The question of how to recalibrate human relationships with nature is a point of focus for many artists working in Australia today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/19/from-paris-is-burning-to-boom-for-real-five-films-to-immerse-you-in-1980s-new-york\">From Paris is Burning to Boom for Real: five films to immerse you in 1980s New York</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an increasingly destabilised world, barriers are being broken down and audiences are becoming more comfortable with experiencing new approaches to art.

      "bodyText": "A sense of urgency is pervading Australian art. Artists are seeking more than ever to spark cultural change. For some, this involves moving away from traditional art-making approaches. Others continue to mine the archives or the natural world for materials that inspire, shock, or lend themselves to 21st century recalibration. Collaborations are becoming more common across disciplines, between artists and scientists, activists, healthcare workers, educators. Audiences and art institutions are being asked to play new roles in their relationship with art. Works \u201cabout identity\u201d are no longer seen as solely the domain of artists belonging to minority groups. Many artists and audiences now expect art institutions to acknowledge the political tensions in which their work is exhibited and experienced. Colonial artistic assumptions are being questioned and in some cases directly countered by institutions, while climate catastrophe is a topic from which no one is spared. The question of how to recalibrate human relationships with nature is a point of focus for many artists working in Australia today. In an increasingly destabilised world, barriers are being broken down and audiences are becoming more comfortable with experiencing new approaches to art. As the National Gallery of Victoria celebrates the work of two artistic trailblazers who tackled the big issues of their time, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, we\u2019re offering a subjective, non-definitive snapshot of Australian artists \u2013 some well-known, others just beginning to make their mark \u2013 who investigate personal, local and global political themes, and open up possibilities for the future. Abdul Abdullah John Olsen once said his status as Australia\u2019s \u201cgreatest living artist\u201d was \u201ca terrible burden\u201d. Abdul Abdullah emblazoned the phrase across a painting of an Australian landscape for his work A Terrible Burden, shortlisted for this year\u2019s Wynne Prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), highlighting the way ownership has been inscribed on Australia cartographically and aesthetically, since invasion. Hailing from Perth and now living in Sydney, Abdullah\u2019s works in a variety of media focus on the experience of marginalised community groups, reflecting his coming of age in the post-September 11 era as a Muslim Australian. Recently, comments by federal MP George Christensen and a Mackay local councillor led to the temporary removal of Abdullah\u2019s work For We Are Young and Free, which depicts members of the armed services, from the touring exhibition Violent Salt.

He is represented by Yavuz Gallery, and will present a solo exhibition with Yavuz at The Armory Show in New York (5 \u2013 8 March). Alana Hunt An artist and writer based in Kununurra in the far north-west of Australia, Alana Hunt makes works that consider the subtle and overt violence arising from contested territories. Hunt\u2019s participatory memorial to Kashmiri civilians, Cups of Nun Chai (2010\u2013ongoing), originally appeared as a newspaper serial and in 2020 will be published as a book by Yaarbal Books (New Delhi-based publishers founded by documentary filmmaker and writer Sanjay Kak). Hunt\u2019s latest project, The Border Line, takes as its starting point her home in Miriwoong country on the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. While the cultures of this region have been exported successfully to the world, The Border Line sparks creative conversations within the region through events including film screenings, discussions and residencies. Where to find her work: Hunt\u2019s feature essay Violent Dreams of Development: A food bowl in the north\u2011west of Australia? appears in the current issue of Artlink.

In her recent survey exhibition, After Nature, at Sydney\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art, one of the major installation pieces, Deep Breathing: Resuscitation for the Reef (2015\u201316/2019), included footage of coral and marine life filmed during a residency at Lizard Island, a site where the reef is monitored for coral bleaching. Where to find her work: In 2020 Laurence will present a solo exhibition in the Yu-Hsui Museum of Art in Taiwan, titled The Entangled Garden of Plant Memory. She will also participate in the group show Courants Verts in Paris curated by Paul Ardenne in L\u2019espace Fondation EDF in March 2020, and in the National Gallery of Australia exhibition titled Know My Name in May 2020. Laurence is represented by Dominik Mersch Gallery, Sydney, and Arc One Gallery, Melbourne. Sam Petersen The personal is political, and for Melbourne-based artist Sam Petersen, this notion is central to her practice. Petersen\u2019s sexuality and disability inform her work which focuses on access \u2013 physical, professional, social. Petersen has described plasticine as a \u201cgreat subverter of space, and therefore potentially of people\u2019s minds\u201d, and uses it in installation works, exploring its malleable and opaque properties. The spoken and written word are a major part of Petersen\u2019s work. In the performance I\u2019m Not a Good Girl, held in 2018 at Westspace, Melbourne, Petersen said: \u201cI have hardly felt discriminated against as a woman, for my disability has always overshadowed it. This is annoying as I feel like a good angry feminist, but never get the chance. Instead I have grown up in this world where few people know how to be with me. And I have come to see that is feminism but hardly anyone knows about it.\u201d Where to find her work: In February, Petersen will travel to Sydney to present her first commercial gallery exhibition, My Pee Is Political, at Darren Knight Gallery (1 February \u2013 29 February), having received an Australia Council grant to make the trip with curator Mad\u00e9 Spencer-Castle and the two support workers she requires for independent travel. The title of the exhibition refers to how the function of wee relates to Petersen\u2019s disability. Brook Andrew This year\u2019s 22nd Biennale of Sydney will be the first curated by an artist. Brook Andrew\u2019s project, Nirin, is a First Nations-led Biennale that will give voice to First Nations artists from around the world and challenge the dominant narratives of colonialism. Alongside more traditional Biennale offerings, Andrew has invited creative practitioners from other fields such as chef Kylie Kwong and cartoonist First Dog on the Moon to contribute. Nirin is a word meaning \u201cedge\u201d from Andrew\u2019s mother\u2019s language group, the Wiradjuri people of central western NSW. Andrew\u2019s own practice is rooted in research modes across traditional and new media and draws on the artist\u2019s extensive archival collection of photographs and other documents. Where to find his work: The 22nd Biennale of Sydney (2020): Nirin, curated by Brook Andrew, will be open from 14 March \u2013 8 June 2020. Andrew is represented by Tolarno Galleries, Melbourne, Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney, and Galerie Nathalie Obadia, Paris and Brussels. Make or Break Sydney-based artist duo Make or Break began with a relatively simple premise. During an exhibition, Connie Anthes and Rebecca Gallo used the gallery space as a studio, starting with nothing but a basic toolkit and making works only from materials donated by visitors. Taking turns to make or break their own and each other\u2019s works, the relay challenged the idea of the artist working in inspired solitude and explored a sustainable method of exhibition-making. Since then, their projects have included Women of Kyneton, where the women of this Victorian town were invited to submit proposals for public monuments, and Institutional Waste #1, a project proposing a new approach to trickle-down economics and sustainability in which the artists take discarded materials from the nearby Art Gallery of New South Wales and use them to create works in other parts of the arts \u201cecosystem\u201d. Where to find their work: Institutional Waste #1 was recently on show at Artspace as part of the NSW Visual Arts Emerging Fellowship exhibition. Make or Break will also present work at the Next Wave festival, Melbourne, from 15 May \u2013 30 May 2020. Joan Ross For Joan Ross, the legacy of colonialism is writ large on the Australian landscape. Her now-signature aesthetic combines traditional landscape paintings such as those of colonial artist John Glover with the very contemporary shade of safety-vest fluoro yellow. In her video works, sprayed graffiti tags pepper the landscape and these 19th century protagonists shuffle around awkwardly, attempting ikebana arrangements with native flora until the whole scene collapses around them. Ross\u2019s recent VR work, Did You Ask the River?, immerses the viewer in a chronologically disrupted tableau, using disarming humour to consider the destructive impact of colonialism. Where to find her work: Ross has been commissioned to create a work that will feature on the hoarding of the AGNSW\u2019s Sydney Modern construction project throughout 2020. Ross is represented by Michael Reid Gallery, Sydney, Berlin and Murrurundi, and Bett Gallery, Hobart. Karla Dickens Karla Dickens\u2019 works are rich and rewarding, materially and conceptually. She often uses found and discarded materials, transforming them into objects of talismanic resonance and strength that speak to issues of identity politics, sexuality, Indigeneity and the environment. A Wiradjuri woman based in Lismore, NSW, earlier this year Dickens was the subject of an extensive profile in the New York Times. In 2017, she was included in the major Australian biennial The National with works incorporating text and textiles: autobiographical reflections on the idea of home, and canvas straitjackets decorated with evocative items like plastic combs and cows\u2019 teeth. Where to find her work: In 2020 Dickens\u2019 work will be included in the Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art (29 February \u2013 8 June), the Biennale of Sydney (14 March \u2013 8 June), and her exhibition My Mother\u2019s Keeper, the result of a collaborative project between Dickens and author Bruce Pascoe, will take place at Linden New Art, Melbourne from 22 February \u2013 17 May. Dickens is represented by Andrew Baker Art Dealer, Brisbane. \u2022 This series is supported by the National Gallery of Victoria.

She is now a general practitioner and Senior Lecturer in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health education at the University of Tasmania. When it comes to Closing the Gap, Dr Schramm says there hasn\u2019t been much change, but \u201cas General Practitioners we have that opportunity to make a big difference.\u201d We need more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander doctors At the moment, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people only make up around 0.5% of the medical practitioner workforce. Dr Schramm says that number needs to grow, and for that to happen, there must be change from the ground up. \u201cQuite often when you go into schools and say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019d like to talk to the Aboriginal kids enrolled here about going on to uni and doing medicine,\u2019 they\u2019ll say, \u2018Uh, I don\u2019t know that we have anybody that would be able to do that\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the attitude you\u2019re still greeted with. That\u2019s the big thing that we need to change. We have to support the dreams of our children.\u201d Dr Schramm says increased visibility of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the healthcare workforce has tangible results. \u201cWhile people are coming through, doing their degree, graduating, and going on to careers, not only are they becoming role models for children in our community, but also becoming really strong advocates for Aboriginal health,\u201d she says. \u201cThe number of students going through medical school now has reached about population parity,\u201d Dr Schramm says. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure they\u2019re graduating at the other end.\u201d Dr Tanya Schramm during a question and answer session at Close the Gap Day. Photograph: RACGP. She says support is required to overcome barriers faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Many are mature-aged students with families, don\u2019t have the financial resources of others in their course, and they are usually in a very small minority within their cohort, which can be isolating. And she says registrars also face extra burdens. \u201cAs soon as you start, as an Aboriginal doctor you\u2019re seen as the be-all-and-know-all of everything to do with Aboriginal health. It\u2019s a lot of pressure. \u201cHopefully we all grow and change, but in doing that you\u2019ve got to often put up with a lot. \u201cIt\u2019s all about respect and communication\u201d Cultural safety continues to be an issue for both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander doctors and patients. Research shows that Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services, which provide around three million episodes of care every year, are better at attracting and retaining Aboriginal clients and the ACCHS peak body says cultural safety is the reason why. \u201cAboriginal health services are amazing, really great and they work really, really well,\u201d says Dr Schramm. \u201cWe could do with a lot more.\u201d But there are currently only around 140 such services in existence, making access difficult unless you happen to live near one. That means most Aboriginal people are attending mainstream health services, even if those practices don\u2019t know it. The Close the Gap Campaign aims to achieve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health equality by 2030. \u201cThe [RACGP] has been really good, making sure we\u2019ve got good education out there for General Practitioners who are working in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health,\u201d says Dr Schramm. \u201cA lot of the problem in the past has been poor identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and forgetting that they\u2019re coming through the door as well,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s more about making sure that we\u2019re identifying patients, doing really good health checks and following those up, and then helping that patient jump the hurdles in getting the further care they need.\u201d Dr Schramm says GPs can make that happen by connecting with local communities and organisations, making their practice environment more welcoming and inclusive, utilising all the resources available for their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, like Aboriginal health checks and closing the gap programs, and listening. \u201cWe\u2019re in a great position to start to have some of those discussions with our patients about what they want, listening to what they want. \u201cAnd then if we have the links with community, we have different ways we can help them access care outside of our little general practice room. I think we can make a difference.\u201d The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is Australia\u2019s largest professional general practice organisation - our mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of all people in Australia by supporting GPs, general practice registrars and medical students.",

The question of what the \u201cusual\u201d sex worker or client might be is an interesting and pertinent one, but goes unaddressed. Instead, Theroux introduces us to his three gatewomen to this new world.</p> <p>They are 33-year-old Victoria, whose life moves in quartets \u2013 four years in the sex industry, four bookings per working day, four children for whom she is the sole provider; 23-year-old Ashleigh, a student with Asperger syndrome who streamed live sex shows from her home for several years before selling sex to pay her way through art school; and sixtysomething former dental nurse Caroline, married for 44 years to her devoted husband, Graham \u2013 she turned to escort work after a friend who had done the same joked that she should try it.</p> <p>What follows is probably not, the world being what it is, going to be some of Theroux\u2019s most headline-grabbing work, up there with his visits to the toxic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/14/louis-theroux-surviving-americas-most-hated-family-review-a-deeply-uncomfortable-watch\" title=\"\">Westboro Baptist Church</a> in Kansas or meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/29/when-louis-theroux-met-jimmy-savile-again-gullible-bbc\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a>. But it is a fine exploration of a potentially sensationalist, exploitative topic and an excellent showcase for Theroux\u2019s softer skills \u2013 patience, reasoning, hanging back and letting subjects find their own words.</p> <p>It is a relief, too, after his recent outing, which saw him investigate the phenomenon of profound postpartum depression in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/12/mothers-on-the-edge-review-louis-theroux-more-perturbed-than-ever-before\" title=\"\">Mothers on the Edge</a>. There, his usually impervious air of neutrality began to desert him, but here, thankfully, normal, nonjudgmental service has been resumed.</p> <p>Like an archaeologist brushing away layers, Theroux gradually reveals the depth of the women\u2019s stories through his questions. Beneath Victoria\u2019s description of sex work as something that fits around caring for her children lies a story of a child who left home at 14 and entered an abusive relationship with a man aged 25. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nowhere to go \u2026 and someone shows an interest, you don\u2019t realise it\u2019s just sexual, you think they care about you \u2026 I used to do all these crazy things to keep him happy\u201d. There is no meaning or good connections for her with sex, she says, so she has turned it into a way to support her family.</p> <p>This dissociative state, which surely has been experienced by people for almost as long as the oldest profession has existed, is familiar to Ashleigh, too \u2013 and for not dissimilar reasons. She talks about her absent father\u2019s resistance to her attempts to build a relationship with him (\u201cI\u2019m so desperate for people to acknowledge my existence\u201d) and sexual abuse from the age of six to 12 (\u201cThat was the time I felt wanted \u2026 when it stopped, I basically thought he hated me. So it made everything worse\u201d).</p> <p>But she is over it now. \u201cI say that as I cry!\u201d she acknowledges brightly through her tears. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. Shit happens. You just have to use it as something to make yourself a better person.\u201d</p> <p>In this context, Caroline\u2019s story amounts almost to light relief. A repressive religious upbringing left her alienated from and scared of sex, which she considered dirty and sinful. Now, in her seventh decade, she is beginning to emerge from its shadow. Whether her marriage will survive is unclear, but set against the other stories it looks at least a little more like genuine empowerment.</p> <p>There are those who argue that it is the stigma attached to sex work that does the harm. Selling Sex suggests the harm is done much earlier and causes the kind of emotional cautery required to undertake it. Whether it should be legal or not is almost beside the point. The true question is how we define coercion or exploitation. The aim of the law\u2019s definition is surely to ensure that anyone selling his or her body is doing so willingly, as a matter of absolutely free choice. Whether this can be said of any of the women here, I am not sure.</p>",

But it is a fine exploration of a potentially sensationalist, exploitative topic and an excellent showcase for Theroux\u2019s softer skills \u2013 patience, reasoning, hanging back and letting subjects find their own words. It is a relief, too, after his recent outing, which saw him investigate the phenomenon of profound postpartum depression in Mothers on the Edge. There, his usually impervious air of neutrality began to desert him, but here, thankfully, normal, nonjudgmental service has been resumed. Like an archaeologist brushing away layers, Theroux gradually reveals the depth of the women\u2019s stories through his questions. Beneath Victoria\u2019s description of sex work as something that fits around caring for her children lies a story of a child who left home at 14 and entered an abusive relationship with a man aged 25. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nowhere to go \u2026 and someone shows an interest, you don\u2019t realise it\u2019s just sexual, you think they care about you \u2026 I used to do all these crazy things to keep him happy\u201d. There is no meaning or good connections for her with sex, she says, so she has turned it into a way to support her family. This dissociative state, which surely has been experienced by people for almost as long as the oldest profession has existed, is familiar to Ashleigh, too \u2013 and for not dissimilar reasons. She talks about her absent father\u2019s resistance to her attempts to build a relationship with him (\u201cI\u2019m so desperate for people to acknowledge my existence\u201d) and sexual abuse from the age of six to 12 (\u201cThat was the time I felt wanted \u2026 when it stopped, I basically thought he hated me. So it made everything worse\u201d). But she is over it now. \u201cI say that as I cry!\u201d she acknowledges brightly through her tears. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. Shit happens. You just have to use it as something to make yourself a better person.\u201d In this context, Caroline\u2019s story amounts almost to light relief. A repressive religious upbringing left her alienated from and scared of sex, which she considered dirty and sinful. Now, in her seventh decade, she is beginning to emerge from its shadow. Whether her marriage will survive is unclear, but set against the other stories it looks at least a little more like genuine empowerment. There are those who argue that it is the stigma attached to sex work that does the harm. Selling Sex suggests the harm is done much earlier and causes the kind of emotional cautery required to undertake it. Whether it should be legal or not is almost beside the point. The true question is how we define coercion or exploitation. The aim of the law\u2019s definition is surely to ensure that anyone selling his or her body is doing so willingly, as a matter of absolutely free choice. Whether this can be said of any of the women here, I am not sure.",

      "bodyText": "And here is the report. So I guess that\u2019s us. The game teased and taunted but never quite got going, and ended in the way we knew it would: Sergio Ramos celebrating, though this time the hero/villain was Federico Valverde. Ta-ra. A derby is a derby, and the Real players look pretty happy. It\u2019s another trophy too, and they point, dance and gesticulate. Football is the winner. Can he score? Of course he can! Ramos rolls in the decisive kick, and Real Madrid, who won neither league nor cup, have won the competition for the league and cup winners! I\u2019m choking up here! Great penalty, whacked into the roof, left-hand side. Modric ambles up and canes a riser into the top left. Atleti must score this next one and hope Real miss their next two. Thomas swipes hard, but Courtois guesses right, it\u2019s not in the corner, and he shoves the ball away! Rodrygo absolutely lamps his kick into the top corner, Pressman-style. Saul saunters u[, opens his body, and taps against the foot of the post as Courtois goes the wrong way! Straight run-up and Carvajal despatches confidently, halfway up and to Oblak\u2019s right as he dives left. Carvajal will go first for Real... \u201cRegarding Liverpool\u2019s prospects against Atletico,\u201d emails Hakan Burden, \u201cI can\u2019t see Pep getting too nervous about meeting Real. Given how the Madrid team plays today City has to be huge favourites?\u201d How they played today is one thing - can they play that much better than this? I\u2019m not sure, and I think City may well wipe the floor with them. Definitely got a bit of the ball. So we get the artificial finish this nonsense deserves. At least we got a little rumble at the end, eg. Penalties it is! 120 min There\u2019ll be one added minute. 118 min Has someone spike the Isostar? Another save from Courtois following the corner, again from Correa! 117 min Courtois fumbles Correa\u2019s low free-kick away, then saves from Vinicius, who diverts the ball towards his own goal 115 min Real win a free-kick that Ramos can\u2019t quick head back into danger and Atletico break! A poor touch from Arias allows Saul to send Morata screeching through the middle, and just before he reaches the box, Carvajal upends him, playground-style! Glorious! There might\u2019ve been a covering man - we\u2019re not allowed to see - but either way, the ref shows red! There follows some ruckus, in which at least two yellow cards are shown - Savic got one and so did Carvajal - and here we go, at last! 114 min Carvajal makes hay down the right and smacks a cross towards the near post that Felipe heads firmly clear. 111 min Carvajal allows Saul to jump, then upends him in the air. He\u2019s booked. 110 min But here they come now, Modric punching a shot from the edge of the box which Oblak fists away! And Mariano collects the rebound inside the box, dances across a challenge, then drives low ... straight at Oblak, who does brilliantly to get hands down by his boots! 109 min It\u2019s very hard to see how Madrid evolve this side any time soon. They don\u2019t necessarily have the money to buy stars anymore, they need so many new players, and can\u2019t really bin the oder ones who\u2019ve done so much for them. 109 min Madrid have missed Benzema so much tonight. 107 min Varane heads the following corner clear. 106 min Immediately, Atleti win a corner which Thomas takes, and Courtois comes flying out only to miss his punch; Morata tries an overhead, that someone blocks wide. 106 min Finally. That was not so good. 105+1 min \u201cFair points,\u201d reverts Martin Burdett. \u201cAtletico of course have plenty of CL experience and are unquestionably a resilient side in the image of their manager but seriously Trippier will be having nightmares about facing Man\u00e9, and none of Atletico\u2019s forwards have anything to worry Van Dijk and co. And let\u2019s be honest, Liverpool always raise their game for the big matches. We\u2019ll talk again after the second leg.\u201d Van Dijk is an excellent defender; he\u2019s not God. But yes, if I was Simeone I\u2019d be telling Felix to have a go at whoever\u2019s next to him. As I said, I think Liverpool will go through, but I\u2019d not be surprised if they didn\u2019t. One problem Atletico might have is a lack of width, which might well stop them pinning Liverpool\u2019s full-backs back. 104 min Real work the ball wide to Mendy, whose cross is headed clear by Felipe. 103 min Vinicius replaces Kroos. I\u2019m pretty sure both managers have stopped keeping score. 102 min Lovely from Modric who, facing the touchline, feints then nicks a yard to cross, Mariano heading over. 101 min Yet another change for Atleti, Arias on for Joao Felix. If the players were my kids I\u2019d be calling them in for dinner. 100 min Carvajal tries to go around Llorente, but his cross is easily headed clear by Spider from Corrie Savic. 98 min An extremely displeased Gimenez is removed, stomping off and chucking boots when he sits on the bench. Savic replaces him. 97 min The ball breaks to Modric in the box and he jinks inside to open up a shooting lane, but Thomas slides in to shut it right down. 96 min The Real players are ambling about like they can\u2019t grasp what they\u2019re being told to do here. Extra-time in a Charity Shield friendly, played in the middle of the following season, in a different country, with neither finalist a trophy-holder; what a piece of nonsense. 95 min Back to that Liverpool point, Atletico won\u2019t be scared of them either, or daunted by the occasion. 94 min Meanwhile, Vitolo lashes a shot wide. 92 min \u201cI seem to recall you writing at the start of the match preview that Atletico had a good chance of knocking out the CL holders,\u201d says Martin Burdett. \u201cWith the exception of an exceptional goalkeeper and a good central defender, there is nothing to worry LFC. I don\u2019t know how you could possibly come to such a conclusion especially over two legs with the second leg at Anfield?\u201d I\u2019d always prefer the first leg at home as it goes, especially if I was the inferior team. But I also think Atletico have more going for them than that \u2013 their midfield is tough, quick and clever, Joao Felix on a good day will cause problems and Liverpool\u2019s centre-backs rarely have to mark a man each. I\u2019d expect Liverpool to go through, but I\u2019d not be surprised if they didn\u2019t - they\u2019ve won a lot of tight games, and generally though not always, that doesn\u2019t sustain through a season. 91 min Off we go yet again. Extra-time it is, because it\u2019s no more than this crucial competition deserves. 90+4 min Clever! With everyone expecting a cross, Thomas tries a low shot around the near side of the wall, seeking the near post, but Courtois scrambles it away. 90+3 min Vitolo stretches the ball away from Modric, who loughs through him and is booked; another free-kick, 30 yards out, right of centre. Thomas with it... 90+3 min Now Atleti have a free-kick, which Thomas pumps into the box, but Varane heads clear. 90+1 min Real are still trying to win this, Carvajal digging out a fine cross that Mariano can\u2019t reach with his head ... but the ball reaches Rodrygo, who spins into a low, hard shot ... that\u2019s straight at Oblak! Anywhere else and that was the game! 90 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. 89 min A further change for Atleti, Llorente replacing Lodi. 88 min Correa barges through Kroos, who now has the chance to stick in a ball into the mixer, 30 yards out. He picks out Casemiro at the back post, and the knock-back isn\u2019t bad, but Oblak punches clear. 87 min Mariano, who has a turn of pace, seizes onto an error from Trippier, but a heavy touch allows Saul to slide in and unload him. 86 min If I was Liverpool or Man City watching this, I\u2019d be extremely unscared. 85 min Mariano screeches down the left, but has no support and does well to win a throw. Nothing comes of it. 83 min Mendy snaps a ball into Mariano, whose return is just too strong. 83 min Strange change for Real, Mariano replacing Jovic. 82 min Morata comes deep, turns, and sticks Correa away down the left. But he can\u2019t find a killer pass, and now Real counter ... to no avail. 80 min Lovely from Trippier, coaxing a pass around three defenders and into the path of Morata, who watches it onto his foot before guiding a low shot ... that Courtois saves at his near post. Of course he does, it was Morata. That wasn\u2019t actually a bad effort - it was a really good save - but the space was at the far post. 78 min It\u2019s Real committing men forward trying to win this, but they don\u2019t quite have the speed to work Atleti out of position and eventually Carvajal lofts a cross into Oblak\u2019s hands. 77 min Jovic finds Rodrygo, who drives at the Atletico defence before running into 43 men and losing the ball. 74 min Rodrygo leads a counter, a lovely feint sending Thomas for a bag of kelewele; he retorts with a trip, earning himself a yellow card. 72 min Thomas and Saul look like they\u2019re taking control of midfield now - Real\u2019s trio are old, after all. And a clever pass into midfield by the former allows an attack to build down the right, Trippier combining nicely with Vitolo, whose cross is kicked clear. 71 min I\u2019d expect to see Vinicius soon. 70 min Real have been much the better side since half-time, but Atleti are just starting to show signs of life. 69 min Correa drives at the heart of the Real defence before sliding in Vitolo, to his left, who slices a lash wide. 67 min Eeek! Jovic pulls wide and takes a ball from Rodrygo, drilling a low cross that clips Gimenez and picks out Carvajal! But, full-back that he is, he brings up his knees and heads into them and wide, the goal gaping. 66 min I\u2019m disappointed in Thomas tonight. He\u2019s a player who\u2019s looked ready to step up a level, but he\u2019s done hardly anything here. 64 min Modric gets away down the right but without the pace to go on the outside needs to come back inside. His mates can\u2019t find the angle for a killer pass, and eventually Felix runs into Valverde, earning the free-kick. 63 min After a moment standing at the side, Ramos is ready to return. 61 min Ramos is down after jumping with Morata and landing very slightly awkwardly. 60 min Real make their first change, Rodrygo replacing Isco. That looks a good call, because Isco has been peripheral and some pace on the outside will help Jovic. 59 min Joao Felix makes ground down the right but Carvajal shadows him all the way, forcing him to turn, retreat and lay back for Thomas, who makes nothing of it. 57 min A long ball over the top sends Mendy away, and he teases Trippier before sliding over to Modric, who has a look, shifts it, then swipes a shot wide. Real need to score during this spell. 56 min And there it is: off goes Herrera and on comes Vitolo. 55 min My coverage dropped out, but it\u2019s still 0-0. Real are all over it now, and Simeone needs to change something. 51 min This is more like it! Modric glides through midfield and finds Jovic, who moves away from Trippier, slows, feints inside and moves outside, then drills a shot just wide of the far post. He\u2019s already done more this half than in the whole of the last one. 48 min Well! Casemiro chugs through midfield and releases Jovic, who doesn\u2019t look fast but somehow manages not to be caught by any of the three men close to him - Cantona was like that, not fast but always fast enough. Then, just as he looks ready to shoot, making down the left side of the box, Gimenez slides in to concede a corner - which comes to nothing. 47 min Obviously Xavi is a genius, but this would have been quite a move. Even Guardiola had more experience, and also had the greatest raw materials of all-time at his disposal. 46 min Meanwhile... 46 min Off we go again.I should note that in the event of a draw, we shall enjoy extra-time and penalties. Back come the boyz. Diego Simeone will be relatively pleased with how that went. Joao Felix missed the game\u2019s only real chance, and his team look far more dangerous in the final third. Zinedine Zidane needs to change something - perhaps Vinicius or Rodrygo need a run. 43 min Real win a corner down the right and Kroos picks out Casemiro \u201cin and around\u201d the near post. He leaps well, and heads just over the top. 43 min Apparently, Luis Suarez will be out for the rest of the season with his knee situation. 42 min Nice from Correa, lifting the ball over one challenge and bustling past another ... before running out of position, inside the box. 41 min This game needs a goal. It\u2019s not bad so far, but both teams can do more, if incited to. 39 min nice from Mendy, pulling wide, putting the ball on Trippier\u2019s inside and barging through on his outside, before shooting straight at Oblak. 38 min The crowd perform a Mexican wave. No further questions, yer honour. 36 min More possession for Madrid, and for a second it looks as though Kroos has picked a good ball into the box for Jovic, but he can\u2019t turn adroitly enough to get a shot away. 34 min Lovely fro Valverde, shimmying away from Lodi before finding Carvajal on touchline. He can\u2019t do anything with the return, but he\u2019s Real\u2019s most lively attacker thus far. 33 min If they\u2019re already going global with this game, they should probably fly Mike Dean in to ref it. 31 min But here comes Mendy on the left, only for Trippier to get in his road. 31 min Real are focusing their attacks down their right. Have they never seen Trippier play? 29 min A better five minutes for Real, who have enjoyed some time in the Atleti half without creating anything. 27 min Now we\u2019re talking. Jovic wriggles away from Felipe, who scythes him down and is booked. 25 min Madrid stroke it around and find Valverde on the right, but he can\u2019t pick out a man with his cross. Madrid keep it going though, before a poor cross is clipped away by Trippier. 25 min We need a bit of Gabi to up the needle. 24 min It\u2019s been a fair while since Real mustered an attack worthy of note. 22 min Now it\u2019s Correa, taking the long way around the outside of Real\u2019s back four, before Ramos nips in to unload him. 21 min And now it\u2019s Saul\u2019s go, shifting it to go outside Carvajal before sliding into a shot which deflects wide. The resultant corner comes to nowt. 20 min Atleti are the better team here, and Thomas finds Morata who drives at the box, scudding a low one just wide from 20 yards. 19 min Saul appears on the left, which isn\u2019t where I\u2019d like to see him. The first few times i saw him, I thought I was watching the new Bryan Robson, but it\u2019s not quite happened for him in the way I hoped it might. Those who watch Atleti more than me: what does he need to fulfil his potential? 17 min \u201cIt was an excellent Simeone photo-series you treated us to in the preamble,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cbut the most magnificent part was Batigol looking on, giving the sultry side-eye. What a man. What a footballer. What a shot! Foot like a traction engine, and so on.\u201d His eyes were a revelation, but I also enjoyed the sneaky bit of Ortega. Both played in this game, which I was lucky enough to be at. 15 min And here come Atleti again, Morata again flowing towards the line, before collapsing with the weight of Courtois\u2019 breathing. That\u2019s a dive, is that, but he escapes a booking much to Casemiro and Ramos\u2019 chagrin. 14 min Chance Atleti! The free-kick goes short into the channel and Ramos botches his clearance straight to Felix! He takes a touch, then drags a shot wide with the goal gaping! 13 min Trippier catches one on his chest, then catches one on his leg, courtesy of little Isco. No harm done. 12 min On the Atleti bench, Diego Costa appears to be wearing a Varsity jacket of some sort. What is the world coming to? 11 min This is, so far, a better game than Bournemouth-Watford. There. I said it. 9 min And when the corner is half-cleared, Modric swerves a shot into Oblak\u2019s midriff. 9 min Valverde controls a crossfield ball nicely and lifts over Lodi\u2019s head, then sees his cross deflected behind. 7 min Lodi pushes forward and finds Joao Felix, who burrows into trouble and shoots into the nearest shins. 5 min This is good from Real, pushing Atletico back, and Modric finds Casemiro, who punches a side-footed curler which Oblak holds easily enough. 4 min Carvajal clips a ball towards the far side of the box, where Isco waits, but Trippier reads it well \u2013 who ever supposed to write those words \u2013and heads clear. 4 min I should note that I am currently watching on a tiny screen without commentary. 3 min Gimenez drills wide to Trippier, who\u2019s crowded out, but Morata picks up the ball and hits the line, digging out a decent cross that Ramos heads away. 1 min Real set us away! I understand that the players are out. Obviously the unnamed betting site has problems delivering the stream. Ho hum. Looking at this Atleti team, I\u2019d guess that they\u2019ll look to hurt Madrid through the middle. They\u2019re so strong in that area and know that Ramos isn\u2019t what he was, plus they lack a bit of flair and pace out wide. Alvaro Morata, then. He has so much ability \u2013 speed, strength, imagination \u2013 but can he turn it into anything serious? I sometimes wonder if Simeone bought him to ensure he maintains requisite fury at all time, or if he just fancied the biggest challenge going. I don\u2019t yet think we can answer with any degree of certainty. For balance, frisson/strides interface. Game recognise game. I can go all night. \u201cThere they are, the lads.\u201d Pretty sure I could take him if I had to. Elsewhere, the aforementioned City are 4-0 up at Villa Park, with just 45 minutes played. Those Villa players must be buzzing for the second half. In little more than a month\u2019s time, these sides will take on England\u2019s best. Atleti meet Liverpool in the first round of fixtures, and Real meet City in the second. If Laporte is back, I\u2019d back City to progress with relative ease, but think Atleti have a good chance of taking out the holders. It is extremely apt that this game can only be viewed in the UK on a betting website. As for Atleti \u2013 nickname terms, us \u2013 they\u2019re getting there. They too aren\u2019t what they were, but in some ways are closer to getting back there. Jose Gimenez is a giant, Joao Felix will be a star, and Saul, Thomas and Herrera is a serious piece of midfield. I fancy them. These teams are not bad. Real\u2019s rebuild hasn\u2019t quite worked itself out yet, but that midfield, though past its best, is still that midfield. In attack, I\u2019m not quite sure how that front three will work out \u2013 there\u2019s a lack of oomph \u2013 but you can never underestimate Atletico\u2019s propensity to shoot themselves in the solar plexus. Make your mind up, son. Why. Why? Why! WHY?! Yet here we are. Without wanting to get too meta, for this is surely not a preamble about writing a preamble, it\u2019s impossible to pick out the key element of this match in a hilarious, stylish and intensely poignant manner without alighting upon the sheer awfulness of what we\u2019re about to enjoy. How can we focus on the football, when even the football isn\u2019t focused on the football? This might well be a good game \u2013 two huge teams running into decent form \u2013 but we cannot and must not be consumed by that, because that is what they want us to be. Let\u2019s be better than them. Kick-off: 6pm GMT",

      "bodyText": "Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge funder, has claimed picking a nominee to face Donald Trump in November is \u201cmore about judgment than experience\u201d. Steyer this week became the sixth qualifier for the seventh Democratic presidential debate, in Des Moines on Tuesday, after he met polling and donor-based marks set by the Democratic National Committee. He is way down the field in Iowa, the first state to vote, but polls in South Carolina and Nevada, where he has spent heavily on ads that depict him as an \u201coutsider\u201d ready to take on Trump, put him over the top. Steyer will line up against former senator and vice-president Joe Biden; senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar; and Pete Buttigieg, formerly mayor of South Bend, Indiana. None of the other candidates, among them New Jersey senator Cory Booker, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and another billionaire, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, will be present. Steyer\u2019s success has prompted pointed remarks from analysts and other candidates. Warren said recently she did not \u201cbelieve that elections ought to be for sale\u201d. Others have pointed to an all-white debate lineup in the absence of Booker, the only African American left in the race, and what that says for a party committed to recognising diversity. Asked what qualified him to seek the White House, Steyer told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI did business for over 30 years working and traveling around the world, meeting with governments, talking to the heads of huge corporations, and understanding actually what drives America\u2019s business around the world and our relationships with other countries, and what makes that trade and relationship succeed.\u201d He also said the person who \u201cdid the best job in figuring out American foreign policy and military policy\u201d over the last two decades was \u201ca state senator from Illinois with absolutely no military or international experience named Barack Obama, who said, against the advice of everybody who was an insider in Washington DC, that the Iraq war was a mistake\u201d. Amid fierce controversy over Trump\u2019s aggression towards Iran, Steyer added: \u201cWhen you tell me that what we really need is more conventional DC thinking about our international policy, our foreign policy and our military policy, I would actually suggest to you that maybe this is more about judgment than experience.\u201d Steyer has a financial advantage over most other candidates. Many have criticised him, and Bloomberg, for seeking to \u201cbuy\u201d the nomination, in order to face another billionaire at the polls. Stayer made his fortune running Farallon Capital, out of San Francisco, but has spent the last 10 years or so giving money philanthropically and pursuing policy priorities including accessible banking and climate activism. \u201cI think that the thing that has put me on this stage,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cis message. I have a very simple message, which is, the government is broken. It\u2019s been bought by corporations. I spent 10 years as an outsider putting together coalitions of American citizens to fight and beat those corporations. \u201cI\u2019m the only person in this race who will say that his or her No 1 priority is climate. And I will attack it from the \u2026 very first day from the standpoint of environmental justice, and I can take on Mr Trump on the economy in a way that nobody else can, because I built a business from scratch, and I understand job creation and prosperity and growth, as well as economic justice.\u201d The Nevada caucuses are on 22 February and South Carolina holds its primary seven days later. Steyer\u2019s concentration on the two states has had national benefits: on Saturday a Washington Poll post poll showed him second, if distantly, to Biden among black voters, a key bloc in South Carolina. Other candidates, with less to spend, have been busy in Iowa and New Hampshire, which vote on 3 and 11 February respectively. Challenged over figures that show 91% of political advertising so far in South Carolina and 97% in Nevada has been from his campaign, Steyer insisted he had \u201c82 organisers on the ground in South Carolina\u201d and was \u201cactually a grassroots person\u201d. \u201cI have been there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone who didn\u2019t endorse me who\u2019s a politician in South Carolina who said, \u2018Steyer came down here. He rolled up his sleeves. He went out. He listened to people. He sat across the table. He worked.\u2019 \u201cI have been a grassroots organiser, as you know, for 10 years. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing in these early primary states. I\u2019m going. I\u2019m listening to people. I spend all my time in the kinds of meetings that I love, which is taking questions and asking questions and listening and learning.\u201d",

The Newspoll, published on Monday, confirms that a horror summer in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/21/scott-morrison-hawaii-horror-show-pr-disaster-unfolded\">Morrison chose to holiday in Hawaii</a> during the extended bushfire crisis that has claimed 28 lives and more than 2,000 homes, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/zoey-turned-his-back-on-me-woman-forced-shake-scott-morrisons-hand-lost-everything-in-fires\">fumbled meetings with victims</a>, has significantly impacted his popularity. Satisfaction in Morrison fell eight points and dissatisfaction increased 11 points, both movements outside the poll\u2019s margin of error of 2.5%. Just 4% of voters were \u201cuncommitted\u201d when asked how Morrison is performing. Meanwhile, the<strong> </strong>government will pledge $50m to help rescue and protect wildlife affected by the bushfire crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/13/government-to-commit-50m-for-wildlife-affected-by-bushfires-as-green-groups-call-for-action\">with a promise of more to come</a>, as environment groups warn that some species may have already been driven to extinction.

Playing from the left of a midfield two, he was handy in the early sterile exchanges as both teams settled into the match.

      "bodyText": "Every single footballer in the world aims to be the big-game player who constantly shows up against the champions, but Danny Drinkwater may have taken this all a little too literally. His only start in his wasted half season at Burnley came at the beginning of last month when they were obliterated 4-1 at home to City. His last appearance for Chelsea? Their 2-0 loss to Manchester City in last season\u2019s Community Shield. His last league start for Chelsea? A 1-0 defeat at the Etihad in March 2018. That fact alone should have been a red flag for Dean Smith. Instead, five days after arriving on loan at Aston Villa, there he was in the starting lineup against the defending champions and for a few short minutes, things were actually going well. Playing from the left of a midfield two, he was handy in the early sterile exchanges as both teams settled into the match. One of his first touches was an interception in the middle of the field, which elicited applause from the home crowd, and he relieved pressure for his new team with a couple of nice, simple passes. He pointed, he yelled, he seemed comfortable in possession. And then, 18 minutes into Drinkwater\u2019s Aston Villa debut, his world was on fire.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Coalition suffered a two-point drop in primary vote to 40% while Labor recovered by three points to 36%. In two-party-preferred terms Labor lead the Coalition 51% to 49%.</p> \n<p>The pollster Kevin Bonham said Morrison\u2019s plunge from 14 points ahead as preferred prime minister to four behind is \u201cthe equal second highest such loss in Newspoll history\u201d, after Paul Keating\u2019s 23% drop against John Hewson after the horror 1993 budget.</p> \n<p>He also said it was \u201chighly

The Newspoll, published on Monday, confirms that a horror summer in which Morrison chose to holiday in Hawaii during the extended bushfire crisis that has claimed 28 lives and more than 2,000 homes, and fumbled meetings with victims, has significantly impacted his popularity. On Monday Labor stepped up its attack on Morrison, with deputy leader Richard Marles suggesting the prime minister\u2019s performance through the crisis had shown he was \u201cloose with the truth\u201d and \u201cdisinterested in the national interest\u201d. The poll of 1,505 voters, conducted between Wednesday and Saturday, found more voters (59%) are dissatisfied with Morrison\u2019s performance than satisfied (37%). Satisfaction in Morrison fell eight points and dissatisfaction increased by 11 points, both movements outside the poll\u2019s margin of error of 2.5%. Just 4% of voters were \u201cuncommitted\u201d when asked how Morrison is performing. Albanese is in positive territory after a six-point increase in satisfaction from 40% to 46% and dissatisfaction falling from 41% to 37%. He leads Morrison as preferred prime minister, 43% to 39%, the first time he has done so since taking the Labor leadership after Bill Shorten\u2019s shock loss at the May 2019 election. Morrison dropped nine points as preferred prime minister while Albanese increased by nine points, reversing Morrison\u2019s lead of 14 points in the last poll, taken in the first week of December, to trail by four points. The Coalition suffered a two-point drop in primary vote to 40% while Labor recovered by three points to 36%. In two-party-preferred terms Labor lead the Coalition 51% to 49%. The pollster Kevin Bonham said Morrison\u2019s plunge from 14 points ahead as preferred prime minister to four behind is \u201cthe equal second highest such loss in Newspoll history\u201d, after Paul Keating\u2019s 23% drop against John Hewson after the horror 1993 budget. He also said it was \u201chighly unusual\u201d for the current prime minister to trail the opposition leader on preferred prime minister when the two-party-preferred margin was narrow. Since returning to Australia days before Christmas Morrison has apologised for his holiday and ramped up the federal government\u2019s response to the bushfire crisis but denied suggestions it has been slow to respond or that Australia\u2019s response to global heating is plainly inadequate. In the first week of January the federal government issued a compulsory callout of 3,000 defence force reserves and Morrison pledged $2bn for bushfire recovery. But Morrison\u2019s horror summer \u2013 in which he was heckled by survivors in Cobargo, New South Wales \u2013 continued with the revelation that the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner had not been informed of the compulsory callout and an embarrassing gaffe in which Morrison claimed nobody had died on Kangaroo Island where, in fact, two people were killed. On Sunday Morrison acknowledged that he \u201ccould have handled on the ground much better\u201d in the \u201cstrained\u201d emotional environment of firegrounds. He suggested he would seek authority from the states and pass new legislation for the chief of the defence force to take a more proactive role in deploying defence personnel during natural disasters, which are normally managed by the states, describing the public expectation of a bigger federal response as the \u201cnew normal\u201d. Morrison indicated that the government could bolster its carbon emission reduction efforts and flagged a royal commission into Australia\u2019s horror bushfire season. Marles took issue with Morrison\u2019s suggestion that \u201cmoments of national crisis are a state issue and previously there hasn\u2019t been an expectation of commonwealth involvement\u201d. He told reporters in Melbourne it was \u201cpatently wrong\u201d, citing the Rudd Labor government\u2019s involvement in the Black Saturday bushfires. Marles accused Morrison of \u201crunning away from the country without telling anyone\u201d, \u201cliterally forcing people to shake his hand\u201d rather than showing empathy, and being \u201cincredibly slow\u201d to involve the Australian Defence Force. Marles also blasted Morrison for filming an ad to promote the government\u2019s disaster recovery efforts, suggesting it showed \u201cpanic\u201d \u2013 not on behalf of the nation, but for his own image. The deputy Labor leader said Australians had seen \u201can unfiltered, an uncensored and a very disappointing version of Scott Morrison\u201d through the crisis. Doubts have been raised about the Australian government\u2019s ability to meet its Paris targets of 26% to 28% emissions reduction by 2030, with the use of carryover credits criticised as an \u201caccounting trick\u201d that may add up to as much as 80% of Australia\u2019s emission reduction achievement. The former head of Morrison\u2019s department, Martin Parkinson, has blamed \u201ccivil war\u201d within the Coalition for the government not developing a more ambitious climate policy, warning that global efforts were insufficient to halt warming at 2C.",

Last-minute phone calls, messages and meetings will be held as contenders to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader, and Tom Watson as deputy, rally MPs and MEPs to try to reach the threshold of 22 nominations to get through to the next round. Those who hit the threshold last week, including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey, will still be trying to boost their support base as their leadership bids continue. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who has struggled to gain support after being the first person to declare she was running for leader, told the BBC she was confident she would reach the threshold by the time nominations close on Monday at 2.30pm. Clive Lewis, the shadow treasury minister, was on just four nominations \u2013 including the nomination he gave himself \u2013 with just 24 hours before the cut-off. Angela Rayner\u2019s runaway success in support from colleagues for the deputy position has put her on 72 nominations. Labour\u2019s sole MP in Scotland, Ian Murray, is also through to the next round by getting the backing of 30 MPs and MEPs. MPs will be keen to see whether the most leftwing candidate Richard Burgon can get through to the next stage for deputy leader. He was on 18 nominations and said if he reached 22 he would ask people to back another candidate so that members have the widest possible choice on the eventual ballot paper. Rosena Allin-Khan, who had the support of 17 people, and Dawn Butler, who had 15, will be among those hoping that a last-minute surge in declarations will go in their favour. Nandy, the MP for Wigan whose pitch for leader is strongly about reconnecting the party with its heartland voters, will make her first speech in the campaign on Monday in Dagenham, east London. The area voted 62% leave in the EU referendum and saw a swing to the Conservatives in the 2019 general election, although Labour retained the seat. She will be joined by the local MP Jon Cruddas. In her pitch for the leadership Long-Bailey has said she wants to abolish the House of Lords and would not stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum. The shadow business secretary, who is a close ally of Corbyn, said having \u201ccompletely unelected people\u201d within the structure of government was wrong and representative of the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d. She remains behind Starmer in early polling of members over Corbyn\u2019s replacement. She told the Sky News programme Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI do want to abolish the House of Lords and we\u2019ll be rolling out as my campaign progresses how we intend to really shake up that constitutional package. \u201cMPs like myself, we\u2019re fed up of the Westminster bubble, and fed up of our communities feeling like decisions about their lives are made in Westminster consistently. We\u2019ve got to shift power and wealth into our communities.\u201d On how the work of MPs would be scrutinised with no upper chamber, she said: \u201cThere would need to be checks and balances in place but to have a set of completely unelected people doing that I don\u2019t think is right. We need to have people who are able, experts and democratically accountable to the community that they represent, not people appointed by parties.\u201d Long-Bailey, who has positioned herself as the most leftwing of the leadership candidates, also said she could support a second referendum on Scottish independence if she was ever elected prime minister, despite wanting to retain the union. She said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to inhibit the democracy of people because that\u2019s one of the most fundamental pillars that we\u2019re proud of in this country, but I don\u2019t support in any way the breaking up of Scotland from the UK. \u201cI\u2019m fully committed to the union and I don\u2019t think that should be shaken in any way, but ultimately the people of Scotland need to make the case and they\u2019ve got their own parliament to determine whether they want to push that and that will be for me as a prime minister to review and to look at.\u201d References to her being the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn candidate\u201d in the race were \u201cannoying\u201d she said, but she agreed she was a socialist. \u201cIt annoys me when people say that and unfortunately, as a woman, it annoys me even more. I\u2019m a person in my own right,\u201d she said. On running an effective joint ticket with Angela Rayner, who is standing to be deputy leader of the party, she said: \u201cWe always joked, to be honest, that the pair of us, that if it ever goes wrong, \u2018you know it\u2019s going to be me and you that\u2019s going to have to sort it out\u2019\u2026 and then when we had the defeat and it was devastating. \u201cWe both sat down and was like, you know we were joking, you know we actually are going to think about this.\u201d Thornberry, who was once one of the most prominent people in Corbyn\u2019s team and deputised for him at prime minister\u2019s questions, has so far struggled to get support for her bid. She told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: \u201cFrom the conversations I\u2019ve had this weekend I\u2019m fairly confident that so long as I don\u2019t get any slippage, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll get across the line and then we move on to the next stage. \u201cI\u2019ve been a slow starter but I did start from a standing start after the general election.\u201d The former barrister, who backed remaining in the EU and a second referendum, said she could withstand the ups and downs of the leadership contest as she comes from a long line of \u201ctough old birds\u201d.",

Customers on the Community Power tariff will be able to \u201csee exactly where it is being generated at small scale sites across the UK, and they know it is benefiting local communities\u201d, he said. Co-op, which has about 300,000 customers, has set itself apart from a rising number of energy supply deals which are marked as 100% renewable, but are not as green as they seem. Consumer group Which? has found that many suppliers offer renewable energy tariffs but do not generate renewable electricity themselves or have contracts to buy any renewable electricity directly from generators. Instead, the \u201cpale green\u201d suppliers exploit a loophole in the energy market by snapping up cheap renewable energy certificates, without necessarily buying energy from renewables projects. The certificates are issued by the regulator to renewable energy developers for each megawatt generated, but these can be sold separately from the electricity for a fraction of the price. Which? warned that these suppliers appear to be greenwashing their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers. A survey conducted last year found that one in 10 people believe that a renewables tariff means that the supplier generates at least some of its electricity from its own renewable energy projects. Ponsonby said the wind and solar schemes that generate electricity for the Community Power tariff \u201cplough the profits they make back into their neighbourhoods or into helping other similar projects get off the ground\u201d. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said being able to buy locally-sourced clean, green energy is \u201ca massive jump in the right direction\u201d which will help grow the UK\u2019s green electricity capacity. \u201cInvesting in more local energy infrastructure and getting Britain\u2019s homes run by the sun when it\u2019s shining and the wind when it\u2019s blowing can end our reliance on dirty fossil fuels sooner than we hoped,\u201d he said. \u201cLocal people investing in local people means that we can all muck in and put the work in to decarbonise where governments and large companies are slow to.\u201d",

Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett was one of the 22 people who died in the 2017 attack, has lobbied for stronger anti-terror security measures. Brandon Lewis, the security minister, said Boris Johnson was \u201c100%\u201d behind the proposals for bag searches and metal detectors at big venues such as concert and sport arenas. Manchester city council has pledged to adopt \u201cMartyn\u2019s law\u201d early through new licensing rules. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Lewis said: \u201cThe prime minister, home secretary and I are all 100% behind Figen and are working to improve security measures at public venues and spaces. \u201cWe are working quickly to come up with a solution that will honour Martyn\u2019s memory and all of those affected by terrorism. He added: \u201cI am pleased that last week Manchester city council announced new licensing rules, but we are committed to going further and making Martyn\u2019s law a reality for all public venues across the UK.\u201d Murray has been pushing for stronger anti-terror security measures since 2018. The government has now backed the plan, but has not yet set a timetable for its implementation. The government announcement represents a shift from the Home Office\u2019s 2019 resistance to Murray\u2019s petition, when it responded that while it provided advice to venues on appropriate and proportionate security measures, there were \u201cno plans to mandate specific security measures\u201d.

I met with Mr Lewis a few weeks ago but did not realise they were moving things on so quickly. \u201cIf the government do make this a reality then it will be a fitting tribute to not only Martyn but all those who died that night.\u201d The government backing follows calls by the mayor of Greater Manchester for mandatory security checks at large-scale public venues last year. Andy Burnham said: \u201cI believe there is a clear case for a thorough review of security measures at major sporting and entertainment event venues to establish clearly understood mandatory standards and I call on the government to initiate one. \u201cWe need to have clear minimum and mandatory standards at all venues so there is clarity for operators, and confidence for the public.\u201d",

Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\"</p>\n    <p>The IHRA definition goes on to state:</p>\n    <p>\"Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for 'why things go wrong'. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.\"</p>\n    <p>The IHRA provides the following as examples of antisemitism:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective \u2014 such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All the leadership and deputy contenders questions on how they intend to win back voters who were dismayed at the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism.</p> \n<p>Long-Bailey, who is deemed closest to Corbyn, said Labour did not act quickly or robustly enough.

      "bodyText": "The department store chain Beales is on the brink of collapse and must find a buyer within days, with about 1,000 jobs at risk if the historic retailer does not complete a rescue deal. Beales, which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881, has filed notice of its intention to appoint administrators, as the retailer considers its options while seeking to complete a sale process begun last month. Sources close to the firm said it was still hopeful of being able to secure a deal, amid interest from at least two suitors including another retail firm and a venture-capital investor currently holding eleventh-hour talks with Beales and its financial advisers. Beales appointed the advisory firm KPMG in the final retail trading week before Christmas to help advise on its \u201cstrategic and financing options\u201d \u2013 including a sale of the whole company or its subsidiaries. KPMG declined to comment. In a bid to fund its moves towards a \u201csustainable business model\u201d, the firm said it needed funding to support a refreshed strategy, which included an overhaul of its product ranges and cost-saving efforts. Beales, which has 22 stores across the UK, including in Bedford, Mansfield, Perth, Southport and Yeovil, completed a management buyout in October 2018 led by its chief executive, Tony Brown. Pretax losses more than doubled to \u00a33.2m in the year to March 2019 from \u00a31.5m a year before as sales remained steady at \u00a348.3m. The business had net current debts of \u00a315.8m. It said in those accounts that trading had been hampered by an industry-wide downturn in sales of women\u2019s fashion and the 2018 summer heatwave. Department stores are under pressure from rising costs, particularly business rates, and increasing competition, as the brands they have specialised in are increasingly going direct to shoppers either online or via their own stores. The retail industry has warned that 2019 was the worst on record for sales, with the volume bought by customers falling for the first time in 24 years amid a dire period for high-street shops. Households across the country have been reining in their expenditure in recent months against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty over Brexit. Several firms have reported a disappointing Christmas shopping period, the most important time of the year for retail industry profits.

The 39-year-old, who is currently in charge of the Doha club al-Sadd, expressed a desire to become coach at the Camp Nou but with Barcelona pressing for a swift response he decided the time was not right.

Last February he signed a new contract that runs to the end of this season with an option for another. No one anticipated that clause would be activated, but Valverde has no intention of resigning. Bar\u00e7a are through to the next round of the Champions League, having won their group, and are top of La Liga. They have also won the title in each of the last two seasons.</p> <p>Abidal and Grau had travelled to Qatar following Barcelona\u2019s defeat on Thursday. From 2-1 up with eight minutes remaining, they were defeated 3-2. Although doubts over Valverde had been profound, Barcelona stuck with him in the summer, but that defeat \u2013 throughout which Saudi Arabian Barcelona fans booed him \u2013 brought reservations back to the surface. With Xavi saying no, and negotiations public, it would be difficult to take a step back now: Valverde\u2019s position has been weakened dramatically.</p> <p>Grau and Abidal had been due in Qatar to check on the progress of the injured Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 but they also met Xavi. That too was planned but, to his surprise, they offered him the manager\u2019s job immediately. He told reporters it was no secret that his \u201cdream\u201d was to manage Barcelona, but hinted he had doubts over the timing. Xavi, who won eight La Liga titles and four Champions League during his 17-year career at Barcelona, also insisted on his \u201crespect\u201d for al-Sadd and Valverde.

      "bodyText": "Barcelona have been left in limbo after their former midfielder Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez turned down an offer to take over as manager of the club. Barcelona\u2019s sporting director, Eric Abidal, and chief executive, \u00d2scar Grau, are due to discuss the next step with Josep Maria Bartomeu, the club\u2019s president, upon their return from Qatar, where they held meetings with Xavi over two days. The 39-year-old, who is currently in charge of the Doha club al-Sadd, expressed a desire to become coach at the Camp Nou but with Barcelona pressing for a swift response he decided the time was not right. Ernesto Valverde remains in charge. Barcelona are now considering their options, which include handing the job on a part-time basis to the B-team coach, Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Pimienta, with a view to Xavi taking over in the summer. Until Barcelona were beaten 3-2 by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia on Thursday night, their original idea had been to see out the season with Valverde, with the former centre-back and current Netherlands head coach, Ronald Koeman, the principal candidate to replace him after Euro 2020, but that position has shifted now. Valverde had not been informed of the meetings and, unless a resolution is reached, he will turn up to take training on Monday. Last February he signed a new contract that runs to the end of this season with an option for another. No one anticipated that clause would be activated, but Valverde has no intention of resigning. Bar\u00e7a are through to the next round of the Champions League, having won their group, and are top of La Liga. They have also won the title in each of the last two seasons. Abidal and Grau had travelled to Qatar following Barcelona\u2019s defeat on Thursday. From 2-1 up with eight minutes remaining, they were defeated 3-2. Although doubts over Valverde had been profound, Barcelona stuck with him in the summer, but that defeat \u2013 throughout which Saudi Arabian Barcelona fans booed him \u2013 brought reservations back to the surface. With Xavi saying no, and negotiations public, it would be difficult to take a step back now: Valverde\u2019s position has been weakened dramatically. Grau and Abidal had been due in Qatar to check on the progress of the injured Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 but they also met Xavi. That too was planned but, to his surprise, they offered him the manager\u2019s job immediately. He told reporters it was no secret that his \u201cdream\u201d was to manage Barcelona, but hinted he had doubts over the timing. Xavi, who won eight La Liga titles and four Champions League during his 17-year career at Barcelona, also insisted on his \u201crespect\u201d for al-Sadd and Valverde. On Sunday, he finally turned the job down. The day that was expected to bring news of the end of Valverde\u2019s career at Bar\u00e7a may instead have brought news of the end of Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s career there after the club announced he will be out for an estimated four months after he underwent surgery on the meniscus on his right knee. Su\u00e1rez is 34 next month and Barcelona, who were already looking for a long-term replacement in the summer, are now considering going into the winter transfer market. Only four players have ever scored more goals for the club and before Thursday night\u2019s match, Su\u00e1rez had scored or assisted each of Barcelona\u2019s last 10 goals.",

It was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011.</p>\n    <p>Its stated purpose is to safeguard and support those vulnerable to radicalisation and to stop them from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does it prevent people from becoming terrorists?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Individuals suspected of being vulnerable to radicalisation can be referred to police for further assessment. One of the most controversial aspects of Prevent was the statutory duty introduced in 2015 on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism.</p>\n    <p>Once referred, the individual will be assessed to see whether or not further intervention is required. If an individual is assessed to be vulnerable to radicalisation, they may be offered support through the Channel programme in England and Wales, or the Prevent Professional Concerns (PPC) programme in Scotland. This is a voluntary process.</p>\n    <p>Between 2017 and 2018, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but only 394 were escalated to the Channel process.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Prevent controversial?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The most common criticism levelled at the Prevent strategy is that it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/23/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-schools-demonising-muslim-children\">disproportionately impacts people of Muslim faith</a>&nbsp;or background and inhibits legitimate expression.</p>\n    <p>There have been numerous reports over the last 15 years that have fuelled this perception: an eight-year-old questioned by Prevent after his teachers mistook his T-shirt slogan for Islamic State propaganda, a 17-year-old referred because he wore a \u201cFree Palestine\u201d badge to school and a student of counter-terrorism questioned after an official spotted him reading a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/24/student-accused-being-terrorist-reading-book-terrorism\">textbook entitled Terrorism Studies</a>.</p>\n    <p>The Prevent brand has been labelled \u201ctoxic\u201d in parts of the Muslim community. But senior policing and security figures continue to back Prevent. In September 2019 the UK\u2019s most senior counter-terrorism officer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/09/foiled-terrorist-attacks-on-uk-soil-have-risen-to-22-says-top-officer\">Neil Basu, vigorously defended the programme in a speech in Israel</a>, while security ministers and former home secretaries have insisted it has saved lives.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-grierson\">Jamie Grierson</a>,</b>&nbsp;<i>Home affairs correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fahy said confidence in Prevent was crucial to its success in stopping the flow of terrorists, and risked being damaged by the inclusion of the nonviolent group in the guide. \u201dIt is clearly disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cPrevent has to be about safeguarding people from becoming involved in terrorism.</p> \n<p>\u201cPrevent does depend on having the confidence of communities, and for instance of teachers because you need them to have confidence they can feed in information and it will be used proportionately.

City brutalised an under-strength Villa, and at one stage it looked like the Premier League record victory of 9-0 would be under threat. Instead, Sergio Aguero broke two big records: the most Premier League goals by a foreign player (177, two more than Thierry Henry) and the most hat-tricks by anyone (12, one more than Alan Shearer). El Ghazi scores emphatically. You can\u2019t call it a consolation goal, really, but it was an excellent penalty. PENALTY TO VILLA. Gundogan dangles a leg, Trezeguet trips over it and Villa have a penalty, VAR permitting. 87 min Grealish misses a decent chance, hoofing into orbit from the left side of the box. 86 min Villa almost get a non-consolation goal. Trezeguet moves into the area from the right and drills a shot that deflects wide off Gundogan. 85 min City must be so frustrated that they played silly buggers so often in the first half of the season, because they are in awesome form now. If they were even 6-8 points behind Liverpool, we\u2019d have an immense title race in prospect. It\u2019s Aguero\u2019s 12th hat-trick, one more than Alan Shearer. Villa\u2019s fans were sarcastically ol\u00e9ing as their team passed the ball around in defence. Then Hause gave it straight to Mahrez, who clipped it through to the unmarked Aguero. He ran into the area and battered a close-range shot past Nyland. Aguero breaks another record, this time for the most Premier League hat-tricks. 80 min Jack Grealish is booked for dissent. 79 min Henri Lansbury comes on for Danny Drinkwater. He didn\u2019t have the full Woodgate, but it was still a debut to forget. 78 min City work the ball across the line of the Villa area. Eventually Foden plays in Gabriel Jesus, whose fierce shot from a tight angle is beaten around the near post by Nyland. From the resulting corner Jesus misses a better chance, sidefooting just wide from 10 yards. 76 min Meanwhile, this will be fun. 75 min \u201cAll the talk of Belgian football reminded me of the most spiteful friendly I\u2019ve ever seen, a very workmanlike Belgium against that exquisite Dutch side of the late 1990s,\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cEnded in a five-all draw, and included a Maradona-like slalom from Edgar Davids. What a strange game.\u201d I vividly recall seeing that score in the Sunday Ti- sorry, in the Observer and assuming it was a cock-up. 74 min Okay, perhaps City have declared at 5-0. The intensity has dropped since De Bruyne went off. 72 min \u201cAt the risk of arguing with a joke (\u201cMost competitive league in the world!\u201d, 61 minutes) one thrashing doesn\u2019t make it not true,\u201d says Tom Chivers. \u201cCity lost to the worst team in the league earlier this season. Leicester beat Southampton 9-0 away then lost 2-1 at home. If by \u201cmost competitive\u201d we mean \u201canyone can beat anyone\u201d then you could probably argue it. (Except Liverpool. No one can beat them and that is just marvellous so carry on.)\u201d It\u2019s not worth the trouble of an argument, but I don\u2019t particularly agree. It was far more competitive in the 20th century, and even, briefly, in the mid-2010s. But the other big leagues have been as bad, if not worse. The Bundesliga has been great this year, mind. 71 min City\u2019s final change: Rodri off, Ilkay Gundogan on. And Villa bring on Trezeguet for Conor Hourihane. 69 min City ping the ball around in Villa\u2019s area before Mahrez\u2019s shot from the edge is blocked. 65 min A Villa change: Marvelous Nakamba replaces Douglas Luiz. Lucky him. 64 min Gabriel Jesus\u2019s shot is kicked off the line by Mings. This could end up 10-0. 63 min A double change for City: Nicolas Otamendi and Phil Foden replace Fernandinho and Kevin De Bruyne. 62 min Here\u2019s James Debens, continuing our VARternative history of football. \u201cAt the beginning of Chapter 2, after Billy Whitehurst\u2019s volcanic reaction to his goal being disallowed, a human pyramid of Fraser Forster, Peter Crouch, Harry Souttar, Wayne Hennessey, Per Mertesacker, Jan Koller, and Costel Pantilimon is used to fish Martin Atkinson from the floodlights.\u201d 61 min There\u2019s no sign of City declaring at 5-0, and Villa look completely shot mentally. It\u2019s the most competitive league in the world! 60 min \u201cAre the tactical fouls necessary at 4-0?\u201d says David Bertram. \u201cFernandinho was not playing the ball there.\u201d He does them on autopilot. 59 min That was Sergio Aguero\u2019s 176th Premier League goal, a new record for a foreign player. Thierry Henry scored 175. This is hard to watch. David Silva finds an eye in the needle, sliding a fine pass between two defenders for Aguero. He moves across the area, away from Mings, and passes the ball into the corner. It took a slight deflection off Mings but it was going in anyway. 56 min Aguero shoots straight at Nyland from 20 yards. 55 min This win will move City above Leicester and into second, just 14 poi- no, let\u2019s not go there. 54 min \u201cBeing Belgian I have followed Kevin... for the last 12 years,\u201d says Herman de latte. \u201cHe is close to the top of his development... he will bring Belgium the next European Championship.\u201d There\u2019s a good case for him being Belgium\u2019s greatest ever player. I\u2019d put him above Scifo, probably above Hazard and maybe Ceulemans. It\u2019s harder to compare him with Kompany, Gerets and Pfaff I suppose. 53 min El Ghazi is booked for leaving an arm on someone. 51 min Aguero fouls Grealish, prompting an exchange of views and shoves between the two. No yellow cards. 50 min Fernandino does what he does best, flattening Jack Grealish to stop a Villa counter-attack and earn a yellow card. 49 min \u201cI watched a lot of Mahrez in the miracle season hoping Leicester would drop points (us Gooners),\u201d says Drew Lundgren. \u201cI thought he had at least 10 penalties that weren\u2019t called. I think Leicester could have won the title by 20 points with VAR.\u201d Someone should write the VARternative History of Football. In Chapter 1, Billy Whitehurst learns that his first goal in 22 games is being checked for a possible handball. 48 min \u201cCity are exceptional but Villa, Jesus wept,\u201d weeps Niall Mullen. \u201cIf Danny Drinkwater is the answer I want to know what the question is.\u201d He was so good in Leicester\u2019s title-winning team as well. Hopefully it\u2019s just rust rather than (professional) rigor mortis. 47 min No changes on either side, since you asked. 46 min Peep peep! Villa begin the second half. \u201cInterestingly, Pep really only seems to struggle with free spirits and lapses in attackers,\u201d says Joe Harvey. \u201cHe got the very best out of Dani Alves (perhaps the freest spirit to play the game) and continues to tolerate Kyle Walker and Ederson. It\u2019s interesting - maybe forwards just don\u2019t expect to have such detailed defensive jobs, and struggle a bit?\u201d This is really a question for one for the Guardian Sport SuperBrains, but to my peasant eye it\u2019s more about individualism. He doesn\u2019t care for people who pick the wrong passes, or don\u2019t pass at all, which doesn\u2019t really apply to his best full-backs. Half-time reading Jose\u2019s bored already, isn\u2019t he. The upside of City being out of the title race is that they can just relax and play. They ended last season, when the stakes were so high, with a series of hard-fought one-goal victories. I suspect they will administer plenty of towellings between now and May. That was another demonstration of Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s rare genius. He didn\u2019t put the ball into an area; he looked up while he was on the run, processed where Jesus and the defenders were, and played the appropriate pass. He couldn\u2019t have drawn it any more accurately. Four. Kevin De Bruyne, on the right, puts in a glorious low pass - you can\u2019t call it a cross - that is finished from close range by Gabriel Jesus. 45 min \u201cThe decision to play Danny Drinkwater was questionable before the game,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cNow it looks like utter madness. He\u2019s so far off the pace it\u2019s untrue.\u201d I feel a bit sorry for him. I doubt we\u2019ll see him in the second half. 44 min There\u2019s an example of why Pep hasn\u2019t always been a fan of Riyad Mahrez. He leads a City break, three on two from a Villa corner, but holds on to the ball too long and the chance is lost. 41 min After a patient move, Villa\u2019s best of the match, El Ghazi cuts back inside Joao Cancelo and sprays a rising shot just wide of the far post. Ederson had it covered but it was a good effort. 40 min Villa\u2019s next three Premier League games are Brighton (A), Watford (H) and Bournemouth (A). That\u2019s the real quiz. 38 min David Silva curls a free-kick this far wide from 20 yards. The City fans cheered, thinking it had gone in. 36 min \u201cAs a Leicester fan, I\u2019ve seen Mahrez shimmy in from the right wing loads of times,\u201d says Martin Sinclair. \u201cYou know what\u2019s coming but sometimes you just can\u2019t stop it. I thought he was a great signing for City precisely because he is a bit different to everyone else. When City are desperate for a goal, he can create one out of nothing.\u201d I agree \u2013 he has a touch of genius, in mine \u2013 but Pep Guardiola hasn\u2019t generally got on well with free spirits. I thought he really missed a trick by not playing Mahrez against Andy Robertson at Anfield. 35 min This is getting embarrassing. Aguero misses a good chance to make it 4-0, rifling just over the bar after Mings makes a desperate tackle on Joao Cancelo. 31 min \u201cCan we stop this now?\u201d says David Bertram. \u201cDrinkwater looks like a budget Ashley Westwood. What\u2019s Big Sam up to? Having McGinn, Heston and Wesley out is unfortunate but a striker was needed and not having someone lined up is criminal.\u201d On the plus side, you\u2019re only one game away from a Carabao Cup agains- oh. For the second time this week, City go 3-0 up in the first half of an away game. De Bruyne beats Drinkwater with ease and finds Aguero, whose scorching 20-yard shot goes through the hands of the leaping Nyland. 28 min Villa have hardly had a kick in the last 15 minutes. 26 min Gabriel Jesus stabs over the bar after a superb turn in the area. Riyad Mahrez gets his second! Poor Danny Drinkwater, making his Villa debut, is having a bit of a nightmare. He dithered in his own area and was robbed by David Silva, whose touch diverted the close across the area. It bounced up nicely for Mahrez, who smacked it past Nyland with the minimum of fuss. 23 min The pattern of the game - City passing the ball hither and thither - suited Villa when the match was goalless. At 0-1, not so much. 21 min Riyad Mahrez\u2019s Manchester City career has been a mixed bag, and the feeling persists that he isn\u2019t quite a Pep Guardiola player. But when he\u2019s good, he\u2019s often awesome. Mahrez is such a beautiful player. He received Aguero\u2019s pass, 40 yards from goal on the right wing, and went straight at the backpedalling Villa defence. Drinkwater was the first to attempt a tackle on the edge of the area. Mahrez cut back inside him, used sleight of hip to throw Hause off balance without touching the ball and then dragged a disguised finish past Nyland at the near post. Riyad Mahrez gives City the lead with a brilliant individual goal! 16 min De Bruyne and David Silva combine to find Aguero on the right side of the area, but he slips in the act of shooting. He might have been assisted by a little push from Hause, though it wasn\u2019t enough for VAR to get involved. 15 min De Bruyne stabs an awesome pass, like the sudden thrust of a dagger, to take three Villa players out of the game and find Mahrez in the area. He tries to come back inside Hause and is dispossessed. The pass, though; the pass. 13 min Villa will be pretty happy with how the game has started. Although City have had most of the ball, Orjan Nyland has had the square root of sod all to do. 12 min Joao Cancelo\u2019s dangerous low cross towards Jesus is superbly defended by Konsa, sliding towards his own goal. 8 min Mendy fizzes a square pass to his fellow full back, Joao Cancelo. He gets the ball out of his feet and then smashes it well wide from 25 yards. 6 min It\u2019s been a scruffy start to the game, with City yet to get into their passing rhythm. 3 min City are playing a 4-3-3, with Jesus as the left-sided attacker. Villa have started with Anwar El Ghazi and Jack Grealish as an unlikely front pair. 39 seconds El Ghazi, near the penalty spot, heads well wide from Elmohamady\u2019s cross. 1 min Peep peep! City kick off from right to left. They are in their black away strip; Villa are wearing claret and blue. The players emerge from the tunnel on a crisp afternoon in Aston. This looks like a nigh-on impossible ask for Villa, who are without so many important players. \u201cIs Pep trying to sabotage Fantasy Football teams?\u201d says Chris Tavernos. \u201cNo Sterling (my captain) again?\u201d Some people say there was a world before Fantasy Football banter, but I\u2019ll be damned if I can remember it. And I knew I should have bought Mahrez this week. Watford have thumped Bournemouth 3-0 in the early game. It\u2019s their fourth win in six league games under Nigel Pearson, and they are already out of the relegation zone. Scenes, and then some. Pre-match reading Pep Guardiola has rested a few players, including Kyle Walker, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva. I think City will play 4-3-3 with Gabriel Jesus wide left, though most team news providers have them in a 3-4-2-1. Villa\u2019s formation looks like 3-5-1-1. Aston Villa (3-5-2) Nyland; Ngoyo, Mings, Hause; El Mohamady, Drinkwater, Douglas Luiz, Hourihane, Taylor; Grealish; El Ghazi. Substitutes: Kalinic, Chester, Guilbert, Lansbury, Nakamba, Trezeguet, Vassilev. Manchester City (4-3-3) Ederson; Joao Cancelo, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy; De Bruyne, Rodri, D Silva; Mahrez, Aguero, Jesus. Substitutes: Bravo, Walker, Otamendi, Gundogan, B Silva, Sterling, Foden. Referee Jon Moss. Now, here\u2019s a first: it\u2019s mid-January, and Pep Guardiola is out of the title race. That doesn\u2019t really compute, given the absurd excellence of his Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City teams, and it will be interesting to see how he responds. Most managers would prioritise the three available cup competitions, especially the Champions League, but Pep the perfectionist prefers to win every game regardless of context. I bet he\u2019s fun at Tiddlywinks parties. On the face of it this means a lot more to Aston Villa, who will start the match in the relegation zone if Watford finish the job at Bournemouth. Villa have played pretty well against the big teams - nobody has come closer to beating Liverpool in the league - but don\u2019t have many points to show for it. Yet. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

Then Villa were equally generous, with Drinkwater seemingly unable to do more than chug along behind the attacker, who waltzed into the box unchallenged before using Kortney Hause\u2019s body as a shield and slotting a low shot past the unsighted \u00d8rjan Nyland. Rather than wake Villa up, it seemed to render them even more passive.</p> <p>Six minutes later Ag\u00fcero took advantage of dawdling by Ahmed Elmohamady to prod the ball back from the byline. It landed at the feet of Drinkwater, whose lack of sharpness was exposed by David Silva, who nipped in to relieve him of the ball and feed Mahrez, who swished it into the net from 10 yards.</p> <p>Villa deteriorated. Jesus fired just over the bar after a Konsa mistake in the 26th minute. City soon came back for more, scoring their third before the half-hour mark. De Bruyne breezed past Drinkwater in midfield before finding Ag\u00fcero, who brushed aside Douglas Luiz before blasting into the net from 20 yards to equal Henry\u2019s record. There was no chance of him stopping there. Jesus got in on the act before half-time, converting at the back post after De Bruyne had again been allowed to canter through midfield and deliver a superb low cross.</p> <p>City created chances to increase their lead before Ag\u00fcero did so in the 57th minute. Again De Bruyne motored past almost stationary Villa midfielders to supply David Silva, who slipped the ball through to Ag\u00fcero. The striker held off Elmohamady and sidestepped Tyrone Mings before slotting home. He completed his hat-trick nine minutes from time. Hause gave the ball to Mahrez, he helped it on to Ag\u00fcero and the Argentinian made no mistake.</p> <p>City\u2019s clean sheet was lost when Ilkay G\u00fcndogan tripped Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet and El Ghazi netted from the spot but there could be no wiping away Villa\u2019s woes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>",

Rather than wake Villa up, it seemed to render them even more passive. Six minutes later Ag\u00fcero took advantage of dawdling by Ahmed Elmohamady to prod the ball back from the byline. It landed at the feet of Drinkwater, whose lack of sharpness was exposed by David Silva, who nipped in to relieve him of the ball and feed Mahrez, who swished it into the net from 10 yards. Villa deteriorated. Jesus fired just over the bar after a Konsa mistake in the 26th minute. City soon came back for more, scoring their third before the half-hour mark. De Bruyne breezed past Drinkwater in midfield before finding Ag\u00fcero, who brushed aside Douglas Luiz before blasting into the net from 20 yards to equal Henry\u2019s record. There was no chance of him stopping there. Jesus got in on the act before half-time, converting at the back post after De Bruyne had again been allowed to canter through midfield and deliver a superb low cross. City created chances to increase their lead before Ag\u00fcero did so in the 57th minute. Again De Bruyne motored past almost stationary Villa midfielders to supply David Silva, who slipped the ball through to Ag\u00fcero. The striker held off Elmohamady and sidestepped Tyrone Mings before slotting home. He completed his hat-trick nine minutes from time. Hause gave the ball to Mahrez, he helped it on to Ag\u00fcero and the Argentinian made no mistake. City\u2019s clean sheet was lost when Ilkay G\u00fcndogan tripped Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet and El Ghazi netted from the spot but there could be no wiping away Villa\u2019s woes.",

      "bodyText": "Steve McQueen has said the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) risks becoming irrelevant, redundant and of no interest or importance unless it undergoes reform to avoid a repeat of this year\u2019s nominations where there was a lack of diversity in many of the principal categories, including all the main acting awards. The director, who has won two Baftas \u2013 one for his debut feature film Hunger in 2009 and another for best film in 2014 for 12 Years a Slave \u2013 told the Guardian that the British film awards could become obsolete if it fails to recognise diverse talent. \u201cAfter a while you get a bit fed up with it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if the Baftas are not supporting British talent, if you\u2019re not supporting the people who are making headway in the industry, then I don\u2019t understand what you are there for. \u201cUnless the Baftas wants to be like the Grammys, which is of no interest to anyone, and has no credibility at all, then they should continue on this path,\u201d he added, referring to the criticism of the Grammys for consistently snubbing black talent. \u201cIf not then they have to change. Fact.\u201d McQueen said there was a vast amount of British talent that could have been nominated this year including Marianne Jean-Baptiste for In Fabric, Joanna Hogg for The Souvenir, Cynthia Erivo for Harriet, and Daniel Kaluuya for his performance in Queen &amp; Slim. \u201cBut not even just British talent, it\u2019s talent in general,\u201d he said, using the example of Lupita Nyongo\u2019o not being nominated for Jordan Peele\u2019s Us. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d In response to the backlash on Monday after the nominations were announced, Marc Samuelson, chair of Bafta\u2019s film committee, called the lack of diversity infuriating and said the awards could not make the industry do something about it. His comments echoed Bafta\u2019s deputy chairman, Krishnendu Majumdar, who said the lack of female nominees in the best director category was an \u201cindustry-wide problem\u201d. McQueen said the argument that the lack of nominations could be explained as mostly an \u201cindustry problem\u201d was nonsensical. \u201cWhen these films are being made to critical acclaim, they\u2019re not even being recognised \u2013 that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d The director\u2019s comments follow a week of criticism for Bafta, which announced on Thursday that it would undergo a review of its voting system after another year when its main acting awards will all be competed for by white talent. In 2018, a report revealed that 94% of all Bafta film award nominees had been white. The criticism also came before the Oscars nominations on Monday, as attention turns to Hollywood, which has its own long history of diversity issues. In 2015, the Oscars \u2013 along with all the leading film and music awards \u2013 were heavily criticised for a lack of diversity among nominees, only 12 months after a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d year when 12 Years a Slave won best picture. In 2016 \u2013 after another year of all-white nominees in the acting award, which led to a threatened boycott by Spike Lee, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Will Smith \u2013 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced it would review its membership process. The Academy eventually pledged to double female and minority members by 2020. Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker led the Baftas field this year with 11 nominations, with many films featuring BAME and female talent missing out, including The Souvenir and Greta Gerwig\u2019s Little Women \u2013 neither of whom featured in the all-male best director category. In an email to voters, Samuelson and Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry said the nominations were \u201cfrustrating and deeply disappointing\u201d and confirmed they would review all aspects of the voting process and listen to all interested parties in order to tackle the root cause of underrepresentation in Bafta nominations. Bafta voting is divided into two rounds: nominations and then a final say on the shortlist. At present, the four main acting categories are nominated by the full membership, with specific \u201cchapters\u201d \u2013 made up of specialists from Bafta\u2019s 6,700 members \u2013 choosing nominees for other categories such as best director, score and screenplay.

      "bodyText": "Seeking to explain Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Iran was planning attacks on four American embassies before the US killed Iranian Gen Qassem Suleimani in a drone strike, defense secretary Mike Esper found himself in the dangerous position of contradicting the president. Asked on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation if there had been a specific or tangible threat, Esper said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see one with regard to four embassies.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim on Fox News on Friday prompted fierce criticism from members of Congress who were not briefed before the strike and who say such a threat was not mentioned in a classified briefing on Wednesday. On Sunday, Esper added: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is I share the president\u2019s view that, probably, my expectation was that they were going to go after our embassies. \u201cWe had information that there was going to be an attack within a matter of days that would be broad in scale, in other words more than one country, and that it would be bigger than previous attacks, likely going to take us into open hostilities with Iran. \u201cWe had every expectation to believe this would happen. That threat has been disrupted.\u201d Suleimani was killed by a drone strike at Baghdad airport on 3 January. Iran responded with missile strikes on US bases in Iraq. It has also admitted accidentally shooting down a Ukrainian airliner over Tehran, killing 176 people. Esper later appeared to row back, telling CNN\u2019s State of the Union \u201cwhat the president said with regard to the four embassies is what I believe as well\u201d. \u201cThere was intelligence that there was an intent to target the US embassy in Baghdad,\u201d he said. However, Esper\u2019s insistence that such \u201cexquisite intelligence\u201d was shared with the bipartisan Gang of Eight congressional leaders in a briefing was immediately dismissed by Adam Schiff, Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee. \u201cHe\u2019s just plain wrong,\u201d Schiff told CBS. \u201cThere was no discussion that, \u2018These are the four embassies that are being targeted and we have exquisite intelligence that shows these or those are specific targets.\u2019 \u201c[And] I don\u2019t recall there being a specific discussion about bombing the US embassy in Baghdad.

That\u2019s Pompeo\u2019s personal opinion.\u201d Schiff also had harsh words for Trump. \u201cWhen you hear the president out there on Fox,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019s fudging the intelligence.\u201d Trump has also mentioned the threat to the Baghdad embassy as a motivation for the strike on Suleimani, but congressional criticism of his attempts to justify precipitating a crisis with Iran remains. After the classified briefing on Wednesday, Senator Mike Lee of Utah voiced rare Republican criticism of the president. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything about [the four embassies claim],\u201d Lee told CNN on Sunday, appearing to back up Schiff\u2019s assertion. \u201cAnd several of my colleagues have said the same so that was news to me. It certainly wasn\u2019t something I recall being mentioned at the classified briefing.\u201d Pompeo has claimed Congress was briefed fully on the rationale for the strike on Suleimani, \u201cthe most perilous chapter so far in Trump\u2019s three years in office\u201d, according to a detailed chronology of the crisis published by the New York Times on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m sure there was a mention of at least one embassy in that briefing,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbecause there had been an attack on one of our embassies [in Baghdad, by pro-Iranian militia] leading up to the strike on Suleimani.\u201d Asked if he agreed with the former Republican now independent congressman Justin Amash, that Trump was guilty of an abuse of his power in ordering the strike without informing Congress, Lee said he did not \u201cdoubt there was an imminent attack but it\u2019s frustrating not to get the details of the intelligence behind it\u201d. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul was more blunt than his fellow Republican on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, claiming Pompeo had given \u201ccontradictory information\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the secretary of state that they don\u2019t know where or when, but it was imminent,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe thinks he can square the circle but to me it seems pretty inconsistent.\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, parroted the \u201cexquisite intelligence\u201d talking point. \u201cWe had exquisite intelligence to show they were looking at US facilities throughout the region and they wanted to inflict casualties on American soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, as well as diplomats,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cThe threat was imminent, I saw the evidence,\u201d O\u2019Brien added, declining to elaborate because he said the information was classified. Pressed on his definition of imminent, he said: \u201cSoon, quickly.\u201d On ABC\u2019s This Week, Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi accepted Iran had malignant intentions towards the US but questioned the president\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cA lot of bad actors are doing bad things and threatening bad things to us, we know that,\u201d she said, \u201cIran being one of them and its proxies doing bad things to our interests and the world. \u201cBut how do we deal with that in a way that calms rather than escalates?\u201d Trump, meanwhile, continued to seek to capitalise on protests in Iran which broke out after the regime admitted shooting down the airliner. \u201cTo the leaders of Iran,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cDO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!\u201d",

He enlisted in the military during the Korean war and toured army bases performing in a revue that he had also written and directed. Upon returning to New York, he did a variety of jobs, including dubbing foreign films for the US market. He was also the figurehead of a hoax perpetrated by his friend <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2018/09/30/alan-abel-prankster-obituary/\" title=\"\">Alan Abel</a>, appearing on TV chat shows as the supposed president of a campaign to preserve the decency of animals by keeping them clothed; \u201cA nude horse is a rude horse,\u201d ran one of his slogans.</p> <p>In 1962, he joined the improv troupe The Premise and worked on TV comedies such as the US version of That Was the Week That Was and The Garry Moore Show, where he wrote for a cast that included Carol Burnett. His first film script, co-written with <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ted-flicker-20140919-story.html\" title=\"\">Theodore Flicker</a>, was The Troublemaker (1964), about a man who becomes embroiled in comic confusion and corruption when he tries to open a coffee house.</p> <p>In the wake of Get Smart and The Graduate, Henry was greatly in demand. He adapted <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryterry-southern-1581238.html\" title=\"\">Terry Southern</a> and Mason Hoffenberg\u2019s novel Candy (1968), derived from Candide and featuring eccentric turns from Marlon Brando, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/charles-aznavour-obituary\" title=\"\">Charles Aznavour</a> and Ringo Starr, and turned Bill Manhoff\u2019s play <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066195/?ref_=tt_urv\" title=\"\">The Owl and the Pussycat</a> into a vehicle for Barbra Streisand.</p> <p>He scripted two further adaptations for Nichols: an ambitious film of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/14/josephheller\" title=\"\">Joseph Heller</a>\u2019s antiwar satire Catch-22 (also 1970), which repeated the dazed, sceptical tone of The Graduate though not its commercial success, and the 1973 thriller The Day of the Dolphin (\u201cI thought it was a stupid book. I tried to move it in the direction of a less stupid film.\u201d) With Warren Beatty, he co-directed and acted in Heaven Can Wait (1978), a remake of the 1941 reincarnation comedy Here Comes Mr Jordan. His only solo directing gig was the presidential comedy First Family (1980) which had a top-notch cast (Bob Newhart, Gilda Radner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/06/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Madeline Kahn</a>) but flopped nonetheless.</p> <p>Henry usually turned up on screen in the films he wrote; he can be seen in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE-Hkno9Ao\" title=\"\">The Graduate, for instance, as the quietly intimidating desk clerk</a> at the hotel where Benjamin and Mrs Robinson are having an assignation. But his acting career was diverse, and quite distinct from his screenwriting one.</p> <p>He is impressive as a middle-class parent who joins the counter-culture after his daughter goes missing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/milos-forman-obituary\" title=\"\">Milo\u0161 Forman</a>\u2019s delightful <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067820/?ref_=tt_urv\" title=\"\">Taking Off (1971)</a>. He played a patent attorney going into business with an alien (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/obituary-david-bowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/25/nicolas-roeg-obituary\" title=\"\">Nicolas Roeg</a>\u2019s 1976 The Man Who Fell to Earth. (\u201cNever quite understood the script,\u201d said Henry in 2010. \u201cStill don\u2019t.\u201d) He was in John Cassavetes\u2019s thriller Gloria (1980) and the cannibalism comedy Eating Raoul (1982), and he appeared as himself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/22/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Robert Altman</a>\u2019s star-studded Hollywood satire The Player (1992), where he is shown pitching a sequel to The Graduate. For the same director, he played one of a group of friends who stumble upon a corpse during a fishing trip in Short Cuts (1993). In 1999, he joined his friend George Segal in the fourth Broadway cast of <a href=\"http://www.playbill.com/article/henry-segal-knight-join-bways-art-may-11-com-81800\" title=\"\">Yasmina Reza\u2019s Art</a>. \u201cYou can depend on him to be unsentimental all the time,\u201d said Segal. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to get gooey on you.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, Tina Fey cast him in several episodes of her sitcom 30 Rock as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB8MXiH4xkQ\" title=\"\">Dick Lemon, the father of Fey\u2019s character, Liz</a>.

As a child, Henry mixed with his parents\u2019 celebrity friends, including Howard Hughes, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Peter Lorre, but he was especially fascinated by the Hollywood comedy writers of their acquaintance: \u201cNo audience knew who they were, but everyone heard their jokes on their favourite shows.\u201d He was educated at the Choate school in Dartford, Connecticut, and at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, where he wrote stories for the Dartmouth Quarterly and ran with the theatre crowd. He enlisted in the military during the Korean war and toured army bases performing in a revue that he had also written and directed. Upon returning to New York, he did a variety of jobs, including dubbing foreign films for the US market. He was also the figurehead of a hoax perpetrated by his friend Alan Abel, appearing on TV chat shows as the supposed president of a campaign to preserve the decency of animals by keeping them clothed; \u201cA nude horse is a rude horse,\u201d ran one of his slogans. In 1962, he joined the improv troupe The Premise and worked on TV comedies such as the US version of That Was the Week That Was and The Garry Moore Show, where he wrote for a cast that included Carol Burnett. His first film script, co-written with Theodore Flicker, was The Troublemaker (1964), about a man who becomes embroiled in comic confusion and corruption when he tries to open a coffee house. In the wake of Get Smart and The Graduate, Henry was greatly in demand. He adapted Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg\u2019s novel Candy (1968), derived from Candide and featuring eccentric turns from Marlon Brando, Charles Aznavour and Ringo Starr, and turned Bill Manhoff\u2019s play The Owl and the Pussycat into a vehicle for Barbra Streisand. He scripted two further adaptations for Nichols: an ambitious film of Joseph Heller\u2019s antiwar satire Catch-22 (also 1970), which repeated the dazed, sceptical tone of The Graduate though not its commercial success, and the 1973 thriller The Day of the Dolphin (\u201cI thought it was a stupid book. I tried to move it in the direction of a less stupid film.\u201d) With Warren Beatty, he co-directed and acted in Heaven Can Wait (1978), a remake of the 1941 reincarnation comedy Here Comes Mr Jordan. His only solo directing gig was the presidential comedy First Family (1980) which had a top-notch cast (Bob Newhart, Gilda Radner, Madeline Kahn) but flopped nonetheless. Henry usually turned up on screen in the films he wrote; he can be seen in The Graduate, for instance, as the quietly intimidating desk clerk at the hotel where Benjamin and Mrs Robinson are having an assignation. But his acting career was diverse, and quite distinct from his screenwriting one. He is impressive as a middle-class parent who joins the counter-culture after his daughter goes missing in Milo\u0161 Forman\u2019s delightful Taking Off (1971). He played a patent attorney going into business with an alien (David Bowie) in Nicolas Roeg\u2019s 1976 The Man Who Fell to Earth. (\u201cNever quite understood the script,\u201d said Henry in 2010. \u201cStill don\u2019t.\u201d) He was in John Cassavetes\u2019s thriller Gloria (1980) and the cannibalism comedy Eating Raoul (1982), and he appeared as himself in Robert Altman\u2019s star-studded Hollywood satire The Player (1992), where he is shown pitching a sequel to The Graduate. For the same director, he played one of a group of friends who stumble upon a corpse during a fishing trip in Short Cuts (1993). In 1999, he joined his friend George Segal in the fourth Broadway cast of Yasmina Reza\u2019s Art. \u201cYou can depend on him to be unsentimental all the time,\u201d said Segal. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to get gooey on you.\u201d More recently, Tina Fey cast him in several episodes of her sitcom 30 Rock as Dick Lemon, the father of Fey\u2019s character, Liz. In one episode, it is revealed that Dick served at Pearl Harbor, but only during the Korean war; in another he gets sloshed in a bar and accidentally propositions Liz. In 2008 he married Irene Ramp, and she survives him, as does a daughter from an earlier relationship. \u2022 Buck Henry (Henry Zuckerman), screenwriter and actor, born 9 December 1930; died 8 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "What a difference a year makes. At the end of 2018 I had just won an MP of the Year award \u2013 by New Year\u2019s Eve 2019, I had lost a job that I loved. A week to pack up the parliamentary office, up to two months to wind up the constituency office, and then the absolute worst part: making my amazing staff redundant. You can\u2019t get away from the instability of politics. Democracy rightly gives us the ability to remove politicians from positions of power. In a marginal seat such as mine \u2013 Crewe and Nantwich \u2013 the situation was always going to be more precarious. There is a common misconception that all MPs have bags of money and receive huge payoffs if they lose their seat. Like many colleagues who lost their seats, I don\u2019t have a family fortune or lots of friends in high places. When I attended an appointment at my local jobcentre last week, a few people were shocked to see me there. One even took a photograph on their phone. I am working-class. When the work stops, the money stops, and a new source of income must be found. I\u2019m not embarrassed to be in my situation \u2013 I have two kids and two pensioners who live with me and I have a responsibility to provide for them. It\u2019s not easy being out of work so suddenly but I don\u2019t regret anything. I have been incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to be an MP, something I will always be grateful to the people of Crewe and Nantwich for.

To begin with, the responsibility of staffing this queue fell to the emergency department itself.</p> <p>\u201cAround 18 months ago, random wards were asked to supply registered staff to take responsibility of staffing the queue, leaving the wards sometimes dangerously understaffed. Without any real consultation with less senior members of staff, a rotation system was devised and implemented.</p> <p>\u201cEvery ward now has allocated slots of sometimes up to four hours per shift. This is not only leaving the wards short but also putting huge amounts of stress on staff. It has hit staff morale as many staff don\u2019t want to leave their own patients that may be acutely unwell or in pain. Many nurses\u2019 are concerned for their PIN [registration to practise] as [they] feel they could be used as a scapegoat if something were to happen in the queue or on the ward they have left.</p> <p>\u201cWe have felt very vulnerable when in the queue as we find ourselves caring for patients with specialist needs, that in some cases we find are beyond our limits of competence. Many of us have raised this through incident reports and other channels but not received much, if any, feedback.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the rotation system was first sprung upon us. We were told that if we believed our ward/clinical area was unsafe we were to stress this to the clinical site team. But this has been met with \u2018Everywhere is busy, you need to just get on with it.\u2019 We understand what is going on within the NHS and its pressures. We\u2019re in the thick of it \u2013 but we\u2019re being asked to choose between the safety of our patients on the ward and those in the queue.</p> <p>\u201cOur NMC Code section 13 states many of these concerns, and if something were to happen during these periods any nurse could easily be accused of breaking the code in this sense. Our concerns when raised just never appear to be taken into consideration. It has pushed some to leave and others, including myself, to look for work elsewhere. Something I would rather not do.</p> <p>\u201cWhen in the queue we are expected to cannulate and take bloods in corridors while patients are in chairs, on the floor or on trolleys. This plays havoc on the back and laughs in the face of all the manual handling skills we have been taught and expected to adhere.</p> <p>\u201cMany nurses, including myself, now dread going into work in case we\u2019re pulled from our own patients (up to eight) to then care for a number of people in the queue, which is clearly unsafe.\u201d</p> <p><em>As told to Denis Campbell</em></p>",

To begin with, the responsibility of staffing this queue fell to the emergency department itself. \u201cAround 18 months ago, random wards were asked to supply registered staff to take responsibility of staffing the queue, leaving the wards sometimes dangerously understaffed. Without any real consultation with less senior members of staff, a rotation system was devised and implemented. \u201cEvery ward now has allocated slots of sometimes up to four hours per shift. This is not only leaving the wards short but also putting huge amounts of stress on staff. It has hit staff morale as many staff don\u2019t want to leave their own patients that may be acutely unwell or in pain. Many nurses\u2019 are concerned for their PIN [registration to practise] as [they] feel they could be used as a scapegoat if something were to happen in the queue or on the ward they have left. \u201cWe have felt very vulnerable when in the queue as we find ourselves caring for patients with specialist needs, that in some cases we find are beyond our limits of competence. Many of us have raised this through incident reports and other channels but not received much, if any, feedback. \u201cWhen the rotation system was first sprung upon us. We were told that if we believed our ward/clinical area was unsafe we were to stress this to the clinical site team. But this has been met with \u2018Everywhere is busy, you need to just get on with it.\u2019 We understand what is going on within the NHS and its pressures. We\u2019re in the thick of it \u2013 but we\u2019re being asked to choose between the safety of our patients on the ward and those in the queue. \u201cOur NMC Code section 13 states many of these concerns, and if something were to happen during these periods any nurse could easily be accused of breaking the code in this sense. Our concerns when raised just never appear to be taken into consideration. It has pushed some to leave and others, including myself, to look for work elsewhere. Something I would rather not do. \u201cWhen in the queue we are expected to cannulate and take bloods in corridors while patients are in chairs, on the floor or on trolleys. This plays havoc on the back and laughs in the face of all the manual handling skills we have been taught and expected to adhere. \u201cMany nurses, including myself, now dread going into work in case we\u2019re pulled from our own patients (up to eight) to then care for a number of people in the queue, which is clearly unsafe.\u201d As told to Denis Campbell",

Many hospitals have become so overcrowded that they are being forced to tell nurses to spend part of their shift working as \u201ccorridor nurses\u201d to look after patients who are waiting for a bed. Nurses, doctors and hospital bosses have all voiced unease about the practice, which has risen sharply in recent weeks as the NHS has struggled to cope with the extra pressures of winter.

      "bodyText": "Momentum towards an interest cut is growing after a third member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee signalled that the British economy could require support from lower borrowing costs within months. Gertjan Vlieghe, an independent member of Threadneedle Street\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC), said on Sunday he would vote for a cut in rates later this month from 0.75% \u2013 if key barometers of economic strength fail to reveal a bounce straight after the December general election. Vlieghe\u2019s comments are the third indication in four days by an MPC member that a cut could come soon. In an intervention following signals last week from Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, and Silvana Tenreyro, another external member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, that a cut in rates could come within months, Vlieghe told the Financial Timesthe upcoming decision would be a \u201cclose call\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much data to swing it one way or the other and the next few [MPC] meetings are absolutely live,\u201d he said. \u201cI really need to see an imminent and significant improvement in the UK data to justify waiting a little bit longer.\u201d At the latest MPC meeting in December, two members voted for an immediate rate cut \u2013 Jonathan Haskell and Michael Saunders. With three members now indicating they might join Haskell and Saunders, the balance of the MPC is now tilting towards a cut. At the outset of the year, the British economy is struggling for momentum, after a period of intense political and Brexit-related uncertainty weighed on growth at the end of 2019. The latest official growth figures, due on Monday, are expected to indicate that GDP fell in the three months to November, reflecting a downturn in business activity and consumer spending before last month\u2019s election. Some early indicators from the economy have suggested that Britain could stage a recovery in the opening months of the year, after Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpectedly decisive election victory lifted some of the Brexit uncertainty holding back firms\u2019 investment decisions. However, some economists warn that a lack of clarity over the UK\u2019s future EU trading relationship \u2013 which will be subject to intense negotiations with Brussels this year \u2013 could serve as a continuing drag on growth. On Friday, Tenreyro told a conference in London that she was ready to vote for an interest rate cut \u201cin the coming months\u201d if there was no sign of a bounce since the general election. \u201cIf uncertainty over the future trading arrangement or subdued global growth continued to weigh on UK demand, then my inclination is towards voting for a cut in bank rate in the near term,\u201d she added.

Other recommendations include increasing the Disaster Recovery Allowance, which is paid at the same rate as Newstart, which the organisation said was inadequate to cover basic living costs, and providing additional relief for people on low incomes who could not afford insurance. \u201cAs extreme weather events increase in Australia, insurance premiums are escalating and too many people, particularly people on low incomes, find themselves under-insured or not insured.\u201d According to the Insurance Council of Australia, more than $700m in insurance payments have already been paid out to bushfire victims. Acoss is also calling on the government to increase funding for food relief, saying the government needs to immediately allocate an additional $30m in funding for the community sector to respond \u201cto the surge in need which is likely to continue for many months\u201d. \u201cFood relief is critical for people, families and communities that are affected by bushfires,\u201d Goldie said. Along with a call for the \u201cstreamlining\u201d of payments and service delivery, Acoss has outlined a range of medium- and long-term recommendations, including a call for greater action on climate change. This includes the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, investment in energy efficiency and disaster resilience for low-income households, and government support to ensure a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers and communities affected by the shift to renewables. \u201cSome communities will experience negative effects from our response to climate change, such as those heavily dependent on burning or extracting fossil fuels,\u201d Goldie said. \u201cWe must develop transition plans that are place-based, and include the development of new economic opportunities.\u201d Goldie, who also wants the community sector included on the board of the new National Bushfire Recovery Agency, praised several government initiatives, including the decision to make the disaster tax exempt and the pause on debt recovery actions for affected welfare recipients. She also welcomed the establishment of a royal commission, but said there needed to be a national summit on bushfire recovery and preparedness to address the \u201cimmediate policy and investment needs for recovery\u201d. \u201cWe need a national summit to draw on the best advice across the community about what we need to do to recover from this bushfire crisis, and what is needed to prepare for the increasing natural disasters that we will inevitably see as our climate changes,\u201d she said. On Sunday, Morrison announced the government had already paid out $40m in various forms of disaster assistance to more than 30,000 people, with another $40m paid to affected councils.",

      "bodyText": "As Australia\u2019s unprecedented bushfire season continues to unfold, competing arguments have been made about the principal causes of the human and environmental tragedy \u2013 particularly around the role of climate change. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has acknowledged that climate change has had an influence on the fires and has defended his government\u2019s climate record. But Morrison has also said that \u201cjob-destroying, economy-destroying, economy-wrecking targets and goals\u201d on climate change \u201cwon\u2019t change the fact that there have been bushfires or anything like that in Australia\u201d. Backbench MP Craig Kelly denied any link between climate change and bushfires in a combative interview on British TV. Conservative media have concentrated on other factors, such as the amount of hazard reduction burning carried out, or the activities of arsonists \u2013 a claim shown to have been inflated and misrepresented. Bushfire experts say that in normal years hazard reduction is a way to control the behaviour of fires, but the changing climate is making it harder to carry out prescribed burns and, according to fire chiefs, it is not a \u201cpanacea\u201d for extreme bushfires. Here is what we know about the long-term influences on the bushfire catastrophe. Why has this bushfire season been so devastating? Extreme heat and dryness are two important influencers of fire and, on both measures, 2019 was remarkable for Australia. Australia experienced its hottest year on record in 2019, with average temperatures 1.52C above the 1961-1990 average. Our second hottest year was 2013, followed by 2005, 2018 and 2017. New South Wales \u2013 one state hard hit by the bushfires \u2013 broke its record by a greater margin, with temperatures 1.95C above average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C. At a very basic level, rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere change the Earth\u2019s radiation balance, allowing less heat to escape. Australia also had its driest ever year in 2019, with rainfall 40% lower than average, based on records going back to 1900. NSW also had its driest year. A visualisation from Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, examines hot and dry years in Australia since 1910 and how they correlate with major bushfires. Fire authorities and the Bureau of Meteorology look at the risk of bushfires using the forest fire danger index, a combined measure of temperature, humidity, wind speed and the dryness, but not the amount, of fuel on the ground. Australia\u2019s 2019 spring months of September, October and November were the worst on a record going back to 1950 for bushfire risk. What about \u2018natural\u2019 weather patterns? There have been two other meteorological patterns that helped generate the extreme conditions Australia has been experiencing, and both these \u201cmodes of variability\u201d were in \u201cphases\u201d that made conditions worse. The Indian Ocean dipole was in a \u201cpositive phase\u201d, meaning the Indian Ocean off Australia\u2019s north-west was cooler than normal and the west of the ocean was warmer. Positive dipole events draw moisture away from Australia and tend to deliver less rainfall. But there is evidence that the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are also impacting the dipole and another phenomenon, known as the southern annular mode (SAM). A 2009 study found that positive dipole events \u201cprecondition\u201d the south of the country for dangerous bushfire seasons and that these events were becoming more common. A 2018 study in the journal Nature Communications found the number of extreme positive dipole events goes up as climate heating continues. At 1.5C of global warming, the frequency of extreme positive dipole events doubles compared with the pre-industrial period. The southern annular mode was in a \u201cnegative phase\u201d as the bushfires took hold in November and December. This phase was generated by a sudden warming event in the stratosphere above Antarctica. This caused westerly winds to track further north, blowing hot air across the continent into fire-prone areas, further fanning flames. Abram\u2019s own research has found that the SAM is being pushed towards more positive phases which, when they occur in Australia\u2019s winter, tend to dry the continent. Prof Matt England, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, said: \u201cThese modes of variability are not changing in a way that\u2019s good for south-east Australia. \u201cWe know with certainty that we are stacking the dice for the chances of these extreme drought years because of the changes in the modes.\u201d What has happened to Australia\u2019s fire weather? Scientists have already detected a trend towards more dangerous fire weather in Australia. A 2017 study of 67 years of FFDI data found a \u201cclear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season\u201d. That trend continued in 2019, which was the riskiest year for bushfires on a record going back to 1950. What role is climate change playing in the risk of fire? A study of Queensland\u2019s historic 2018 bushfire season found the extreme temperatures that coincided with the fires were four times more likely because of human-caused climate change. In advice issued in November 2019, Australia\u2019s National Environmental Science Program was unambiguous. \u201cHuman-caused climate change has resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia. \u201cObservations show a trend towards more dangerous conditions during summer and an earlier start to the fire season, particularly in parts of southern and eastern Australia. \u201cThese trends are very likely to increase into the future, with climate models showing more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires throughout Australia due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Despite such unequivocal statements, Scott Morrison has been irritated that interviewers have asked about his government\u2019s record on climate change, saying it was \u201cjust ridiculous\u201d to link \u201cany one emissions reduction policy to any of these fires\u201d. Morrison\u2019s argument that no emissions reduction policy can be tied to individual events is spurious, as the same argument could be put for any and all efforts to reduce emissions anywhere in the world, at any time. Scientists also believe that 2019 was a \u201cstandout\u201d year in Australia for the formation of extreme bushfires that became \u201ccoupled\u201d with the atmosphere, generating their own lightning and gusty, violent and unpredictable winds. Rainfall is replaced with blackened hail and embers that can be shot out over distances of 30km. Another study has found that global heating will create more favourable conditions for these \u201cpyroCB\u201d storms to form in Australia. What about the future? Climate studies show that conditions in Australia for extreme bushfires will only get worse as more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. On Friday afternoon the president of the Australian Academy of Science, Prof John Shine, said Australia would need to further improve its climate modelling ability and understanding of fire behaviour to mitigate against the extreme events that would become more frequent and intense because of climate change. \u201cAustralia must take stronger action as part of the worldwide commitment to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C above the long-term average to reduce the worst impacts of climate change,\u201d he said. England said: \u201cWe are loading the dice for more and more of these summers. But we have had knowledge of this for some time. \u201cWhat we have seen in Australia this year will just be a normal summer if we warmed the planet by 3C. And an extreme summer would be even worse than we\u2019ve seen now.\u201d Abram said: \u201cEven from my perspective, I am surprised by just how bad 1C of warming is looking. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying that we are talking about this as a new normal, because we are actually on an upward trajectory. Currently the pledges in the Paris agreement are not enough to limit us to 1.5C \u2013 we are looking more like 3C.\u201d",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ecologist Chris Dickman, from the University of Sydney, <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/08/australian-bushfires-more-than-one-billion-animals-impacted.html\">estimates more than one billion animals</a> have been killed in bushfires that have burned more than 10.7m hectares (26m acres) across the country. <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/leaked-report-lays-bare-environmental-devastation-of-victorian-fires-20200110-p53qep.html\">According to a Victorian government report</a> leaked to the Age, fires in that state have burned 31% of rainforests, 24% of wet or damp forests and 34% of lowland forests.

Government ministers said the commitment, drawn from the government\u2019s $2bn bushfire recovery fund, was a downpayment to be spent immediately on priorities in burned areas and planning for longer-term protection and restoration of habitat. Conservation groups wrote to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, and her state counterparts on Thursday expressing concern for at least 13 animal species, and urging the government to use a review of national environment laws launched last year to boost wildlife protection. The letter by five groups echoes earlier warnings by scientists in saying the fires may have triggered extinction events for some threatened species. It sets out a recommended emergency wildlife recovery plan, including that scientists and conservationists be sent into the field immediately to identify and help at-risk animal populations as part of a coordinated national response. The federal government said its immediate priorities would be caring for and rehabilitating injured wildlife, securing viable populations of threatened species, controlling feral predators and other pests that are a major threat to vulnerable species after fires, scientifically mapping the damage and working with landowners to protect unburned areas that act as \u201carks\u201d in which plants and animals could recover.

It calls for the review of EPBC Act, led by the businessman Graeme Samuel, to consider the development and implementation of recovery and threat reduction plans for threatened species. Less than 40% of nationally listed threatened species have formal recovery plans. Launching the review of EPBC Act last year, Ley stressed it would \u201ctackle green tape\u201d and reduce project approval delays.

We\u2019ve had enough of those over the past few years.\u201d</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez last Tuesday secured the backing of congress to form his new government by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/pedro-sanchez-spain-pm-government-vote-parliament\">the narrowest of margins</a>, winning 167 votes to 165, with 18 abstentions.</p> \n<p>The coalition\u2019s path to victory was far from easy \u2013 or polite. The two investiture debates began with the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) calling S\u00e1nchez a sociopath.</p> \n<p>It was at least in keeping with the epithets Pablo Casado has hurled at S\u00e1nchez in the past, which include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/03/spanish-pm-pedro-sanchez-brexit-catalan-independence-bid-both-based-on-lies\">traitor, squatter, villain, catastrophe, hostage and compulsive liar</a>.</p> \n<p>Casado warmed to his theme still further on Tuesday, when he accused the Socialist leader of being an egotistical \u201cextremist\u201d who had left the country\u2019s future in the hands of \u201cterrorists and coup-mongers\u201d from Catalonia and the Basque country.</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, branded his rightwing opponents a \u201ccoalition of the apocalypse\u201d and sore losers to boot.</p> \n<p>An MP from one of the pro-independence Catalan parties loathed by Casado informed congress that she \u201cdidn\u2019t give a damn about the governability of Spain\u201d \u2013 shortly before her party\u2019s abstention returned S\u00e1nchez to office.</p> \n<p>The week was rounded off by a frank assessment of the new cabinet from the general secretary of the far-right Vox party on Friday.</p> \n<p>What did Javier Ortega Smith make of the ministers in the new coalition government? \u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/politica/MINUTO-POLITICO-nuevo-Gobierno-forma_13_983531638_37510.html\">said Ortega Smith</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t know them but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all really bad.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not all the barbs, however, were rhetorical, as one of Spain\u2019s newest MPs soon discovered.</p> \n<p>Tom\u00e1s Guitarte, a 58-year-old architect, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/spain-general-election-polls-pedro-sanchez-psoe\">elected to congress last November</a>, becoming the sole MP for Teruel Exists, a movement that campaigns to improve conditions in the overlooked eponymous region of eastern Spain.</p> \n<p>Guitarte\u2019s decision to support the new coalition provoked a furious reaction. Graffiti denouncing him as a traitor appeared on walls in Teruel and he received thousands of threats and abusive messages. He was assigned protection officers by Spain\u2019s interior ministry and decided for himself that it would be best not to sleep at home before Tuesday\u2019s decisive vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe very last thing you expect when you stand in an election is that you\u2019ll to have to deal with something like this,\u201d Guitarte told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be about arguing and defending your positions through reasoned debate when you\u2019re an MP. But they were trying to force an MP to change the way they vote, which is totally anti-democratic and doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p> \n<p>What Guitarte refers to as his \u201csocial media lynching\u201d also saw online calls for a boycott of Teruel and its produce.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s prime minister has called for calm and cooperation as the country\u2019s first coalition government since the 1930s prepares for office. The plea by Pedro S\u00e1nchez follows a tumultuous and extraordinarily bad-tempered week of political argument that presages another fraught legislature. The prime minister has spent the past few days putting together a cabinet made up of ministers from his own Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party and its new partners, the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance. On Sunday afternoon, S\u00e1nchez spoke of the need for \u201csocial, territorial and generational dialogue\u201d, adding that Spain had grown tired of political deadlock, splits and squabbling. \u201cThe citizens are calling on us politicians for a Spain of moderation and not a Spain of tension,\u201d he said. \u201cA Spain that builds bridges of collaboration and not a Spain of vetoes and ruptures. We\u2019ve had enough of those over the past few years.\u201d S\u00e1nchez last Tuesday secured the backing of congress to form his new government by the narrowest of margins, winning 167 votes to 165, with 18 abstentions. The coalition\u2019s path to victory was far from easy \u2013 or polite. The two investiture debates began with the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) calling S\u00e1nchez a sociopath. It was at least in keeping with the epithets Pablo Casado has hurled at S\u00e1nchez in the past, which include traitor, squatter, villain, catastrophe, hostage and compulsive liar. Casado warmed to his theme still further on Tuesday, when he accused the Socialist leader of being an egotistical \u201cextremist\u201d who had left the country\u2019s future in the hands of \u201cterrorists and coup-mongers\u201d from Catalonia and the Basque country. S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, branded his rightwing opponents a \u201ccoalition of the apocalypse\u201d and sore losers to boot. An MP from one of the pro-independence Catalan parties loathed by Casado informed congress that she \u201cdidn\u2019t give a damn about the governability of Spain\u201d \u2013 shortly before her party\u2019s abstention returned S\u00e1nchez to office. The week was rounded off by a frank assessment of the new cabinet from the general secretary of the far-right Vox party on Friday. What did Javier Ortega Smith make of the ministers in the new coalition government? \u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d said Ortega Smith. \u201cI don\u2019t know them but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all really bad.\u201d Not all the barbs, however, were rhetorical, as one of Spain\u2019s newest MPs soon discovered. Tom\u00e1s Guitarte, a 58-year-old architect, was elected to congress last November, becoming the sole MP for Teruel Exists, a movement that campaigns to improve conditions in the overlooked eponymous region of eastern Spain. Guitarte\u2019s decision to support the new coalition provoked a furious reaction. Graffiti denouncing him as a traitor appeared on walls in Teruel and he received thousands of threats and abusive messages. He was assigned protection officers by Spain\u2019s interior ministry and decided for himself that it would be best not to sleep at home before Tuesday\u2019s decisive vote. \u201cThe very last thing you expect when you stand in an election is that you\u2019ll to have to deal with something like this,\u201d Guitarte told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be about arguing and defending your positions through reasoned debate when you\u2019re an MP. But they were trying to force an MP to change the way they vote, which is totally anti-democratic and doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d What Guitarte refers to as his \u201csocial media lynching\u201d also saw online calls for a boycott of Teruel and its produce. But the initiative backfired after a rival campaign #YoVoyaTeruel (#I\u2019mGoingtoTeruel) was launched and began trending on Twitter. \u201cThe boycott has had the opposite effect,\u201d said Guitarte. \u201cA lot of hotels and businesses say they\u2019ve seen their business increase online. There haven\u2019t been any negative repercussions at all. The sympathy movement was far stronger than the boycott.\u201d The threats and vilification were not the only things that have caught him unawares; Guitarte was also shocked by the aggressive nature of the investiture debates. \u201cYou can argue your case and your convictions perfectly well without having to resort to attacks and insults,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of my fellow MPs said that there\u2019s always a bit of theatre in the chamber, but these are people who are also meant to be able to get round a table and decide things for the entire country.\u201d Bonnie Field, professor of global studies at Bentley University in Massachusetts, said that although \u201cvery heated debate\u201d had long been a feature of contemporary Spanish politics, \u201cthe tone of this week\u2019s investiture debate was the most corrosive, aggressive and divisive of all investiture debates\u201d since Spain\u2019s return to democracy after 1977. \u201cIt is, in part, a result of greater polarisation \u2013 particularly on territorial and national identity issues, and very much intertwined with the Catalan crisis,\u201d said Field. \u201cHowever, competition within political blocks also contributes greatly, particularly at a time of party system flux and when voters are less committed to a particular party.\u201d Much of the most fierce language has come from parties on the Spanish right, which used to be the exclusive territory of the PP.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s our match report. Enjoy the rest of your weekend; ta-ra. Eddie Howe says there wasn\u2019t much in it till Watford scored the first goal \u2013 I\u2019m not sure about that \u2013 and that the second half was \u201cdifficult\u201d \u2013 I am certain about that. He says the first goal came about because of \u201cour endeavour to do the right thing\u201d, and that he\u2019s not going to blame players because he never does, but the problem was the execution not the action. He agrees that his team are conceding too many and scoring too few; they worked on attacking this week, but confidence is low. And so too is fitness; he says he has players playing through injury, and when a team goes behind that becomes a problem. Finally, he says that the responsibility is his, and it is his job to give cbeief to his players. Half an hour from now, Aston Villa-Man City kicks-off; join Rob Smyth for build-up fun immediately. So there we are. It\u2019s still only January and Bournemouth have plenty of time to save themselves, but they need to get going because their run-in is brutal. Watford, on the other hand, are going to be fine. \u201cThe boys and the gaffer have gotta take credit,\u201d says Troy Deeney bashfully. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit rock bottom a few times this season\u201d. He then praises Doucoure, who hasn\u2019t trained this week. Doucoure says he likes playing further forward, then Deeney says his team should\u2019ve scored more and, gesturing to the away end, says \u201clook how happy these guys are\u201d, which is what it\u2019s all about. Bournemouth are now second-bottom with 20 points from 22 games; Watford have 22 from 22, while between them, Villa have 21 from 21, and they play Manchester City in 36 minutes\u2019 time. Four wins in five league games for Watford, who move out of the bottom three for the first time this season. Bournemouth, meanwhile, now have one win in 11 games, and unless they can find something and fast, are going down. Yet another counter, Pereyra finding Gray, but Billing does really well to hold him up with a slide before Cook S clears his shot off the line ... only for the ball to rear up straight at Pereyra, who controls beautifully on his upper chest before zetzing home a murderous volley! 90 min There\u2019ll be four added minutes. 90 min Pearson treats Deulofeu to an ovation from the away end, replacing him with Andre Gray. He looks disappointed, so Pearson takes him by the phizog to offer some consoling threats. 88 min Hinchcliffe gives Deeney man of the match. I might\u2019ve gone Masina, who was huge when the scores were level, or Doucoure who got the first goal and has been the difference in midfield, but I can\u2019t argue with the choice. 88 min Fraser, who\u2019s been willing but uninspired, curves in a low cross, which Dawson kicks away. 86 min Second change for Watford. Off comes Doucoure, who exchanges bro-hugs with the giletted Pearson. Quina replaces him. 84 min Nice again from Watford, Deeney finding Deulofeu out side. He moseys towards the box and rolls to Doucoure, who can\u2019t fold his go-go Gadget legs around the ball, slicing a shot that doesn\u2019t even go out for a throw. 83 min Change for Watford, Pereyra replacing Sarr. 82 min Watford are superior to Bournemouth in every department. They\u2019re stronger, faster, more skilful and have a better idea of what they\u2019re doing. 80 min Deeney, who\u2019s had a very nifty second half, sends Doucoure away down the left; he looks up and squares directly to Ake. 79 min Surridge sways into the box and beats Mariappa, but Chalobah comes across to relieve him of possession 78 min Bournemouth have gone to three at the back, for all the good it\u2019ll do them. 78 min Watford look dangerous every time they counter, and Deulofeu combines with Doucoure once more before running out of pitch. 77 min Teams are in for the Villa-City game, which you can follow here with Rob Smyth. 75 min Final go for Howe, who sends Surridge on for Wilson H, armed with various notes. 74 min ...Deeney pulls to the left side of the box and holds up Deulofeu\u2019s pass, laying it back into his stride ... but the eventuating shot is wide. 73 min The Watford fans sing for the late lamented Graham Taylor as their team sweep forward again... 71 min The away end are enjoying themselves/is enjoying itself. They\u2019re expecting more goals, and Bournemouth can\u2019t subdue Deulofeu/ who scythes through a one-two/ with Dou/ Coure/But his shot/ isn\u2019t true. 70 min Bournemouth desperately try to compose themselves, Fraser chipping a ball into the box that\u2019s cleared as far as Billing ... who half-clumps a volley wide. 68 min Bournemouth get caught upfield which is not something you want to happen when the other side have Sarr and Deulofeu. And the latter drives on the counter, burrowing into the box and shooting into shins before Deeney, following up again, shoots first time. But this time, Travers is there to save. 67 min There is not a chance Bournemouth will redeem this. What a finish this is! Deeney drops deep and feeds a ball into Sarr down the channel; Cook S could just see him away, but instead dives in and Sarr lanks beyond him and to the line, driving a cross into legs ... only for the ball to break to Deeney, arriving onto the scene and absolutely punishing a first-time finish into the far side-netting! Bournemouth are in absolutely all sorts! 63 min Watford just have more class and more confidence than Bournemouth, playing like they expect to win not like they kind of hope to win. 62 min Better again from Bournemouth, Solanke nipping out right and standing up a cross for Wilson C. But Masina, who\u2019s been excellent, is wise to the ruse and heads clear. 60 min This is better from Bournemouth, Fraser feeding a ball into Billings\u2019 stride and he powers into the box. But Caopue follows him, refraining from jumping in, playground-style, in favour of running his man out of position. 59 min Howe has seen enough, hooking Gosling and Lerma for Billings and Cook L. 58 min Wilson C, who we\u2019ve barely seen, suddenly finds space on the right of the box, lamping a shot high and wide of the near post. 57 min Deeney loses possession to Wilson H, who scurries away only to quickly be levelled by a sliding recovery. Deeney is booked. 56 min A long clearance sends Sarr lanking away, but the counter looks over when he slows ... only to pick a clever pass into the path of Doucoure, who goes one more for Deulofeu. He should pass back across goal, but instead slices high and wide at the near post. 54 min \u201cThis Bournemouth team has the look and feel of one at the end of its cycle,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cWhen you factor in injuries and some frankly weird signings on top, you\u2019re left to conclude - sadly - that Howe\u2019s time is up.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about that \u2013 he\u2019s earned the opportunity to build again \u2013 but so far, this is a relegation performance. It is not unusual for a board to act in such circumstances. 52 min The corner isn\u2019t cleared so Deulofeu clips in a cross that Deeney attacks, and though he gets nothing on the ball, he attracts men to him, leaving Sarr free! But instead of taking it down or panelling first time, he dribbles a tame shot across the face that Bournemouth eventually clear. 51 min Again,Bournemouth give it away deep inside their own half and Watford move the ball from left to centre, Sarr easily diddling Gosling with a clever shimmy and driving a low shot which loops off Ake and behind. 51 min Mariappa lumps high into the box and Doucoure is up. He can\u2019t get over the ball, but his desire to get to it nevertheless highlights a difference between the sides. 50 min Not huge amounts going on here, but Bournemouth are passing it a bit quicker now. 48 min Fergus Brown is back: \u201cTo the tune of \u201cCopacabana\u201d; Deu, deulefeu, he really is quite a good playeu...\u201d One of my mates has a mum called Lola. Oh what larks, dear old Pip, dear old chap. 46 min \u201cWell, obviously,\u201d begins Fergus Brown. \u201cDeu\u2026 Deulofeu \u2026 daylight come an me wanna go home...\u201d Manchester United fans sung this about George Weah when he was at Manchester City. 46 min Off we go again! Half-time entertainment: Bournemouth in happier times. Bournemouth are in trouble, threatening little and tripping themselves up lots. They need to stop messing about in their own half and get men into the box, because if they don\u2019t they\u2019ll lose this by another goal or two. Watford, on the other hand, haven\u2019t played well but have been comfortably the better side. 45+2 min It\u2019s very quiet in Dean Court, and Eddie Howe looks rueful. 45 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. 45 min Bournemouth badly need to find something. And here it almost is, Lerma picking a ball through midfield which Gosling touches off to Solanke, who slides in Fraser! But his low drive is superbly blocked by Mesina. Circus music! Again, Bournemouth try to pass out from the back and Nigel Pearson my son is having no such thing. His team press, Francis opts not to go long but to go home, and Travers sells Smith short. So Sarr bursts through him, cuts back hard, and Doucoure takes a fine first touch, allowing him to turn, then another that sets up a shot ... which flies into the roof of the net. 40 min Smith loses the ball, which goes crossfield to Ake ... whom Sarr barges through. Dean isn\u2019t angry, he\u2019s just disappointed, all the more so when Ake takes swift revenge. No card are shown, but the one with the sounds is ticking. 38 min \u201cThis game rely needs Mike Dean to assert his influence and dictate proceedings,\u201d says Colin Flint. \u201cBy the way, what would you choose as your rapper name?\u201d Tonight Matthew, I\u2019m gonna be MC Mikey Dean. 36 min \u201cMF DOOM could ink a rap opus titled \u2018Deulofeu\u2019 in the time it took him to drink one-and-a-half bottles of malt liquor,\u201d tweets Dean Van Nguyen. I was picturing Pharoahe Monch, but that\u2019d do me. I\u2019m off for some half-time 8 Ball. 35 min Lerma leaps into Doucoure and hurts his knee. That looked a sair yin, bone on bone, but he should be ok. 34 min I said earlier that this is the unscary crowd derby, but it\u2019s also the waterpark derby: Splashdown v Watford Springs RIP. It\u2019s not a remotely close contest. 32 min There is nothing going on here; anyone fancy a game of Four In A Row? Why don\u2019t you come too? 30 min Watford are dictating in midfield but are struggling to create anything, and as I type that, Sarr lays back for Mariappa who humps a cross in the general direction of Deeney. Nothing comes of it. 29 min I\u2019ve seen better games. 27 min Sky show us Bournemouth\u2019s next few league fixtures, which are both appealing and daunting. They play: Norwich (a) Brighton (h) Villa (h) Sheffield United (a) Burnley (a) So plenty of points available, but if they don\u2019t find some form quickly, they\u2019ll have to beat teams better than them to stay up. 25 min Wilson H, who looks better, teams up with Fraser to pick a route through the Watford defence, but Masina is there again. 24 min Ake eases forward and flicks a ball out to Fraser, whose cross is a good one ... but Masina sees it coming and concedes the corner which obviously comes to nothing. 23 min If I was a rapper, I\u2019d love the word \u201cDeulofeu\u201d, brilliant for rhymes and half-rhymes with its own internal rhyme. 22 min Bournemouth are determined to pass their way out of defence and into trouble. Francis is nearly caught in possession by Deulofeu, but gets the ball away, just. 20 min Again, Bournemouth give the ball away deep inside their own half, and this time Cook has to chuck his body in the way of Sarr\u2019s shot. The home side are nervous again. 20 min Caopue\u2019s corner is a good one, but Masina can\u2019t direct his header. 18 min But here\u2019s Deulofeu, Francis giving it away cheaply to Masina, who finds Doucoure ... and he knocks off to Capoue, who slides a lush baa in behind for Deulofeu, who drills a low shot which Travers tips around his near post. 17 min We\u2019ve not seen anything of Deulofeu yet, but it\u2019s noticeable how quickly Watford get up when the ball goes into Deeney, whom they assume will win the header. 16 min These last few minutes have been a bit better for Bournemouth, who\u2019ve settled into the game now. And Wilson H is back on too, but still grimacing. 15 min Wilson stands at the side as we get going again. 14 min Wilson H is down after landing on shoulder. It looks sair, and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll be able to continue. 13 min Nice from Sarr, skirting around the outside of Smith and away down the line, only for Smith to scythe through him. He\u2019s booked. 12 min There\u2019s a brief pause after Lerma and Doucoure enjoy minor afters; lil Mikey Dean quickly reminds them who everyone\u2019s come to see. 11 min While we\u2019re on the subject, when did it become desirable to dress like a Peaky Blinder. We now have colours available to us, and all sorts. 9 min Wilson, who looks like the youngest Shelby, John i think, outswings one past the wall ... and Foster has to dive to save! 9 min Chalobah hauls Lerma down for no reason, and Bournemouth have a free-kick, almost dead centre, 25 yards out. 7 min Close! Smith drags a low shot that flicks off Wilson c and bobbles about as Solanke tries to adjust body and feet without losing sight of the ball. He can\u2019t quite manage it though, and Foster smothers. 6 min \u201cSuper-low camera angle today,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cHard to see the far side of the pitch.\u201d Trudat. I prefer too low to too high because I\u2019m trying to feel involved in the game, but this isn\u2019t great. Tagentially, when did \u201csuper\u201d become a synonym for \u201cvery\u201d. 5 min The corner yields another, which comes to nothing. This is a good start from Watford. 4 min Fraser gives it away and Ake is caught up the pitch so Watford break, but Sarr\u2019s first touch is loose and he does well to win a corner when Travers shoves his shot around the post, though it was going wide. 2 min Watford knock it about confidently, until Mariappa\u2019s heavy touch forces him to stretch. But stretch he does and Smith finds Deeney, whose first touch is lovely, sending Doucoure away down the right. His cross is good, but with Deeney behind play, no one is around to cash in. 1 min Ake is playing at left-back, presumably so that instead of fighting with Deeney, he\u2019s shackling Sarr. 1 min Away we go! Daryl Gurney\u2019s walk-on plays as the players get ready. Here they come! \u201cIt\u2019ll be a game of chess in terms of who\u2019ll make the first move,\u201d says Steph Houghton. Er, pretty sure that\u2019s white. The players gather in the tunnel. Watford have had some well good kits. Here\u2019s Nigel Callaghan in the 1984 Cup final, taking on the ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS John Bailey. Today is a big day for Dominic Solanke, who has one goal in 21 Bournemouth appearances. Howe can\u2019t afford to keep picking a striker who doesn\u2019t score, or at least can\u2019t when his team is losing. On which point, when is David Brooks back? If it\u2019s soon, that could be the difference between staying up and going down. FOOTBALLESE QUIZ TIME: Graeme Souness thinks Nigel Pearson is someone you\u2019d want... \u201cWe\u2019re effectively playing catch-up now,\u201d says Pearson, which makes me think: has any gameshow achieved such lasting verncularial impact as Going for Gold? Foster goes on to say that Pearson has got his side mentally prepared. When he came in, he was very quick \u201cin and out\u201d, telling players what he expected of them, and is a manger whereas previously Watford had had coaches. Ben Foster tells Sky that Watford needed a rocket, and Pearson was that man. That man himself says he wanted the players to enjoy themselves and not worry about things going wrong. Breaking: Andy Hinchcliffe reckons Ake being back is important for Bournemouth. More news as i get it. On which point, Bournemouth\u2019s two strikers have a big role to play today (and in other revelatory news, I think the first goal will be important). But it\u2019s rare for centre-backs to have a man each to mark, and if Lerma or Gosling can make third-man runs, Watford will have a problem. Looking more closely at that Watford team, it looks very physically imposing, but with no small amount of wit and imagination. I strongly fancy them today, though Bournemouth pose a threat if they can get the ball wide early. Choking up here! Eddie Howe tells Sky that his club\u2019s circumstance represents his biggest challenge in the Premier League, but also notes that it\u2019s more or less like this every season, with his team forced to fight to stay up. He is clear that his team will seek to attack and get the crowd going, which reminds me that today\u2019s match is the least-fearsome crowds derby. As for Watford, they make two changes: Kabasele is suspended and Femenia is injured, so Mariappa and Mesina get a go. So what does it all mean? Well, huge news four Bournemouth comes with the return of Nathan Ake, who replaces Chris Mepham; at left-back, Adam Smith returns from an injury to his moral sentiments, Diego Rico dropping out; and in goal, Mark Travers replaces the minorly hamstrung Aaron Ramsdale. AFC Bournemouth (a genteel 4-4-flipping-2): Travers; Francis, Cook S, Ake, Smith; Wilson H, Lerma, Gosling, Fraser; Wilson C, Solanke. Subs: Boruc, Surman, Cook L, Rico, Simpson, Billing, Surridge. Watford (an ungenteel 4-2-3-1): Foster; Mariappa, Dawson, Cathcart, Masina; Chalobah, Capoue; Sarr, Doucoure, Deulofeu; Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Gray, Quina, Success, Dele-Bashiru, Holebas, Pereyra. Star of the show: Lil Mikey Dean (Wirral) He may call his dad \u201cSon\u201d; his real name may be \u201cNigel Pear\u201d; but you\u2019d have to be an absolute ostrich not to grasp that \u201cNigel Pearson\u201d knows something. Claudio Ranieri may have bought pizza and such, but it was not him who built Leicester\u2019s ludicrous league winners. As such, Watford\u2019s recent improvement is no remote surprise. They have enough good players to stay up, and now they have a manager able to identify and arrange them in mutually advantageous manner. It would be a surprise were they to go down. It would also be a surprise were Bournemouth to go down, as they too have some decent players and a manager with a track record of competence. But they\u2019ve lost three of their last four games and sit 18th in the table, just a point above their visitors today; if they lose, they are in trouble. All of which is to say that this game is absolutely monstrous, and both sides can be relied upon to attack it as such. Bournemouth will stay true to the attractive, enterprising football that has left them at this point, and Watford will continue with the aggressive, direct football that has rescued them from that point. Settle in. Kick-off: 2pm GMT",

      "body": "<p>Beethoven spent almost a decade getting his only opera right, and even the final, 1814 version of what he called Fidelio has its problems. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/18/facing-the-music-composer-david-lang\">composer David Lang</a> saw it on stage for the first time in the 1970s, he was struck by some of those, and how they compromise the impact of the glorious music in Beethoven\u2019s score, whether it\u2019s the way the <em>buffo</em> sub-plot of the early scenes seems to belong to an entirely different work from the deadly serious exploration of love and freedom that provides the opera\u2019s soaring climax, or whether what begins as a <em>Singspiel</em>, following on from Mozart, ends as something much closer to an oratorio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98ed1be719e7e9ea4a87b14d9280a0467a8849b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98ed1be719e7e9ea4a87b14d9280a0467a8849b5/0_0_5000_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dav\u00f3ne Tines as the Jailor and Julie Mathevet in Prisoner of the State.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dav\u00f3ne Tines as the Jailor and Julie Mathevet in Prisoner of the State.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, 40 years on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/10/david-lang-beethoven-opera-fidelio-prisoner-of-the-state\">Lang has tackled some of those </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/10/david-lang-beethoven-opera-fidelio-prisoner-of-the-state\">difficulties in a piece of his own</a>. Prisoner of the State, first performed in New York last June, and brought to the Barbican for its European premiere, with Ilan Volkov conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra, is an hour-long opera for the concert hall that takes the central story of Fidelio \u2013 Leonora\u2019s efforts to rescue her husband, Florestan, by disguising herself as a young man to work in the prison in which he is incarcerated \u2013 and gives it a timeless, universal slant. The original characters lose their identities: Leonora becomes the Assistant, Florestan the Prisoner, and so on, while the other inmates of the prison, who in Beethoven\u2019s opera only appear for the famous prisoners\u2019 chorus and in the final number, feature in every scene of Lang\u2019s version, which does away with the comic elements.</p> <p>Lang says his work is built on \u201cthe skeleton\u201d of Beethoven\u2019s version, and that he wrote his own libretto as a commentary on the texts of both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/beethoven-leonore-review-rene-jacobs-fidelio-harmonia-mundi-cds\">the original 1805 opera (when it was known as Leonore)</a> and the final 1814 Fidelio. What he has produced is more or less a latter-day <em>Singspiel</em>, with self-contained musical numbers occasionally interspersed with dialogue. But direct musical references are avoided, though the text is larded with quotes from other sources. Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s \u201cMan is born free, but everywhere is in chains\u201d features prominently, to which in the final chorus the prisoners add the observation that: \u201cThe difference between prison and outside is that here you see the chains.\u201d Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cIt is better to be feared than to be loved\u201d provides the text for an aria by the Governor (Beethoven\u2019s Pizarro).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c91306468b77b6ac85b230b2c72b01cf95fb1e1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c91306468b77b6ac85b230b2c72b01cf95fb1e1c/0_0_5000_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Oke as the Governor and Dav\u00f3ne Tines at the Barbican.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Oke as the Governor and Dav\u00f3ne Tines at the Barbican.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Lang\u2019s reworking has its own dramatic issues. The climactic confrontation between the Assistant and the Governor, which leads to the Prisoner\u2019s rescue, seems contrived, with the Governor apparently realising the errors of his way as soon as he is faced with a gun.

      "bodyText": "Beethoven spent almost a decade getting his only opera right, and even the final, 1814 version of what he called Fidelio has its problems. When composer David Lang saw it on stage for the first time in the 1970s, he was struck by some of those, and how they compromise the impact of the glorious music in Beethoven\u2019s score, whether it\u2019s the way the buffo sub-plot of the early scenes seems to belong to an entirely different work from the deadly serious exploration of love and freedom that provides the opera\u2019s soaring climax, or whether what begins as a Singspiel, following on from Mozart, ends as something much closer to an oratorio. Now, 40 years on, Lang has tackled some of those difficulties in a piece of his own. Prisoner of the State, first performed in New York last June, and brought to the Barbican for its European premiere, with Ilan Volkov conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra, is an hour-long opera for the concert hall that takes the central story of Fidelio \u2013 Leonora\u2019s efforts to rescue her husband, Florestan, by disguising herself as a young man to work in the prison in which he is incarcerated \u2013 and gives it a timeless, universal slant. The original characters lose their identities: Leonora becomes the Assistant, Florestan the Prisoner, and so on, while the other inmates of the prison, who in Beethoven\u2019s opera only appear for the famous prisoners\u2019 chorus and in the final number, feature in every scene of Lang\u2019s version, which does away with the comic elements. Lang says his work is built on \u201cthe skeleton\u201d of Beethoven\u2019s version, and that he wrote his own libretto as a commentary on the texts of both the original 1805 opera (when it was known as Leonore) and the final 1814 Fidelio. What he has produced is more or less a latter-day Singspiel, with self-contained musical numbers occasionally interspersed with dialogue. But direct musical references are avoided, though the text is larded with quotes from other sources. Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s \u201cMan is born free, but everywhere is in chains\u201d features prominently, to which in the final chorus the prisoners add the observation that: \u201cThe difference between prison and outside is that here you see the chains.\u201d Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cIt is better to be feared than to be loved\u201d provides the text for an aria by the Governor (Beethoven\u2019s Pizarro). Yet Lang\u2019s reworking has its own dramatic issues. The climactic confrontation between the Assistant and the Governor, which leads to the Prisoner\u2019s rescue, seems contrived, with the Governor apparently realising the errors of his way as soon as he is faced with a gun. The ending seems, if anything, even more oratorio-like than Fidelio\u2019s. There is, though, some strikingly beautiful music. The tone is set in the opening number, as the Assistant (unsentimentally played by Julie Mathevet) sings of her love for her husband, while the Machiavelli aria for the Governor gives Alan Oke the chance to remind us what a compelling stage presence he has. Most of the vocal lines are suspended over spare, ostinato-based orchestral textures, sometimes menacing, sometimes consoling, while the luminosity of Lang\u2019s choral writing harks back to the beauties of his The Little Match Girl Passion more than a decade ago. With Jarrett Ott as the Prisoner and Dav\u00f3ne Tines as the Jailor completing the cast of principals, and the BBC Singers, joined by students from the Guildhall School, as the prisoners, the staging by Elkhanah Pulitzer did everything that was necessary, but whether Lang\u2019s piece really provides a solution to problems Beethoven failed to solve is another matter. \u2022 On BBC Sounds until 10 February.",

      "body": "<p>Sugar is bad; sugar is evil; sugar is the devil. We all know that, although that doesn\u2019t stop us from heaping it over our Weetabix every morning and adding it to tea and coffee.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.atkins.com/how-it-works/library/articles/10-ways-sugar-harms-your-health\" title=\"\">Too much sugar</a> can lead to weight gain, causes tooth decay and increases the risk of diabetes. But it also has another profound effect \u2013 it messes with your sleep, and in such a way that your sleeplessness will leave you with a craving for more sugar.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://jcsm.aasm.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=30412\" title=\"\">2016 study</a> found that people who have diets high in sugar tend to sleep less deeply and display greater restlessness at night. According to <a href=\"https://thesleepdoctor.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Michael Breus</a> \u2013 AKA \u201cthe sleep doctor\u201d \u2013 a US clinical psychologist who specialises in sleep disorders, too much sugar leads to a tendency to eat later in the day because blood sugar levels are zigzagging out of control. That adversely affects sleep, and your disrupted sleep will, in turn, produce an even greater craving for sugar the next day. The vicious circle is complete.</p> <p>Having too much sugar at night can be detrimental to our health. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your blood sugar levels rise and your pancreas releases insulin, which helps the sugar to be taken back into the cells, giving them fuel to run on,\u201d says the dietitian <a href=\"https://abergavennydietitian.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Alex Evans</a>. \u201cEating sugar late at night overstimulates you. It gives you energy and makes you ready for activity, but that is not what we\u2019re trying to do at night. We\u2019re designed to shut down towards the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSugar uses up a lot of magnesium, which you need for sleep,\u201d says the nutritional therapist <a href=\"https://www.charlottewattshealth.com/\" title=\"\">Charlotte Watts</a>, author of Good Mood Food and The De-Stress Effect. She points out that you should, in particular, avoid late-night chocolate, which contains caffeine and other stimulants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-kelley\" title=\"\">Dr Paul Kelley</a>, a researcher into sleep patterns, accepts the link between high sugar intake and disturbed sleep, but cautions that more data is needed before we fully understand the causality. \u201cPoor sleep and eating sugar and fatty foods do go together, but there is evidence on both sides about which direction it goes in,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes eating sweet things make you sleep less or does sleeping less make you eat sweet things?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The less you rely on sugar during the day, the more you are able to achieve healthy sleep patterns at night</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He says the average adult needs at least seven hours sleep a night; any less and you will be looking for short-term energy boosts, and the combination of bad diet and poor sleep will damage your health.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a major problem with sleep and a major problem with food, and they interact,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cSugary foods are likely to disrupt your sleep. The rule of thumb is that you shouldn\u2019t eat in the two hours before you go to sleep.\u201d He recommends avoiding caffeine and switching off the TV an hour before bed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real biochemical drive to eat more sugar,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThe body recognises that resources are low, and you need something that acts as a crutch.\u201d She says bingeing on sugary foods can be a sign of loneliness. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have enough joy in life, we tend to turn to things that can prop us up instead, and sugar is one of those. Sugar is a massive self-medicator.\u201d</p> <p>The encouraging news is that the craving can be broken. \u201cBlood sugar is like a rollercoaster, but <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-get-more-fibre-into-your-diet/\" title=\"\">fibrous foods</a> such as wholemeal and granary bread, and potatoes in their skins can help to control it,\u201d says the dietitian <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~0177126f137862c17a/\" title=\"\">Anna Hardman</a>. \u201cThey release sugar over a much longer period and reduce the spikes.\u201d Your overworked pancreas gets a well-earned rest.</p> <p>Foods high in <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/tryptophan\" title=\"\">tryptophan</a> are recommended for enhancing sleep. These include beans, lentils, nuts, whole grains and poultry. Or you could opt for a meal with sleep-inducing carbs and some protein. \u201cTryptophan helps to make the neurotransmitter serotonin, known as the \u2018happy hormone\u2019,\u201d says Evans. \u201cOne of the things it does is prepare you for sleep.\u201d</p> <p>So what should those who have late-night food cravings eat? \u201cGood sources of tryptophan are cottage cheese and turkey,\u201d she says. \u201cCertain plants are seen to have a sleepy effect \u2013 lettuce, for example. A turkey and lettuce sandwich on wholegrain bread would give you slow-release carbohydrates from the bread, tryptophan from the turkey, producing your serotonin, and the soporific effect from the lettuce.\u201d</p> <p>Watts recommends eating well throughout the day, starting with plenty of protein for breakfast, to counteract fluctuating blood-sugar levels. \u201cThe less you rely on sugar and caffeine to prop you up through the day, the more you are able to go into healthy sleep patterns at night,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Healthy eating, exercise and an evening wind-down produce good sleep, and the vicious circle turns virtuous. Sleep well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sugar is bad; sugar is evil; sugar is the devil. We all know that, although that doesn\u2019t stop us from heaping it over our Weetabix every morning and adding it to tea and coffee. Too much sugar can lead to weight gain, causes tooth decay and increases the risk of diabetes. But it also has another profound effect \u2013 it messes with your sleep, and in such a way that your sleeplessness will leave you with a craving for more sugar. A 2016 study found that people who have diets high in sugar tend to sleep less deeply and display greater restlessness at night. According to Dr Michael Breus \u2013 AKA \u201cthe sleep doctor\u201d \u2013 a US clinical psychologist who specialises in sleep disorders, too much sugar leads to a tendency to eat later in the day because blood sugar levels are zigzagging out of control. That adversely affects sleep, and your disrupted sleep will, in turn, produce an even greater craving for sugar the next day. The vicious circle is complete. Having too much sugar at night can be detrimental to our health. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your blood sugar levels rise and your pancreas releases insulin, which helps the sugar to be taken back into the cells, giving them fuel to run on,\u201d says the dietitian Alex Evans. \u201cEating sugar late at night overstimulates you. It gives you energy and makes you ready for activity, but that is not what we\u2019re trying to do at night. We\u2019re designed to shut down towards the end of the day.\u201d \u201cSugar uses up a lot of magnesium, which you need for sleep,\u201d says the nutritional therapist Charlotte Watts, author of Good Mood Food and The De-Stress Effect. She points out that you should, in particular, avoid late-night chocolate, which contains caffeine and other stimulants. Dr Paul Kelley, a researcher into sleep patterns, accepts the link between high sugar intake and disturbed sleep, but cautions that more data is needed before we fully understand the causality. \u201cPoor sleep and eating sugar and fatty foods do go together, but there is evidence on both sides about which direction it goes in,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes eating sweet things make you sleep less or does sleeping less make you eat sweet things?\u201d He says the average adult needs at least seven hours sleep a night; any less and you will be looking for short-term energy boosts, and the combination of bad diet and poor sleep will damage your health. \u201cWe have a major problem with sleep and a major problem with food, and they interact,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cSugary foods are likely to disrupt your sleep. The rule of thumb is that you shouldn\u2019t eat in the two hours before you go to sleep.\u201d He recommends avoiding caffeine and switching off the TV an hour before bed. \u201cThere\u2019s a real biochemical drive to eat more sugar,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThe body recognises that resources are low, and you need something that acts as a crutch.\u201d She says bingeing on sugary foods can be a sign of loneliness. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have enough joy in life, we tend to turn to things that can prop us up instead, and sugar is one of those. Sugar is a massive self-medicator.\u201d The encouraging news is that the craving can be broken. \u201cBlood sugar is like a rollercoaster, but fibrous foods such as wholemeal and granary bread, and potatoes in their skins can help to control it,\u201d says the dietitian Anna Hardman. \u201cThey release sugar over a much longer period and reduce the spikes.\u201d Your overworked pancreas gets a well-earned rest. Foods high in tryptophan are recommended for enhancing sleep. These include beans, lentils, nuts, whole grains and poultry. Or you could opt for a meal with sleep-inducing carbs and some protein. \u201cTryptophan helps to make the neurotransmitter serotonin, known as the \u2018happy hormone\u2019,\u201d says Evans. \u201cOne of the things it does is prepare you for sleep.\u201d So what should those who have late-night food cravings eat? \u201cGood sources of tryptophan are cottage cheese and turkey,\u201d she says. \u201cCertain plants are seen to have a sleepy effect \u2013 lettuce, for example. A turkey and lettuce sandwich on wholegrain bread would give you slow-release carbohydrates from the bread, tryptophan from the turkey, producing your serotonin, and the soporific effect from the lettuce.\u201d Watts recommends eating well throughout the day, starting with plenty of protein for breakfast, to counteract fluctuating blood-sugar levels. \u201cThe less you rely on sugar and caffeine to prop you up through the day, the more you are able to go into healthy sleep patterns at night,\u201d she says. Healthy eating, exercise and an evening wind-down produce good sleep, and the vicious circle turns virtuous. Sleep well.",

      "bodyText": "Whether or not Nancy Pelosi is the \u201cabsolute worst speaker of the House in US history\u201d, as Donald Trump insists, the Democrat said on Sunday her caucus will meet on Tuesday to decide when to transmit two articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial. Preparations continue for a piece of pure Washington theatre. Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, which makes Trump only the third president to face trial in the Senate, a process Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton survived. The articles of impeachment were approved before Christmas but Pelosi delayed sending them to the Senate while Democrats sought to negotiate trial rules with Republicans who hold the upper chamber. Democrats want the former national security adviser John Bolton and other key Trump aides to appear as witnesses and new evidence to be presented. Bolton has said he will appear if served with a subpoena. In an interview with Fox News broadcast on Friday night, Trump made clear that he would block such testimony, citing executive privilege. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, remains in lockstep with the White House, saying he has not ruled out new witnesses but emphasising that impeachment is a political rather than a judicial process and promising the case against Trump will quickly be dismissed. Republicans have followed their leader, regardless of the oath they will take to be impartial jurors. Democratic hopes that moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska might force the calling of witnesses seem to have been in vain. \u201cIt\u2019s about a fair trial,\u201d Pelosi told ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday. \u201cThey take an oath to have a fair trial and we think that would be with witnesses and documentation. Now the ball is in their court to either do that or pay a price for not doing that.\u201d Pelosi said McConnell\u2019s behaviour, including signing up to a resolution to dismiss the charges against Trump without a trial, was \u201cvastly unusual\u201d. \u201cDismissing is a cover-up,\u201d she said. The case against Trump is that he abused his power, by seeking investigations in Ukraine regarding a conspiracy theory about election interference and alleged corruption involving former vice-president Joe Biden, and then obstructed Congress in its attempts to investigate the affair. In House hearings, witnesses detailed the withholding of nearly $400m in military aid as well as promises of a White House meeting for Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelinskiy. Bolton, who sought a judge\u2019s opinion on whether he should testify, thereby delaying a decision until the articles were approved, emerged as a key figure. For example, Fiona Hill, a British-born former White House expert on Russia policy, explained how Bolton called efforts towards the Kyiv government by the Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others a \u201cdrug deal\u201d in which he wanted no part. Even if Republicans do allow new witnesses and documentation, a two-thirds majority of 100 senators would be required to remove Trump \u2013 a vastly unlikely outcome. But leading Democrats, among them the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, have pointed to the emergence of new reporting on the Ukraine scandal as a benefit of Pelosi\u2019s delay. Pelosi told ABC: \u201cWe have confidence in our case that this is impeachable and the president is impeached for life, regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell. We\u2019re confident in the impeachment and we think that\u2019s enough testimony to remove [Trump] from office.\u201d On Saturday, Trump claimed \u201cnew polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere\u201d. In fact, most polling shows the US public split. On Saturday a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of Iowa voters, released ahead of the caucuses which kick off the Democratic primary on 3 February, said 45% of voters in the state, of either party, disapproved of the process while 43% approved. Nationally, the polls site fivethirtyeight.com puts support for impeaching Trump at 50.2%, to 46.2% against. Trump spent the weekend presenting his aggressive moves against Iran as a contrast to alleged Democratic inaction domestically. Pelosi \u201cis obsessed with impeachment\u201d, he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cShe has done nothing. She is going to go down as one of the worst speakers in the history of our country. And she\u2019s become a crazed lunatic.\u201d On Sunday, Trump demanded the ABC host George Stephanopoulos \u201cask Crazy Nancy why she allowed Adam \u2018Shifty\u2019 Schiff to totally make up my conversation with the Ukrainian President &amp; read his false words to Congress and the world\u201d. That was a reference to a summary Schiff made at a congressional hearing of a 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelinskiy which sits at the heart of Trump\u2019s impeachment. The president and allies have sought to portray it as an attempt to misrepresent Trump\u2019s words. Opponents say the rough White House version of the call shows Trump engaged in impeachable behaviour. Asked about Trump\u2019s personal attacks, Pelosi told ABC: \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday morning. I\u2019d like to talk about some more pleasant subjects than the erratic nature of this president ... but he has to know that every knock from him is a boost.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t like to spend too much time on his crazy tweets, because everything he says is a projection. When he calls someone crazy, he knows that he is.\u201d Regarding Pelosi\u2019s abilities as speaker, political Twitter lit up with discussion of a man who held the position from 1999 to 2007, Denny Hastert, making him its longest-serving Republican. In 2015, Hastert was sentenced to 15 months in prison for financial crimes related to attempts to cover up his abuse of teenage boys when he was a high-school wrestling coach. Hastert admitted the abuse. A federal judge called him a \u201cserial child molester\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 because the polls site fivethirtyeight.com puts support for impeaching Donald Trump, not removing Trump as an earlier version said, at 50.2%, to 46.2% against.",

He came to power in a bloodless coup that overthrew his father, the increasingly erratic and repressive Sultan Said bin Taimur, in 1970. Despite denials at the time, the Sandhurst-trained Qaboos\u2019s takeover was engineered by his British military advisers in order to avert the disintegration of the oldest independent Arab state (itself a former British protectorate) in the face of a communist insurgency in the southern region of Dhofar.</p> <p>Within five years of Qaboos\u2019s accession, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/britains-secret-wars-oman\" title=\"\">the Dhofar uprising</a> had been put down with the help of troops from Jordan and Iran as well as British special forces. The discovery of significant deposits of oil in the mid-1960s provided Qaboos with the opportunity to fulfil his promise to revitalise the lives of his people.

      "bodyText": "Over the course of nearly five decades, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who has died aged 79 after suffering from cancer, transformed Oman from a backward and isolated country into a prosperous, modern and unified state fully engaged in the Arab region and the wider world. The longest serving Arab ruler, Qaboos was an absolute monarch, albeit a relatively benevolent and popular one. He came to power in a bloodless coup that overthrew his father, the increasingly erratic and repressive Sultan Said bin Taimur, in 1970. Despite denials at the time, the Sandhurst-trained Qaboos\u2019s takeover was engineered by his British military advisers in order to avert the disintegration of the oldest independent Arab state (itself a former British protectorate) in the face of a communist insurgency in the southern region of Dhofar. Within five years of Qaboos\u2019s accession, the Dhofar uprising had been put down with the help of troops from Jordan and Iran as well as British special forces. The discovery of significant deposits of oil in the mid-1960s provided Qaboos with the opportunity to fulfil his promise to revitalise the lives of his people. At the time of his accession, Oman was a country plagued by poverty, illiteracy and disease, with life expectancy in the 40s. Slavery had yet to be abolished and the population was dependent on fishing and subsistence farming. There were only six miles of paved roads in the country. Slavery was outlawed as one of Qaboos\u2019s first acts and today life expectancy is in the mid-70s and literacy rates are close to 90%. Clinics, hospitals, schools and a sports arena, invariably named after the Omani ruler, almost entirely absent before 1970 are now commonplace across the kingdom. Far less impressive was the extent of political change in Oman, where Qaboos retained personal control of all the main government posts and refused to delegate any real power to other members of a royal family that has ruled Oman continuously since 1749. Following unrest inspired by the Arab Spring in 2011, Qaboos removed several long- serving ministers perceived to be corrupt and widened the powers of a consultative council, but political parties and unauthorised public gatherings remained prohibited. Even the US State Department \u2013 hardly Qaboos\u2019s leading critic \u2013 drew attention to the raft of legislation that prohibited any criticism of the sultan and permitted the suppression of views deemed \u201cpolitically objectionable\u201d. Born in Oman\u2019s second city, Salalah, in Dhofar province, Qaboos was the only son of Said, who had come to power eight years previously, and his second wife, Mazoon al-Mashani. Qaboos was educated at a private school in Suffolk and worked briefly for Suffolk county council before entering the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst at the age of 20. After graduating, Qaboos served a year in the British army in Germany. Returning to Oman in the mid-60s, Qaboos was excluded from any role in government by his increasingly troubled father; by the time of the coup that brought him to power in 1970 Qaboos was under virtual house arrest. Qaboos\u2019s accession had relied on British support though, as the new ruler, he soon moved to end the dependence on a British officer corps: by the end of the 70s, Omani officers commanded all infantry units. But this implied no break with Britain: Qaboos remained strongly attached to the UK and the British military. However there was a determined shift to a much more independent and pragmatic foreign policy, encapsulated in the phrase \u201cfriend to all, enemy to no one\u201d. In contrast to his father\u2019s attempt to ignore the rest of the world, Qaboos set out to exploit the power implicit in Oman\u2019s strategically important position at the mouth of the Gulf. Oman joined the Arab League and the United Nations and became a founding member of the Gulf Co-operation Council in 1981. Qaboos established diplomatic relations with both the communist Soviet Union and China, allaying concerns in conservative circles by entering into close military cooperation with the US at the same time.

Qaboos sent Omani soldiers to fight in the US-led coalition. Access to Omani bases also played its part in the US-led invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. Qaboos also exhibited considerable skill in maintaining good relations with Iran, a potentially threatening presence across the Straits of Hormuz.

Even though Oman does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited Muscat in October 2018 to meet Qaboos \u2013 another sign of his resolve to have good relations with all. A renowned patron of the arts, Qaboos created a symphony orchestra and opened a royal opera house in the capital, Muscat, in 2011. He was said to play the organ and the lute. He was also passionate about yachting. His brief marriage to a first cousin ended in divorce in 1979.

      "body": "<p>A hot night in Djibouti City, 5 September, and Mohamud Ali is in disbelief at having just written himself into Somali history. The<strong> </strong>former \u00a350-a-day factory worker was man of the match as his nation beat Zimbabwe 1-0 to record a first World Cup qualifier win.

I was celebrating on the pitch, me and my brother being able to celebrate together was amazing.</p> <p>\u201cThen going back to the hotel in the team bus with music playing, everyone dancing. As soon as you get to the hotel you turned the wifi on and the phone was booming. All night you\u2019re speaking to family back home.\u201d Ali believes Zimbabwe underestimated a young XI that was a mix of diaspora \u2013 a consequence of the troubles at home \u2013 and Somalia\u2011based players. Ahmed Ail was then at Doha\u2019s Pearl FC but is now back in Manchester and a free agent. The match-winner, Anwar, making his debut, is at Elman FC in Somalia\u2019s capital, Mogadishu.</p> <p>Ali says: \u201cWe all just met there and then. Some of the players flew out one day or two days before the game. Some were there already there in the training camp in Djibouti. We arrived at the stadium at the same time as Zimbabwe and could see by the way they were getting off the bus singing, dancing, that they were underestimating us.\u201d</p> <p>Ali\u2019s journey began in the Netherlands after his family fled their country during the civil war that ran from 1991-2006. \u201cMy parents are Somalian but I was born and raised in Netherlands,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got two older siblings who were born in Somalia but there was a war going so we had to leave and we decided to go to Holland. I played there for a season semi-pro, made my first-team debut for Alphense Boys,\u201d he says of the club located in Alphen aan den Rijn in the western Netherlands. \u201cThen we came to Manchester seven years ago, when I was 18.\u201d</p> <p>Ali talks of a drive to better himself. \u201cThe first six months I wasn\u2019t playing, it was very tough,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I signed for Northwich Victoria and in my second season had my debut for Somalia \u2013 in 2015, against Niger. But when I came back I struggled to get back into the team. Then the manager [Jim Gannon] left for Stockport County and you know how it goes with football. So at the end of that season I signed for Glossop North End.\u201d</p> <p>Ali also faced a fight to find employment. \u201cThe qualifications I had back home, I couldn\u2019t transfer them so I had to do GCSEs, start all over again. I was at college and I decided to try and just get a job and play football, so I started working at a factory for a guy I know and playing non-league. I was packing and sending stuff out for \u00a350 a day.</p> <p>\u201cI was only working on Sundays initially and getting paid from football as well, so I had \u00a3150 a week. It wasn\u2019t a lot but I was living at home with my parents. I was going to the gym nearly every day, trying to get higher up the ladder. Then one of my friends, who owns a driving school, said: \u2018I\u2019ve got this opportunity for you. Are you interested?\u2019 I\u2019m thinking: \u2018I\u2019m only getting one day a week at the factory, I\u2019ve nothing to lose,\u2019 and I was trying to pursue a career in football and it\u2019s quite a flexible job.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f30febd5f437b534fb684f4d9e33dd31fd52d24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f30febd5f437b534fb684f4d9e33dd31fd52d24/0_412_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamud Ali played for Curzon Ashton one day after returning from the qualifier with Somalia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamud Ali played for Curzon Ashton one day after returning from the qualifier with Somalia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Four years on Ali remains content. \u201cI still enjoy what I\u2019m doing but at this time I\u2019m focusing more on football,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After the victory against Zimbabwe there was a harsh return to reality. \u201cI came back on the Friday and on Saturday we had a game but I didn\u2019t expect to be playing,\u201d he says. \u201cI was knackered and we got beat 4-0 but I got man of the match.</p> <p>\u201cI then rested, saw my family but on my second day back working I had a new client, who said: \u2018Are you a footballer?\u2019 I said: \u2018I literally just came back from international duty. I play for Somalia.\u2019 And he knew the captain from Zimbabwe, Alec Mudimu, who lives in Manchester.</p> <p>\u201cHe goes: \u2018You played against Alec? I was watching the game. I can\u2019t believe my driving instructor is a footballer.\u2019 It was funny.

I played there for a season semi-pro, made my first-team debut for Alphense Boys,\u201d he says of the club located in Alphen aan den Rijn in the western Netherlands. \u201cThen we came to Manchester seven years ago, when I was 18.\u201d Ali talks of a drive to better himself. \u201cThe first six months I wasn\u2019t playing, it was very tough,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I signed for Northwich Victoria and in my second season had my debut for Somalia \u2013 in 2015, against Niger. But when I came back I struggled to get back into the team. Then the manager [Jim Gannon] left for Stockport County and you know how it goes with football. So at the end of that season I signed for Glossop North End.\u201d Ali also faced a fight to find employment. \u201cThe qualifications I had back home, I couldn\u2019t transfer them so I had to do GCSEs, start all over again. I was at college and I decided to try and just get a job and play football, so I started working at a factory for a guy I know and playing non-league. I was packing and sending stuff out for \u00a350 a day. \u201cI was only working on Sundays initially and getting paid from football as well, so I had \u00a3150 a week. It wasn\u2019t a lot but I was living at home with my parents. I was going to the gym nearly every day, trying to get higher up the ladder. Then one of my friends, who owns a driving school, said: \u2018I\u2019ve got this opportunity for you. Are you interested?\u2019 I\u2019m thinking: \u2018I\u2019m only getting one day a week at the factory, I\u2019ve nothing to lose,\u2019 and I was trying to pursue a career in football and it\u2019s quite a flexible job.\u201d Four years on Ali remains content. \u201cI still enjoy what I\u2019m doing but at this time I\u2019m focusing more on football,\u201d he says. After the victory against Zimbabwe there was a harsh return to reality. \u201cI came back on the Friday and on Saturday we had a game but I didn\u2019t expect to be playing,\u201d he says. \u201cI was knackered and we got beat 4-0 but I got man of the match. \u201cI then rested, saw my family but on my second day back working I had a new client, who said: \u2018Are you a footballer?\u2019 I said: \u2018I literally just came back from international duty. I play for Somalia.\u2019 And he knew the captain from Zimbabwe, Alec Mudimu, who lives in Manchester. \u201cHe goes: \u2018You played against Alec? I was watching the game. I can\u2019t believe my driving instructor is a footballer.\u2019 It was funny. Other students messaged me while I was there saying: \u2018Amazing, I\u2019ve seen you on the BBC, congratulations.\u2019 \u201cThat was nice. You realise how big your achievement was. It was massive and people back home are saying you are a legend. I\u2019ve never been to Somalia but I know if I do go I\u2019d be welcome. I\u2019ve got family that have moved back and they\u2019re saying it\u2019s fine but we hear stories of suicide attacks, bombings, stuff like that so I wouldn\u2019t go back just yet myself. \u201cMy mum was so proud \u2013 speaking to me and my brother after the game. Honestly, they\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices leaving Somalia to give us a better life and to be able to celebrate this with my family was sweet.\u201d Somalia lost the return leg 3-1 in Zimbabwe, conceding two late goals, and so were knocked out. But Ali can always be proud of his role in a moment that will remembered for a long time in his country.",

They just wanted to make life easier for themselves. \u201cWhen we started to do shows,\u201d says guitarist Prateek Raj Neupane, \u201cour playing skills were at an amateur level. And the instruments we had were amateurish. And the sound didn\u2019t come out good. We couldn\u2019t explain what we wanted to sound engineers at shows, so we thought maybe we should do a record and give it to them so they could fix our sound. And that\u2019s how we ended up recording the first-ever metal record in Nepal.\u201d</p> <p>That was in 2000 and the recording \u2013 the magnificently titled demo Himalayan Metal of Death, featuring a song called Perversion or Cutting Up of a Human Body &amp; Eating Some of It \u2013 wasn\u2019t made for general release. \u201cWe were thinking about bringing out three copies only, for the three people who recorded it. We would lend one to sound engineers at gigs. But our friends were adamant on us at least making 100 copies. We brought one of our friends\u2019 father\u2019s office printers to my home, made our own design and printed it.\u201d The Nepali metal underground was born.</p> <p>Back then, it was so underground that Ugra Karma, who were without a drummer, couldn\u2019t even explain what death metal was to whoever filled in on the drum stool. \u201cWe would ask, \u2018Do you play double bass drums?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the high-speed pummelling that powers death metal along. \u201cThey would tell us something like that didn\u2019t even exist. So we switched instruments between songs. In one, I would do guitar and vocals, my friend would do bass, the other would do drums. But because we are not real drummers, we would get tired, so then I would go to drums and the other one would go to guitars.

I am still on parole.\u201d</p> <p>This is the world in which the eighth edition of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SilenceFestival/\">Silence festival</a> exists. Nepal\u2019s biggest metal event, established by Bikrant Shestra of the band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN-zMacV5Q4\">Underside</a>, is tiny by western standards: it takes place in two courtyards of a small hotel and restaurant complex in Kathmandu. But for Nepali metal, to have 1,500 or so fans in one place to watch a succession of bands across two stages one Saturday in mid-December is huge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28ea92f45cc82fdc301c149683f124dd78a1c328\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28ea92f45cc82fdc301c149683f124dd78a1c328/0_0_10795_3787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The hills are alive with the sound of metal \u2026 sunset over Kathmandu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hills are alive with the sound of metal \u2026 sunset over Kathmandu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Jedraszak/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are local groups \u2013 the excellent stoner rock trio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-F8monPH8Y\">Shree 3</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYyLgZSx_U\">Born in Silence</a>, who owe such a debt (visually and sonically) to one particular band that they might as well be called KnotSlip; grindcore band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiCHamr_hkM\">Chepang</a>, who have three singers, two drummers and no bassist; Prateek\u2019s other death metal band, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTpkwALLFOQ\">Binaash</a>; and Underside themselves. There are bands from around Asia. And there is a big-name headliner: Californian thrash veterans <a href=\"http://www.testamentlegions.com/\">Testament</a>.</p> <p>The day before Silence, though, there\u2019s a sense of nervousness. It has been raining hard in Kathmandu, which means the site isn\u2019t ready. Driving round the city, the surrounding mountains hidden from view by the lowering clouds and the traffic jostling on rutted and puddled roads, it\u2019s hard to imagine how anyone could make a festival work here. And, as Underside\u2019s singer Avishek KC explains, Nepal has a pay-on-the-day culture, and if the rain stays, the fans won\u2019t come. What\u2019s more, Testament\u2019s fee alone accounts for more than the ticket revenue a sold-out event will bring, a situation made more worrying by the fact that one of the biggest sponsors has halved its funding. Worse still, Underside \u2013 the most popular metal band in Nepal \u2013 can\u2019t even play their own festival: their drummer lives in Assam, in India, and can\u2019t leave his girlfriend\u2019s home because of the civil unrest there. There is gunfire outside the house and flights have been suspended.</p> <p>Silence is clearly not going to make its organisers rich. Festival director Flower KC, who also manages Underside, reckons this one will lose \u00a325,000, all covered by him and his friends. \u201cThe idea is guided by the idea that why should it be only mountaineers or hippies who come to Nepal?\u201d Flower says. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we attract a different breed of people? My goal is to make Nepal a heavy metal destination. Testament came to play purely because it was in Kathmandu \u2013 I hung out with them and they were stoked to be here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c22d81a8d7417f955712565d3a97170ce0db94f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c22d81a8d7417f955712565d3a97170ce0db94f3/195_11_2439_3049/800.jpg\" alt=\"Patched up \u2026 a Napalm Death fan at the festival.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patched up \u2026 a Napalm Death fan at the festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Hann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFast forward 10 to 15 years, my dream is that our festival makes music fans want to travel to Nepal to see the sickest bands.\u201d But he needs international sponsorship. \u201cWe don\u2019t have infinite money, and sponsorship games are pretty weird in this country.\u201d</p> <p>While the people who run the festival might be middle-class by Nepali standards, they are not in western terms \u2013 all the Nepali metal musicians have other jobs. Prateek plays guitar in two bands, teaches leadership to management students in college, and acts in Nepali movies; Flower, who lives in the UK, works in local government in London.</p> <p>Money matters here. \u201cIf you want to see real Nepal, you have to step out of the city,\u201d Avishek says. \u201cAnd people in the villages \u2013 until two years ago, you had all these power cut-offs, 18 hours a day without power. So people didn\u2019t even have a choice to listen to music.\u201d Prateek adds: \u201cWorking class here means something very different from England. They are so busy trying to get food and shelter for today that they do not have the luxury to come to gigs and listen to music and, in their terms, waste time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Make the tickets expensive. People need to learn that gigs cost</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being middle class, and having other avenues open to them, few metal bands last long \u2013 and fans don\u2019t tend to stick with the scene far into their 20s. \u201cThey will regularly follow metal up to college,\u201d says Vishal Rai. \u201cBut after college, they will get pressure from society and family to find a job. After college, they mostly follow a different lifestyle. But there are a few people who always stick to metal, like me. I\u2019m very old to be into this stuff \u2013 I am 35.\u201d</p> <p>Having such a young scene is healthy in some ways, Prateek says. There are always young bands and fresh fans coming along. But because the scene is so young, no one has their own money, which means ticket prices have stayed low for 20 years, making it impossible for bands to even cover their costs.</p> <p>\u201cMake the tickets expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cForget that 100 rupee [\u00a31] bullshit. Make it 1,000. People need to learn that gigs are expensive. And there is a reason for that. If you hire a sound system, it will cost you. The venue will charge you. The venue gets paid, the sound system gets paid. But the bands \u2013 who are the core of the show, who the people come to see \u2013 aren\u2019t paid.\u201d Avishek notes that Underside, who can draw 800 people in Kathmandu, charged an unprecedented price for their last headline show: 500 rupees. A fiver, in British money.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKJCU2ldOvY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EKJCU2ldOvY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a video of Underside performing Disconnect</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Despite overnight storms, Saturday dawns clear. In the early morning, women are at the city\u2019s wells, taking advantage of the good weather to get their washing done. Worshippers are making their clockwise walks around the roadside shrines that dot the city. And at the festival site, volunteers, having been unable to work the previous day, frantically pull everything together. Silence kicks off just a few minutes late and the crowd swells as the afternoon wears on. The majority of fans are local, with a few Europeans and Americans. One Peace Corps worker, who has come in from out of town, is sporting a T-shirt from the recent Extreme Gore Fest III event. When he went in the pit there, he says, everyone fled because he was twice their height and they thought he\u2019d crush them.</p> <p>The whole thing is fabulous: supremely good-natured and cooperative. There are local oddities: instead of the battle jackets \u2013 sleeveless denim covered with patches beloved of western metalheads \u2013 a fair few of the fans have sewn a big patch on to the back of a piece of entirely unmetal clothing. I see a Napalm Death patch on the back of a plaid shirt, though I\u2019m not sure the lad who has attached a Pantera patch to the back of his waterproof has done its weather-resistant qualities any good. Best of all, Underside get their moment of glory after all. On learning of their drummer-less state, Testament\u2019s Gene Hoglan \u2013 a legend in thrash metal \u2013 volunteers to spend the afternoon learning four songs so they can play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7tPS4RVJ4k\">a short set</a>. Avishek is almost shaking with excitement when he tells me. \u201cGene Hoglan is going to play with Underside! Gene fucking Hoglan!\u201d</p> <p>After night falls, Testament take to the stage, the biggest metal band ever to have come to Nepal. Their singer, Chuck Billy, surveys the crowd. He\u2019s played to thousands of audiences, most bigger than this, but I\u2019ve rarely seen a man look so delighted to be fronting a band. \u201cHow are you fucking doing?\u201d he shouts, then pauses to laugh. \u201cKathmandu?\u201d And he shakes his head in disbelief.</p>",

Festival director Flower KC, who also manages Underside, reckons this one will lose \u00a325,000, all covered by him and his friends. \u201cThe idea is guided by the idea that why should it be only mountaineers or hippies who come to Nepal?\u201d Flower says. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we attract a different breed of people? My goal is to make Nepal a heavy metal destination. Testament came to play purely because it was in Kathmandu \u2013 I hung out with them and they were stoked to be here. \u201cFast forward 10 to 15 years, my dream is that our festival makes music fans want to travel to Nepal to see the sickest bands.\u201d But he needs international sponsorship. \u201cWe don\u2019t have infinite money, and sponsorship games are pretty weird in this country.\u201d While the people who run the festival might be middle-class by Nepali standards, they are not in western terms \u2013 all the Nepali metal musicians have other jobs. Prateek plays guitar in two bands, teaches leadership to management students in college, and acts in Nepali movies; Flower, who lives in the UK, works in local government in London. Money matters here. \u201cIf you want to see real Nepal, you have to step out of the city,\u201d Avishek says. \u201cAnd people in the villages \u2013 until two years ago, you had all these power cut-offs, 18 hours a day without power. So people didn\u2019t even have a choice to listen to music.\u201d Prateek adds: \u201cWorking class here means something very different from England. They are so busy trying to get food and shelter for today that they do not have the luxury to come to gigs and listen to music and, in their terms, waste time.\u201d Being middle class, and having other avenues open to them, few metal bands last long \u2013 and fans don\u2019t tend to stick with the scene far into their 20s. \u201cThey will regularly follow metal up to college,\u201d says Vishal Rai. \u201cBut after college, they will get pressure from society and family to find a job. After college, they mostly follow a different lifestyle. But there are a few people who always stick to metal, like me. I\u2019m very old to be into this stuff \u2013 I am 35.\u201d Having such a young scene is healthy in some ways, Prateek says. There are always young bands and fresh fans coming along. But because the scene is so young, no one has their own money, which means ticket prices have stayed low for 20 years, making it impossible for bands to even cover their costs. \u201cMake the tickets expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cForget that 100 rupee [\u00a31] bullshit. Make it 1,000. People need to learn that gigs are expensive. And there is a reason for that. If you hire a sound system, it will cost you. The venue will charge you. The venue gets paid, the sound system gets paid. But the bands \u2013 who are the core of the show, who the people come to see \u2013 aren\u2019t paid.\u201d Avishek notes that Underside, who can draw 800 people in Kathmandu, charged an unprecedented price for their last headline show: 500 rupees. A fiver, in British money. Despite overnight storms, Saturday dawns clear. In the early morning, women are at the city\u2019s wells, taking advantage of the good weather to get their washing done. Worshippers are making their clockwise walks around the roadside shrines that dot the city. And at the festival site, volunteers, having been unable to work the previous day, frantically pull everything together. Silence kicks off just a few minutes late and the crowd swells as the afternoon wears on. The majority of fans are local, with a few Europeans and Americans. One Peace Corps worker, who has come in from out of town, is sporting a T-shirt from the recent Extreme Gore Fest III event. When he went in the pit there, he says, everyone fled because he was twice their height and they thought he\u2019d crush them. The whole thing is fabulous: supremely good-natured and cooperative. There are local oddities: instead of the battle jackets \u2013 sleeveless denim covered with patches beloved of western metalheads \u2013 a fair few of the fans have sewn a big patch on to the back of a piece of entirely unmetal clothing. I see a Napalm Death patch on the back of a plaid shirt, though I\u2019m not sure the lad who has attached a Pantera patch to the back of his waterproof has done its weather-resistant qualities any good. Best of all, Underside get their moment of glory after all. On learning of their drummer-less state, Testament\u2019s Gene Hoglan \u2013 a legend in thrash metal \u2013 volunteers to spend the afternoon learning four songs so they can play a short set. Avishek is almost shaking with excitement when he tells me. \u201cGene Hoglan is going to play with Underside! Gene fucking Hoglan!\u201d After night falls, Testament take to the stage, the biggest metal band ever to have come to Nepal. Their singer, Chuck Billy, surveys the crowd. He\u2019s played to thousands of audiences, most bigger than this, but I\u2019ve rarely seen a man look so delighted to be fronting a band. \u201cHow are you fucking doing?\u201d he shouts, then pauses to laugh. \u201cKathmandu?\u201d And he shakes his head in disbelief.",

      "body": "<p>When sibling film-makers Josh and Benny Safdie were developing the script for <em>Uncut Gems</em>, their new film set in the shadier recesses of the New York jewellery trade, they scoured their native city for inspiration. For their protagonist, Howard Ratner, a risk-craving gemstone dealer played by Adam Sandler, they drew on stories their father used to tell from his time working in Manhattan\u2019s Diamond District.</p> <p>For Ratner\u2019s girlfriend and partner-in-crime, Julia, the Safdies took a more direct approach: they based the character on a young New York socialite named Julia Fox, whom they met in the early 2010s. A glamorous fixture of the downtown club scene, Fox was running a minimalist fashion label and posting revealing videos of herself on the social media platform Vine. So closely did the Safdies mirror her in the character of Julia that, when they sent Fox a script a year later asking her to play the part, her first question was: \u201cHave you been spying on me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of similarities,\u201d says Fox down the line from Los Angeles. \u201cEven in the character description, I was kind of like: \u2018<em>This</em> is a little familiar.\u2019 It was pretty spot-on.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, the film kept getting pushed back. But the Safdies\u2019 profile was raised by 2014\u2019s harrowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/01/heaven-knows-what-review-arielle-holmes\" title=\"\"><em>Heaven Knows What</em></a>, and then went sky-high after they released the thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/19/good-time-robert-pattinson-excels-electrifying-urban-thriller\" title=\"\"><em>Good Time</em></a>, starring Robert Pattinson, in 2017 (the<em> New Yorker</em> called it \u201can instant crime classic in the age of Trump\u201d). As as result, when <em>Uncut Gems</em> finally came around, Fox\u2019s claim on the role had become tentative. The fact that she had never acted before didn\u2019t bother the Safdies, who enjoy casting first-timers in their films. But this production was much bigger than before, with heavyweight producers on board including Martin Scorsese and Scott Rudin, and the brothers were under pressure to find a bigger name.</p> <p>\u201cThey auditioned about 300 girls,\u201d says Fox. \u201cI heard Lady Gaga\u2019s name thrown around. I heard Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansson. I think at one point I even heard Kim Kardashian, though I never asked because I didn\u2019t want to put myself in an uncomfortable position where I would be obsessing over it and doing the compare-and-contrast thing.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovoJXdtPB-o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ovoJXdtPB-o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovoJXdtPB-o\">Watch a trailer for Uncut Gems</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But she was determined to make the role her own. Not all aspects of the character were identical \u2013 Fox had never worked as a Diamond District shop assistant, nor had she used her seductive powers to get famous musicians to buy jewellery \u2013 but the parallels were clear. \u201cBeing independent, resilient, being a hustler, having a ride-or-die mentality, and overall just being really cute\u201d: these qualities, says Fox, were shared by both Julias.</p> <p>This unabashed way of talking about herself, verging on brash, seems characteristic of Fox, who later in our conversation declares that, at 28, she has outgrown New York, which she describes as a \u201csmall town\u201d. But she can be sweetly self-doubting too, confessing to nerves on set and berating herself for playing it safe when she made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjMg2e2e1qE\" title=\"\">her chat-show debut on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em></a> last month.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of an extroverted introvert,\u201d she says. \u201cI do really well in social situations, but I have a tendency to isolate. I think it\u2019s what makes me an interesting person.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s what attracted the Safdies to her, this mix of assertiveness and vulnerability. To convince the studios of Fox\u2019s rightness for the role, they got her to do a scene with Sandler at a New York department store \u2013 \u201cWe were arguing over a dress he was buying me: I wanted the more expensive, better dress and he wanted the cheaper, not-as-nice dress\u201d \u2013 and a karaoke scene where she sang Wicked Game by Chris Isaak. \u201cI was really nervous about that,\u201d she says. \u201cSinging in public is already kind of nerve-racking. But I do love karaoke and Josh thought I would really shine.\u201d</p> <p>She secured the part, though it took her a while to settle. \u201cI was nervous the first day because I was like: what if I tricked all these people into thinking I can do this, and then they yell \u2018action!\u2019, and I have no idea how to act?\u201d she says. \u201cI only slept one hour the night before, but it kind of helped, because in the scene Julia hasn\u2019t slept \u2013 she went out partying and didn\u2019t come to work on time \u2013 and everyone loved it. After that I felt so much better.\u201d</p> <p>Some early viewers of <em>Uncut Gems</em>, which follows Sandler\u2019s character through a series of increasingly high-stakes gambles, have compared it to a cocaine rush; one critic for <em>Variety</em> described the film as \u201ca protracted heart attack\u201d. Given the Safdies\u2019 penchant for shooting on the hoof, without permits where possible, it would figure if the production had been stressful too, but according to Fox it was easy and fun. \u201cI just felt like I was making a movie with my friends.\u201d</p> <p>She enjoyed working with Canadian R&amp;B megastar the Weeknd, with whom she shares an intimate scene in a nightclub, and retired basketball giant Kevin Garnett, whose obsession with an Ethiopian black opal sends Howard, and the film, into overdrive. \u201cWe were both first -time actors, so we had that bond,\u201d Fox says of Garnett. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be lifelong friends.\u201d</p> <p>It helped that Sandler, playing against type \u2013 ie not playing a man-boy in a goofy comedy \u2013 seemed a little anxious too. \u201cSo we were both nervous,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe just really lightened the mood and made the experience so fun and not intimidating. He has a very warm, welcoming energy.\u201d</p> <p>Some viewers have wondered how anyone could put up with the manic, spectacularly irresponsible lowlife that Sandler portrays in the film, but Fox can understand what Julia sees in Howard Ratner. \u201cThey\u2019re both broken people who feel alone in the world. When you\u2019re addicted to something like gambling and you\u2019re always ripping off everyone and everyone is just an opportunity, it makes you feel kind of alone. But with Julia, he doesn\u2019t feel that way \u2013 they\u2019re both able to be vulnerable with each other. And he\u2019s charming and manipulative and so is she.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d55b2b5dc734d5510944fb0a3dd55ec5ab0b785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d55b2b5dc734d5510944fb0a3dd55ec5ab0b785/0_0_3000_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Fox in Uncut Gems.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Fox in Uncut Gems.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has she ever met anyone like Howard before, or indeed dated anyone like him?</p> <p>She splutters. \u201cI would never date anyone like that. That\u2019s also where the character and I differ. But I\u2019ve definitely met people like that \u2013 there\u2019s so many people like that in New York.\u201d</p> <p>With her languid drawl punctuated with kind-of-likes and you-knows and her worldly, seen-it-all-before attitude, Fox comes across as a consummate New Yorker, a Manhattanite to the core. In fact, she was born in Italy, spending her first few years with her Italian mother in the town of Saronno outside Milan. \u201cI lived mostly with my grandpa,\u201d she says. \u201cHe took care of us while my mom was in university getting her degree.\u201d</p> <p>Moving to Manhattan aged five to live with her American father was a culture shock, she says, though she soon found her feet. Her dad was extremely laissez-faire \u2013 \u201che always treated me as an adult, even as a child,\u201d she recalls \u2013 and as a teenager Fox ran wild. \u201cVery, very wild,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t come home for days. And I was allowed to do that. I think my dad was relieved that I was out of the house.\u201d</p> <p>What was she getting up to?</p> <p>\u201cHanging out at friends\u2019 houses,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then we would go sneak into clubs \u2013 we all had fake IDs. It was New York, so you hung out in staircases and rooftops.\u201d</p> <p>Aged 17, Fox overdosed and says she had a near-death experience \u2013 she saw a tunnel of light and felt her spirit lifting out of her body. \u201cIt was after a night out and I really blacked out,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened but I remember afterwards just feeling so different, like something changed.\u201d</p> <p>Something inside her had changed?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I became like a straight-A student,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very spiritual, like an awakening. Being saved. It really felt like a divine intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Did the partying tail off a bit after that?</p> <p>\u201cTotally, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>Work filled the gap. When asked what she gets up to for fun, Fox says she loves going to the movies, writing and spending time with friends, \u201cand running errands. I\u2019m really big on running errands.\u201d</p> <p>Running errands?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, getting things done. I\u2019m just a doer. I like to stay busy. I think boredom is my number one enemy. I always need to be stimulated or feel like I\u2019m accomplishing something, whether it be small or big. I\u2019m a big list girl. If I don\u2019t have a list, I\u2019m totally lost. \u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In life, I don\u2019t play it safe. I put everything out there. I\u2019ve always done whatever I wanted to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She\u2019s also restless. After dropping out of a media studies degree at the New School university in New York, and then tiring of the fashion world, Fox dabbled in art and photography, putting on a 2017 show entitled RIP Julia Fox, featuring images of mutilated women drawn on silk using her own blood. It was partly inspired by her near-death experience, she said at the time, though Fox\u2019s interest in bodily extremes goes further back. When she was 18 and not yet out of high school, she got a job as a dominatrix in a dungeon in the East Village. (There was no nudity or penetration involved, <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/coolest-person-julia-fox-2641229503.html\" title=\"\">she made clear in a recent interview</a>, just role-play.)</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a ballsy thing to do as a teenager,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the youngest person there by far. It was nice, because I was kind of like the baby and everyone took care of me. It felt like I had a family unit, with a bunch of sisters. I\u2019d only ever really been around boys or men, having grown up with my dad and my brother, so it was nice to have that female energy that had been lacking in my life. And I\u2019ve been a girl\u2019s girl ever since. I don\u2019t think I have one guy friend who\u2019s not gay.\u201d</p> <p>Considering her rich portfolio of jobs and life experiences, Fox feels frustrated that her \u201creal personality didn\u2019t really shine through\u201d on her slightly awkward, tongue-tied appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show.</p> <p>So what did we not see?</p> <p>\u201cIn life, I don\u2019t play it safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI always put everything out there, and I\u2019m shameless. I\u2019ve always done whatever I wanted to do, and I think that intimidates people \u2013 whether it was publishing my very personal art book, or creating a fashion line, or even making this movie having never acted before and not knowing if I would be good at it or how it would be received.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f9a0c9d4f1e994e3b3cd0a6fc193c3628603c2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f9a0c9d4f1e994e3b3cd0a6fc193c3628603c2f/0_0_5077_3385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fox at a Moschino show in New York, December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fox at a Moschino show in New York, December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lexie Moreland/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it turns out, Fox is very good in the film, radiating brassy, sexy attitude even as the cracks in Julia\u2019s tough facade begin to show. (The performance earned her a breakthrough actor nomination at the Gotham awards in October.) The Safdies gave her plenty of creative licence to make the character properly her own, she says. \u201cThey really wanted it to feel real and believable, so everyone was allowed to freestyle a bit.\u201d One scene, in which Julia reveals to a crisis-stricken Howard that she\u2019s had his name tattooed on her back, was suggested by Fox, who had a similar experience with a boyfriend, whose name she had tattooed on her ring finger after a blow-up to show her commitment.</p> <p>The appetite for creating dramatic narratives, as well as acting in them, has been building inside Fox for some time. Last year, before her role in <em>Uncut Gems</em> was confirmed, she went to Reno, Nevada, to direct a short film with a friend. They didn\u2019t go with a firm plan in mind. Instead, she says, \u201cWe knew that there was a story there and we were going to uncover it. And then, immediately upon entering the city, we met all these kids on the side of the highway and I just knew that this was going to be where my story was.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the children\u2019s parents, she learned that Reno was rife with drug use, crime and sex work. \u201cThere are girls going missing all the time,\u201d she says. In the film, entitled <em>Fantasy Girls</em>, four teenage girls risk their lives to attend a talent show while a kidnapper is on the loose. Shooting it was a revelatory experience. \u201cI realised, this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I finally found it after trying my hand at so many different things.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, though, Fox wants to capitalise on the buzz around <em>Uncut Gems</em>, which has intensified since its premiere at the Telluride film festival last August. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/uncut-gems-review-the-fateful-lure-of-chaos-11576185504\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street Journal </em>said of it</a>: \u201cEverything is simultaneously terrifying, horrifying and mesmerising ... <em>Uncut Gems</em> is a dark sparkler.\u201d (It may be too intense to get Oscar recognition, says Fox, but she hopes the Academy will keep an open mind.) In November, she signed with the talent agency WME, which will mean leaving \u201csmall town\u201d New York for the wide-open expanses of Hollywood. \u201cWorking as an actress, I\u2019ll be able to learn more about the film-making process,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the immediate future is acting, but my long term is definitely writing, directing and producing.\u201d</p> <p>Destiny, she believes, has had a hand in getting her to this point. \u201cEven if things didn\u2019t go how I had envisioned them, but went another way, that other way was how they were supposed to go,\u201d she says. The route \u2013 from city rooftops to East Village dungeons, fashion shows to garish jewellery shops \u2013 may have been circuitous and occasionally hazardous, but it\u2019s all part of a bigger plan. \u201cThe universe has a funny way of making sense at the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p><em>Uncut Gems is in selected UK cinemas </em><em>now</em><em> and on Netflix from </em><em>31</em><em> January</em>.</p>",

I think my dad was relieved that I was out of the house.\u201d What was she getting up to? \u201cHanging out at friends\u2019 houses,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then we would go sneak into clubs \u2013 we all had fake IDs. It was New York, so you hung out in staircases and rooftops.\u201d Aged 17, Fox overdosed and says she had a near-death experience \u2013 she saw a tunnel of light and felt her spirit lifting out of her body. \u201cIt was after a night out and I really blacked out,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened but I remember afterwards just feeling so different, like something changed.\u201d Something inside her had changed? \u201cYeah, I became like a straight-A student,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very spiritual, like an awakening. Being saved. It really felt like a divine intervention.\u201d Did the partying tail off a bit after that? \u201cTotally, yeah.\u201d Work filled the gap. When asked what she gets up to for fun, Fox says she loves going to the movies, writing and spending time with friends, \u201cand running errands. I\u2019m really big on running errands.\u201d Running errands? \u201cYeah, getting things done. I\u2019m just a doer. I like to stay busy. I think boredom is my number one enemy. I always need to be stimulated or feel like I\u2019m accomplishing something, whether it be small or big. I\u2019m a big list girl. If I don\u2019t have a list, I\u2019m totally lost. \u201d She\u2019s also restless. After dropping out of a media studies degree at the New School university in New York, and then tiring of the fashion world, Fox dabbled in art and photography, putting on a 2017 show entitled RIP Julia Fox, featuring images of mutilated women drawn on silk using her own blood. It was partly inspired by her near-death experience, she said at the time, though Fox\u2019s interest in bodily extremes goes further back. When she was 18 and not yet out of high school, she got a job as a dominatrix in a dungeon in the East Village. (There was no nudity or penetration involved, she made clear in a recent interview, just role-play.) \u201cThat\u2019s a ballsy thing to do as a teenager,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the youngest person there by far. It was nice, because I was kind of like the baby and everyone took care of me. It felt like I had a family unit, with a bunch of sisters. I\u2019d only ever really been around boys or men, having grown up with my dad and my brother, so it was nice to have that female energy that had been lacking in my life. And I\u2019ve been a girl\u2019s girl ever since. I don\u2019t think I have one guy friend who\u2019s not gay.\u201d Considering her rich portfolio of jobs and life experiences, Fox feels frustrated that her \u201creal personality didn\u2019t really shine through\u201d on her slightly awkward, tongue-tied appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show. So what did we not see? \u201cIn life, I don\u2019t play it safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI always put everything out there, and I\u2019m shameless. I\u2019ve always done whatever I wanted to do, and I think that intimidates people \u2013 whether it was publishing my very personal art book, or creating a fashion line, or even making this movie having never acted before and not knowing if I would be good at it or how it would be received.\u201d As it turns out, Fox is very good in the film, radiating brassy, sexy attitude even as the cracks in Julia\u2019s tough facade begin to show. (The performance earned her a breakthrough actor nomination at the Gotham awards in October.) The Safdies gave her plenty of creative licence to make the character properly her own, she says. \u201cThey really wanted it to feel real and believable, so everyone was allowed to freestyle a bit.\u201d One scene, in which Julia reveals to a crisis-stricken Howard that she\u2019s had his name tattooed on her back, was suggested by Fox, who had a similar experience with a boyfriend, whose name she had tattooed on her ring finger after a blow-up to show her commitment. The appetite for creating dramatic narratives, as well as acting in them, has been building inside Fox for some time. Last year, before her role in Uncut Gems was confirmed, she went to Reno, Nevada, to direct a short film with a friend. They didn\u2019t go with a firm plan in mind. Instead, she says, \u201cWe knew that there was a story there and we were going to uncover it. And then, immediately upon entering the city, we met all these kids on the side of the highway and I just knew that this was going to be where my story was.\u201d Speaking to the children\u2019s parents, she learned that Reno was rife with drug use, crime and sex work. \u201cThere are girls going missing all the time,\u201d she says. In the film, entitled Fantasy Girls, four teenage girls risk their lives to attend a talent show while a kidnapper is on the loose. Shooting it was a revelatory experience. \u201cI realised, this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I finally found it after trying my hand at so many different things.\u201d Right now, though, Fox wants to capitalise on the buzz around Uncut Gems, which has intensified since its premiere at the Telluride film festival last August. The Wall Street Journal said of it: \u201cEverything is simultaneously terrifying, horrifying and mesmerising ... Uncut Gems is a dark sparkler.\u201d (It may be too intense to get Oscar recognition, says Fox, but she hopes the Academy will keep an open mind.) In November, she signed with the talent agency WME, which will mean leaving \u201csmall town\u201d New York for the wide-open expanses of Hollywood. \u201cWorking as an actress, I\u2019ll be able to learn more about the film-making process,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the immediate future is acting, but my long term is definitely writing, directing and producing.\u201d Destiny, she believes, has had a hand in getting her to this point. \u201cEven if things didn\u2019t go how I had envisioned them, but went another way, that other way was how they were supposed to go,\u201d she says. The route \u2013 from city rooftops to East Village dungeons, fashion shows to garish jewellery shops \u2013 may have been circuitous and occasionally hazardous, but it\u2019s all part of a bigger plan. \u201cThe universe has a funny way of making sense at the end of the day.\u201d Uncut Gems is in selected UK cinemas now and on Netflix from 31 January.",

It is the only one with no permanent speed traps, it is the site of the country\u2019s largest reservoir, and it has a castle that\u2019s no bigger than many church halls. And it is the last county in England with no McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, or KFC \u2013 yet.</p> <p>That could be about to change, with councillors set to decide on Tuesday on an application for a new McDonald\u2019s. Planning officers have already recommended that councillors approve the application, advising that the development will \u201cnot have an adverse impact on \u2026 the character of the surrounding area\u201d.</p> <p>But it is a move that has divided opinion in Oakham, the well-to-do county town of Rutland, on the edge of which the restaurant is due to be built. A planning consultation has so far had 78 responses, with 55 against.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/18/rutland-county-mcdonalds-burgers-uk\">Residents opposing the plan</a> online cite fears of an increase in litter, a negative impact on the pubs and restaurants in the town, and even that the new drive-through will cause a drop in house prices. But residents who spoke to the Guardian on the streets of Oakham were more evenly split, with many speaking up for the plan.</p> <p>Oakham is a picturesque town of stone and brick that already hosts a large number of cafes and restaurants.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s last county without a McDonald\u2019s is set to decide on a plan for a new 24-hour drive-through restaurant this week, in the face of staunch opposition from some locals who fear that it will ruin their area\u2019s unique charm. The historic county of Rutland is England\u2019s smallest. It is the only one with no permanent speed traps, it is the site of the country\u2019s largest reservoir, and it has a castle that\u2019s no bigger than many church halls. And it is the last county in England with no McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, or KFC \u2013 yet. That could be about to change, with councillors set to decide on Tuesday on an application for a new McDonald\u2019s. Planning officers have already recommended that councillors approve the application, advising that the development will \u201cnot have an adverse impact on \u2026 the character of the surrounding area\u201d. But it is a move that has divided opinion in Oakham, the well-to-do county town of Rutland, on the edge of which the restaurant is due to be built. A planning consultation has so far had 78 responses, with 55 against. Residents opposing the plan online cite fears of an increase in litter, a negative impact on the pubs and restaurants in the town, and even that the new drive-through will cause a drop in house prices. But residents who spoke to the Guardian on the streets of Oakham were more evenly split, with many speaking up for the plan. Oakham is a picturesque town of stone and brick that already hosts a large number of cafes and restaurants. Most were doing a steady trade and seemed prosperous, but prices were not cheap. And that\u2019s a problem for some. \u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to take children out in the town,\u201d said Karen Wilkinson, 63, who was out drinking coffee in Hungry Birds, one of Oakham\u2019s many coffee shops. Her son, a father of five, has got nowhere he can afford to take his kids, she said. \u201cHe can\u2019t afford to eat in Rutland, all the restaurants are really expensive.\u201d Sitting with her, Ann Dowling, 45, said she hoped the new McDonald\u2019s would offer somewhere for her teenage children to go. Oakham is lacking in facilities for young people, she said. She hoped the prospect of a McDonald\u2019s breakfast would tempt her children out of bed before 11am. But just feet away, at another table, Jill Tittensor, 54, said she felt the arrival of the fast-food chain would detract from the town\u2019s unique charm. \u201cI think it will go ahead,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do think not having one helps to put Rutland on the map.\u201d Opposition is not neatly split along age lines. Charlie Pallett, 25, who writes about the county as the Rutland Blogger, is also against the new restaurant. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really cool thing that we don\u2019t have one and I wish we could keep Rutland the way it is,\u201d she said. \u201cMy point is that we don\u2019t actually need it, we\u2019ve got some great restaurant businesses.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is a symbol of change in Rutland, which has seen an influx of newcomers in the past few years. Demographically, the county has for decades skewed older and wealthier, with many of the younger residents connected to two boarding schools. But new housing developments in the north-west of the town, close to a bypass, house younger families and commuters travelling to nearby Leicester and Nottingham, and even as far as London.

      "bodyText": "Peep peep! Arsenal restore their three-point lead at the top of the WSL with the usual 4-0 victory over Brighton. They were too slick, too confident, too much for the home side, who were never really in the game. Danielle van de Donk, Jill Roord, Jordan Nobbs and Beth Mead got the goals to give Arsenal a perfect start to their busy week. Thanks for your company - bye! 90+4 min Miedema misses an excellent chance to make it 5-0, lobbing over the outrushing Walsh but also the crossbar. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. 90 min If it stays like this it will be Arsenal\u2019s third consecutive 4-0 win over Brighton in the WSL. And the match before that ended 4-1. Beth Mead makes it 4-0. Walsh fumbled a cross from Walti and then, in her desperation to redeem the error, brought Maier down. The referee was in the process of awarding a penalty when Mead put the loose ball into the net. 86 min Not long now. The last 20 minutes have been a non-event. 83 min A loose ball breaks to Barton, who batters it into orbit from 20 yards. 80 min The match is petering out. In truth, it was over when Jill Roord made it 2-0 in the 32nd minute. 79 min And now Brighton make their final change, with Lea Le Garrec replaced by Ini-Abasi Umotong. 76 min A double change for Arsenal. Leah Williamson and Jordan Nobbs, who were both superb, are replaced by Katie McCabe and Leonie Maier. 74 min A dodgy pass from Williamson goes straight to Green. She turns, looks up ... and has almost no support. That\u2019s been the case all afternoon. 70 min This must be pretty demoralising for Brighton, who have spent almost all of the match in Arsenal\u2019s slipstream. 66 min A substitution apiece. Beth Mead comes on for Arsenal, with the reliably excellent Kim Little going off. And Megan Connolly replaces Emily Simpkins for Brighton. 66 min \u201cPicking up the score at a motorway service station, where (First World Problem Alert!) their notion of a cortado leaves much to be desired, I see that Arsenal are well ahead - no surprise there - but that Miedema hasn\u2019t scored yet,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cWhat\u2019s gone wrong, Rob?\u201d She\u2019s hardly touched the ball. Not that she has needed to \u2013 she even made the third with a dummy. 65 min Zinsberger, possibly out of boredom, goes charging out of her area to block Whelan\u2019s cross. 63 min A quarter-chance for Brighton, with the under-pressure Williams heading wide from a corner. 61 min Nothing much to report since the third goal. The intensity hasn\u2019t really dropped, even though both teams know the match is over. 57 min Brighton would surely settle for this scoreline. Arsenal could easily score two or three more. 54 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says H\u00e5kan Burden. \u201cEver since Arsenal won against G\u00f6teborg in 2012 I\u2019ve had a soft spot for the Gunners. At least in the WSL. Press and Asante were playing for G\u00f6teborg in those days, makes you wonder if the smaller nations and leagues will be able to compete in the long run against England, Germany and France?\u201d Good question. I fear not, for all the usual reasons, but I\u2019d imagine there will be a bit more equality than in the men\u2019s game. This is a lovely team goal, finished off by Jordan Nobbs. van de Donk\u2019s low ball from the left was dummied beautifully on the edge of the area by Miedema and ran through to Nobbs. She controlled the ball on the run and drilled it through the legs of Walsh. 51 min Arsenal have two huge league games coming up - Chelsea at home next weekend, and Manchester City away on 2 February. 50 min After some patient passing from Arsenal, Little\u2019s shot from the edge of the area is blocked. 47 min \u201cArsenal certainly seem to know how to play with the handbrake off,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cFront to back class in that team, and they seem to fit like clockwork.\u201d Indeed. They have the relaxed certainty of champions. 46 min Peep peep! Arsenal begin the second half. A win today would restore their three-point lead at the top of the WSL. Brighton have made a half-time change, with Kate Natkiel replacing Amanda Nilden. Half-time chitchat \u201cNoticing some new fans on the MBM,\u201d says Nic. \u201cThey might well be interested to know that most of the WSL games are shown live for free on the FA Player. Some of the games are shown live by BT Sport or the BBC, these are then not shown live to people logging in from the UK. The quality of these games is still below the men\u2019s game but they often throw up some close 1-0, 2-1 scorelines so that they can still be very entertaining.\u201d And there\u2019s a helluva title race developing. Peep peep! The league leaders Arsenal are in control at Crawley after a slick, authoritative first-half performance. Danielle van de Donk and Jill Roord scored excellent goals, and they could be further ahead. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+1 min And now a great chance for Brighton! Whelan, on the right, plays a superb through ball to find Simpkins just inside the area. She controls the ball on the run but sprays her shot wide of the near post. 45+1 min Arsenal almost finish Brighton off on the break. van de Donk slides a precise ball across the edge of the area to Nobbs, who gets it out of her feet and drives just wide. 45 min Roord is booked for a spiteful tackle on Kayleigh Green. 43 min Zinsberger has definitely touched the ball now. She did very well to hurry across her goal to palm Whelan\u2019s brilliant right-wing cross away from danger. 42 min I\u2019m sure Manuela Zinsberger has touched the ball, but I\u2019m honestly struggling to recall her doing so. 37 min After yet another incision down the Arsenal right, this time from Evans, Nobbs clips a first-time shot that is well saved by Walsh. 36 min Beautiful play from Arsenal. van de Donk flicks the ball behind her standing leg to Nobbs, who stabs it towards Miedema in the area. To widespread surprise, she slices her shot well wide. That was a great chance. 35 min \u201cHi there Rob,\u201d says Kevin in Clonakilty. \u201cDelighted to see a women\u2019s game covered live. Can\u2019t say I know much about the WPL but will know a lot more by the end of the game. My three 11-year-old triplet girls wholeheartedly agree.\u201d If they\u2019re looking for a hero, Katie McCabe is a good place to start. Inevitably, it was created down the right. Williamson, who also made the first goal as well, curled a long cross-pass into the path of Roord, who made an excellent run off Le Garrec. She controlled the ball just inside the area and finished emphatically into the bottom corner. Jill Roord doubles Arsenal\u2019s lead with a fine finish. 29 min Nobbs and Evans are causing so manyh problems down the Arsenal right. Nobbs wins the ball high up the field and crosses towards the near post, where Miedema\u2019s snapshot goes over the bar. 26 min Brighton have been better in the last few minutes, interrupting Arsenal\u2019s passing game with some strong challenges. 23 min We haven\u2019t seen possession statistics, but it feels like Arsenal have had at least 70 per cent. The one thing that will please Brighton is that their goalkeeper Megan Walsh hasn\u2019t had a huge amount of work to do. 21 min See 14 min. 18 min Miedema almost makes it 2-0. She has two close-range shots blocked - the first, crucially, by Kerkdijk I think. 16 min \u201cFear not, Rob, you have at least one reader,\u201d says Siddhant Lazar. Ah, well isn\u2019t that nice. It makes it all worthwhile. Sorry, what\u2019s that you say, Siddhant? \u201cAnd that\u2019s only because my net pack is rather terrible and thus I cannot watch the game online. And being an Arsenal fan, through and through, hopefully, this ends a lot better than the men\u2019s game did on Saturday.\u201d 14 min Brighton have a good home record this season, and beat an admittedly under-strength Arsenal on penalties in the group stage of the Continental Cup, but at the moment they are being outclassed. 12 min Nobbs\u2019 cross-shot from a tight angle is palmed away by Walsh. Brighton are hanging on desperately to their 1-0 deficit. 10 min Anyone out there? Eh? 8 min That was almost 2-0 to Arsenal. Evans\u2019 low cross from the right was miskicked by Nobbs and ran through to Roord, whose low shot was half blocked by Kerkdijk. The ball looped back towards goal and was grabbed by the diving Walsh. 6 min It\u2019s all Arsenal. Their unusual formation - it looks like a 3-3-3-1, or a 3-1-2-3-1 if you want to go full hipster - means they have a lot of ball players in the team, and at the moment Brighton are struggling to get possession. That didn\u2019t take long. Williamson drives a brilliant crossfield pass to release van de Donk on the left. She surges into the area, eases Barton out of the way and places the ball past Walsh from close range. That was far too easy. 2 min It looks like Arsenal are using a back three, although it\u2019s hard to work out their formation as they seem to be playing without winbg-backs. Schanderbeck and Williamson aer almost playing as full-back, with Louise Quinn as the only central defender. 1 min Peep peep! Brighton kick off from left to right. They are in blue and white stripes; Arsenal are in yellow. Some pre-match reading Brighton (4-1-4-1) Walsh; Barton, Kerkdijk, Williams, Gibbons; Simpkins; Whelan, Bowman, Le Garrce, Nilden; Green. Substitutes: Harris, Roe, Lundorf, Hack, Connolly, Natkiel, Umotong. Arsenal (3-4-3) Zinsberger; Williamson, Quinn, Schanderbeck; Nobbs, Walti, Little, Roord; Evans, Miedema, van de Donk. Substitutes: Peyraud-Magnin, Maier, McCabe, Filis, Grant, Mead. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Brighton v Arsenal from Crawley. The venue has changed but it\u2019s still Brighton away, which means an overload of happy memories for Arsenal supporters. Their team clinched last season\u2019s title \u2013 their first since 2012 - with a 4-0 win at the Amex Stadium. There\u2019s a long way to go in this year\u2019s title race, but a win today feels almost as important. The Big Three have set a blistering pace at the top of the WSL, with Arsenal ahead of Manchester City on alphabetical order, and the margin for error is almost non-existent. The title may be decided not by their mini-league with Chelsea, but by who drops the fewest points against the rest of the division. So far, Chelsea are the only team to have done so, with 1-1 draws at Liverpool and \u2013 yep \u2013 Brighton. Even in mid-January, Arsenal know that anything less then the best is a felony. Kick off is at 12.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>On Saturday night, a singer with a 13-year career played only her second London headline show. Naturally, the venue was packed out with rapt, merchandise-clad fans eager to see her live. But \u201clive\u201d, in this instance, is a loose concept \u2013 because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/05/hatsune-miku-japan-hologram-pop-star\">Hatsune Miku is a hologram</a>, or virtual idol.</p> <p>Miku\u2019s name comes from a blend of the Japanese words for \u201cfirst\u201d, \u201csound\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d and the turquoise-haired avatar was created by Japanese software company Crypton, as the face of Yamaha\u2019s Vocaloid software, in 2007. Independently produced freeware can be downloaded by anyone and used to create a song in Miku\u2019s piercingly sweet vocal. In terms of her tracks, she\u2019s the world\u2019s first crowdsourced pop star. Her setlist pulled from the more than 100,000 songs that have been made in Miku\u2019s name, and that have amassed an international fandom that has propelled her to performing on the Late Show with David Letterman, a Lady Gaga tour, and this year, even at Coachella.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33e1f32975b69a93671aabe03e3257e68717f3ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33e1f32975b69a93671aabe03e3257e68717f3ca/0_141_5472_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Full throttle experience \u2026 Miku at Brixton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"586\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full throttle experience \u2026 Miku at Brixton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CFM/Sega</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeing these tunes performed is a full-throttle experience. Miku is accompanied by four human musicians who are indefatigable, playing for two breakneck hours with a singer who has no need to pause for water breaks, costume changes or banter. Miku marches through J-pop, dance and nu-metal, bringing out other virtual idols as her special guests. While Miku is confined to a transparent screen centre-stage, a high-octane light show carries her energy around the auditorium for highlights such as the mosh-heavy thrasher Hyper Reality Show, and the punchy power pop of Rolling Girl.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_rnyqPr0zU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_rnyqPr0zU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As a concert, it\u2019s oddly sterile, with none of the unpredictability or imperfections that make live music thrilling. But tellingly, the tour is named the Miku Expo, and the London show resembles more a real-life gathering-slash-rave for online devotees than a traditional gig. Many in the audience are dressed as Miku, and many more have purchased official Miku glowsticks, which they wave in religious unison throughout the entire set as a visual reminder of the community and collaboration that creates Miku\u2019s numbers. She may not be the future of live music, but she represents a potential future for music creation and fandom, and internet culture\u2019s blurring of the lines between the two.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Saturday night, a singer with a 13-year career played only her second London headline show. Naturally, the venue was packed out with rapt, merchandise-clad fans eager to see her live. But \u201clive\u201d, in this instance, is a loose concept \u2013 because Hatsune Miku is a hologram, or virtual idol. Miku\u2019s name comes from a blend of the Japanese words for \u201cfirst\u201d, \u201csound\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d and the turquoise-haired avatar was created by Japanese software company Crypton, as the face of Yamaha\u2019s Vocaloid software, in 2007. Independently produced freeware can be downloaded by anyone and used to create a song in Miku\u2019s piercingly sweet vocal. In terms of her tracks, she\u2019s the world\u2019s first crowdsourced pop star. Her setlist pulled from the more than 100,000 songs that have been made in Miku\u2019s name, and that have amassed an international fandom that has propelled her to performing on the Late Show with David Letterman, a Lady Gaga tour, and this year, even at Coachella. Seeing these tunes performed is a full-throttle experience. Miku is accompanied by four human musicians who are indefatigable, playing for two breakneck hours with a singer who has no need to pause for water breaks, costume changes or banter. Miku marches through J-pop, dance and nu-metal, bringing out other virtual idols as her special guests. While Miku is confined to a transparent screen centre-stage, a high-octane light show carries her energy around the auditorium for highlights such as the mosh-heavy thrasher Hyper Reality Show, and the punchy power pop of Rolling Girl. As a concert, it\u2019s oddly sterile, with none of the unpredictability or imperfections that make live music thrilling. But tellingly, the tour is named the Miku Expo, and the London show resembles more a real-life gathering-slash-rave for online devotees than a traditional gig. Many in the audience are dressed as Miku, and many more have purchased official Miku glowsticks, which they wave in religious unison throughout the entire set as a visual reminder of the community and collaboration that creates Miku\u2019s numbers. She may not be the future of live music, but she represents a potential future for music creation and fandom, and internet culture\u2019s blurring of the lines between the two.",

On Friday, the force said it would be used to find suspects on \u201cwatchlists\u201d for serious and violent crime, as well as to help find children and vulnerable people. Scotland Yard said the public would be aware of the surveillance, with the cameras being placed in open locations and officers handing out explanatory leaflets.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How is it used in policing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The technology greatly improves the power of surveillance. At the simple end, a facial recognition system connected to a network of cameras can automatically track an individual as they move in and out of coverage, even if no other information is known about them. At the more complex end, a facial recognition system fuelled by a large database of labelled data can enable police to pinpoint a person of interest across a city of networked cameras.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it controversial?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facial recognition frequently sparks two distinct fears: that it will not work well enough, or that it will work too well.</p>\n    <p>The first concern highlights the fact that the technology, still in its infancy, is prone to false positives and false negatives, particularly when used with noisy imagery, such as that harvested from CCTV cameras installed years or decades ago. When that technology is used to arrest, convict or imprison people, on a possibly faulty basis, it can cause real harm. Worse, the errors are not evenly distributed; facial recognition systems have regularly been found to be inaccurate at identifying people with darker skin.</p>\n    <p>But the technology will improve, meaning the second concern is harder to shake. This is the fear that facial recognition inherently undermines freedom by enabling perfect surveillance of everyone, all the time. The fear is not hypothetical; already, Chinese cities have proudly used the technology to publicly shame citizens for jaywalking, or leaving the house in their pyjamas.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-hern\"><b>Alex Hern</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Technology editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two vans with facial recognition technology were seen.

Insofar as influence goes, though, it is more akin to a vicar saying daily prayers in an empty church. News organisation endorsements are not what win elections. What do win them are narrowly targeted ad campaigns, according to people who sell narrowly targeted ad campaigns.</p> <p>If one is to believe the internal communication to Facebook colleagues from executive Andrew Bosworth, which surfaced last week, the 2016 election was won not by the interference of Russian troll factories, or by the psychometric salesmen at Cambridge Analytica, but because Trump, in Bosworth\u2019s words \u201cran the single best digital ad campaign I\u2019ve ever seen from any advertiser\u201d.</p> <p>Given the Trump campaign spent heavily on Facebook and benefited from teams of Facebook employees embedded within the campaign, Bosworth might have substituted \u201che\u201d for \u201cwe\u201d.

Facebook will, it seems, only put its thumb on the scale for a candidate or campaign when paid to do so, as a vehicle for targeted advertising.</p> <p>Bosworth\u2019s memo provided an early smokescreen for an announcement later in the week that Facebook was holding fast to its policy of not fact-checking or removing untruthful statements in political advertising. For those concerned about the fairness of elections, this was a disappointing response. Even a very low bar for claims would be better than no bar and, much more importantly, an agreement to stop using the targeting methods which segment voters on an individual level would limit the vast opportunities to run dishonest campaigns.</p> <p>It has always made commercial sense for Facebook to refuse to be the regulator for political advertising, for two key reasons. First, it doesn\u2019t actually have the human capacity or skill to reliably check and remove untruthful campaign material.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18765ba17fd3c08f6ecaff6756c9437ee8c1e9f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18765ba17fd3c08f6ecaff6756c9437ee8c1e9f2/0_45_4375_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 x\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s campaign ran 5.9m different advertisements in six months during 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And second, because some of its biggest and most powerful clients \u2013 political parties and governments \u2013 don\u2019t want it to. On a broader principle, media companies should be setting their own standards for what is acceptable and ethical \u2013 but they should not be setting the rules for the rest of society.</p> <p>In 2016, the Trump campaign ran 5.9m different advertisements in six months, compared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s negligible 66,000, each one a subtle variant which can be created, tested and targeted. It is a system that cannot be effectively policed without either a change of business model or more stringent external regulation. The persuasion of societies happens through multivariate testing of different messages, whether buying bed sheets or elections.</p> <p>We know a great deal more about the dynamics of how information and misinformation is deployed during elections than we did in 2016. Media gatekeepers, which are now principally companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple, are still struggling to develop both methods and organisational cultures that meet the role.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The persuasion of societies happens through multivariate testing of messages, whether buying bed sheets or elections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those that have been losing control of gatekeeping over two decades, the news organisations, have bigger problems. In the past four years the media in the US and UK have learned what other parts of the world woke up to some time ago: namely, that politicians can be elected without ever engaging with the news media.</p> <p>Presidents and prime ministers can succeed by telling lies and avoiding any accountability in terms of public scrutiny. This is a global phenomenon \u2013 Narendra Modi, India\u2019s charismatic authoritarian leader, has never held a press conference. The White House press secretary has not held a briefing for half a year \u2013 not even in the last week, when the US has teetered on the brink of a war.</p> <p>Politicians across the spectrum understand that there is little to be gained by subjecting themselves even to good faith questioning. When the Conservative government is reportedly considering no longer participating in a serious programme such as Newsnight because its new policy editor, Lewis Goodall, was active in student politics a long time ago, it is hoping to read the last rites over any type of difficult public questioning. Who would seek out this kind of scrutiny when they could just stick to their own accounts on social media?</p> <p>What comes with it \u2013 the trolling, disinformation, virtual and real threats \u2013 only serve to remove the more fair-minded. Set against this trajectory, Facebook\u2019s policy of applying less scrutiny to political advertising than other types looks more reckless than reasonable.</p> <p>Even with the impossibility of policing, the reduction in revenue and likely evasion of any rules, it would be good to know that the new gatekeepers understand the importance of demonstrating their own values. If running the best dishonest digital campaign is the way to win, those responsible for enabling it are as much at fault as those who commission it.</p>",

Bosworth started his missive by explaining why Facebook would not use its own tools and practices to decide the outcome of the next election, even if that meant the election of a lying candidate. Facebook will, it seems, only put its thumb on the scale for a candidate or campaign when paid to do so, as a vehicle for targeted advertising. Bosworth\u2019s memo provided an early smokescreen for an announcement later in the week that Facebook was holding fast to its policy of not fact-checking or removing untruthful statements in political advertising. For those concerned about the fairness of elections, this was a disappointing response. Even a very low bar for claims would be better than no bar and, much more importantly, an agreement to stop using the targeting methods which segment voters on an individual level would limit the vast opportunities to run dishonest campaigns. It has always made commercial sense for Facebook to refuse to be the regulator for political advertising, for two key reasons. First, it doesn\u2019t actually have the human capacity or skill to reliably check and remove untruthful campaign material. And second, because some of its biggest and most powerful clients \u2013 political parties and governments \u2013 don\u2019t want it to. On a broader principle, media companies should be setting their own standards for what is acceptable and ethical \u2013 but they should not be setting the rules for the rest of society. In 2016, the Trump campaign ran 5.9m different advertisements in six months, compared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s negligible 66,000, each one a subtle variant which can be created, tested and targeted. It is a system that cannot be effectively policed without either a change of business model or more stringent external regulation. The persuasion of societies happens through multivariate testing of different messages, whether buying bed sheets or elections. We know a great deal more about the dynamics of how information and misinformation is deployed during elections than we did in 2016. Media gatekeepers, which are now principally companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple, are still struggling to develop both methods and organisational cultures that meet the role. Those that have been losing control of gatekeeping over two decades, the news organisations, have bigger problems. In the past four years the media in the US and UK have learned what other parts of the world woke up to some time ago: namely, that politicians can be elected without ever engaging with the news media. Presidents and prime ministers can succeed by telling lies and avoiding any accountability in terms of public scrutiny. This is a global phenomenon \u2013 Narendra Modi, India\u2019s charismatic authoritarian leader, has never held a press conference. The White House press secretary has not held a briefing for half a year \u2013 not even in the last week, when the US has teetered on the brink of a war. Politicians across the spectrum understand that there is little to be gained by subjecting themselves even to good faith questioning. When the Conservative government is reportedly considering no longer participating in a serious programme such as Newsnight because its new policy editor, Lewis Goodall, was active in student politics a long time ago, it is hoping to read the last rites over any type of difficult public questioning. Who would seek out this kind of scrutiny when they could just stick to their own accounts on social media? What comes with it \u2013 the trolling, disinformation, virtual and real threats \u2013 only serve to remove the more fair-minded. Set against this trajectory, Facebook\u2019s policy of applying less scrutiny to political advertising than other types looks more reckless than reasonable. Even with the impossibility of policing, the reduction in revenue and likely evasion of any rules, it would be good to know that the new gatekeepers understand the importance of demonstrating their own values. If running the best dishonest digital campaign is the way to win, those responsible for enabling it are as much at fault as those who commission it.",

      "body": "<h2>How to consciously uncouple from your phone</h2> <p>Stop using your phone as an alarm clock. Buy an old-school alarm instead and keep your phone in another room. This way, you won\u2019t be sucked into the carnival of distress as soon as you wake up. In fact, try to make the first 90 minutes and the last 90 minutes of your day phone-free.</p> <p>\u201cSmell the coffee. Have a shower. Eat breakfast with your family. Start your work day with the task that is actually the most pressing,\u201d says Julie Morgenstern, author of a number of books on time management. \u201cOnly once you\u2019ve made significant progress should you engage with email.\u201d</p> <p>Write a list of the most pressing tasks of the day, in order of importance, and work through them sequentially. Designate specific times that are OK to go online: 10am, noon, 2pm, 5pm, 7pm. \u201cAvoid doing it in the micro-moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is a phenomenal way to break the habit.\u201d</p> <p>One of the main problems with phones is that they have so many functions. You check the time \u2013 and you read a maddening tweet. You look up a film showtime \u2013 and you read a vexing email from a colleague. Make a list of all of the functions and try to focus on the three or four that actually benefit you.</p> <p>Another problem is that phone-use dominoes. If one person gets their phone out at a table, everyone else does. Designate a specific place in your home where phones are stored, perhaps by the front door. Encourage the whole family to keep their phones there, especially during mealtimes. Synchronise use. \u201cThe thing about breaking up with your phone is that it\u2019s hard to do. It\u2019s like sugar, it\u2019s designed to be addictive. You can break your screen addiction \u2013 but you\u2019re going to have to break it again and again.\u201d</p> <h2>How to look after your clothes</h2> <p>You can fix a stuck zip with a regular graphite pencil. Run the pencil along both sides of the zip \u2013 it should start to glide open. If you\u2019re sewing a button on a shirt, thread the needle with two, three or four strands of thread and knot them together. Then you should be able to sew it with just one stitch.</p> <p>Wash less, but wash better. Avoid overfilling the washing machine, stick to low temperatures and handwash your delicates. \u201cYou can handwash all sorts of things,\u201d says Lucinda O\u2019Connor, founder of online clothing renovation service Clothes Doctor. \u201cIt reduces friction, it stops microfibres escaping, and it keeps clothes in much better shape.\u201d</p> <p>Leave a cashmere jumper to soak for about 20 minutes in cold water with a gentle detergent, rinse, leave it to dry flat on a towel. \u201cIt comes out super soft. If you put cashmere on a radiator, it often shrinks. If you put it on a towel, it dries slowly and retains its shape.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Connor says that in her former life as a City analyst, she used to buy a new item every week. Since founding Clothes Doctor in 2017, she has kicked her fast-fashion habit. \u201cI barely buy any new clothes now. I have a much smaller, more organised wardrobe. I don\u2019t dry clean. But I do handwash and I do steam. Steaming kills 99% of bacteria and therefore odours and it gets the creases out, too. Buy a steamer! That\u2019s my tip.\u201d</p> <h2>How to raise extremely resilient children</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf5861c7b34978b2b3ffdea5131ece40b909b1a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5861c7b34978b2b3ffdea5131ece40b909b1a7/0_112_1833_1910/960.jpg\" alt=\"Time to toughen up: \u2018If you fail to recognise a child\u2019s pain, you are teaching the child to desensitise themselves.\u2019\" width=\"960\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time to toughen up: \u2018If you fail to recognise a child\u2019s pain, you are teaching the child to desensitise themselves.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A child in your care laughs, runs, trips \u2013 and goes flying. You hold your breath and wince as skin scrapes asphalt. \u201cThere is a school of thought,\u201d says Philippa Perry, psychotherapist and author of <em>The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read</em>, \u201cthat you should say: \u2018Don\u2019t make a fuss, that doesn\u2019t look like it hurts,\u2019 and the kid will learn to be tough. This is not so.\u201d</p> <p>If you fail to recognise a child\u2019s pain, you are teaching the child to desensitise themselves \u2013 to pretend they\u2019re OK when they\u2019re not OK \u2013 which will in turn desensitise them to other people\u2019s hurts.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as resilience,\u201d she adds. As counterintuitive as it seems, the best way to build resilience is to take the child\u2019s pain seriously \u2013 \u201cOuch! That looks really painful? Are you OK? Let me have a look\u201d \u2013 but to contain it. Don\u2019t be overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe learn how to soothe ourselves in relationship with other people,\u201d says Perry. \u201cIf your parents soothe the pain and contain it, a child internalises that soothing. At first it comes externally, from the parent \u2013 but after a while they learn to self-soothe.\u201d</p> <p>When it\u2019s a knottier problem \u2013 say, a schoolfriend doesn\u2019t want to play with them any more \u2013 invite the child to problem-solve with you, and then brainstorm solutions. \u201cWork with them.

But it\u2019s a life-changing amount of money when you\u2019re buying a car or a house.</p> <p>You can negotiate in any shop where there are salespeople on the floor \u2013 for example, mid-range clothes shops \u2013 as long as you\u2019re \u201ccreating value\u201d for the salesperson. He recently talked his way into a \u00a3200 clothes discount. \u201cI was buying a suit for a wedding which was \u00a3600, and I was also in the market for a leather jacket, which was \u00a3400. I knew I was going to buy both, but I feigned disinterest and looked around the shop aimlessly. Eventually the salesman starts selling the jacket to me. So I said: \u2018Look, if you do me the suit and the jacket together for \u00a3786 then I\u2019ll get them both.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Unround numbers sound more credible; and it\u2019s vital to get your figure out first, to \u201canchor\u201d the negotiation. \u201cIf I\u2019d have said \u00a3800, he wouldn\u2019t have gone for it. As it was, he said: \u2018I can\u2019t do \u00a3786, but I can do 80%\u2019. I\u2019m like: \u2018All right!\u2019 The value for me was \u00a3200. The value in it for the shop was the ability to upsell and turn a single sale into a multiple sale.\u201d</p> <h2>How to start a fire without a match</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019d recommend the hand-drill method,\u201d says John Plant, presenter of the Primitive Technology YouTube channel, on which he recreates Stone Age tools. \u201cIt\u2019s basically rubbing two sticks together. People like Bear Grylls teach the bow-drill method, but it requires five components. The hand drill only involves three. It\u2019s less reliant on technology.\u201d</p> <p>First, gather your materials and make sure they\u2019re bone dry. You will need a tinder bundle: anything dry and fibrous. You will need twigs to use as kindling. And you will need firesticks. \u201cYou\u2019re after low-density wood that\u2019s light and dry when you pick it up. Any fast-growing trees at the edge of a clearing are good.\u201d</p> <p>Fashion your spindle: you want a round, straight piece of wood that\u2019s about 60cm long with a diameter of about 1 to 1.5cm. Peel off all the bark. Now, make your baseboard: a thicker piece of the same timber, long enough so you can hold it steady with your foot. Use a sharp stone to gouge a small hole in the baseboard with a small notch in the side of the hole where hot powder can collect.</p> <p>Put the tinder on the ground, put the base board on top of that, then put the spindle in the socket. The basic action is rotating the stick back and forward between the palm of the hand. \u201cIt\u2019s speed you\u2019re after rather than force,\u201d says Plant. \u201cYou need to trigger the fast-twitch muscles. You\u2019ve got more than enough energy in your body to start a fire. You just need to focus it.\u201d</p> <p>Making fire is difficult. Take heart from incremental progress. \u201cThe first milestone is making the fire stick hot. The second milestone is creating powder. The third milestone is smoke. The final step is producing a hot coal. Blow the hot coal so it ignites the tinder. Once the whole lot is starting to smoulder, you can put tiny little twigs on top of the tinder bundle and nurse the flame from there.\u201d</p> <h2>How to master the yodel</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83efec608111e77cf43b0aba2011dd2d9c14f1c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83efec608111e77cf43b0aba2011dd2d9c14f1c9/0_466_3543_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liddle-o-lay-hee-hoo!: \u2018When you\u2019re yodelling, you\u2019re always entertaining.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"856\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liddle-o-lay-hee-hoo!: \u2018When you\u2019re yodelling, you\u2019re always entertaining.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a deep breath right into your belly. Sing a low note from the depths of your diaphragm and siren up, higher and higher, until your chest voice breaks and you have to use your falsetto voice to keep going. That\u2019s your \u201cflip\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo yodel, you have to master that flip,\u201d says Leah Daniels, a country singer from rural Ontario, Canada. The idea of yodelling is to flip rapidly between your chest and head voice. \u201cIt goes against everything we\u2019re taught to do as singers \u2013 we\u2019re taught to have a seamless voice from head to chest.\u201d</p> <p>Daniels got yodelling from her grandfather, a country and western aficionado who caught the yodelling craze in the 1940s and yodelled all the way to his retirement home. \u201cHe had this real knack for entertaining people,\u201d she says, \u201cand when you\u2019re yodelling, you\u2019re definitely entertaining people.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t hold back. Try saying \u201cHey!\u201d loudly a few times to build up the requisite oomph. \u201cYou find it through bad singing,\u201d says Daniels. \u201cYou need not to be afraid of sounding horrible while you\u2019re finding it.\u201d Once you have found your flip, you can start playing around with vowels. Ays, Ees, Ohs and Oohs are all good. Liddle-o-lay-hee-hoo is quintessential.</p> <h2>How to finally banish brain fog</h2> <p>You know those days when your brain feels all misted over and you can\u2019t concentrate no matter how much you whack your head with your fists? Dr Mike Dow, author of <em>The</em> <em>Sugar Brain Fix</em>, reckons it has a lot to do with sugar \u2013 whose effects on brain chemistry (mostly bad) are only just becoming understood.</p> <p>\u201cSugar is just as bad for your brain as it is for your waistline,\u201d he asserts. Studies have shown that if you give a person sugar, they will perform worse on memory and cognition tests an hour later. Excessive sugar consumption leads to type 2 diabetes, which is linked to dementia and deterioration of brain function. A recent study appeared to implicate sugar in depressive disorders, as well as dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about short-term brain fog,\u201d he says, \u201cit also has this long-term effect on mood and cognition.\u201d</p> <p>So stop buying sweets. Don\u2019t keep biscuits in the house. Banish cakes from the office. Watch out for ingredients that are actually sugar, but pretend not to be (like brown rice syrup). Eat a good brain diet. One of the things that keeps us going back for sugar is the serotonin it releases. \u201cYou can combine different foods to promote the production of serotonin in your gut, which will mean you don\u2019t miss the serotonin you were getting from sugar so much. Probiotics helps. The combination of vitamin B, vitamin C and the amino acid tryptophan \u2013 found in chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, pumpkin seeds and peanuts \u2013 helps your body to manufacture natural serotonin.\u201d A salad of, say, kale (vitamin B), tomatoes (vitamin C) and chicken (tryptophan) should leave you less at the mercy of sugar cravings.</p> <h2>How to defuse a tricky argument</h2> <p>\u201cFirst: breathe!\u201d says clinical psychologist Julie Gottman, co-author of numerous books on relationships with her husband of 30 years, John. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re calm enough to frame your words carefully.\u201d</p> <p>The Gottmans have observed more than 3,000 couples having \u201cconflict conversations\u201d, and followed them up over the course of 20 years. Some couples are notably better at negotiating these inevitable disagreements. They tend to start with \u201cI\u201d and name what they feel, rather than using \u201cYou\u201d. \u201cJust imagine someone pointing their finger at you and exclaiming, \u2018You, you, <em>you</em>!\u2019\u201d says Julie. \u201cNot good, right? So, say: \u2018I\u2019m upset.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Then, they describe what they\u2019re upset about. \u201cCombining both, this sounds like \u2018I\u2019m upset that the kitchen is a mess,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m angry that the bills haven\u2019t been paid yet,\u2019\u201d says Julie. \u201cNotice, \u2018you\u2019 hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet.\u201d</p> <p>They finish by saying what they need \u2013 something positive. \u201cThis gives the partner a way to shine for their partner, a recipe for how to succeed with them.\u201d</p> <p>Avoid phrases like \u201cyou always\u201d and \u201cyou never\u201d \u2013 these imply personality flaws in your partner. Criticism and contempt will stop your partner from listening to you. If they are cross with you, don\u2019t go on the defensive (\u201cNo I didn\u2019t!\u201d) and don\u2019t counter-attack (\u201cOh yeah? Well you did X.\u201d) Try to hear the pain beneath the complaint. Take responsibility. Empathise with your partner\u2019s feelings before you explain your behaviour to them. Gently remind them to just describe their own feelings \u2013 rather than your personality flaws.</p> <h2>How to be happy in 2020</h2> <p>\u201cI think. It all depends. On how much. Time. You have,\u201d says the Korean Buddhist monk <a href=\"Haemin Sunim\" title=\"\">Haemin Sunim</a>, at the pace of a sailing boat on a windless day. If you want to be happy right now, try smiling. \u201cA smile makes your whole body feel more open and calm. You can also take a deep breath. You do it naturally when you\u2019ve just achieved something. But you can actually just do it by itself and it has more or less the same effect. In fact, you can do it now!\u201d</p> <p>If you have more time, Sunim suggests you count your blessings. Capitalism and digital technology conspire to give us incessant reminders of what we lack and can\u2019t control. A good antidote is to keep a gratitude journal. Get into the habit of writing down the things for which you\u2019re grateful. \u201cIf you\u2019re actively looking for blessings, you notice them more.\u201d</p> <p>What if you have lots of time? \u201cYou can do things to make you spiritually, emotionally and intellectually grow. This feeling of being in contact with something that you didn\u2019t know before \u2013 that is happiness. If we feel we are not growing, we try to find happiness by controlling other people. However, if you focus on your personal growth, you can be happy without depending on other people.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s the use of my own happiness if the world is falling apart around me? \u201cWell, here, you have to choose,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cYou can choose to be a victim of our times. Or you can commit to compassion. Often you feel frustration and sadness because so many sad things are happening, particularly in the political and ecological realm. But underneath these frustrations is always compassion. From that place, you can ask: \u2018What can I do better to improve the world from my own limited capacity?\u2019\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "How to consciously uncouple from your phone Stop using your phone as an alarm clock. Buy an old-school alarm instead and keep your phone in another room. This way, you won\u2019t be sucked into the carnival of distress as soon as you wake up. In fact, try to make the first 90 minutes and the last 90 minutes of your day phone-free. \u201cSmell the coffee. Have a shower. Eat breakfast with your family. Start your work day with the task that is actually the most pressing,\u201d says Julie Morgenstern, author of a number of books on time management. \u201cOnly once you\u2019ve made significant progress should you engage with email.\u201d Write a list of the most pressing tasks of the day, in order of importance, and work through them sequentially. Designate specific times that are OK to go online: 10am, noon, 2pm, 5pm, 7pm. \u201cAvoid doing it in the micro-moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is a phenomenal way to break the habit.\u201d One of the main problems with phones is that they have so many functions. You check the time \u2013 and you read a maddening tweet. You look up a film showtime \u2013 and you read a vexing email from a colleague. Make a list of all of the functions and try to focus on the three or four that actually benefit you. Another problem is that phone-use dominoes. If one person gets their phone out at a table, everyone else does. Designate a specific place in your home where phones are stored, perhaps by the front door. Encourage the whole family to keep their phones there, especially during mealtimes. Synchronise use. \u201cThe thing about breaking up with your phone is that it\u2019s hard to do. It\u2019s like sugar, it\u2019s designed to be addictive. You can break your screen addiction \u2013 but you\u2019re going to have to break it again and again.\u201d How to look after your clothes You can fix a stuck zip with a regular graphite pencil. Run the pencil along both sides of the zip \u2013 it should start to glide open. If you\u2019re sewing a button on a shirt, thread the needle with two, three or four strands of thread and knot them together. Then you should be able to sew it with just one stitch. Wash less, but wash better. Avoid overfilling the washing machine, stick to low temperatures and handwash your delicates. \u201cYou can handwash all sorts of things,\u201d says Lucinda O\u2019Connor, founder of online clothing renovation service Clothes Doctor. \u201cIt reduces friction, it stops microfibres escaping, and it keeps clothes in much better shape.\u201d Leave a cashmere jumper to soak for about 20 minutes in cold water with a gentle detergent, rinse, leave it to dry flat on a towel. \u201cIt comes out super soft. If you put cashmere on a radiator, it often shrinks. If you put it on a towel, it dries slowly and retains its shape.\u201d O\u2019Connor says that in her former life as a City analyst, she used to buy a new item every week. Since founding Clothes Doctor in 2017, she has kicked her fast-fashion habit. \u201cI barely buy any new clothes now. I have a much smaller, more organised wardrobe. I don\u2019t dry clean. But I do handwash and I do steam. Steaming kills 99% of bacteria and therefore odours and it gets the creases out, too. Buy a steamer! That\u2019s my tip.\u201d How to raise extremely resilient children A child in your care laughs, runs, trips \u2013 and goes flying. You hold your breath and wince as skin scrapes asphalt. \u201cThere is a school of thought,\u201d says Philippa Perry, psychotherapist and author of The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read, \u201cthat you should say: \u2018Don\u2019t make a fuss, that doesn\u2019t look like it hurts,\u2019 and the kid will learn to be tough. This is not so.\u201d If you fail to recognise a child\u2019s pain, you are teaching the child to desensitise themselves \u2013 to pretend they\u2019re OK when they\u2019re not OK \u2013 which will in turn desensitise them to other people\u2019s hurts. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same as resilience,\u201d she adds. As counterintuitive as it seems, the best way to build resilience is to take the child\u2019s pain seriously \u2013 \u201cOuch! That looks really painful? Are you OK? Let me have a look\u201d \u2013 but to contain it. Don\u2019t be overwhelmed. \u201cWe learn how to soothe ourselves in relationship with other people,\u201d says Perry. \u201cIf your parents soothe the pain and contain it, a child internalises that soothing. At first it comes externally, from the parent \u2013 but after a while they learn to self-soothe.\u201d When it\u2019s a knottier problem \u2013 say, a schoolfriend doesn\u2019t want to play with them any more \u2013 invite the child to problem-solve with you, and then brainstorm solutions. \u201cWork with them. Don\u2019t shut any of their ideas down, even the mad ones. Just ask for more. If they come up with an idea themselves, they\u2019re more likely to do it. Brainstorming is really where it\u2019s at.\u201d How to absolutely, 100% own that room!

The basic action is rotating the stick back and forward between the palm of the hand. \u201cIt\u2019s speed you\u2019re after rather than force,\u201d says Plant. \u201cYou need to trigger the fast-twitch muscles. You\u2019ve got more than enough energy in your body to start a fire. You just need to focus it.\u201d Making fire is difficult. Take heart from incremental progress. \u201cThe first milestone is making the fire stick hot. The second milestone is creating powder. The third milestone is smoke. The final step is producing a hot coal. Blow the hot coal so it ignites the tinder. Once the whole lot is starting to smoulder, you can put tiny little twigs on top of the tinder bundle and nurse the flame from there.\u201d How to master the yodel Take a deep breath right into your belly. Sing a low note from the depths of your diaphragm and siren up, higher and higher, until your chest voice breaks and you have to use your falsetto voice to keep going. That\u2019s your \u201cflip\u201d. \u201cTo yodel, you have to master that flip,\u201d says Leah Daniels, a country singer from rural Ontario, Canada. The idea of yodelling is to flip rapidly between your chest and head voice. \u201cIt goes against everything we\u2019re taught to do as singers \u2013 we\u2019re taught to have a seamless voice from head to chest.\u201d Daniels got yodelling from her grandfather, a country and western aficionado who caught the yodelling craze in the 1940s and yodelled all the way to his retirement home. \u201cHe had this real knack for entertaining people,\u201d she says, \u201cand when you\u2019re yodelling, you\u2019re definitely entertaining people.\u201d Don\u2019t hold back. Try saying \u201cHey!\u201d loudly a few times to build up the requisite oomph. \u201cYou find it through bad singing,\u201d says Daniels. \u201cYou need not to be afraid of sounding horrible while you\u2019re finding it.\u201d Once you have found your flip, you can start playing around with vowels. Ays, Ees, Ohs and Oohs are all good. Liddle-o-lay-hee-hoo is quintessential. How to finally banish brain fog You know those days when your brain feels all misted over and you can\u2019t concentrate no matter how much you whack your head with your fists? Dr Mike Dow, author of The Sugar Brain Fix, reckons it has a lot to do with sugar \u2013 whose effects on brain chemistry (mostly bad) are only just becoming understood. \u201cSugar is just as bad for your brain as it is for your waistline,\u201d he asserts. Studies have shown that if you give a person sugar, they will perform worse on memory and cognition tests an hour later. Excessive sugar consumption leads to type 2 diabetes, which is linked to dementia and deterioration of brain function. A recent study appeared to implicate sugar in depressive disorders, as well as dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about short-term brain fog,\u201d he says, \u201cit also has this long-term effect on mood and cognition.\u201d So stop buying sweets. Don\u2019t keep biscuits in the house. Banish cakes from the office. Watch out for ingredients that are actually sugar, but pretend not to be (like brown rice syrup). Eat a good brain diet. One of the things that keeps us going back for sugar is the serotonin it releases. \u201cYou can combine different foods to promote the production of serotonin in your gut, which will mean you don\u2019t miss the serotonin you were getting from sugar so much. Probiotics helps. The combination of vitamin B, vitamin C and the amino acid tryptophan \u2013 found in chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, pumpkin seeds and peanuts \u2013 helps your body to manufacture natural serotonin.\u201d A salad of, say, kale (vitamin B), tomatoes (vitamin C) and chicken (tryptophan) should leave you less at the mercy of sugar cravings. How to defuse a tricky argument \u201cFirst: breathe!\u201d says clinical psychologist Julie Gottman, co-author of numerous books on relationships with her husband of 30 years, John. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re calm enough to frame your words carefully.\u201d The Gottmans have observed more than 3,000 couples having \u201cconflict conversations\u201d, and followed them up over the course of 20 years. Some couples are notably better at negotiating these inevitable disagreements. They tend to start with \u201cI\u201d and name what they feel, rather than using \u201cYou\u201d. \u201cJust imagine someone pointing their finger at you and exclaiming, \u2018You, you, you!\u2019\u201d says Julie. \u201cNot good, right? So, say: \u2018I\u2019m upset.\u2019\u201d Then, they describe what they\u2019re upset about. \u201cCombining both, this sounds like \u2018I\u2019m upset that the kitchen is a mess,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m angry that the bills haven\u2019t been paid yet,\u2019\u201d says Julie. \u201cNotice, \u2018you\u2019 hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet.\u201d They finish by saying what they need \u2013 something positive. \u201cThis gives the partner a way to shine for their partner, a recipe for how to succeed with them.\u201d Avoid phrases like \u201cyou always\u201d and \u201cyou never\u201d \u2013 these imply personality flaws in your partner. Criticism and contempt will stop your partner from listening to you. If they are cross with you, don\u2019t go on the defensive (\u201cNo I didn\u2019t!\u201d) and don\u2019t counter-attack (\u201cOh yeah? Well you did X.\u201d) Try to hear the pain beneath the complaint. Take responsibility. Empathise with your partner\u2019s feelings before you explain your behaviour to them. Gently remind them to just describe their own feelings \u2013 rather than your personality flaws. How to be happy in 2020 \u201cI think. It all depends. On how much. Time. You have,\u201d says the Korean Buddhist monk Haemin Sunim, at the pace of a sailing boat on a windless day. If you want to be happy right now, try smiling. \u201cA smile makes your whole body feel more open and calm. You can also take a deep breath. You do it naturally when you\u2019ve just achieved something. But you can actually just do it by itself and it has more or less the same effect. In fact, you can do it now!\u201d If you have more time, Sunim suggests you count your blessings. Capitalism and digital technology conspire to give us incessant reminders of what we lack and can\u2019t control. A good antidote is to keep a gratitude journal. Get into the habit of writing down the things for which you\u2019re grateful. \u201cIf you\u2019re actively looking for blessings, you notice them more.\u201d What if you have lots of time? \u201cYou can do things to make you spiritually, emotionally and intellectually grow. This feeling of being in contact with something that you didn\u2019t know before \u2013 that is happiness. If we feel we are not growing, we try to find happiness by controlling other people. However, if you focus on your personal growth, you can be happy without depending on other people.\u201d What\u2019s the use of my own happiness if the world is falling apart around me? \u201cWell, here, you have to choose,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cYou can choose to be a victim of our times. Or you can commit to compassion. Often you feel frustration and sadness because so many sad things are happening, particularly in the political and ecological realm. But underneath these frustrations is always compassion. From that place, you can ask: \u2018What can I do better to improve the world from my own limited capacity?\u2019\u201d",

In the period of my career, it\u2019s changed in front of our eyes. Every year, we went to Lizard Island, Australia, to a protected marine reserve in the Great Barrier Reef, and that was our reference for what coral reefs should be like: dazzling places, full of life. A quarter of all marine species live on coral reefs, which only make up about 0.1% of the ocean surface. They\u2019re rainforests of the sea.</p> <p>When we went back to the Great Barrier Reef after a major bleaching event in 2006, it had turned into a graveyard. It looked weird, because the fish were still brightly coloured, like someone had gone in and painted them on an otherwise black-and-white photograph. It was completely devastating to see individual corals that we knew and loved and had spent so long studying, now dead.</p> <p>I\u2019d just recruited a PhD student to study fish behaviour, and between the time of recruiting him and getting out for the first field season, the Great Barrier Reef died \u2013 80% of the corals where we work were gone, and most of the fish that lived there also moved on. I told him in the interview that his visit was going to be this most wonderful experience, and it was just a tragic graveyard of historic coral reef life.</p> <p><strong>How have you been dealing with it?</strong><br>We come back from our field seasons increasingly broken. You can either think: I can\u2019t do this, I\u2019m going to have to change the science I do; or you might try to internalise all of that pain that you feel. Lots of scientists do the latter \u2013 they feel we should be objective and robust, not at the mercy of our emotions.</p> <p>Increasingly, we\u2019re realising that we can use that emotional response to form new questions. Working on the bleached and dying coral reefs is enormously important to understanding how those environments are changing. There is a real urge to want to do something about it, rather than just chart the demise. And that\u2019s where our research is heading now. We\u2019re trying to restore some coral reef communities, or a fishery, or replant a mangrove forest. We\u2019re just trying to find ways of protecting pockets of really diverse, vibrant life, which might reseed much larger areas when we tackle the big issues.</p> <p><strong>Any advice to others experiencing ecological grief?</strong><br>It\u2019s really important that we find ways of communicating the grief that we\u2019re feeling and work together to support each other. Then we can become stronger, we can start to develop the science that takes our knowledge and turns it on its head \u2013 turns it into a solution, rather than just a negative story.</p> <p>I think that finding any way of fostering a love of the natural world in the next generation is critical for them to be part of the solution.</p> <h2>Ashlee Consolo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e55592680226e17f1ed2ff90f8c0b40f9a2444c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e55592680226e17f1ed2ff90f8c0b40f9a2444c4/0_20_5100_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Inuit man fishing on Baker Lake in Nunavut, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Inuit man fishing on Baker Lake in Nunavut, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AGF/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Director of the Lab</strong></em><em><strong>rador Institute of Memorial University, Happy Valley-Goose Bay</strong></em><em><strong>,</strong></em><em><strong> Canada. </strong></em><em><strong>Consolo works with indigenous Inuit communities</strong></em></p> <p><strong>What changes have you personally seen that have affected you?</strong><br>Labrador is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/30/canada-inuits-climate-change-impact-global-warming-melting-ice\" title=\"\">fastest-warming places in Canada</a>, with around three degrees temperature change since 1900. It\u2019s a place that relies on solid ice formation, with deep cultural connections to cold. We interviewed hundreds of people on the coasts over five years, and no matter what age and gender, the changing environmental conditions were impacting them mentally, emotionally. Indigenous people talked about how being able to travel, to hunt, was freedom \u2013 a way of connecting to ancestors, culture, and feeling well and whole. With the climate shifting, people spend less time on the land, so they feel sad, angry, lonely and helpless.</p> <p>A lot of people talked about grief for what it might mean for children and future generations to come. One of the Inuit elders said, \u201cWe are people of the sea ice. And if there\u2019s no more sea ice, how do we be people of the sea ice?\u201d And that sort of profound existential question is so deep and complex.</p> <p>People talked about mourning their own identity, and also anticipatory grief: the sense that the changes are continuing, and that they\u2019re likely to experience worsening of what they\u2019re already seeing. People also discussed the sadness of watching others around the world suffer environmental-related trauma, and knowing the pain of what it\u2019s like.</p> <p>This is a slow and cumulative grief without end \u2013 unlike a human death, say. There\u2019s not one moment that you can pinpoint, but long, enduring grief and anxiety that\u2019s underneath.</p> <p><strong>How have you been dealing with it?</strong><br>In doing this research, I did have a very long period where I almost felt consumed by what I was seeing in the environment, and also being surrounded by and immersed in the grief of others. When I was experiencing my own very severe ecological grief, one of the things that really helped me through was talking to the indigenous elders \u2013 having people to share with. It was a really amazing moment, because they talked about how grief isn\u2019t something to avoid or be scared of. It\u2019s certainly painful. It can be terribly isolating; it can be a really horrible experience. But if we come together, and we share our grief, and we share pain and emotions, there\u2019s a real strength to that.</p> <p><strong>Any advice to others experiencing ecological grief?</strong><br>There\u2019s a power and an honour to grief, because it means that we have loved something, and we\u2019ve had a connection to a place or to species of the planet. We need to find ways to mark our loss and share our loss, but also to remind ourselves that we only grieve what we love. I think new rituals are essential to celebrate that love, and to mark the loss and to come together for loss.</p> <p>What I really learned from the elders was to start talking about grief as a totally normal response to climate change or other forms of environmental degradation. So it\u2019s not something to feel ashamed about. And then through the leadership of those elders, they started bringing other people in the communities together to talk about what we were finding in research, and have people share their experiences.</p> <p>The sense of helplessness is very prevalent \u2013 the feeling that the scale of our environmental crisis is so large that as individuals we can\u2019t intervene. And I think that\u2019s actually one of the really powerful mobilising potentials of ecological grief \u2013 it\u2019s driving action and anger; climate marches. More and more people are coming forward to share their pain and there\u2019s power in that \u2013 the capacity to make a sea-change in policy because ecological grief is so much now a part of the public narrative. Inuit leader <a href=\"https://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/laureates/sheila-watt-cloutier/\" title=\"\">Sheila Watt-Cloutier</a> led a really amazing movement across Canada, bringing a lawsuit against the government for \u201cthe right to be cold\u201d.</p> <p>We\u2019re seeing incredible leadership coming out of indigenous peoples\u2019 elders, and part of what we have to talk about is: how do we deal with our grief? Because who and what we choose to grieve tells us a lot about ourselves and where our values are.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.unity.edu/employee/deanna-witman/\" title=\"\">Deanna W</a><a href=\"https://www.unity.edu/employee/deanna-witman/\" title=\"\">itman</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"136aaef4ddf699c79265baf53c838558df07415f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136aaef4ddf699c79265baf53c838558df07415f/0_109_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deanna Witman of Unity College.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deanna Witman of Unity College.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Assistant professor of environmental humanities at Unity College</strong></em><em><strong>, Main</strong></em><em><strong>e</strong></em></p> <p><strong>What changes have you personally seen that have affected you?</strong><br>I was a field biologist, working for a private consulting company doing impact studies for transportation and infrastructure projects \u2013 collecting data to understand how the potential work would impact the surrounding area.

He was known locally as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/aug/08/communities.uknews\">the Mole Man</a> because, since the early 60s, he had been digging beneath his double-fronted Victorian villa. He broke through the foundations, creating a series of tunnels and caverns \u2013 some up to 8 metres deep and travelling as far as 20 metres from his house \u2013 shored up by handmade concrete pillars. When he was eventually evicted in 2006, he told the press: \u201cI just have a big basement.\u201d The council removed more than 30 tonnes of waste from the grounds of his house, including three cars and a boat, before filling the tunnels with 2,000 tonnes of aerated concrete and erecting a corrugated iron fence around the site.

Noble and Webster\u2019s work had recently appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/sep/21/artsfeatures2\">Apocalypse at the Royal Academy</a> and in MoMa in New York. When she wasn\u2019t hard at it, she would cycle from Shoreditch to De Beauvoir for lunch with friends. \u201cI lived in this hardcore designer studio with a living pad on the top,\u201d she explains, \u201cthen I\u2019d go to my friend\u2019s family house and it was like a comfort zone \u2013 just lovely.\u201d She asked her friends to give her first refusal on the property if they ever sold. \u201cWhen it came to it, though, I just couldn\u2019t buy it. Something within me couldn\u2019t deal with normality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cycling back from their house one evening, Webster saw the Mole Man\u2019s house. \u201cIt had \u2018Danger, keep out\u2019 stickers all over it. I pulled up and I rang Hackney council immediately.\u201d The voice on the end of the phone told Webster to search for \u201cMole Man\u201d online, which she did, there and then. \u201cThe lid just came off,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought: \u2018Wow, there\u2019s a project.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Webster tracked down the heir hunter and registered her interest in the property, but she had a hard time convincing him she was serious. \u201cOf course, he didn\u2019t take a blind bit of notice of me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a woman on a push bike: he didn\u2019t realise I had millions of pounds stuffed down my knickers.\u201d Undeterred, when the property was finally auctioned, Webster took her art dealer (\u201ca man in a suit\u201d) with her to do the bidding. Lyttle\u2019s keys with the cheap plastic fob were handed to her in 2012.</p> \n<p>Webster\u2019s initial vision for the house was a full-scale Victorian restoration. She talked to a couple of architects about reinstating the villa\u2019s original fixtures and fittings, creating a comfortable time capsule in contrast to the rigid minimalism of Dirty House. Then she showed Adjaye the building. \u201cHe just had this massive grin on his face,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI knew he could take on the enormity of what was ahead of us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Webster and Adjaye make a formidable design partnership. This is her second home designed by the architect (\u201cNot many people can say that,\u201d she says gleefully), coming after Dirty House: a factory conversion with a double-height studio and a top-floor apartment hidden behind a parapet wall under an illuminated roof. Mirrored glass and black external render gave the building a hefty presence in a changing neighbourhood and it became a breakthrough project for Adjaye. \u201cHe got a lot from that, so there\u2019s a level of respect for one another,\u201d Webster reflects. \u201cIf I ring David, he\u2019ll pick up the phone.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a85960ad89bb3bb56a4f7d50556ffb4398bea8b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a85960ad89bb3bb56a4f7d50556ffb4398bea8b/1168_0_7289_7291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engineered pine and concrete in a hallway featuring one of Webster\u2019s artworks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineered pine and concrete in a hallway featuring one of Webster\u2019s artworks.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6d35eee73dfeddb03e129442aba861f334659276\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d35eee73dfeddb03e129442aba861f334659276/0_1677_5833_5143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street-facing windows are covered in mirrored vinyl, giving the appearance of someone in mirrored sunglasses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"882\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street-facing windows are covered in mirrored vinyl, giving the appearance of someone in mirrored sunglasses.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mole House, as it is now known, sits on a sharp point between two roads with views of Dalston Junction.

Adjaye wanted to fabricate a new street entrance, but Webster insisted on keeping the green gate. It\u2019s a conversation the pair must have had over and over \u2013 a dialogue written across the entire facade. \u201cWe\u2019ve rebuilt the house entirely on the inside,\u201d Webster explains, \u201cbut on the outside we wanted to restore it as much as possible.\u201d In the sunken courtyard garden, there are three visible types of concrete: Mole Man\u2019s handmade batch, full of pipes, rubble and waste; Hackney council\u2019s half-hearted aerated addition; and Adjaye\u2019s dense, deliberate sharp edges. On the building\u2019s facade, the wrinkled stucco remains largely untouched and there are still traces of regulation yellow spray paint on the bay windows, which have been rebuilt in steel and cast concrete.</p> \n<p>There are what Webster calls \u201cknowing design details\u201d. She points to the concrete \u201cbelly band\u201d that wraps around the middle of the building \u2013 a structural device that supports the concrete frame within. At the top of the roof, the cracked facade ends in a crisp line of brickwork, topped with a neat steel band. Neighbours complained that it \u201clooks like a bombed-out bunker from Basra\u201d. Webster took that as a compliment. \u201cI really didn\u2019t feel the need to unify it and paint it white. This is the history of this building: why deny it? Why cover it up? I may as well demolish it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de8f72517156f47e238cb1d72d981faf61bbd80d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de8f72517156f47e238cb1d72d981faf61bbd80d/0_599_7317_4392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The living area of Mole House, featuring a Max Lamb coffee table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The living area of Mole House, featuring a Max Lamb coffee table.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The street-facing windows have been covered in mirrored vinyl, which gives the house the same slightly unnerving appearance of someone in mirrored sunglasses.

Warm, heavily grained douglas fir joinery is used throughout.</p> \n<p>From the front door (in Adjaye-aged steel), a generous entrance leads to Webster\u2019s open-plan living area. There are three mirrored bays at this level: a circular dining table and chairs have been placed in front of one; a white plinth with <a href=\"https://www.artimage.org.uk/7099/tim-noble-and-sue-webster/double-negative--2009\">Noble and Webster\u2019s Double Negative sculpture</a> sits in another.

(\u201cThey wanted to give me cupboards, but I said just give me a shelf for artwork.\u201d) In the middle of the space, curled up on a dark, low sofa facing a lumpen <a href=\"http://maxlamb.org/\">Max Lamb</a> coffee table and 20 metres of custom-made shelving, is Webster\u2019s black cat, Baby. Aside from the sofa, soft furnishings are nonexistent.</p> \n<p>Upstairs, a simple, custom-made desk has been fitted on the landing at the top of the staircase. This is where Webster sits and draws.

The double-height space has been dug out from the foundations. In the main space, a white wall reaches nearly 5 metres to the ceiling, which is lit by a zigzag of fluorescent striplights. On the day of my visit, the wall is installed with Webster\u2019s latest work, The Crime Scene \u2013 an unpacking of the artist\u2019s teenage years.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt all stemmed from these three boxes that I\u2019ve carried around with me throughout life,\u201d Webster explains. \u201cWhen I left home, my dad packed up my bedroom and gave me these boxes. In them was all my stuff: my diaries, my T-shirts, my concert tickets, my NME collection, my cassette tapes. They all travelled with me and when I moved out of Dirty House, I had all this stuff and I decided to open it all up. It was almost like a moving on or letting go.\u201d Webster\u2019s recent book, I Was a Teenage Banshee, is the counterpart to this work. In it are photographs of the objects that appear here, and essays she has written that examine her teenage years, including the time she spent in a mental health unit.</p> \n<p>In the centre of the wall is a black-and-white passport-sized photo of Webster, aged 11. Orbiting her portrait are four albums by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/siouxsieandthebanshees\">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>. \u201cI came up with this theory that everything I\u2019ve learned in life came from listening to these first four albums,\u201d Webster explains. The essays in her book back this up. In the studio, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/myblackbaby/?hl=en\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/myblackbaby/?hl=en\">neon orange thread</a> ties the objects together, forming a web of interconnected influences and experiences leading the 11-year-old from Leicester and Siouxsie Sioux to Germany, Bauhaus, fascism, Italian futurism and beyond. Her overalls are up here, as is her wedding dress and several packets of Walkers crisps (made in her home town). The Noble and Webster sculptures <a href=\"http://www.timnobleandsuewebster.com/bad_little_christmas_tree.html\">Bad Little Christmas Tree</a> and <a href=\"http://www.timnobleandsuewebster.com/spinning_heads_2005.html\">Untitled (Spinning Heads)</a> are woven in, too. The installation reads like a giant self-portrait.</p> \n<p>Moving into Mole House has made Webster reflect on her own freedom as an artist. \u201cI get up in the morning, I do what the hell I like and I go to bed. That\u2019s a good day. With [the house], we were constantly coming up against invented rules and boundaries \u2013 something that I don\u2019t quite understand in life.\u201d Through working with Adjaye, those boundaries were pushed and a piece of local \u2013 and personal \u2013 history survives.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847868209\">I Was a Teenage Banshee</a> by Sue Webster is </em><em>published by Rizzoli</em><strong> </strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Just inside the artist Sue Webster\u2019s front door, crafted from grey cardboard, is the architect\u2019s model of her house. On top is a pyramid roof that Webster lifts up. \u201cThis bit we haven\u2019t done yet,\u201d she confesses. \u201cWe\u2019d been building for five years: I needed the project to stop.\u201d Tucked under the roof on the top floor of the model is a set of keys that belonged to the previous owner. On the cheap plastic key fob is the name \u201cLyttle\u201d. William Lyttle lived in De Beauvoir Town, east London, for more than four decades. He was known locally as the Mole Man because, since the early 60s, he had been digging beneath his double-fronted Victorian villa. He broke through the foundations, creating a series of tunnels and caverns \u2013 some up to 8 metres deep and travelling as far as 20 metres from his house \u2013 shored up by handmade concrete pillars. When he was eventually evicted in 2006, he told the press: \u201cI just have a big basement.\u201d The council removed more than 30 tonnes of waste from the grounds of his house, including three cars and a boat, before filling the tunnels with 2,000 tonnes of aerated concrete and erecting a corrugated iron fence around the site. Lyttle died in 2010, leaving the decrepit property in the hands of a company of heir hunters. In the years that followed, the roof collapsed and buddleia began to grow from the brickwork. At the time Webster was living and working with her then husband and creative partner, Tim Noble, in Dirty House \u2013 the architect David Adjaye\u2019s second commission, completed in 2002. Noble and Webster\u2019s work had recently appeared in Apocalypse at the Royal Academy and in MoMa in New York.

Warm, heavily grained douglas fir joinery is used throughout. From the front door (in Adjaye-aged steel), a generous entrance leads to Webster\u2019s open-plan living area.

Aside from the sofa, soft furnishings are nonexistent. Upstairs, a simple, custom-made desk has been fitted on the landing at the top of the staircase. This is where Webster sits and draws. There is one master bedroom, and a guest room furnished with only a sofa and a leather punchbag that hangs from a hook in the ceiling (Webster kickboxes). The monochrome main bathroom has been tiled in a disorienting zigzag pattern: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit Twin Peaks,\u201d Webster admits. On the window ledge are a couple of boxes of black hair dye. They could be from Boots, or be another Noble and Webster artwork. (Simply Natural was a photomontage created by the duo in 1999. In it, their faces are superimposed on to packets of black hair dye.)

Orbiting her portrait are four albums by Siouxsie and the Banshees. \u201cI came up with this theory that everything I\u2019ve learned in life came from listening to these first four albums,\u201d Webster explains. The essays in her book back this up. In the studio, a neon orange thread ties the objects together, forming a web of interconnected influences and experiences leading the 11-year-old from Leicester and Siouxsie Sioux to Germany, Bauhaus, fascism, Italian futurism and beyond. Her overalls are up here, as is her wedding dress and several packets of Walkers crisps (made in her home town). The Noble and Webster sculptures Bad Little Christmas Tree and Untitled (Spinning Heads) are woven in, too. The installation reads like a giant self-portrait. Moving into Mole House has made Webster reflect on her own freedom as an artist. \u201cI get up in the morning, I do what the hell I like and I go to bed. That\u2019s a good day. With [the house], we were constantly coming up against invented rules and boundaries \u2013 something that I don\u2019t quite understand in life.\u201d Through working with Adjaye, those boundaries were pushed and a piece of local \u2013 and personal \u2013 history survives. I Was a Teenage Banshee by Sue Webster is published by Rizzoli",

That\u2019s the argument of Adam\u2019s sophomore show Hang Fire, and it\u2019s as unremarkable as I\u2019ve made it sound until her big reveal, 10 minutes from the end. Until then, this is no more than a likable standup set, elucidating Adam\u2019s hokey philosophy of mistake-making with teenage anecdotes and tales of the misbehaving famous. We hear about an illicit New Year\u2019s Eve party that she tries to conceal from her mum, and about the clumsy retreat she once beat from a one-night stand.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9AOcWLQJWo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f9AOcWLQJWo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Chortle preview of Maisie Adam\u2019s 2018 Edinburgh show Vague</figcaption> </figure>   <p>With her gawky mannerisms and amusing routines on, say, the hierarchy of women\u2019s pants, it\u2019s endearing stuff, the more so because the Yorkshire native is ploughing on tonight through a severe cold.

A greater portion of the show should be dedicated to the extraordinary story she then tells \u2013 which left me wanting to know more.

Maisie Adam\u2019s stage is decorated with photos strung from a clothes line: mugshots of celebs brought low by their public indiscretions. Here is Hugh Grant, rueful but raffish after being caught on Sunset Boulevard with his pants down. Here\u2019s Winona Ryder, repenting the theft of $5,000 worth of underwear. Adam has a kind word for them all. They screwed up, but at least, she says, they owned their mistakes. Who among us could do more? That\u2019s the argument of Adam\u2019s sophomore show Hang Fire, and it\u2019s as unremarkable as I\u2019ve made it sound until her big reveal, 10 minutes from the end. Until then, this is no more than a likable standup set, elucidating Adam\u2019s hokey philosophy of mistake-making with teenage anecdotes and tales of the misbehaving famous. We hear about an illicit New Year\u2019s Eve party that she tries to conceal from her mum, and about the clumsy retreat she once beat from a one-night stand. With her gawky mannerisms and amusing routines on, say, the hierarchy of women\u2019s pants, it\u2019s endearing stuff, the more so because the Yorkshire native is ploughing on tonight through a severe cold. But it\u2019s only in this short set\u2019s latter moments that the personal significance becomes clear of her warning against rushes to judgment in the court of public opinion. A greater portion of the show should be dedicated to the extraordinary story she then tells \u2013 which left me wanting to know more. As it is, this is personable, pedestrian standup distinguished by a sucker-punch final act. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, 15 January. Then touring until 30 May.",

She does this under her breath, the way a dentist uses that odd numerical language to gossip about your molars right in front of you. \u201cChin 11.8, Mid aux 22, Supra 45.\u201d I shudder from the touch of cold callipers on my skin as this last measurement is taken from my suprailiac area. Closer acquaintances would, I suppose, call them my love handles, but Sarah is good enough to keep things mildly formal, perhaps to offset the fact that she is measuring the fat on my body just a few minutes into our first meeting. I am standing in her office at <a href=\"https://roar-fitness.com/\" title=\"\">R</a><a href=\"https://roar-fitness.com/\" title=\"\">oar Fitness</a>, and my initial consultation is under way. It is Day 0 of my physical transformation plan and, following a brief chat, my top is off and it\u2019s straight to the skin folds. This term itself is not ideal. Skin folds. It\u2019s standard anatomical parlance, but it conjures images of oversized wildlife \u2013 hippos hoist into the air so the zoo can wash their meaty shanks. I am, of course, making these connections because I am staring in the mirror as all this is being done and noticing, perhaps for the first time, how much my body has changed in the past couple of years.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/13/harry-hill-kidz-show-how-to-be-funny-for-kids\" title=\"\">Harry Hill</a> says he knew he was going bald when it started taking longer and longer to wash his face. I first noticed I was gaining weight when I started having to reach a little further to wash my sides in the shower. That and realising, around the time my son was six months old, that his adorable little pot belly and my own seemed to bear a family resemblance. If I\u2019m being honest, my body\u2019s journey from lad bod to dad bod preceded fatherhood. I spent my youth as that skinny, lanky child who never put on any weight. But with advancing age came lower metabolism, and a move away from retail and minimum wage jobs that kept me on my feet all day, to more settled and sedentary creative pursuits that see me now, aged 34, heartier than I once was.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a remarkable story, I grant you. Mine is the experience of millions of people my age, and a minor version of the process compared to millions more. The UK is in the middle of an obesity crisis: over 60% of the population is overweight and roughly a third of UK adults are obese. Figures for children are equally shocking.</p> <p>So, no, the love handles you see on these pages, squishy as they are, don\u2019t constitute a grand horror story, nor are they anything to be ashamed of. I was mostly healthy and, overall, happy with myself, but I also felt a little slower to move and lift and spring to attention, and chasing a toddler around had put these changes in stark relief.

It\u2019s a curious quirk of our current age that, as we grow ever more lightbulb-shaped, a head-spinning profusion of diets, fitness regimens, self-health books and body-shaping plans has exploded. Physical transformation has, in theory, never been more accessible to those of us who find themselves the unexpected proprietor of a nascent dad bod, and theres\u2019s no shortage of social pressures for us to avail of them.</p> <p>It should be said that some of this focus on health doesn\u2019t seem particularly healthy. Short-term body projects are complicated, controversial things. Doctors don\u2019t tend to recommend them, for fear of the mental and physical damage sparked when a desired physical form is unrealised. The ideal male physique is now everywhere around us, from the pneumatic tightness of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a></em> contestants, to the preened and perfect bods of Instagram fitness gurus selling us diet teas, gamified fitness trackers and wellness apps. It is a taunt, unattainable and unsustainable \u2013 a 12-week course at Roar costs more than \u00a33,000. In agreeing to write this article, I kept telling people I was looking forward to doing the mildly silly Before and After shots, precisely because I find the \u201cblack-and-white-sad-man versus full-colour-beefcake\u201d contrast so ridiculous. As a congenitally cynical person, I was incredulous as to how real or positive those images were. But, if I\u2019m honest, some of that curiosity was borne of having passed those images a thousand times, patting my belly, and wondering if I could achieve similar results.</p> <p><em><strong>At R</strong></em><em><strong>oar, I embarked </strong></em>on a fitness and diet plan aimed at getting me from dad bod to rad bod in just seven weeks. (They would have had me do it longer, but since we were starting at Halloween, a suitably festive Halloween-to-Christmas arc was agreed, in the hopes that my reaction to my workouts would likewise turn from horror and darkness to joy and good tidings.) Now, finished with my folds, Sarah is quick to point out the difficulty of my task. \u201cNo one does this in seven weeks,\u201d she says, \u201cso we\u2019re really going to have to push you.\u201d I feel a pit somewhere in my stomach open. I\u2019m fairly sure that what she terms \u201cpushing\u201d I am likely to consider borderline inhuman. Sarah is a three-time Olympian and nine-time British speed-skating champion, who runs Roar Fitness with her partner, Rich Phillipps. They specialise in physical overhauls. The walls of their site near Moorgate are decked with Before and After shots that show dramatic \u2013 sometimes scarcely believable \u2013 changes in short spaces of time. None, however, as short as seven weeks. \u201cThese are 12 weeks, 16 weeks,\u201d she says, pointing at the grid of achievements. Some depict programmes spanning half a year.</p> <p>Seven weeks means a radical dismantling of my diet, excluding all booze, dairy and oils, and a near total ban on carbs, fat and sugar \u2013 even fruit. All this before I begin my exercise routine, which starts each day with a 40-minute pre-breakfast run, followed, three times a week, by a weights session with a personal trainer. When my full plan arrives in my inbox on Halloween night, I shoo my loved ones off to enjoy their trick or treating and ponder what exactly I\u2019ve let myself in for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af4d809ad3c7fd3ed77fb6aa26778e0b2e1b024c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af4d809ad3c7fd3ed77fb6aa26778e0b2e1b024c/0_435_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Powering through: hitting the weights with personal trainer Alex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Powering through: hitting the weights with personal trainer Alex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within the diet\u2019s first few days the answer to that question is clear. My breakfast of salmon and eggs with green veg isn\u2019t, in and of itself, particularly onerous. Nor the chicken and veg for lunch or the white fish with veg for dinner. They are all, with certain tweaks, meals I could imagine enjoying in any other context. But that context would almost certainly involve butter, oil, cream and, I soon realise, the numerous extra little treats I clearly wasn\u2019t tabulating in my assessment of my moderately healthy, but gloriously unrestricted, diet.</p> <p>Worse is the lack of variety, since my diet prescribes those exact same three meals every single day with no variation, save a daily allowance of 21 olives \u2013 not 20 or 22 \u2013 and a protein shake to be taken after every workout.</p> <p>The workout is a crash course in upper-body exercises with Alex, my trainer. \u201cSo,\u201d he says on Day 1, \u201cwill this be your first workout?\u201d I don\u2019t know if he means my first workout for this project, or my first workout ever. I say \u201cyes\u201d, because it\u2019s true of both questions. I have never used exercise equipment in my life, never lifted a weight or troubled the pedals of a stationary bike.</p> <p>Alex is patient and kind as he introduces the machines, taking great care to describe them to me in the way I talk to my dad about internet memes \u2013 slowly, while leaving judicious gaps for the many, many questions that will arise.</p> <p><em><strong>Woody Allen famously</strong></em> described Arnold Schwarzenegger as having \u201cmuscles in places where I don\u2019t even have places\u201d. I thought of this quote often as these sessions began forcing unfamiliar patches of meat into action. Suddenly I was aware of \u201cplaces\u201d in my body that didn\u2019t exist before, pains I couldn\u2019t even readily identify. It was like growing six invisible new foreheads all over my body, and getting a zesty little migraine in each. I began to realise that my frame had been carrying a lot of passengers, muscles that had sat in the background of my body like those slightly less prominent members of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/24/urban\" title=\"\">So Solid Crew</a>. Now they jolted into life, shrivelled and screaming in the darkness of my arms, shoulders and back, roaring to let them return to 30 years of unbroken sleep. Alex had other ideas, however, and quickly set about reducing me to a sweaty nub of offal each Monday, Wednesday and Friday, until that constant, heady state of alarm dulled to a dim resentment and, even, something like satisfaction from their first honest days\u2019 work in my lifetime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4cf1b46b2f000340d73a5f966bc2ff23ba3b210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4cf1b46b2f000340d73a5f966bc2ff23ba3b210/0_752_4480_5456/821.jpg\" alt=\"working out with elastic bands\" width=\"821\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I began to feel better about myself in a way that transcended looking good in photos.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw some drastic improvements quite early, dropping nearly a stone in the first two weeks. A large part of this, I reckoned, was the absence of booze. I didn\u2019t think of myself as a heavy drinker, but now had to realise I was treating a nightly glass or two of wine as not just commonplace, but common sense. It had become my accompaniment to every dinner, and a reward for each tiring, overspent day. Within four weeks, I realised my morning runs were not just more manageable, but \u2013 and I am disturbed to even write this \u2013 enjoyable.</p> <p>When tracking my progress in those first few weeks, friends often asked if I felt different, and I found it hard to answer. I mean I guess I did, but the exact manner of this difference was hard to quantify. I did feel stronger, but I was also usually slightly sore from working out for the first time in my life. I was running faster and for longer, but was also more fatigued between runs as I was having fewer rest days. Not drinking had probably left me more clear-headed in the mornings, but I\u2019ve never suffered overly from hangovers so it was hard to really know how much better I felt when they went away entirely.</p> <p>Moreover, any sense of wellbeing these improvements should have engendered was tainted by my reflexive tendency for self-pity, since I spent the first few weeks extraordinarily resentful of the diet. Had I been on a longer course, say 12 or 16 weeks, it wouldn\u2019t have been so severe, but I started to realise just how much of my life was mapped around mealtimes, how much excitement I take from food \u2013 cooking and eating and hosting, all of which was now denied me.</p> <p>For the record, I\u2019m delighted that I take so much joy in food and, for all I might amend my more extreme acts of gluttony, or portion sizes, this experience means I will never again take that joy for granted. To my amazement, however, I grew to enjoy the various seasonings and spices I could use on my same three meals, and stopped missing my nightly wines within the first week or two. The same could not be said for other, less expected, abstinences. I found myself daydreaming about the rich, warm waft of butter on toast, the first creamy mouthful of a buttered spud and the quotidian ecstasy of an honest-to-goodness cup of tea. Teas were, incidentally, included in my approved list, but milk was off the menu, and I\u2019m sorry but black tea is horrible.</p> <p>By the fourth and fifth week, I found my appetite had changed sufficiently that I no longer looked at my diet in horror, but as a job to be done. As much as I looked forward to all the old joys that eating offers, I was surprised, and pleased, by a newfound ability to maintain discipline, if only for the novelty of it. Stranger still, I was now relishing my workouts, as the weights I was moving doubled in quick time. I looked forward to my time with Alex, and the belief he had in my ability to push further and further each day.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprisingly of all, I was beginning to admit how much I enjoyed the physical changes to my body. I was thinner, yes, but I was also stronger and felt, undeniably, better about myself in a manner that transcended simply looking better in photos or fitting in old clothes again. \u201cYou see people change through the process so much,\u201d Sarah says when I mention this. \u201cEspecially when it comes to getting strong. People come, a lot of the time, to lose weight, but when they start to get stronger, it\u2019s really empowering.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah has an open, easy manner and the unfaked enthusiasm of one of those cool young teachers you end up wanting to impress. I realise, to my shame, that before I\u2019d started this thing I\u2019d been worried \u2013 actually, dimly terrified \u2013 about how all these fit, beautiful people would regard my shlubby frame and wobbly bits. By the end of my seven weeks, I\u2019d been disarmed by their patience and empathy and their understanding of how transforming the physical affects the psychological. \u201cHonestly,\u201d she tells me, \u201cit\u2019s more than half the job. People do this because a lot of the time they don\u2019t feel good. Maybe eight out of 10 people cry in their initial consultation, because they end up saying out loud for the first time that they\u2019re not happy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e241c0ba6a6bbd5adf4bc63f8a5ded2fc8428c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e241c0ba6a6bbd5adf4bc63f8a5ded2fc8428c9/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Before and after: \u2018With seven weeks to play with, I was never going to end up a bodybuilder, but I\u2019d attained a leanness I hadn\u2019t considered possible.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Before and after: \u2018With seven weeks to play with, I was never going to end up a bodybuilder, but I\u2019d attained a leanness I hadn\u2019t considered possible.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roar fitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>I realise I\u2019d spent</strong></em> my life carrying around certain self-serving fictions about health and fitness that this modicum of effort had challenged.

I was running 5km in 22 minutes, having started at closer to 30, but was prouder still that I no longer needed to pause for breath when picking up my son. I\u2019d expected to shift a bit of flab and generate enough content to make a gently self-deprecating article that charted my unlikely transition from slob to slightly-fitter slob.

      "bodyText": "Sarah Lindsay recites numbers as she pinches my folds. She does this under her breath, the way a dentist uses that odd numerical language to gossip about your molars right in front of you. \u201cChin 11.8, Mid aux 22, Supra 45.\u201d I shudder from the touch of cold callipers on my skin as this last measurement is taken from my suprailiac area. Closer acquaintances would, I suppose, call them my love handles, but Sarah is good enough to keep things mildly formal, perhaps to offset the fact that she is measuring the fat on my body just a few minutes into our first meeting. I am standing in her office at Roar Fitness, and my initial consultation is under way. It is Day 0 of my physical transformation plan and, following a brief chat, my top is off and it\u2019s straight to the skin folds. This term itself is not ideal. Skin folds. It\u2019s standard anatomical parlance, but it conjures images of oversized wildlife \u2013 hippos hoist into the air so the zoo can wash their meaty shanks. I am, of course, making these connections because I am staring in the mirror as all this is being done and noticing, perhaps for the first time, how much my body has changed in the past couple of years. Harry Hill says he knew he was going bald when it started taking longer and longer to wash his face. I first noticed I was gaining weight when I started having to reach a little further to wash my sides in the shower. That and realising, around the time my son was six months old, that his adorable little pot belly and my own seemed to bear a family resemblance. If I\u2019m being honest, my body\u2019s journey from lad bod to dad bod preceded fatherhood. I spent my youth as that skinny, lanky child who never put on any weight. But with advancing age came lower metabolism, and a move away from retail and minimum wage jobs that kept me on my feet all day, to more settled and sedentary creative pursuits that see me now, aged 34, heartier than I once was. This isn\u2019t a remarkable story, I grant you. Mine is the experience of millions of people my age, and a minor version of the process compared to millions more. The UK is in the middle of an obesity crisis: over 60% of the population is overweight and roughly a third of UK adults are obese. Figures for children are equally shocking. So, no, the love handles you see on these pages, squishy as they are, don\u2019t constitute a grand horror story, nor are they anything to be ashamed of. I was mostly healthy and, overall, happy with myself, but I also felt a little slower to move and lift and spring to attention, and chasing a toddler around had put these changes in stark relief. I also have a family history of diabetes and bowel disorders, and wondered if I could make the changes necessary to offset later risks. And, I\u2019d noticed, the tools to offset those risks seemed to be everywhere. It\u2019s a curious quirk of our current age that, as we grow ever more lightbulb-shaped, a head-spinning profusion of diets, fitness regimens, self-health books and body-shaping plans has exploded. Physical transformation has, in theory, never been more accessible to those of us who find themselves the unexpected proprietor of a nascent dad bod, and theres\u2019s no shortage of social pressures for us to avail of them.

Doctors don\u2019t tend to recommend them, for fear of the mental and physical damage sparked when a desired physical form is unrealised. The ideal male physique is now everywhere around us, from the pneumatic tightness of Love Island contestants, to the preened and perfect bods of Instagram fitness gurus selling us diet teas, gamified fitness trackers and wellness apps.

But, if I\u2019m honest, some of that curiosity was borne of having passed those images a thousand times, patting my belly, and wondering if I could achieve similar results. At Roar, I embarked on a fitness and diet plan aimed at getting me from dad bod to rad bod in just seven weeks. (They would have had me do it longer, but since we were starting at Halloween, a suitably festive Halloween-to-Christmas arc was agreed, in the hopes that my reaction to my workouts would likewise turn from horror and darkness to joy and good tidings.)

When my full plan arrives in my inbox on Halloween night, I shoo my loved ones off to enjoy their trick or treating and ponder what exactly I\u2019ve let myself in for.

The workout is a crash course in upper-body exercises with Alex, my trainer. \u201cSo,\u201d he says on Day 1, \u201cwill this be your first workout?\u201d I don\u2019t know if he means my first workout for this project, or my first workout ever.

With seven weeks to play with, I was never going to end up a bodybuilder, but I\u2019d attained a leanness I hadn\u2019t considered possible, remapped the frontiers of my own endurance, and shed 2st. But I was mostly delighted with smaller improvements I\u2019d made along the way \u2013 lifting more, running harder. I was running 5km in 22 minutes, having started at closer to 30, but was prouder still that I no longer needed to pause for breath when picking up my son. I\u2019d expected to shift a bit of flab and generate enough content to make a gently self-deprecating article that charted my unlikely transition from slob to slightly-fitter slob. It is with a mixture of horror and delight I can report that this transformation was more, well, transformative than that.

Over the years, Guilding (who blogs at The Bible of British Taste and writes regularly for The World of Interiors) has filled the soulful interiors with a combination of local craft, original artworks and thrifty finds. In the dining room \u2013 which overlooks the deep, clear waters of the cove \u2013 the shelves are chock-a-block with studio ware from the Leach Pottery in St Ives and the Wenford Bridge Pottery on Bodmin Moor. In the front room, the sofas have been covered in antique Welsh tapestry blankets, sourced decades ago from the market in Carmarthen. Paintings by local artists Breon O\u2019Casey, Roy Conn and Vanessa Gardiner line the corridors and there\u2019s hand-blocked wallpaper by Marthe Armitage in the bunk room. An artistic, creative retreat in this underpopulated spot near Penzance. \u2022 From \u00a3550 a week (sleeps 2-8); lamornacovehouse.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She told the Sky News programme Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI do want to abolish the House of Lords and we\u2019ll be rolling out as my campaign progresses how we intend to really shake up that constitutional package. \u201cMPs like myself, we\u2019re fed up of the Westminster bubble, and fed up of our communities feeling like decisions about their lives are made in Westminster consistently. We\u2019ve got to shift power and wealth into our communities.\u201d On how the work of MPs would be scrutinised with no upper chamber, she said: \u201cThere would need to be checks and balances in place but to have a set of completely unelected people doing that I don\u2019t think is right. We need to have people who are able, experts and democratically accountable to the community that they represent, not people appointed by parties.\u201d Long-Bailey, who has positioned herself as the most leftwing of the leadership candidates, also said she could support a second referendum on Scottish independence if she was ever elected prime minister, despite wanting to retain the union. She said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to inhibit the democracy of people because that\u2019s one of the most fundamental pillars that we\u2019re proud of in this country, but I don\u2019t support in any way the breaking up of Scotland from the UK. \u201cI\u2019m fully committed to the union and I don\u2019t think that should be shaken in any way, but ultimately the people of Scotland need to make the case and they\u2019ve got their own parliament to determine whether they want to push that and that will be for me as a prime minister to review and to look at.\u201d She refused to rate Corbyn out of 10 for his handling of antisemitism, but said the former leader did bear personal responsibility for the issue. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the way our process was being run, I\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t think we were dealing with complaints quickly enough and I think that\u2019s quite clear, I\u2019ve been quite vocal about that. I also felt that there should have been a level of independence to the allegations, the way they were investigated,\u201d she said. Asked if she ever spoke up herself and challenged Corbyn on how the process was working, she said: \u201cI did, I did, I mean I spoke to Jeremy about it, I spoke to the various members of the team, I spoke to various members of the national executive committee about that.\u201d References to her being the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn candidate\u201d in the race, were \u201cannoying\u201d, she said, but she agreed she was a socialist. \u201cIt annoys me when people say that and unfortunately, as a woman, it annoys me even more. I\u2019m a person in my own right,\u201d she said. On running an effective joint ticket with Angela Rayner, who is standing to be deputy leader of the party, she said: \u201cWe always joked, to be honest, that the pair of us, that if it ever goes wrong, \u2018you know it\u2019s going to be me and you that\u2019s going to have to sort it out\u2019\u2026 and then when we had the defeat and it was devastating. \u201cWe both sat down and was like, you know we were joking, you know we actually are going to think about this.\u201d Meanwhile Emily Thornberry, who is also hoping to become leader, said she believes she has enough nominations to become the fifth leadership candidate to go through to the next phase of the election. The shadow foreign secretary, who was once one of the most prominent people in Corbyn\u2019s team and deputised for him at prime minister\u2019s questions, has so far struggled to get support for her bid. She has 10 nominations but expects to hit the threshold of 22 nominations by Monday afternoon\u2019s deadline. She told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: \u201cFrom the conversations I\u2019ve had this weekend I\u2019m fairly confident that so long as I don\u2019t get any slippage, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll get across the line and then we move on to the next stage. \u201cI\u2019ve been a slow starter but I did start from a standing start after the general election.\u201d The former barrister, who backed remaining in the EU and a second referendum, said she could withstand the ups and downs of the leadership contest as she comes from a long line of \u201ctough old birds\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Renee Salt had just turned 15 when she arrived at the gates of hell. Her journey with her parents to Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp near Krak\u00f3w in German-occupied Poland, was by cattle truck, wedged in with hundreds of other Jews, no food, water or air for 24 hours. On arrival, the men were separated from women and children; Renee, who was born in Poland, never saw her father again.</p> <p>She and her mother stood in line. The \u201cAngel of Death\u201d \u2013 Nazi SS officer Josef Mengele, a doctor who conducted cruel experiments on prisoners \u2013 stood at the head of the queue. \u201cWhenever he saw two people holding hands he would split them up with a flick of his hand, one to die and one to live,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.

In my mind, I can see everything that happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were taken to a hall, everyone was stripped and had their heads shaved. They took all our possessions, jewellery, watches, everything. We were all saying prayers, hugging and kissing one another as we thought this was our last hour.\u201d</p> <p>Instead they were given a piece of white linen with a number printed on it, which they had to pin to the clothing they had been allocated \u2013 in Renee\u2019s case, an oversized skirt and a man\u2019s pyjama jacket. No shoes or underwear were provided. For several weeks, the prisoners sat in rows on the stone floor of a hut, day and night.</p> <p>\u201cWe were taken to the latrines once a day. Also once a day they brought soup in a pan, one for every five people. There were always arguments \u2013 \u2018you\u2019ve had three sips already\u2019. Everyone wanted the soup from the bottom of the pot because it was a bit thicker. We were not allowed to talk. We had to sleep as we were sitting.</p> <p>\u201cTwice a day we had roll calls outside the hut. Very often people collapsed from weakness. Sometimes someone would die. We were treated just like animals.\u201d</p> <p>Now aged 90, Renee will soon again stand at the gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau. Along with up to 200 other Holocaust survivors and scores of heads of state, political leaders and dignitaries, she will mark the 75th anniversary on 27 January of the camp\u2019s liberation by Soviet soldiers. A ceremony will include speeches by survivors, and by Andrzej Duda, the Polish president, and Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress. Britain will be represented by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.</p> <p>Among other events to mark the anniversary and <a href=\"https://www.hmd.org.uk/what-is-holocaust-memorial-day/this-years-theme/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy_OnirL55gIVR7TtCh1bWQb6EAAYASAAEgIIhvD_BwE\" title=\"\">Holocaust Memorial Day</a> is a global forum on Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism, at Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s memorial in Jerusalem, on 23 January. It will be attended by dozens of world leaders, including Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, Mike Pence, the US vice-president, and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president.

In the weeks before Red Army troops arrived on 27 January 1945, thousands of prisoners were shot, tens of thousands more forced on to death marches, and most of the gas chambers destroyed. About 7,000 prisoners remained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f70ac4438e2640473e8662c4db8f5720eec787fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f70ac4438e2640473e8662c4db8f5720eec787fc/0_560_3917_4891/801.jpg\" alt=\"Renee Salt\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renee Salt was 15 when she was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Renee Salt and her mother had been moved about four months earlier. They were first sent to do back-breaking demolition work in Hamburg, and then to the Bergen-Belsen death camp, which was liberated by British troops on 15 April 1945. Renee\u2019s 42-year-old mother died 12 days later and was buried in a mass grave; Renee was hospitalised for several weeks.</p> <p>From a huge extended family \u2013 including aunts, uncles and cousins, two sets of grandparents and even a great-grandparent \u2013 only Renee and three aunts survived the Holocaust. In 1949, she married a British soldier who had been part of the Bergen-Belsen liberation force, and the couple had two children and five grandchildren.</p> <p>For decades, she never spoke of her experiences even to her immediate family, enduring frequent nightmares in isolation. But eventually she accepted an invitation to tell her story to schoolchildren, and in 2005 the BBC broadcast a documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/grandchild-of-the-holocaust/zbxhwty\" title=\"\">Grandchild of the Holocaust</a></em>, about Renee and her grandson, Adrian, then aged 13.</p> <p>She returned to Auschwitz for the first time while making the programme. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go. I was shaking, I was so frightened, it was terrible. But I sort of buried the ghost,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Since then, she has returned dozens of times \u2013 but this visit may be one of the last. Seventy-five years after the end of the second world war, inevitably the number of Holocaust survivors is rapidly dwindling. At a time when antisemitism is rising once again in Europe, \u201cthis may be the last significant anniversary we commemorate with eyewitnesses who endured the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust,\u201d said Karen Pollock of the Holocaust Educational Trust.</p> <p>As well as all the facts, dates and numbers relating to the Holocaust, the world has, for many decades now, been able to \u201csee the faces of people who did not learn about Auschwitz from books and films but actually, tangibly and physically, experienced this hell\u201d, said Piotr Cywi\u0144ski, director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and museum.</p> <p>Survivors have become \u201cmoral symbols \u2013 not just of survival but also of resilience\u201d, said Michael Berenbaum, a Holocaust scholar at the American Jewish University in California. \u201cThey bore witness to the worst humanity can be, and became voices for dignity, tolerance and decency. The idea that we\u2019re going to lose that generation is enormously painful; we will lose the authenticity that comes from someone who can say \u2018I was there\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But, he added, \u201cno generation has left behind as great a historical record\u201d, including memoirs, art, music and video testimony. \u201cAnd we have been planning for a decade or so how to teach about the Holocaust in the absence of living witnesses.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/\" title=\"\">Yad Vashem</a> holds an extensive archive of video, oral and written testimonies. In 2016, the UK National Holocaust Centre and Museum in Newark launched an innovative way of preserving the responses of survivors to children\u2019s questions. <a href=\"https://foreverproject.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Forever Project</a> has created lifesize images of survivors which, using digital technology, can \u201canswer\u201d questions in real time from hundreds of pre-recorded replies. The centre has also produced a short film, telling <a href=\"https://www.edek.film/watch-film/edek-film\" title=\"\">the story of one survivor </a>through the medium of hip-hop, as a means of engaging young people.</p> <p>\u201cIn a climate of ignorance, trivialisation and denial, the primacy of first-hand testimony cannot be overstated,\u201d said Marc Cave, the centre\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe Forever Project is the single most important thing we\u2019ve done to future-proof Holocaust education for generations to come.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90abeede3571638d223268f22af8e078c45a17e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90abeede3571638d223268f22af8e078c45a17e9/0_242_1875_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children found at Auschwitz after the liberation of the camp in 1945.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children found at Auschwitz after the liberation of the camp in 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also \u201csecondary testimony\u201d \u2013 accounts from children and grandchildren of their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 stories. But many survivors\u2019 descendents also have their own stories to tell of living in the long shadow of the Holocaust.</p> <p>The impact on the \u201csecond generation\u201d has been extensively researched, with psychologists and academics noting symptoms of trauma such as clinical depression, anxiety, addiction and eating disorders among some descendants. Now it is being acknowledged that some of the third generation are also struggling under the weight of family history.</p> <p>Allison Nazarian\u2019s maternal grandparents survived Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, where her mother was born. She has written a book, <em><a href=\"https://allisonnazarian.com/\" title=\"\">Aftermath: A Granddaughter\u2019s Story of Legacy, Healing and Hope</a></em>, about her third-generation experience. \u201cI was close to my grandparents. They freely and graphically talked of their lives during the Holocaust. I absorbed their experiences. It was all I heard about. I was surrounded by the Holocaust; it was part of every story, every discussion, every day of my life,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI was told, \u2018they could come for us at any time, you have to be ready\u2019. Even now, I have a \u2018go bag\u2019 with passports and essentials. There are certain things I have an irrational fear of running out of. It was only at 12 or 13 I realised not everyone\u2019s grandparents were in the Holocaust. It made me who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Now 48, Nazarian decided she would not expose her children \u2013 the fourth generation \u2013 to the same trauma. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to sound as if I\u2019m resentful or regretful \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of my grandparents. But I don\u2019t think passing on the burden would help. My children are 100% free of it.\u201d</p> <p>A second-generation survivor, Naomi Levy, said descendants had a strong sense of an \u201coverall sense of loss and ghosts from the pasts\u201d. She went through a period of \u201ctrying to repel, to push it away\u201d but eventually embraced researching and recording her family history, \u201ctrying to piece everything together\u201d.</p> <p>With regard to her own children, now adults, she said: \u201cI wanted to protect them from it for as long as possible. I was very careful around the subject as they grew up. It\u2019s a balancing act \u2013 I don\u2019t want it to be a burden, but it is what it is. I think they will want to know more, but I\u2019m not going to make them face it.\u201d</p> <p>In Israel, a small number of third-generation survivors have had their grandparents\u2019 camp identification numbers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/world/middleeast/with-tattoos-young-israelis-bear-holocaust-scars-of-relatives.html\" title=\"\">tattooed on their own arms</a> as a memorial. The trend, although limited, has been controversial and shocking to many, and not just because of the Jewish prohibition on tattoos.</p> <p>But, for many, the young people\u2019s motive \u2013 \u201cnever forget\u201d \u2013 is more relevant than ever in a time of rising antisemitism, nationalism and populism. According to Cywi\u0144ski, the significance of this year\u2019s anniversary lies not just in the number of years since the liberation of Auschwitz, but is \u201crelated to the world we live in today. Antisemitism, racist and xenophobic reactions are being revived on an unexpected scale, and groups that openly promote hatred are on the rise. All this in the profound helplessness of our democratic institutions, weakened by populism and demagoguery, which have been reborn in so many countries around the world\u201d.</p> <p>It was a mistake to put the Holocaust into a box marked \u201chistory\u201d, said Cave. \u201cWhen we see <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50600887\" title=\"\">lesbians beaten up on a bus</a> or monkey chants at a football match, these are symptoms of \u2018othering\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly how the Holocaust and most genocides start. There is no greater lesson than the warning from history of the Holocaust.\u201d</p> <p>Renee Salt has told her story over and over again \u201cso that people shouldn\u2019t forget. There are still people who say it didn\u2019t happen, there are still deniers. But you can\u2019t hide people like me away. At the end of the war, we believed what happened could never and would never happen again. But now it\u2019s a worrying time.\u201d</p> <h2>In memory</h2> <p><strong>Auschwitz-Birkenau</strong><br>An official memorial event will mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp on 27 January, International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Up to 200 Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned at the camp will attend, along with heads of state from at least 22 countries. A ceremony at 3.30pm will be addressed by survivors, Poland\u2019s president Andrzej Duda, and Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress. It will end with the kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead.</p> <p><strong>Yad Vashem</strong><br>A forum under the banner Remembering the Holocaust, Fighting Antisemitism will be held at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial near Jerusalem. More than 40 state leaders, royals and other dignitaries will be there. Prince Charles will represent the UK as part of his first official visit to Israel. As well as meeting Holocaust survivors, Charles will also visit Bethlehem and meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. (A tweet last month from the British consulate in East Jerusalem welcoming Charles\u2019s visit to the \u201cOccupied Palestinian Territories\u201d was met with an <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/yair-netanyahu-attacks-uk-s-jerusalem-consulate-for-saying-occupied-palestinian-territories-1.494725\" title=\"\">undiplomatic riposte </a>from Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cGod willing you guys will be kicked out of Israel soon. Until then I\u2019m thinking of visiting the occupied lands of Scotland or Wales, which do you recommend?\u201d the younger Netanyahu tweeted.)</p> <p><strong>The BBC</strong><br>In the run-up to the anniversary, the BBC is broadcasting a range of documentaries and dramas, plus <em>Songs of Praise</em> from the UK National Holocaust Centre and Museum and live coverage of the commemoration in Poland. \u201cWe\u2019re offering everyone the chance to reflect on the consequences of prejudice and hatred, and in doing so we\u2019ll ensure that the millions of lives lost in the Holocaust are not forgotten,\u201d said Tony Hall, the BBC\u2019s director general.</p> <p><strong>The UK National Holocaust Centre and Museum</strong><br>The centre in Nottinghamshire \u2013 founded by a Christian family in 1991 \u2013 is taking a virtual reality exhibition, The Eye As Witness, around the country. It invites people to think critically about propaganda techniques and racism and hatred today.</p> <p><strong>75 Memorial Flames exhibition</strong><br>The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust invited organisations and community groups, including prisons, schools and faith groups, to make artworks featuring a <a href=\"https://www.hmd.org.uk/news/75-memorial-flames-selected-for-hmdts-national-exhibition/\" title=\"\">memorial flame</a>.

Along with up to 200 other Holocaust survivors and scores of heads of state, political leaders and dignitaries, she will mark the 75th anniversary on 27 January of the camp\u2019s liberation by Soviet soldiers. A ceremony will include speeches by survivors, and by Andrzej Duda, the Polish president, and Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress. Britain will be represented by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Among other events to mark the anniversary and Holocaust Memorial Day is a global forum on Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism, at Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s memorial in Jerusalem, on 23 January. It will be attended by dozens of world leaders, including Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, Mike Pence, the US vice-president, and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president. The Polish president pulled out last week, claiming he had been denied the opportunity to make a speech. At least 1.1 million people \u2013 mostly Jews \u2013 were murdered at Auschwitz, the largest of the Nazi death camps. In the weeks before Red Army troops arrived on 27 January 1945, thousands of prisoners were shot, tens of thousands more forced on to death marches, and most of the gas chambers destroyed. About 7,000 prisoners remained. Renee Salt and her mother had been moved about four months earlier. They were first sent to do back-breaking demolition work in Hamburg, and then to the Bergen-Belsen death camp, which was liberated by British troops on 15 April 1945. Renee\u2019s 42-year-old mother died 12 days later and was buried in a mass grave; Renee was hospitalised for several weeks. From a huge extended family \u2013 including aunts, uncles and cousins, two sets of grandparents and even a great-grandparent \u2013 only Renee and three aunts survived the Holocaust. In 1949, she married a British soldier who had been part of the Bergen-Belsen liberation force, and the couple had two children and five grandchildren. For decades, she never spoke of her experiences even to her immediate family, enduring frequent nightmares in isolation. But eventually she accepted an invitation to tell her story to schoolchildren, and in 2005 the BBC broadcast a documentary, Grandchild of the Holocaust, about Renee and her grandson, Adrian, then aged 13. She returned to Auschwitz for the first time while making the programme. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go. I was shaking, I was so frightened, it was terrible. But I sort of buried the ghost,\u201d she said. Since then, she has returned dozens of times \u2013 but this visit may be one of the last. Seventy-five years after the end of the second world war, inevitably the number of Holocaust survivors is rapidly dwindling. At a time when antisemitism is rising once again in Europe, \u201cthis may be the last significant anniversary we commemorate with eyewitnesses who endured the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust,\u201d said Karen Pollock of the Holocaust Educational Trust. As well as all the facts, dates and numbers relating to the Holocaust, the world has, for many decades now, been able to \u201csee the faces of people who did not learn about Auschwitz from books and films but actually, tangibly and physically, experienced this hell\u201d, said Piotr Cywi\u0144ski, director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and museum. Survivors have become \u201cmoral symbols \u2013 not just of survival but also of resilience\u201d, said Michael Berenbaum, a Holocaust scholar at the American Jewish University in California. \u201cThey bore witness to the worst humanity can be, and became voices for dignity, tolerance and decency. The idea that we\u2019re going to lose that generation is enormously painful; we will lose the authenticity that comes from someone who can say \u2018I was there\u2019.\u201d But, he added, \u201cno generation has left behind as great a historical record\u201d, including memoirs, art, music and video testimony. \u201cAnd we have been planning for a decade or so how to teach about the Holocaust in the absence of living witnesses.\u201d Yad Vashem holds an extensive archive of video, oral and written testimonies. In 2016, the UK National Holocaust Centre and Museum in Newark launched an innovative way of preserving the responses of survivors to children\u2019s questions. The Forever Project has created lifesize images of survivors which, using digital technology, can \u201canswer\u201d questions in real time from hundreds of pre-recorded replies. The centre has also produced a short film, telling the story of one survivor through the medium of hip-hop, as a means of engaging young people. \u201cIn a climate of ignorance, trivialisation and denial, the primacy of first-hand testimony cannot be overstated,\u201d said Marc Cave, the centre\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe Forever Project is the single most important thing we\u2019ve done to future-proof Holocaust education for generations to come.\u201d There is also \u201csecondary testimony\u201d \u2013 accounts from children and grandchildren of their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 stories. But many survivors\u2019 descendents also have their own stories to tell of living in the long shadow of the Holocaust. The impact on the \u201csecond generation\u201d has been extensively researched, with psychologists and academics noting symptoms of trauma such as clinical depression, anxiety, addiction and eating disorders among some descendants. Now it is being acknowledged that some of the third generation are also struggling under the weight of family history. Allison Nazarian\u2019s maternal grandparents survived Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, where her mother was born. She has written a book, Aftermath: A Granddaughter\u2019s Story of Legacy, Healing and Hope, about her third-generation experience. \u201cI was close to my grandparents. They freely and graphically talked of their lives during the Holocaust. I absorbed their experiences. It was all I heard about. I was surrounded by the Holocaust; it was part of every story, every discussion, every day of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI was told, \u2018they could come for us at any time, you have to be ready\u2019. Even now, I have a \u2018go bag\u2019 with passports and essentials. There are certain things I have an irrational fear of running out of. It was only at 12 or 13 I realised not everyone\u2019s grandparents were in the Holocaust. It made me who I am.\u201d Now 48, Nazarian decided she would not expose her children \u2013 the fourth generation \u2013 to the same trauma. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to sound as if I\u2019m resentful or regretful \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of my grandparents. But I don\u2019t think passing on the burden would help. My children are 100% free of it.\u201d A second-generation survivor, Naomi Levy, said descendants had a strong sense of an \u201coverall sense of loss and ghosts from the pasts\u201d. She went through a period of \u201ctrying to repel, to push it away\u201d but eventually embraced researching and recording her family history, \u201ctrying to piece everything together\u201d. With regard to her own children, now adults, she said: \u201cI wanted to protect them from it for as long as possible. I was very careful around the subject as they grew up. It\u2019s a balancing act \u2013 I don\u2019t want it to be a burden, but it is what it is. I think they will want to know more, but I\u2019m not going to make them face it.\u201d In Israel, a small number of third-generation survivors have had their grandparents\u2019 camp identification numbers tattooed on their own arms as a memorial. The trend, although limited, has been controversial and shocking to many, and not just because of the Jewish prohibition on tattoos. But, for many, the young people\u2019s motive \u2013 \u201cnever forget\u201d \u2013 is more relevant than ever in a time of rising antisemitism, nationalism and populism. According to Cywi\u0144ski, the significance of this year\u2019s anniversary lies not just in the number of years since the liberation of Auschwitz, but is \u201crelated to the world we live in today. Antisemitism, racist and xenophobic reactions are being revived on an unexpected scale, and groups that openly promote hatred are on the rise. All this in the profound helplessness of our democratic institutions, weakened by populism and demagoguery, which have been reborn in so many countries around the world\u201d. It was a mistake to put the Holocaust into a box marked \u201chistory\u201d, said Cave. \u201cWhen we see lesbians beaten up on a bus or monkey chants at a football match, these are symptoms of \u2018othering\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly how the Holocaust and most genocides start. There is no greater lesson than the warning from history of the Holocaust.\u201d Renee Salt has told her story over and over again \u201cso that people shouldn\u2019t forget. There are still people who say it didn\u2019t happen, there are still deniers. But you can\u2019t hide people like me away. At the end of the war, we believed what happened could never and would never happen again. But now it\u2019s a worrying time.\u201d In memory Auschwitz-Birkenau An official memorial event will mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp on 27 January, International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Up to 200 Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned at the camp will attend, along with heads of state from at least 22 countries. A ceremony at 3.30pm will be addressed by survivors, Poland\u2019s president Andrzej Duda, and Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress. It will end with the kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. Yad Vashem A forum under the banner Remembering the Holocaust, Fighting Antisemitism will be held at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial near Jerusalem. More than 40 state leaders, royals and other dignitaries will be there. Prince Charles will represent the UK as part of his first official visit to Israel. As well as meeting Holocaust survivors, Charles will also visit Bethlehem and meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. (A tweet last month from the British consulate in East Jerusalem welcoming Charles\u2019s visit to the \u201cOccupied Palestinian Territories\u201d was met with an undiplomatic riposte from Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cGod willing you guys will be kicked out of Israel soon. Until then I\u2019m thinking of visiting the occupied lands of Scotland or Wales, which do you recommend?\u201d the younger Netanyahu tweeted.) The BBC In the run-up to the anniversary, the BBC is broadcasting a range of documentaries and dramas, plus Songs of Praise from the UK National Holocaust Centre and Museum and live coverage of the commemoration in Poland. \u201cWe\u2019re offering everyone the chance to reflect on the consequences of prejudice and hatred, and in doing so we\u2019ll ensure that the millions of lives lost in the Holocaust are not forgotten,\u201d said Tony Hall, the BBC\u2019s director general. The UK National Holocaust Centre and Museum The centre in Nottinghamshire \u2013 founded by a Christian family in 1991 \u2013 is taking a virtual reality exhibition, The Eye As Witness, around the country. It invites people to think critically about propaganda techniques and racism and hatred today. 75 Memorial Flames exhibition The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust invited organisations and community groups, including prisons, schools and faith groups, to make artworks featuring a memorial flame. Seventy-five have been chosen for an exhibition that will launch at the memorial day ceremony in Westminster on 27 January and then tour the UK. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 to refer, in accordance with the Guardian style guide, to Auschwitz-Birkenau having operated in Poland during the period Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany. It was further amended on 15 January 2020 to more correctly refer to the troops who liberated the camp as Soviet, not \u201cRussian\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It doesn\u2019t seem long ago that announcements around Manhattan were urging playgoers to see a Broadway show \u201cfor the fun of it\u201d. Such exhortations have disappeared with the changing times, amid a New York theatre scene that, if my holiday-season trawl through a dozen or more productions is any gauge, isn\u2019t these days exactly high on fun.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to suggest in any way a lack of theatrical bounty, not least at a time when two new American plays \u2013 <strong><a href=\"https://atlantictheater.org/production/halfway-bitches-go-straight-to-heaven/\" title=\"\">Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven</a></strong> (Linda Gross theatre), and <strong><a href=\"https://soundinsidebroadway.com/\" title=\"\">The Sound Inside</a></strong> (Studio 54) \u2013 were as remarkable as anything I\u2019ve seen over the past year or more. Both merit a London outing that seems more than likely given the increasing preponderance in the capital of American titles from every corner of the repertoire. <em>Halfway Bitches</em>\u2026, now closed, but set among the death throes of a New York City women\u2019s shelter, featured a cast of 18 (plus a goat), and would seem a natural for, say, the Young Vic, while Adam Rapp\u2019s bleak yet beautiful two-hander <em>The Sound Inside</em> signals the overdue Broadway debut from the author of <em>Red Light Winter</em>, a Pulitzer finalist in 2006, and could surely be done almost anywhere, even if its Broadway cast of Mary-Louise Parker and Will Hochman has set the bar tremendously high. A never-better Parker plays an ailing Yale creative writing professor at home with her own solitude, with Hochman as the precocious and nervy student who all but upends her life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scott Ellis\u2019s bustling Tootsie has closed early \u2013 too breezy for our issues-led climate?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the prevailing themes of the plays I saw spoke of a fractious landscape inhabited by a citizenry at racial, sexual and social odds with one another \u2013 a divide that can only be improved if people take the time to lend an ear.</p> <p>\u201cI got it wrong, I\u2019m going to start listening,\u201d says MJ (excellent Elizabeth Stanley), the heavily medicated mother at the bruised heart of <strong><a href=\"https://jaggedlittlepill.com\" title=\"\">Jagged Little Pill</a></strong> (Broadhurst theatre), the aggressively morose new musical scored to the back catalogue of Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album of the same name.

      "bodyText": "It doesn\u2019t seem long ago that announcements around Manhattan were urging playgoers to see a Broadway show \u201cfor the fun of it\u201d. Such exhortations have disappeared with the changing times, amid a New York theatre scene that, if my holiday-season trawl through a dozen or more productions is any gauge, isn\u2019t these days exactly high on fun. That\u2019s not to suggest in any way a lack of theatrical bounty, not least at a time when two new American plays \u2013 Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven (Linda Gross theatre), and The Sound Inside (Studio 54) \u2013 were as remarkable as anything I\u2019ve seen over the past year or more. Both merit a London outing that seems more than likely given the increasing preponderance in the capital of American titles from every corner of the repertoire. Halfway Bitches\u2026, now closed, but set among the death throes of a New York City women\u2019s shelter, featured a cast of 18 (plus a goat), and would seem a natural for, say, the Young Vic, while Adam Rapp\u2019s bleak yet beautiful two-hander The Sound Inside signals the overdue Broadway debut from the author of Red Light Winter, a Pulitzer finalist in 2006, and could surely be done almost anywhere, even if its Broadway cast of Mary-Louise Parker and Will Hochman has set the bar tremendously high. A never-better Parker plays an ailing Yale creative writing professor at home with her own solitude, with Hochman as the precocious and nervy student who all but upends her life. But the prevailing themes of the plays I saw spoke of a fractious landscape inhabited by a citizenry at racial, sexual and social odds with one another \u2013 a divide that can only be improved if people take the time to lend an ear. \u201cI got it wrong, I\u2019m going to start listening,\u201d says MJ (excellent Elizabeth Stanley), the heavily medicated mother at the bruised heart of Jagged Little Pill (Broadhurst theatre), the aggressively morose new musical scored to the back catalogue of Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album of the same name. The contribution of the Belgian choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, an associate artist at Sadler\u2019s Wells, is crucial: his moves lend the show a contemporary dance vibe that is more authentically woke than Diablo Cody\u2019s relentlessly earnest book. Trafficking in one psychic calamity or meltdown after another, Diane Paulus\u2019s powerfully sung production is set across two Christmases, seasonal cheer set in starkly ironic contrast to this tale of a marriage in crisis, and of two children, one white, the other black (she\u2019s adopted). References along the way include teenage rape, opioid addiction, climate emergency and school violence. In context, I would imagine the interval bar is doing brisk business: do they sell tranquillisers? Even Ain\u2019t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations (Imperial theatre) immerses the rousing music one expects from the title into an attenuated tale of woe as we hear of one or another band member succumbing to all manner of misfortune: in context, Tony winner Sergio Trujillo\u2019s roof-raising choreography gives respite to a wearying spirit. Prospects aren\u2019t much brighter just one street away at the far more audacious Slave Play (Golden theatre, until 19 Jan). Performed without an interval, this unabashedly confrontational work set (or perhaps not) in the antebellum south, marks the Broadway debut of Jeremy O Harris, the African American dramatist whose play \u201cDaddy\u201d will open at London\u2019s Almeida theatre in April. Suffice to say that Harris and his director, Robert O\u2019Hara, have already pushed the Broadway envelope pretty far even before a black dildo gets waved about on stage. Harris\u2019s conceit starts out as one kind of play, only for something altogether different and more feral to be unveiled midway through. Clint Ramos\u2019s sets are deceptively beautiful, and the impassioned cast includes James Cusati-Moyer as a deliciously preening actor and Joaquina Kalukango as a putative mistress who won\u2019t allow herself in any way to be subjugated. And if it does happen, well, there will be blood. Scarcely more cheerful, if a lot more pedestrian in dramatic terms, is the Lincoln Center Theater premiere of Greater Clements (Mitzi E Newhouse theatre, until 19 Jan). This is a surprisingly clunky new three-act play from Samuel D Hunter (whose terrific The Whale was seen in 2018 at the Ustinov Studio in Bath), chronicling a mother-son showdown in an Idaho town that knows a thing or two about tragedy: 81 people died in a mining fire there some years before. It doesn\u2019t take a seer to guess that death will rear its head unbidden once again in a production from Davis McCallum notable both for an unwieldy set besieged by laboured mechanics, and for yet another stonking performance from the redoubtable Judith Ivey, who is just one of the many actors \u2013 The Sound Inside\u2019s Mary-Louise Parker is another \u2013 whose regular returns to the New York stage give cause to cheer. Parental dynamics come shaded with more sentimental hues in Harry Townsend\u2019s Last Stand (City Center Stage II, until 15 March), an old-fashioned weepie from the writer George Eastman in which Craig Bierko must deal with putting his ageing father (Len Cariou, Broadway\u2019s original Sweeney Todd) in a care home. Cariou, now 80, is the big event here as a randy old man who takes more pills, even, than the mum in Jagged Little Pill but has no intention of calling life quits anytime soon. Not every New York show is by necessity domestic. Arguably the most unnerving play on offer just now is the Vineyard theatre\u2019s Is This a Room (until 19 Jan), Tina Satter\u2019s verbatim recreation of the arrest in June 2017 of the astonishingly named Reality Winner. Visited at her Georgia home by the FBI, the onetime US air force linguist and whistleblower was found guilty of espionage in the sort of David v Goliath drama that illustrates all too clearly the gap between most ordinary people and the governing bodies whose malefactors continue to walk free. Politics, present and past (Hitler gets a name-check), keeps invading the skilfully conjured spookhouse of The Thin Place (Playwrights Horizons, until 26 January), Lucas Hnath\u2019s slyly unsettling one-act play that nods towards both The Weir and Aunt Dan and Lemon, all the while allowing Emily Cass McDonnell transfixing pride of place as a woman possessed of powers she can\u2019t entirely comprehend. I did laugh, you may be relieved to hear, at a below-the-radar off-Broadway staging, now concluded, of Absurd Person Singular (Theatre One), Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s classic 1972 comedy, handled with affection and respect by the Huddersfield-based company Dick &amp; Lottie (named after two unseen characters from this very play), which will bring the show to Huddersfield\u2019s Lawrence Batley theatre for three performances later this month. Its director, John Cotgrave, honours Ayckbourn\u2019s authorial dazzle while illuminating the bleaker aspects of a script steeped in fairly serious domestic disarray. The mere presence of this play was a welcome surprise in a theatre capital whose British fare these days tends towards behemoths such as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child or, opening on Broadway in March, the only marginally less epic The Lehman Trilogy. And joy, albeit of contrasting kinds, was on exuberant view in three musicals \u2013 one finished, two still going strong. Tootsie closed earlier than expected at the Marquis theatre, which is doubly bizarre given the Tony awards won (deservedly) by its tireless star, Santino Fontana, and by Robert Horn\u2019s genuinely funny book \u2013 a treasurable throwback to a Broadway era when musicals meant musical comedy, a now all-but-vanished genre. Could Scott Ellis\u2019s bustling production simply have been too breezy for an issues-led musicals climate populated by the likes of Hamilton, Hadestown and, yes, Jagged Little Pill? It would seem so: The Cher Show and The Prom are two other none-too-demanding Broadway entries that bit the dust prematurely last year. And on the evidence of the crowd response one recent evening, there\u2019s life aplenty in the director Michael Mayer\u2019s hugely endearing revival of Little Shop of Horrors (Westside Theatre Upstairs, until 15 March), which returns the 1982 musical to its off-Broadway roots, free from the overkill that knowingly afflicts its gloriously devouring plant, otherwise known as Audrey II.

It is as if she is finally able to relax, having spoken for an hour about everything she has been through. It is serious stuff and, as such, no surprise that up to that point she too has been serious in tone and manner.</p> <p>Aged only 20, Darawsha became Israel\u2019s highest-ranking female Arab referee, a remarkable achievement that required her to overcome adversity, abuse and family objections. Some would have cracked but instead Darawsha survived and thrived, and now aged 28 she wants to help other women in Israel achieve their dreams. Hence her presence at De Montfort to study a Fifa masters international MA in management, law and humanities of sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/manchester-city-keira-walsh-interview-criticism-world-cup\">Manchester City\u2019s Keira Walsh: \u2018I thought: do I want to play football any more?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you are a woman in Israel you are made to feel sport is not for you,\u201d Darawsha says. \u201cI want to create the infrastructure needed for women to play a good standard of sport in the country and also come up with a strategy that increases the number of women\u2019s sport teams. There are some in Israel but very few, in football especially.</p> <p>\u201cI am doing this course so I can learn what is happening outside of Israel and understand better why we lack management and leadership in sport, especially for women.\u201d</p> <p>One of seven siblings, Darawsha was born in Arraba, a largely agricultural city in Israel\u2019s northern district. Her childhood was happy but also typical of most Arabs growing up in the country. The community is small \u2013 approximately 21% of the population \u2013 and largely restricted to specific areas where resources are limited. As Darawsha puts it, to be an Arab in Israel is to feel like a \u201ctype-B person\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many people outside of Israel even know we exist,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhen I came to Leicester people said to me: \u2018How is it to be Jewish and Muslim?\u2019 I had to tell them: \u2018I am an Arab Muslim living in Israel.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Darawsha could have developed an inferiority complex but instead decided she was going to make something of her life, and that football would be central to it. At 16 she took up coaching before moving into refereeing so she could remain involved in the sport while travelling across Israel in order to further her studies.</p> <p>Israeli football has a tradition of female referees and there were a few of Arab origin working in the lower echelons of the country\u2019s five-tier league structure when Darawsha decided to give it a go herself. She underwent the Israel Football Federation\u2019s referees\u2019 course in 2010 and, having completed that, was assigned her first 11-a-side game in January 2011, which was between two Jewish teams from the country\u2019s Noar League, which is for men aged between 18 and 20. It went fine, which could not be said about the next Noar League match Darawsha took charge of. Somewhat paradoxically, that was because it involved two Arab sides.</p> <p>\u201cIn our society it is not acceptable for women to be referees,\u201d she explains. \u201cI was new to these men and all the time they were screaming: \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 \u2018You should not be here!\u2019 \u2018Your decisions are wrong!\u2019 They gave me the feeling I should not be a referee.\u201d</p> <p>The experience was scarring for someone who was only a teenager at the time and it required the intervention of a family friend and fellow referee to prevent Darawsha giving up altogether. \u201cHe watched me referee and saw that all I needed was to be stronger on the pitch. He said: \u2018If you make a mistake, don\u2019t worry \u2013 keep going. Believe you are the queen of the game.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The pep talk worked and it was not long before Darawsha was officiating games in Liga Gimel, Israel\u2019s fifth tier. Then in March 2012 came her promotion to Liga Bet, the fourth tier, and what was a genuine history-making moment. \u201cArab women had never run games in Liga Bet \u2013 I was the first,\u201d Darawsha says. \u201cSuddenly journalists wanted to talk to me. I had never experienced anything like this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c2ba4675bb57c0356a8c55487c9890140218c00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2ba4675bb57c0356a8c55487c9890140218c00/0_13_530_318/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sanaa Darawsha officiates a Liga Bet game between Hapoel Shefa-\u2019Amr and Akko in September 2012\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanaa Darawsha officiates a Liga Bet game between Hapoel Shefa-\u2019Amr and Akko in September 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Sanaa Darawsha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Darawsha was soon officiating in Liga Alef, Israel\u2019s third tier. That was testament not only to her talent but also her resolve, which by then had been strengthened by having to cope with further resistance to her becoming a referee from her elder brother, Fadi. \u201cHe knew how footballers spoke to referees, that it could be very aggressive, and felt I couldn\u2019t deal with that,\u201d Darawsha recalls with a notable level of sadness. \u201cHe told me he disapproved of me becoming a referee and when I then told him that I was going to do it anyway he stopped talking to me for an entire year.</p> <p>\u201cIt was hard because we are a close family. We sit next to each other during meals and talk all the time, and suddenly that stopped with my brother. He wouldn\u2019t talk to me and he would leave the table if I sat there. It felt as if I had lost him.\u201d</p> <p>Fadi also objected to his sister having to wear shorts as part of her referee\u2019s uniform. \u201cThis is not acceptable for Muslim women and for my brother it was not acceptable for me to wear them in front of 22 men,\u201d says Darawsha, who tried to solve this problem by asking the federation\u2019s referees department if she could wear leggings when officiating. The request was denied.</p> <p>Fadi eventually accepted Darawsha\u2019s decision to be a referee, as did her parents, Omar and Nura, after some initial reluctance. Yet all of them could have been forgiven for changing their minds after what happened to Darawsha when she took charge of the Liga Bet derby between Tamra and Kabul in December 2012. The score was 2-1 to Kabul when Darawsha ruled out a last-minute equaliser for Tamra after seeing her assistant raise his flag for offside. Cue bedlam.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the Tamra players tried to attack my assistant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI showed a red card and five yellow cards to the players involved. I also sent off one of Tamra\u2019s coaches because he was screaming at me and my assistant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/28/women-faith-football-hijab-fifa-ban\">When women were forced to choose between faith and football | Shireen Ahmed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAfter the final whistle the Tamra players were still angry and two security men had to escort me to the referee\u2019s room because they wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. They followed me there and tried to get in. Fortunately there were police at the game \u2013 because it was a derby \u2013 and they stopped them.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the game that required Darawsha to undergo unexpected dental surgery. It was between Hapoel Iksal and Hapoel Isfiya in Liga Bet and had been proceeding as normal until Isfiya\u2019s goalkeeper got into a furious argument with two Iksal players, who happened to be brothers. It was one of the brothers whose elbow caught Darawsha\u2019s teeth. \u201cThe game was live on TV so my family saw it happen,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were not happy.\u201d</p> <p>By then Darawsha was having doubts herself about continuing as a referee, partly because of what had happened in the Tamra-Kabul game and partly because of the off\u2011the\u2011field stress her decision to officiate had caused. But again there was a determination not to give up and, in the end, she went on to referee more than 100 games. And while she never did so in Israel\u2019s top two divisions \u2013 Liga Leumit and the Premier League \u2013 Darawsha had made her mark. There are now 10 female Arab referees in Israel, the most there has ever been, with many in contact with her for support and advice.</p> <p>That is some legacy but for Darawsha it is not enough.

The brothers are now \u201cseparate entities\u201d but Prince William hopes matters can be resolved so the royal family can once more play as \u201ca team\u201d, according to reports. William told a friend: \u201cI\u2019ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can\u2019t do that any more; we\u2019re separate entities,\u201d the Sunday Times reported. William continued: \u201cI\u2019m sad about that. All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we\u2019re all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the same team.\u201d The comments come as the Queen, Prince of Wales, William and Harry prepare to meet face-to-face for the first time since the Sussexes\u2019 bombshell statement on Wednesday. In it, Harry and Meghan said they intended to \u201cstep back\u201d from being frontline royals, split their time between the UK and North America, and work towards becoming \u201cfinancially independent\u201d. While senior royals have been talking on the phone since the crisis broke, the Queen has been in Norfolk, Charles has been at Birkhall in Aberdeenshire, William at Kensington Palace, and Harry at Windsor. Monday\u2019s meeting will be an opportunity for them to discuss proposals drawn up after a series of consultations between palace officials and representatives of the UK and Canadian governments about how Meghan and Harry can achieve their aim of carving out new \u201cprogressive\u201d roles as hybrid royals. It is understood that Meghan, who is in Canada, is likely to take part take part via conference calling. A royal source said the meeting was to \u201ctalk things through\u201d. The proposals had been drawn up following \u201ca series of meetings and consultations across the last few days\u201d. \u201cThere are a range of possibilities for the family to review, which take into account the thinking the Sussexes outlined earlier in the week,\u201d the source added. Making changes to the working life and role in the monarchy of the couple \u201crequired complex and thoughtful discussions\u201d, the source said. \u201cNext steps will be agreed at the meeting.\u201d It remained the Queen\u2019s wish that changes be resolved \u201cat pace\u201d, in days not weeks. But there was \u201cgenuine agreement and understanding that any decision will take time to be implemented\u201d, the source added. William\u2019s reported comments on the growing distance between the brothers reflects those made by Harry in an ITV documentary in November.

I\u2019m a fan of the Wu-Tang Clan, but there\u2019s so much in <em>Chamber Music</em> even for hip-hop agnostics.

She sings pain with such frayed, truthful soul, but the spoken word riff at the start of the B-side always makes me laugh out loud in the car.

The legend goes that he spotted a fig tree standing alone in the lava field, the only sign of life in the middle of the barren black expanse, and decided to build his home around it.

A white leather banquette nestles in a nook of one cave, curving around a palm tree that sprouts from the middle of a glossy white concrete floor, its green trunk poking up through a hole in the ceiling. A winding passage leads to another cave where bulbous glass pendant lamps dangle from the rockface, illuminating a daybed dotted with red leather cushions. Nearby, basalt steps lead down to a shimmering azure pool, fringed with the lush leaves of enormous swiss cheese plants. It is the ultimate party house, a Bond villain\u2019s dream of hidden chambers reached by narrow passageways, the architecture amplifying the natural magic of the ragged rocks.</p> \n<p>Born in Lanzarote\u2019s capital of Arrecife in 1919, Manrique fought in the Spanish civil war as a volunteer on Franco\u2019s side, before returning to study architecture at the University of La Laguna in Tenerife. The technical strictures of the course didn\u2019t suit his artistic temperament, so he dropped out after two years and moved to Madrid to study painting, where he was strongly influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/matisse\">Matisse</a>. He became <a href=\"http://www.cesarmanrique.com/pintura_i.htm\">a successful artist</a> and, on the advice of his psychoanalyst cousin, moved to New York in 1964, where he received a grant from Nelson Rockefeller that allowed him to rent his own studio on the Lower East Side, then a bohemian enclave of artists and writers. His work was exhibited widely, including at the Guggenheim Museum, but he never acclimatised to life in the big city. As he wrote to a friend: \u201cI feel true nostalgia for the real meaning of things. For the pureness of the people. For the bareness of my landscape and for my friends.\u201d He concluded that \u201cman in New York is like a rat. Man was not created for this artificiality. There is an imperative need to go back to the soil. Feel it, smell it.

Jameo \u2013 a word from the language the islands spoke before the Spanish arrived \u2013 means a large cave-like opening in a lava tube, created when part of the ceiling collapses. In a series of three of these jameos, Manrique choreographed an impossibly theatrical journey.</p> \n<p>First, visitors descend a winding staircase into a cavernous restaurant, where exotic plants dangle inside lobster pots and dining terraces look out over an underground lagoon populated by albino crabs, their eerie white bodies lit by a dramatic shaft of light from the ceiling.

Just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any more surreal, a cleft in the rockface leads to another cave, where a 600-seat auditorium descends into the stygian depths.</p> \n<p>When Hollywood star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/13/1\">Rita Hayworth</a> visited in 1974, she proclaimed the complex the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Two bars built into alcoves in the rocks, equipped with boulder stools and a poolside dancefloor, give you an idea of the kind of wild parties held here back in its heyday.

Eating here feels like dining in a lunar observation base, with panoramic windows bulging from the black basalt walls, framing the barren wilderness below. Chief attraction is the performance of the cooking, which takes place in a conical chamber with an altar-like barbecue grill in the centre, suspended over a volcanic well where the temperature reaches 400C, 6 metres below the ground.</p> \n<p>Ever conscious of the power of the natural landscape, one of Manrique\u2019s greatest talents was knowing when not to intervene. When a grand plan by a Madrid architect for an elaborate holiday village on the north coast of the island fell through, Manrique suggested a more subtle intervention. He had a hollow dug out of the cliff, where he laid out a restaurant and observation deck, which he then roofed over with domes, covered in earth and grass. Almost invisible from the outside, <a href=\"https://www.cactlanzarote.com/en/cact/mirador-del-rio/\">Mirador del R\u00edo</a> is entered via a winding white-painted tunnel that worms its way through the ground.</p> \n<p>When you visit these projects, it is hard to imagine quite how Manrique would have drawn up his designs before the days of 3D computer modelling \u2013 and the simple answer is he didn\u2019t. He never produced working drawings, but designed his structures and details on site, issuing instructions verbally and relying on the practical knowhow of his talented builder, Luis Morales. Operating in a way that had more in common with ad hoc land art than conventional architectural practice, his ideas would often change according to what he found on the site, with construction plans usually drawn up and approved after the event.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a644b09c72c3a3847d76969ed645f3ac32514cae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a644b09c72c3a3847d76969ed645f3ac32514cae/0_0_3664_4580/800.jpg\" alt=\"A staircase at the Jardin de Cactus.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A staircase at the Jardin de Cactus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Philip Wiper/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a style of working that was perhaps possible only because of the respect Manrique commanded on the island. As a childhood friend of Jos\u00e9 Ramirez Cerd\u00e1, then president of the Cabildo, the island\u2019s government, he was able to exert huge influence on Lanzarote\u2019s wider planning policy, encouraging a model of sustainable tourism before the term had been coined. He succeeded in banning advertising hoardings, having telephone and electricity cables laid underground and confining mass tourism to three main coastal regions, as well as imposing height restrictions on hotels. One particularly exacting rule, betraying Manrique\u2019s roots as a painter, specified that, on all new homes, the doors and shutters facing inland should be painted forest green, while those facing the sea should be marine blue.

Along with his subterranean lairs, among his most visible legacies are the mesmerising \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cesarmanrique.com/juguetes_i.htm\">wind toys</a>\u201d that can be found dotted around the island. Inspired by the windmills that once covered Lanzarote, these colourful kinetic sculptures are formed of geometric spheres, pyramids and cubes that somehow interlock and rotate around each other with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/20/the-impossible-world-of-mc-escher\">Escher</a>-like impossibility.</p> \n<p>One of these glittering whirligigs crowns a curious conical pavilion nestled at the base of his last great work. A mecca for cactus lovers from around the world, the <a href=\"https://www.cactlanzarote.com/en/cact/jardin-de-cactus/\">Jard\u00edn de Cactus</a> is a spellbinding ode to the spiny succulents, set in the terraced bowl of a former quarry that now brims with more than 10,000 cactus specimens. The approach is part of the magic: the sunken garden is surrounded by fields of giant prickly pear plants, which are still grown to cultivate cochineal bugs for red dye (once Lanzarote\u2019s chief cash crop, now enjoying a resurgence as a consequence of the suspicion of artificial food additives). After passing rows of these pears sprouting from the lunar landscape, you enter the garden through a fortified basalt gateway, to find an amphitheatre of staggered terraces bursting with spiky shafts and furry blobs of all shapes and sizes. It is an otherworldly place, a distillation of the wild qualities of the island and the architect\u2019s ability to combine nature and artifice.

Some weren\u2019t released in the US in time; others (like The Souvenir) simply weren\u2019t submitted for consideration. Of the titles that are in competition, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s astonishing Parasite is both my own pick of the bunch and a current bookies\u2019 favourite for both best film and the newly renamed international feature film\u2019 category (formerly foreign language film). It would be a worthy winner in either category. Best director \u2022 BONG JOON-HO (Parasite) \u2022 Alejandro Landes (Monos) \u2022 Greta Gerwig (Little Women) \u2022 Jordan Peele (Us) \u2022 Waad Al-Kateab, Edward Watts (For Sama) Martin Scorsese, Sam Mendes and Quentin Tarantino are all in the running for Oscar nominations, alongside Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, who gets my vote. I\u2019d also like to see a nomination for Greta Gerwig, who was shamefully overlooked at the reliably rubbish Golden Globes for her terrific work on Little Women. My other choices, sadly, all seem to have little chance of gaining due Oscar recognition in this category. Best actor \u2022 ANTONIO BANDERAS (Pain and Glory) \u2022 Taron Egerton (Rocketman) \u2022 Adam Driver (Marriage Story) \u2022 Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) \u2022 Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems) Joaquin Phoenix is the clear leader at the Oscars, with Adam Driver also a strong contender. My nominations would include Taron Egerton for his stand-out turn as Elton John in Rocketman, and Adam Sandler, who delivers his best work since Punch-Drunk Love in the Safdie brothers\u2019 Uncut Gems. But Antonio Banderas edges it for me with a career-best performance, filled with vulnerability and longing, in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Pain and Glory. Best actress \u2022 LUPITA NYONG\u2019O (Us) \u2022 Florence Pugh (Midsommar) \u2022 Cynthia Erivo (Harriet) \u2022 Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) \u2022 Charlize Theron (Bombshell) Lesley Manville would get my vote if Ordinary Love was eligible \u2013 it isn\u2019t. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger looks like an Academy favourite for Judy, although she has stiff competition from Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story. If Florence Pugh gets a nomination, it will be for supporting actress in Little Women, but I\u2019d like to recognise her dynamite central role in Midsommar. Top of my list is Lupita Nyong\u2019o, whose dual roles prove the key to Jordan Peele\u2019s satirical Us. Best supporting actor \u2022 ZACK GOTTSAGEN (The Peanut Butter Falcon) \u2022 Song Kang-ho (Parasite) \u2022 Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse) \u2022 Alan Alda (Marriage Story) \u2022 Joe Pesci (The Irishman) Supporting categories are always dogged by arguments about leading and secondary roles. Zack Gottsagen could be considered the central player for his wonderful performance in The Peanut Butter Falcon, as could Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, or Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse. Stephen Graham was a scene-stealer in both The Irishman and Rocketman, although he doesn\u2019t look like a contender for a category in which Brad Pitt and Al Pacino are both hotly tipped. Best supporting actress \u2022 JENNIFER LOPEZ (Hustlers) \u2022 Jamie Lee Curtis (Knives Out) \u2022 Cho Yeo-jeong (Parasite) \u2022 Laura Dern (Marriage Story) \u2022 Margot Robbie (Bombshell) Again, Jennifer Lopez (who is clearly the star of Hustlers) seems to be a frontrunner in the supporting category. She gets my vote. Margot Robbie could be nominated for either Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or Bombshell (the latter is my preferred choice), and it would be great to see Jamie Lee Curtis recognised for her fabulously imperious role in Rian Johnson\u2019s ensemble whodunnit Knives Out. Best score \u2022 HILDUR GU\u00d0NAD\u00d3TTIR (Joker) \u2022 Michael Abels (Us) \u2022 Alberto Iglesias (Pain and Glory) \u2022 Alex Weston (The Farewell) \u2022 Thomas Newman (1917) Many of my own picks (Clint Mansell\u2019s Out of Blue, Cavern of Anti-Matter\u2019s In Fabric, Mica Levi\u2019s Monos, Nainita Desai\u2019s For Sama) were either ineligible or overlooked. Of the titles that did make the already-announced 15-strong shortlist, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s score for Joker is the clear winner \u2013 an astonishing musical odyssey that lends real depth and soul to Todd Phillips\u2019s divisive anti-hero picture. Wendy Ide Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (favourite first) \u2022 PARASITE \u2022 Uncut Gems \u2022 Little Women \u2022 The Irishman \u2022 The Farewell Could this finally be the year that the Academy voters bite the bullet and hand the top prize to a foreign language film? Certainly, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s brilliant, satirical sleight of hand Parasite is the strongest contender for a long time. It is the highest grossing foreign language film of the year in the US, and recently entered the all-time top 10 most successful foreign language US releases. And vindicating stats like these matter to the Academy voters. Best director \u2022 JOSH SAFDIE, BENNY SAFDIE (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Bong Joon Ho (Parasite) \u2022 Greta Gerwig (Little Women) \u2022 Lulu Wang (The Farewell) \u2022 Martin Scorsese (The Irishman) Bong Joon-ho is a magician who has crafted a picture that is pretty much perfect; Greta Gerwig breathes spirit and life into a period literary adaptation; Lulu Wang weaves a complex tapestry of familial ties; Martin Scorsese eschews gangster glamour to focus on the grunt work of the low-level enforcer. But my choice would be the Safdie brothers, for the teeth-chattering, nerve-shredding intensity of Uncut Gems. Best actor \u2022 NOAH JUPE (Honey Boy) \u2022 Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory) \u2022 Adam Driver (Marriage Story) \u2022 Matthew Rhys (A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood) There\u2019s a lot of finely observed suffering here. Antonio Banderas delivers a performance that aches with sadness while Adam Driver feels the breakdown of his marriage like a self-inflicted wound. And Matthew Rhys conveys muted anguish as a disillusioned journalist in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. But the performance that floored me was a heartbreaking Noah Jupe, carrying a movie and capturing the incremental loss of childhood innocence in Honey Boy. Best actress \u2022 ELISABETH MOSS (Her Smell) \u2022 Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) \u2022 Saoirse Ronan (Little Women) \u2022 Awkwafina (The Farewell) \u2022 Cynthia Erivo (Harriet) I adored Saoirse Ronan\u2019s boisterous Jo March and thought Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Harriet Tubman had soul and strength. With The Farewell, Awkwafina shows a range that matches her considerable charm. And on the strength of the lawyer\u2019s office monologue alone, Scarlett Johansson has to be a contender. But the rattling blitzkrieg of Elisabeth Moss in Her Smell is like nothing else this year. It locks us into the cacophonous chaos of her character\u2019s messed up mind and doesn\u2019t let us out. Best supporting actor \u2022 BILL CAMP (Dark Waters) \u2022 Shia LaBeouf (The Peanut Butter Falcon) \u2022 Joe Pesci (The Irishman) \u2022 Lakeith Stanfield (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse) Shia LaBeouf is magnificent in both The Peanut Butter Falcon and Honey Boy but the two films might split the vote. Willem Dafoe is immensely enjoyable as a flatulent lighthouse keeper, wielding gloriously ornate dialogue and a noxious looking pipe to pleasing effect. However, Bill Camp tells a whole life story in his scenes in Dark Waters. His performance, full of unexpected textures and tics, is character acting at its most angular and interesting. Best supporting actress \u2022 FLORENCE PUGH (Little Women) \u2022 Lauren \u201cLolo\u201d Spencer (Give Me Liberty) \u2022 Merritt Wever (Marriage Story) \u2022 Octavia Spencer (Luce) \u2022 Zhao Shuzhen (The Farewell) The supporting performances are often where discoveries are made. Lauren \u201cLolo\u201d Spencer is one: a disability advocate with ALS, she makes her acting debut in the excellent but underseen US indie Give Me Liberty. And she\u2019s remarkable: forceful, furious, humorous and sexy. Zhao Shuzhen, magnetic as the ailing grandmother in The Farewell, is another new face. But my pick is Florence Pugh, who shines in Little Women, making the trickiest of the sisters sympathetic. Best original screenplay \u2022 BONG JOON-HO, HAN JIN-WON (Parasite) \u2022 Lulu Wang (The Farewell) \u2022 Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) \u2022 Robert Eggers, Max Eggers (The Lighthouse) \u2022 Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy) There is a strand of introspection in many of the best original screenplays this year. Noah Baumbach picks at the scabs of his own failed relationship in Marriage Story. Lulu Wang\u2019s own family dilemma \u2013 to tell or not to tell a beloved relative of their cancer diagnosis \u2013 is central to The Farewell. Shia LaBeouf channelled his childhood into a scaldingly public piece of therapy in Honey Boy. But the winner should be Parasite: there is nothing else of the same exquisite precision and artistry. Simran Hans Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (favourite first) \u2022 FOR SAMA \u2022 Atlantics \u2022 Uncut Gems \u2022 Parasite \u2022 Little Women In almost a century of Academy Awards, not one documentary has been nominated for best picture. In 2020 this doesn\u2019t seem likely to change; nonfiction remains siphoned off into its own category. A pity, because Waad Al-Kateab\u2019s first-person account of raising a daughter in Aleppo is as indelible, and as skilfully constructed, as any of the year\u2019s best fiction films. Best director \u2022 MATI DIOP (Atlantics) \u2022 Josh Safdie, Benny Safdie (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Alma Har\u2019el (Honey Boy) \u2022 Waad Al-Kateab, Edward Watts (For Sama) \u2022 Todd Haynes (Dark Waters) Best director should recognise the flair a film-maker brings to their material. So: Diop (my favourite) adds a supernatural twist to a timely migrant story; the Safdies, madcap energy; Har\u2019el applies her grounding in documentary to Shia LaBoeuf\u2019s mythology. Al-Kateab and Watts are bravely direct in their storytelling, while Haynes brings moral clarity, elegance and rage to his environmental thriller. Best actor \u2022 ADAM SANDLER (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Song Kang-ho (Parasite) \u2022 Brad Pitt (Ad Astra) \u2022 Noah Jupe (Honey Boy) \u2022 Felix Maritaud (Sauvage) Those who have seen Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 2002 drama Punch-Drunk Love will know that Adam Sandler can really act. As New York jeweller and gambling addict Howard Ratner, Sandler avoids easy parody and instead achieves an acute sense of pathos as a character who is infuriating, unlikable and positively unstoppable in his bad decisions. Best actress \u2022 FLORENCE PUGH (Midsommar) \u2022 Cynthia Enviro (Harriet) \u2022 Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Us) \u2022 Sienna Miller (American Woman) \u2022 Awkwafina (The Farewell) Things the Academy often rewards: a noteworthy physical transformation; historical biopics of conservative women; blondes. Florence Pugh doesn\u2019t exactly tick all of these boxes as a woman unravelling during the holiday from hell in Midsommar, or indeed as a plucky wrestler from Northampton (Fighting With My Family), or the youngest and most petulant March sister (Little Women, although this might be considered a supporting role). Still, what a year she\u2019s had. Best supporting actor \u2022 JOE PESCI (The Irishman) \u2022 Lakeith Stanfield (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Amadou Mbow (Atlantics) \u2022 Choi Woo-shik (Parasite) \u2022 Evan Alex (Us) The cold, commanding, inward-looking malice of Joe Pesci\u2019s performance in The Irishman is a testament to acting. It\u2019s perhaps unfair to pit him against four considerably lighter roles, but for me, Amadou Mbow\u2019s baffled, sweating policeman in Atlantics, or Evan Alex\u2019s creepy feral double in Us, are just as precisely drawn. Best supporting actress \u2022 JULIA FOX (Uncut Gems) \u2022 Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) \u2022 Park So-dam (Parasite) \u2022 Lee Jeong-eun (Parasite) \u2022 Adele Haenel (Portrait of a Lady on Fire) This is my favourite category, and my favourite crop of performances; the roles might be smaller, but they\u2019re richer, more textured. For me it\u2019s a three-way tussle between three extremely wily and enterprising women: J.Lo\u2019s fast-talking, fur-coated hustler, Park So-dam\u2019s trickster tutor in Parasite, and real-life NYC \u201cIt girl\u201d Julia Fox\u2019s scene-stealing mistress in Uncut Gems. Best international feature film \u2022 ATLANTICS \u2022 Portrait of a Lady on Fire \u2022 Parasite \u2022 Transit \u2022 Monos Atlantics, one of the best films of 2019, might be in with a chance in the international film category: Senegalese-French film-maker Mati Diop\u2019s fabulously smart and spooky feature debut is Senegal\u2019s official Oscar submission. That it already won the Grand Prix at Cannes should boost it somewhat, though Academy voters may lean towards something more accessible, such as Korean crossover hit Parasite. Guy Lodge Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (favourite first) \u2022 PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE \u2022 The Irishman \u2022 Atlantics \u2022 Transit \u2022 Midsommar In a year tediously dominated by the Scorsese v Marvel back-and-forth, the American master would have had egg on his face if his gangster opus had fallen short. It didn\u2019t: muscular yet melancholy, consolidating all his thematic and aesthetic fixations in one, it\u2019s a worthy frontrunner for an Oscar. That said, Scorsese already has one: allow me to dream of C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s exquisite lesbian romance shaking up the Hollywood patriarchy. Best director \u2022 MARIELLE HELLER (A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood) \u2022 Mati Diop (Atlantics) \u2022 C\u00e9line Sciamma (Portrait of a Lady on Fire) \u2022 Todd Haynes (Dark Waters) \u2022 Bong Joon-ho (Parasite) In a field dominated by more obviously impassioned auteur projects, I was struck by what two US directors did with scripts they didn\u2019t write. Haynes is a surprising fit for a legal procedural, but infuses Dark Waters with jittery malaise and moral urgency, while Heller\u2019s quiet, formal audacity takes a strictly American icon \u2013 the children\u2019s entertainer Mr Rogers \u2013 and articulates his presence more vividly than 2018\u2019s standard-issue documentary. Best actror \u2022 FRANZ ROGOWSKI (Transit) \u2022 Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) \u2022 Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory) \u2022 Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse) \u2022 Baykali Ganambarr (The Nightingale) My two favourite male performances of the year are ineligible. Tom Burke should win it all for his devastating turn in The Souvenir, but its US distributor didn\u2019t submit the film. Also not entered: Berlinale winner Synonyms, carried in anarchic, balletic style by Israeli newcomer Tom Mercier. Remember that the Oscars don\u2019t start with a level playing field \u2013 or even all the players. Best actress \u2022 ALFRE WOODARD (Clemency) \u2022 Florence Pugh (Midsommar) \u2022 Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Us) \u2022 Elisabeth Moss (Her Smell) \u2022 Trine Dyrholm (Queen of Hearts) Sometimes our favourites are pipe dreams with clear barriers to Academy consideration. It\u2019s harder, however, to say why Alfre Woodard\u2019s staggering performance as a psychologically tormented death-row prison warden has been left out of the conversation: a revered Hollywood stalwart and past nominee, turning in career-best work in a film that won the top prize at Sundance, she ought to be bounding to an overdue win. Best supporting actor \u2022 BILL CAMP (Dark Waters) \u2022 Will Poulter (Midsommar) \u2022 Joe Pesci (The Irishman) \u2022 Stephen Graham (The Irishman) \u2022 Aldis Hodge (Clemency) Supporting Oscars were introduced in 1936, after Hollywood\u2019s character actors complained they didn\u2019t stand a fair chance. Today, they\u2019re too often hijacked by A-list stars in co-lead roles (Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I\u2019m looking at you). How lovely it would be to see Bill Camp\u2019s or Stephen Graham\u2019s small but invaluable parts get their due instead. Best supporting actress \u2022 SOFIA BUENAVENTURA (Monos) \u2022 Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) \u2022 Elizabeth Debicki (Vita and Virginia) \u2022 Margaret Qualley (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) \u2022 Agyness Deyn (Her Smell) I\u2019m rooting for J.Lo after 20 years of subpar films squandering her vital star voltage: her Ramona in Hustlers is a role that needs a larger-than-life presence to strut it into life. On the flipside, newcomer Sofia Buenaventura\u2019s electrifying turn as burdened child soldier Rambo benefits from unfamiliarity: for much of Monos, even her gender is open to question. Stunning work at opposite ends of the star spectrum: how to choose? Best documentary \u2022 FOR SAMA \u2022 Honeyland \u2022 The Cave \u2022 The Edge of Democracy \u2022 American Factory The Academy already announced its shortlist of 15 films for this category, and while some exciting work (Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld, The Hottest August) got left on the sidelines, the remaining field is strong. Gratifyingly, the majority of the films shortlisted have female directors, most of whom would be worthy winners \u2014 and while the choice may be an obvious one, it\u2019s hard to deny Waad Al-Kateab\u2019s heart-crushing Syria diary.",

The movement, founded in mid-November by a group of four friends from Bologna in response to Salvini\u2019s threat to \u201cliberate\u201d Emilia-Romagna from the left, has attracted a huge following, with thousands of supporters cramming into piazzas across the country in recent months. The next show of strength is planned for Bologna next Sunday, a week before a regional election that is seen as an important test for the stability of the national government coalition between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S). The precarious alliance came together last summer after Salvini\u2019s League party was forced out of government following his failed attempt to force snap elections. Support for the League has dwindled but it is still Italy\u2019s biggest party, and winning in Emilia-Romagna would be a major coup for Salvini and his regional partners, the smaller far-right party, Brothers of Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia.

Academics are protected from the worst financial pressures of living in Cambridge, benefiting from central, subsidised college accommodation, free meals and access to a cheap, university-backed shared equity mortgage scheme.</p> <p>But an article published in university magazine <em>Varsity</em> late last year claimed that only eight of the 31 colleges \u2013 which had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/28/oxford-and-cambridge-university-colleges-hold-21bn-in-riches\" title=\"\">a combined wealth of \u00a36.9bn in 2018</a>, \u00a32.1bn more than Cambridge University itself \u2013 paid all of their staff last year the <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/18240\" title=\"\">\u201creal living wage\u201d, which was then \u00a39 an hour</a>.</p> <p>A spokesman for Cambridge University said: \u201cThe university introduced a \u2018Cambridge living wage\u2019 of \u00a310 an hour, equivalent to a full-time salary of \u00a319,071, on 1 August 2019. The colleges are separate legal entities to the university and control their own finances.\u201d However, he said, a survey in November found 21 colleges were paying at least \u00a39 an hour.</p> <p>In response, the Cambridge University Living Wage campaign, which is led by college students, questioned whether this survey took into account the wages of casual and subcontracted staff employed by the colleges and called for the 21 colleges to seek formal accreditation with the Living Wage Foundation.</p> <p>Labour councillor Richard Johnson said he believed there was \u201ca moral responsibility\u201d on organisations and businesses that profited and did well out of being based in Cambridge to address the inequalities in the city.</p> <p>The Labour-run city council, he said, was spending millions of pounds on its anti-poverty strategy, but was restricted by the funding it received from central government. \u201cWe need more resources,\u201d he said. He welcomed the support on offer from Cambridge 2030 and local businesses.</p> <p>Johnson said the homeless woman who gave birth on the street near Trinity College had been given a council flat, and officers were conducting a review into the case.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/homeless-new-mother\" title=\"\">A crowdfunding initiative</a> that raised more than \u00a325,000 for the woman and her children has been paused over fears the situation could become \u201cdangerous\u201d. The twins, who were born 11 weeks premature, are currently being cared for in a local hospital.</p> <p>\u201cHer case is horrific and it illustrates really well the challenges that we have in Cambridge,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think a joined-up approach is so important. We need to look at the root causes of these problems and channel our efforts into breaking these cycles of poverty.\u201d</p>",

Some of the city\u2019s inequalities continue to reflect its traditional \u201ctown and gown\u201d divide. Academics are protected from the worst financial pressures of living in Cambridge, benefiting from central, subsidised college accommodation, free meals and access to a cheap, university-backed shared equity mortgage scheme. But an article published in university magazine Varsity late last year claimed that only eight of the 31 colleges \u2013 which had a combined wealth of \u00a36.9bn in 2018, \u00a32.1bn more than Cambridge University itself \u2013 paid all of their staff last year the \u201creal living wage\u201d, which was then \u00a39 an hour. A spokesman for Cambridge University said: \u201cThe university introduced a \u2018Cambridge living wage\u2019 of \u00a310 an hour, equivalent to a full-time salary of \u00a319,071, on 1 August 2019. The colleges are separate legal entities to the university and control their own finances.\u201d However, he said, a survey in November found 21 colleges were paying at least \u00a39 an hour. In response, the Cambridge University Living Wage campaign, which is led by college students, questioned whether this survey took into account the wages of casual and subcontracted staff employed by the colleges and called for the 21 colleges to seek formal accreditation with the Living Wage Foundation. Labour councillor Richard Johnson said he believed there was \u201ca moral responsibility\u201d on organisations and businesses that profited and did well out of being based in Cambridge to address the inequalities in the city. The Labour-run city council, he said, was spending millions of pounds on its anti-poverty strategy, but was restricted by the funding it received from central government. \u201cWe need more resources,\u201d he said. He welcomed the support on offer from Cambridge 2030 and local businesses. Johnson said the homeless woman who gave birth on the street near Trinity College had been given a council flat, and officers were conducting a review into the case. A crowdfunding initiative that raised more than \u00a325,000 for the woman and her children has been paused over fears the situation could become \u201cdangerous\u201d. The twins, who were born 11 weeks premature, are currently being cared for in a local hospital. \u201cHer case is horrific and it illustrates really well the challenges that we have in Cambridge,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think a joined-up approach is so important. We need to look at the root causes of these problems and channel our efforts into breaking these cycles of poverty.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Italian painter <a href=\"http://www.tulliocrali.com/\" title=\"\">Tullio Crali</a> ought not to be quite such a head-on revelation. After all, his astonishing vision of a solo pilot nose-diving straight into a canyon of skyscrapers, light shattering round his helmeted head, is one of the great masterpieces of futurist art. Yet this riveting survey at the <a href=\"https://www.estorickcollection.com/exhibitions/tullio-crali-a-futurist-life\" title=\"\">Estorick Collection</a> comes as a surprise from first to last, and not only because it is his first in Britain.</p> <p>Crali (1910-2000) is a strange case, in life as in art. He grew up in Zadar, on what is now the Croatian coast, but which once belonged to Italy. His family moved to north-eastern Italy in 1922, and it was there, at the age of 15, that he created his first futurist work after reading an article about the movement.</p> <p>Crali fell hard for the futurist manifesto, with its addiction to motion, speed, modernity and roaring machinery \u2013 from the espresso maker to the Gatling gun, the aeroplane to the hurtling motorcar, notoriously described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/13/first-world-war-futurism\" title=\"\">Marinetti</a>, futurist leader, as \u201cmore beautiful than the victory of Samothrace\u201d.</p> <p>But Crali\u2019s own painting of a car rushing round a bend is more sophisticated than anything by his contemporaries. The vehicle itself is long gone, leaving only the hint of a wheel among magnificent curving vectors of black, cream and red \u2013 scintillating traces of its fast departure.</p> <p>And though he was as committed as his colleagues to the plane as ultimate futurist symbol, Crali\u2019s <em>aeropittura</em>, as they are called, are frequently more original. A terrific painting at the start of this show, called <em>Tricolour </em><em>Wings</em> (1932), has the plane ascending in sudden stages, scattering its target markings up through the sky like urgent thought bubbles. The plane\u2019s geometry, repeated as if in stop-start motion, perfectly describes the sharp sensation of sudden uplift, catching at each new thermal current. And the sky around it \u2013 running all the way from hyperreal clouds to gracious, Titianesque beauty \u2013 amounts to a painted collage.</p> <p>Indeed, though you could never mistake him for anything else, Crali often seems the odd man out of the futurist gang. For one thing, he is a tremendous colourist. Planes rise into moonlight-blue skies or descend through lavender mists. The scarlet stripes of a biplane burn like a cigarette among pearl-grey clouds. And in a work such as <em><a href=\"https://museumcrush.org/aeropainting-with-italian-futurist-tullio-crali-at-the-estorick/\" title=\"\">Broken Engine</a></em>, the polished wood of the slowing propeller shines gold against smoke and slate-blue heavens, its deco sheen ineffably glorified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca2b9a14eb7199a11e7cbb1a10d8b0c3f6e49196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca2b9a14eb7199a11e7cbb1a10d8b0c3f6e49196/0_0_3543_4617/767.jpg\" alt=\"Tullio Crali\u2019s Tricolour Wings, 1932.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sudden uplift\u2019: Tullio Crali\u2019s Tricolour Wings, 1932.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection/Tullio Crali</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is more, there is an undeniably human aspect to Crali\u2019s art. People get into the picture. There are two vast seamen at the prow of a gigantic battleship, trying to steer the ship through a storm with their muckle hands. A female figure raises her shapely arms like elegant wings and the blue air around her vibrates. He can paint the most complicated machinery \u2013 steam-driven pistons in a shipyard, or high-rising cranes \u2013 and there will be an intimation of human beings moving about below.</p> <p>Crali himself kept on moving. He left Italy after the second world war for an art school in Paris, remaining there for almost a decade. His drawings of the city describe the brasseries, stairwells and metal chairs of the Jardin du Luxembourg, the shadows along the Seine embankment: Paris, in his words, as \u201cmysterious, deep and moody\u201d. In the 60s he quit Paris for Cairo, then back to Italy, eventually ending up in Milan.</p> <p>But somehow Crali\u2019s art stands still, as the man does not. In the late 1980s he is still painting aeroplanes as if they were brand <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/654077545860452609/\" title=\"\">new inventions</a>, still showing solo pilots swooping about in glass cockpits. It is as if the international space race never happened.</p> <p>And his devotion to futurism never seems to waver, even though Marinetti died in 1944 and the movement had its final meeting in 1950. It is hard to decipher Crali\u2019s own politics from anything he wrote or painted; the curators of this show emphasise his belief in futurism as an aesthetic rather than political ideology. But the association with Mussolini\u2019s fascism can hardly be ignored.</p> <p>So perhaps that is why his later career lies in shadow. The Estorick is showing a number of Crali\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://www.tulliocrali.com/gallery/sassintesi/\" title=\"\">Sassintesi</a></em> \u2013 startling collages of stones, seaweed and assorted bric-a-brac found on beaches and presented upright, on canvases. These appear entirely novel. And every now and again they hit the mark, when Crali takes some sea-carved rock and twists it out of kilter, so that it suddenly looks like a rushing futurist figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63bd4b8c38c4d3c68bd5fa105baa1d1e7ff9f0b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63bd4b8c38c4d3c68bd5fa105baa1d1e7ff9f0b8/0_0_4651_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lights at Sunset in Ostia (1930)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lights at Sunset in Ostia, 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection/ Tullio Crali</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he is at his best when most liberated from the movement.

      "body": "<p>In its entire life, the party of Labour has only produced three majority-winning leaders and not one of that rare trio had hands roughened by physical toil. Two of them (Clement Attlee and Tony Blair) were privately educated barristers. The third (Harold Wilson) was a grammar school lad who became an economics don. All three took their degrees at Oxford.</p> <p>Even so and even now that the party has become very middle class, contenders for the Labour leadership feel compelled to compete to be prolier-than-thou. Sir Keir Starmer, perhaps feeling the burden of the knighthood that he earned for being director of public prosecutions, is keen to stress that his mum was a nurse and his dad a toolmaker and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/04/keir-starmer-enters-labour-leadership-race\" title=\"\">christened him</a> out of respect for Labour\u2019s first leader, Keir Hardie, a miner.</p> <p>A more persuasive way of establishing Mr Starmer\u2019s credentials as a man of the left was the campaign video that projected his legal career in a way tailored to appeal to Labour members. It highlighted the cases he fought on behalf of dockers, print and pit workers, poll tax protesters, environmental campaigners and the family of Stephen Lawrence. Even rival camps acknowledge that this was a smart way of pre-rebutting any attack on him as an establishment QC and recasting \u201cSir Keir\u201d as the heroic legal freedom fighter, Superlawyer. When he and other contenders performed at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/10/labour-leadership-good-week-bad-week-starmer-thornberry\" title=\"\">hustings</a> for Labour MPs last week, it was a compliment to the effectiveness of this pitch that it was aped by one of his competitors, Emily Thornberry.</p> <p>By general consent and rather against the run of expectations in the immediate aftermath of the election defeat, Mr Starmer\u2019s campaign to be Labour\u2019s next leader has got off to the strongest start. It is least surprising that he has mustered the most nominations from MPs, many of whom see him as the best available answer to their yearning for someone who can at least turn them into an effective opposition for the next five years. It was a significant boost to attract the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/keir-starmer-secures-support-labour-mps-run-leadership\" title=\"\">backing of Unison</a>, the largest of the trade unions and one that represents many low-paid workers. He is presenting himself as a unifier and his campaign team is ideologically diverse enough to embrace both people who have worked for Jeremy Corbyn and those who have organised for Liz Kendall, the most Blairite of the candidates in the 2015 leadership contest. The first, and so far only, poll of the party\u2019s members has suggested that he is ahead of the following pack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d22450d88e94b5ea649dbec81ba0ca5d434b137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d22450d88e94b5ea649dbec81ba0ca5d434b137/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Long Bailey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In Rebecca Long Bailey, the hard left has a candidate who appears unsure whether she truly wants to be the torchbearer for continuity Corbynism.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This tells us that the devastating scale of Labour\u2019s losses in the December election has been a salutary shock to at least some of the party. The calamity inflicted by Corbynism\u2019s deadly combination of ideological zealotry, toxic factionalism and rank amateurism commends professionalism, pleasantness and credibility to any members who are fed up with losing and would prefer not to be doomed to another decade in opposition. I have heard of a lot of examples of Labour activists who voted for Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests and who now intend to back Mr Starmer. He has also been blessed by his rivals. In Rebecca Long Bailey, the hard left has a candidate who appears unsure whether she truly wants to be the torchbearer for continuity Corbynism. She has given Mr Corbyn \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">10 out of 10</a>\u201d for leadership, prompting mirthful wonderment about how she would have ranked him had he won the election rather than crush Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation down to the lowest level since 1935. The more revealing dimension of her candidacy is the bitter divisions within the hard left about whether she ought to be their representative and her hesitancy about taking on the role of heir to Corbyn for which she has long been groomed and promoted. \u201cRebecca is quite shy,\u201d says a not unsympathetic Labour MP. \u201cIf you bump into her in a corridor, she never says hello unless you say hello first. I get the impression that she\u2019s struggled to make herself do it.\u201d</p> <p>The presence of <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jess-phillips-labour-leadership-a4331286.html\" title=\"\">Jess Phillips</a> as a competitor is probably a net positive for Mr Starmer and it could suit him if the Birmingham MP gathers enough nominations to get into the contest proper. He does not have to be absolutely brutal with the party about its desperate plight when the unflinching Ms Phillips is there to be the blunt truth-teller of the contest. Anti-Corbynite people are joining or rejoining the party in order to support her. Their second or third preferences are likely in large part to go to him.</p> <p>None of which means that it is all wrapped up. Far from it. It is a long and hazard-strewn road to the finishing post of this contest, the result of which will not be revealed until early April. If it gets its act together, the hard left has considerable organisational heft and a significant capacity to turn things extremely ugly. Len McCluskey\u2019s Unite will throw its resources and bureaucracy behind Ms Long Bailey. The campaigns of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/03/labour-power-activism-leader\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy</a> and Ms Phillips might take flight. There is still quite a lot of resistance to the idea that the next Labour leader should be another bloke who lives in north London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8525f668e5e0e51fd636b471c2bda8def825a146\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8525f668e5e0e51fd636b471c2bda8def825a146/0_139_4229_2537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jess Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Starmer does not have to be absolutely brutal with the party about its desperate plight when the unflinching Jess Phillips is there to be the blunt truth-teller of the contest.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mr Starmer will find there is a price to pay for being the front runner, which is that you get exposed to searching questions about who you are and what you really stand for. Gathering opinions among his supporters, I find that they tend to commend him mainly on the grounds that he has the ability and the character to perform the role. \u201cKeir is the only grown-up,\u201d is a typical sort of answer. Another goes: \u201cKeir is the only person the public can see standing on the steps of Number 10.\u201d One supportive Labour MP says: \u201cI don\u2019t really know exactly where he is on the ideological spectrum, but I don\u2019t particularly care. I trust him to do what needs to be done.\u201d</p> <p>He demonstrated his ability to do a big job as DPP when he successfully led a complex and often very challenged organisation. As the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, he navigated Labour\u2019s divisions as well as anyone could. The well-organised start to his campaign \u2013 \u201che\u2019s got a plan, he\u2019s got a grid,\u201d says one admirer \u2013 is taken as another sign that he would be an effective team leader. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely contemptuous of the way Corbyn and his crew ran the Labour party. He sees them as incompetent as well as nasty,\u201d says a friend of many decades standing.</p> <p>Then there are the doubts.

      "bodyText": "In its entire life, the party of Labour has only produced three majority-winning leaders and not one of that rare trio had hands roughened by physical toil. Two of them (Clement Attlee and Tony Blair) were privately educated barristers. The third (Harold Wilson) was a grammar school lad who became an economics don. All three took their degrees at Oxford. Even so and even now that the party has become very middle class, contenders for the Labour leadership feel compelled to compete to be prolier-than-thou. Sir Keir Starmer, perhaps feeling the burden of the knighthood that he earned for being director of public prosecutions, is keen to stress that his mum was a nurse and his dad a toolmaker and they christened him out of respect for Labour\u2019s first leader, Keir Hardie, a miner. A more persuasive way of establishing Mr Starmer\u2019s credentials as a man of the left was the campaign video that projected his legal career in a way tailored to appeal to Labour members. It highlighted the cases he fought on behalf of dockers, print and pit workers, poll tax protesters, environmental campaigners and the family of Stephen Lawrence. Even rival camps acknowledge that this was a smart way of pre-rebutting any attack on him as an establishment QC and recasting \u201cSir Keir\u201d as the heroic legal freedom fighter, Superlawyer. When he and other contenders performed at a hustings for Labour MPs last week, it was a compliment to the effectiveness of this pitch that it was aped by one of his competitors, Emily Thornberry. By general consent and rather against the run of expectations in the immediate aftermath of the election defeat, Mr Starmer\u2019s campaign to be Labour\u2019s next leader has got off to the strongest start. It is least surprising that he has mustered the most nominations from MPs, many of whom see him as the best available answer to their yearning for someone who can at least turn them into an effective opposition for the next five years. It was a significant boost to attract the backing of Unison, the largest of the trade unions and one that represents many low-paid workers. He is presenting himself as a unifier and his campaign team is ideologically diverse enough to embrace both people who have worked for Jeremy Corbyn and those who have organised for Liz Kendall, the most Blairite of the candidates in the 2015 leadership contest. The first, and so far only, poll of the party\u2019s members has suggested that he is ahead of the following pack. This tells us that the devastating scale of Labour\u2019s losses in the December election has been a salutary shock to at least some of the party. The calamity inflicted by Corbynism\u2019s deadly combination of ideological zealotry, toxic factionalism and rank amateurism commends professionalism, pleasantness and credibility to any members who are fed up with losing and would prefer not to be doomed to another decade in opposition. I have heard of a lot of examples of Labour activists who voted for Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests and who now intend to back Mr Starmer. He has also been blessed by his rivals. In Rebecca Long Bailey, the hard left has a candidate who appears unsure whether she truly wants to be the torchbearer for continuity Corbynism. She has given Mr Corbyn \u201c10 out of 10\u201d for leadership, prompting mirthful wonderment about how she would have ranked him had he won the election rather than crush Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation down to the lowest level since 1935. The more revealing dimension of her candidacy is the bitter divisions within the hard left about whether she ought to be their representative and her hesitancy about taking on the role of heir to Corbyn for which she has long been groomed and promoted. \u201cRebecca is quite shy,\u201d says a not unsympathetic Labour MP. \u201cIf you bump into her in a corridor, she never says hello unless you say hello first. I get the impression that she\u2019s struggled to make herself do it.\u201d The presence of Jess Phillips as a competitor is probably a net positive for Mr Starmer and it could suit him if the Birmingham MP gathers enough nominations to get into the contest proper. He does not have to be absolutely brutal with the party about its desperate plight when the unflinching Ms Phillips is there to be the blunt truth-teller of the contest. Anti-Corbynite people are joining or rejoining the party in order to support her. Their second or third preferences are likely in large part to go to him. None of which means that it is all wrapped up. Far from it. It is a long and hazard-strewn road to the finishing post of this contest, the result of which will not be revealed until early April. If it gets its act together, the hard left has considerable organisational heft and a significant capacity to turn things extremely ugly. Len McCluskey\u2019s Unite will throw its resources and bureaucracy behind Ms Long Bailey. The campaigns of Lisa Nandy and Ms Phillips might take flight. There is still quite a lot of resistance to the idea that the next Labour leader should be another bloke who lives in north London. Mr Starmer will find there is a price to pay for being the front runner, which is that you get exposed to searching questions about who you are and what you really stand for. Gathering opinions among his supporters, I find that they tend to commend him mainly on the grounds that he has the ability and the character to perform the role. \u201cKeir is the only grown-up,\u201d is a typical sort of answer. Another goes: \u201cKeir is the only person the public can see standing on the steps of Number 10.\u201d One supportive Labour MP says: \u201cI don\u2019t really know exactly where he is on the ideological spectrum, but I don\u2019t particularly care. I trust him to do what needs to be done.\u201d He demonstrated his ability to do a big job as DPP when he successfully led a complex and often very challenged organisation. As the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, he navigated Labour\u2019s divisions as well as anyone could. The well-organised start to his campaign \u2013 \u201che\u2019s got a plan, he\u2019s got a grid,\u201d says one admirer \u2013 is taken as another sign that he would be an effective team leader. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely contemptuous of the way Corbyn and his crew ran the Labour party. He sees them as incompetent as well as nasty,\u201d says a friend of many decades standing. Then there are the doubts. No one questions his intellectual ability, but many do wonder about his capacity to inspire. \u201cKeir\u2019s legalistic scalpel is his greatest strength and his greatest weakness,\u201d remarks someone who sat with him in the shadow cabinet. They know he can do forensic scrutiny of the government in parliament; they don\u2019t know if he can galvanise opposition to Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories out in the country. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d says one Labour MP. \u201cHe can be bloody boring.\u201d His ideological definition is fuzzy and he has offered only a vague diagnosis of why the party suffered such a calamitous election defeat.

Yet he has tried to offer reassurance to the party\u2019s left by saying that he wouldn\u2019t \u201coversteer\u201d away from Corbynism to the right. He has studiously avoided identifying which elements of Labour\u2019s rejected election offer he would junk. It is not clear what this adds up to, even among his supporters. \u201cHe is decent.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s government demanded justice for the victims, including compensation.

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary has condemned the arrest of Britain\u2019s ambassador in Iran during anti-government protests as a \u201cflagrant violation of international law\u201d and said the country was marching towards \u201cpariah status\u201d. Dominic Raab\u2019s strongly worded statement came after the ambassador, Rob Macaire, was arrested on Saturday during demonstrations near Amirkabir University in Tehran for \u201cinciting\u201d the protesters. He was held for more than an hour on suspicion of organising, provoking and directing radical actions before he was released, the Iranian Tasnim news agency said. Raab said in a statement: \u201cThe arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law. \u201cThe Iranian government is at a crossroads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to de-escalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards.\u201d It is understood that Macaire, a distinguished diplomat with 30 years\u2019 experience, had been attending what had been billed as a vigil for the victims of the crash. However, the event quickly turned into a demonstration, at which point the ambassador left. It was as he was returning to the British embassy that he was arrested, although it is not clear who he was held by. After a number of urgent calls to the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs he was eventually released and allowed to return to the embassy. The new diplomatic row came as Iran\u2019s embattled regime was shaken by a wave of international condemnation and domestic criticism after admitting its forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane with 176 people onboard and it had lied in a bid to cover up its role in the tragedy.

The simple fact is that there is none.</p> <p>This is an unprecedented move in the British royal family, and could end up bringing ours more into line with the royal families of Europe, in which most members not in direct line have full-time careers, such as Prince Constantijn, younger brother of the King of the Netherlands, a lawyer who works in banking, or Princess Madeleine, daughter of the King of Sweden, who works for the family foundation, Global Child Forum and lives mostly in Florida.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/12/prince-harry-meghan-markle-conscious-uncoupling-royal-family-cut-ties-windsor\">Harry and Meghan\u2019s conscious uncoupling from the royal family</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between this and the abdication of Edward VIII there is no comparison. Harry is not king; there is no effect on politics. The prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, dreaded Winston Churchill using public support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/22/wallis-simpson-new-divorce-details-revealed-in-solicitors-notes\" title=\"\">Edward VIII</a> to pull down the government. Our government is doing exactly as it pleases, no doubt delighted by the Sussex announcement as an excellent distraction.</p> <p>Edward wanted to stay in the country but the royal family dreaded a rival \u201csecond king\u201d to George VI, so off he was sent, in exile, not allowed back for royal events \u2013 he watched his niece\u2019s coronation on television with friends, sitting on a gold-painted chair. Harry has chosen to step down and he will still be here, just rather less.</p> <p>The whole principle of royals who aren\u2019t close to the throne doing full-time duties is relatively new. Up until the 1950s minor royals could do very little and could live a quiet life. Then Elizabeth II expanded the \u201cfirm\u201d as she came to the throne, to reflect the greater volume of work that needed doing. As <em>The Crown</em> shows, Elizabeth sacrificed everything for the monarchy.</p> <p>It was a different world, in which a private life could be kept so. Even then, with no social media and a largely respectful press, they felt the intrusion. As the Queen\u2019s governess put it, in the 1930s, \u201croyals are only private in the womb\u201d. Now, Harry clearly feels that he and Meghan have suffered enough. So many commentators are saying that \u201chalf-in, half-out\u201d is not going to work. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. We\u2019ve never tried the \u201cflexi-royal\u201d plan and I think it has huge potential. I expect the Sussexes to set up their own charitable foundation and support the Queen with overseas work and visits, particularly in the Commonwealth. Managed well, it would be the beginning of a real modernisation of the monarchy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d69b35c5f7caff452d8900713a398855bdb270cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d69b35c5f7caff452d8900713a398855bdb270cf/0_66_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen, Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Prince Andrew at Buckingham Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen, Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Prince Andrew at Buckingham Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the Sussexes embark on their new life, meanwhile, there are big questions for the rest of us. Harry and Meghan meant to take on full royal duties. But not even two years after the wedding, they have been, frankly, chased out. Meghan has suffered a barrage of racist and sexist criticism, constantly censured for initiatives and actions that other royal women were praised for. Harry issued a statement about his fear of his wife falling \u201cvictim to the same powerful forces\u201d as Diana. And still it continued.</p> <p>A few months ago, Prince Andrew revealed royal privilege and entitlement at its worst, refusing to apologise in his <em>Newsnight</em> interview for socialising with a sex criminal. And although he was criticised and forced to step down, it was a long time coming and it still seemed as if some in our society were angrier about Meghan wearing dark nail varnish than Andrew\u2019s links with Epstein. Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to step back has gained huge traction and sympathy across the world. The royal family needs to work with their wishes or risk losing them for ever.</p> <p>This is a seismic moment in royal history and British society. It tells historians of the future much about our society, its self-perceptions, prejudices and fears. And most of all, it should mark our realisation \u2013 as we didn\u2019t learn after Diana \u2013 that those who marry into the royal family are not our dolls to attack and throw around as we please.</p> <p>The Sussex announcement will, we hope, bring them happiness. And it offers future members of the royal family a path forward in which perhaps not everything, body and soul, must be given up to the crown.</p> <p><em>Kate Williams is a professor of history at the University of Reading and the author of Rival Queens</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Since the announcement of their plans for a \u201cprogressive new role\u201d within the monarchy, Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have got everyone asking what the historical precedent for their bombshell move is. The simple fact is that there is none. This is an unprecedented move in the British royal family, and could end up bringing ours more into line with the royal families of Europe, in which most members not in direct line have full-time careers, such as Prince Constantijn, younger brother of the King of the Netherlands, a lawyer who works in banking, or Princess Madeleine, daughter of the King of Sweden, who works for the family foundation, Global Child Forum and lives mostly in Florida. Between this and the abdication of Edward VIII there is no comparison. Harry is not king; there is no effect on politics. The prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, dreaded Winston Churchill using public support for Edward VIII to pull down the government. Our government is doing exactly as it pleases, no doubt delighted by the Sussex announcement as an excellent distraction. Edward wanted to stay in the country but the royal family dreaded a rival \u201csecond king\u201d to George VI, so off he was sent, in exile, not allowed back for royal events \u2013 he watched his niece\u2019s coronation on television with friends, sitting on a gold-painted chair. Harry has chosen to step down and he will still be here, just rather less. The whole principle of royals who aren\u2019t close to the throne doing full-time duties is relatively new. Up until the 1950s minor royals could do very little and could live a quiet life. Then Elizabeth II expanded the \u201cfirm\u201d as she came to the throne, to reflect the greater volume of work that needed doing. As The Crown shows, Elizabeth sacrificed everything for the monarchy. It was a different world, in which a private life could be kept so. Even then, with no social media and a largely respectful press, they felt the intrusion. As the Queen\u2019s governess put it, in the 1930s, \u201croyals are only private in the womb\u201d. Now, Harry clearly feels that he and Meghan have suffered enough. So many commentators are saying that \u201chalf-in, half-out\u201d is not going to work. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. We\u2019ve never tried the \u201cflexi-royal\u201d plan and I think it has huge potential. I expect the Sussexes to set up their own charitable foundation and support the Queen with overseas work and visits, particularly in the Commonwealth. Managed well, it would be the beginning of a real modernisation of the monarchy. As the Sussexes embark on their new life, meanwhile, there are big questions for the rest of us. Harry and Meghan meant to take on full royal duties. But not even two years after the wedding, they have been, frankly, chased out. Meghan has suffered a barrage of racist and sexist criticism, constantly censured for initiatives and actions that other royal women were praised for. Harry issued a statement about his fear of his wife falling \u201cvictim to the same powerful forces\u201d as Diana. And still it continued. A few months ago, Prince Andrew revealed royal privilege and entitlement at its worst, refusing to apologise in his Newsnight interview for socialising with a sex criminal. And although he was criticised and forced to step down, it was a long time coming and it still seemed as if some in our society were angrier about Meghan wearing dark nail varnish than Andrew\u2019s links with Epstein. Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to step back has gained huge traction and sympathy across the world. The royal family needs to work with their wishes or risk losing them for ever. This is a seismic moment in royal history and British society. It tells historians of the future much about our society, its self-perceptions, prejudices and fears. And most of all, it should mark our realisation \u2013 as we didn\u2019t learn after Diana \u2013 that those who marry into the royal family are not our dolls to attack and throw around as we please. The Sussex announcement will, we hope, bring them happiness. And it offers future members of the royal family a path forward in which perhaps not everything, body and soul, must be given up to the crown.

One of his better strategies to stay sane appeared to involve treating the institution with due irreverence. Which is to say, I liked that story that he had once bought the Queen a shower cap for Christmas bearing the legend \u201cAin\u2019t life a bitch!\u201d. It was not only a decent joke, but also a pointed reminder that you can\u2019t wear your crown in the bathroom.</p> <p>I reported for this paper on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-windsor-gospel-power-pageantry\" title=\"\">Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding</a>, and enjoyed some of the symbolic detail of it \u2013 including the fact that for the occasion, Meghan\u2019s tormentors in the press (and me) were pointedly dispatched to a room high up in a windowless turret of Windsor castle to watch proceedings on a single television reliant on the kind of set-top aerial I hadn\u2019t seen since the 1980s. It did not seem by chance that royal hacks, some of whose own predecessors Harry holds responsible for his mother\u2019s death, were invited to see less of the ceremony than almost any of the other two billion viewers around the world.</p> <p>What I did catch appeared to emphasise that Harry was determined to be true to the best of his mother\u2019s spirit. There was evangelical bishop Michael Curry, champion of same-sex marriage, demanding in his sermon that the royals brought to mind the first time they had felt the stirrings of love, a question that appeared to leave several flummoxed. And on the bride\u2019s side of the aisle pointed reminders that she had arrived here, in contrast to her husband, entirely on her own merits. The only relation was her elegant social worker mother, Doria Ragland, who sat alongside those world champions of self-reliance Oprah Winfrey and Serena Williams. It seemed unlikely, watching the Duchess of Sussex leave the chapel, that she would have much interest in a life in which she was routinely told where to go and how to behave.</p> <p>Perhaps as a consequence, the \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d the \u201cbiracial princess\u201d brought to the Windsors at her wedding was not allowed to last beyond the honeymoon. The charge list against her from the \u201cknow your place\u201d Stasi of the <em>Daily Mail</em> only grew. She wore the wrong denier tights to some garden party, was a bit slow to present her newborn son to the cameras, was tricky at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. If Harry\u2019s mother, daughter of an earl, experienced the culture shock of royal repression at 20, how must it all have seemed to Markle at 38?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd7245c360d00c39cf7c87df931738352875e7c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7245c360d00c39cf7c87df931738352875e7c4/291_132_2923_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The couple\u2019s decision to hold a private christening for their son Archie was criticised by the tabloids.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple\u2019s decision to hold a private christening for their son Archie was criticised by the tabloids.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so for a few of those reasons, I was inclined to cheer the headlines that suggested she and her husband wanted to give it up. On closer examination, inevitably, the cheer became a shrug. There were far too many caveats to what the <em>Spectator </em>calls the \u201cpseudo-abdication\u201d, far too many grounds to claim, in the spirit of our times, that the royal couple just want to have their cake and eat it.</p> <p>As in the rapid-fire table talk of <em>Succession</em>, the argument of their website moves seamlessly from the emotional high ground of independence and wellbeing to the bottom line of who gets what and how much. Quite rightly, in order to pursue their new status the royal couple are prepared to give up the estimated 5% of their income that comes directly from the public purse. But their case is damaged by special pleading.</p> <p>One ill-considered part of their website attempts to get deeper into the weeds of their funding and to pursue the most specious of all arguments about a hereditary monarchy: that it represents a real bargain for which we should all be grateful. The institution costs each British citizen about \u00a31 a year, the duke and duchess argue. Leave aside the maths that shows the true figure (\u00a389m divided by 65 million) is nearer \u00a31.36, the implication is that the royals provide far better value for money than a Netflix subscription and arguably offer far greater entertainment.</p> <p>For all their talk of independence there is a tacit understanding in this \u2013 presumably principally from Harry \u2013 that their personal sovereignty will always be circumscribed by the monarch\u2019s control of the purse strings. Royals are not allowed, this narrative goes, to make money, and therefore are not at liberty to make decisions about their lives. This is, of course, a rule that depends on the very British myth that to live off the sweated assets of inherited land is to be some kind of disinterested custodian, above the concerns of commerce. The Duchy of Cornwall, 135,000 acres granted to the Black Prince in 1337, brings in \u00a3192m annually. Ninety-five per cent of the money on which the duke and duchess of Sussex live is granted to them out of that generous pot, which in turn is granted to Prince Charles. It comes with obligations. The thought does not appear to have cropped up in Vancouver pillow talk that genuine independence might require them to give up that, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd4ad9fd8b92ab2a880cbcf71c43c65f5ecba635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd4ad9fd8b92ab2a880cbcf71c43c65f5ecba635/0_221_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The couple toured South Africa in September last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple toured South Africa in September last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The precise trigger \u2013 why now? \u2013 for the Windsor Two\u2019s break for the Canadian border is the cause of much speculation. It became clear on their recent official trip to South Africa that their generally laudable efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/19/elton-john-defends-harry-and-meghan-over-use-of-private-jets\" title=\"\">educate the world about global injustice from the steps of private jets</a> was always likely to have the charge of hypocrisy wired in. At least Bono can sing. The decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\" title=\"\">pursue lawsuits against the tabloid press</a> seemed in part a thin-skinned reaction to such cynicism about their \u201cwokeness\u201d, but no doubt they also felt the palace could be more supportive of their legal efforts to protect a vestige of their privacy. Enough had long been enough.</p> <p>Or perhaps it was simply being liberated from keeping up appearances at Sandringham for Christmas that made them determined to retreat. Markle could have been forgiven for running a mile from her in-laws from the moment when Princess Michael of Kent celebrated her arrival in the family by wearing an outsized blackamoor brooch. But given her #MeToo campaigning, she might understandably have felt that the prospect of pulling Christmas crackers with the sex offender-defending uncle was never going to work.</p> <p>Maybe they decided to jump before they were pushed. In the aftermath of Prince Andrew\u2019s <em>Newsnight</em> interview, the heir to the throne has been expressing public determination for a \u201cslimmed down\u201d monarchy \u2013 one that concentrated only on the line of succession. It\u2019s probably no more than coincidence that the second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/03/portrait-of-the-queen-and-three-future-kings-released\" title=\"\">official portrait featuring just the Queen and her three primogeniture heirs</a> was released last Monday to celebrate the \u201cmonarchy for a new decade\u201d. I guess Harry has got used to it, but who really wants to be the emotional new dad informed that his son will never be quite as favoured as his brother\u2019s?</p> <p>If the Sussexes genuinely want to do things on their own terms, however, it is clear that they will need to make more sacrifices than they have outlined. The palace believes that the new arrangement needs to be resolved quickly; the Queen wants a \u201cworkable solution\u201d by Tuesday. The \u201ccrisis talks\u201d that are under way this weekend between Prince Charles and his second son are therefore a rarified version of those that every parent has with their offspring at some point: do they continue to live off the bank of mum and dad, sleep in the spare room, be nagged about what time they are coming in, or are they prepared to take the financial hit in order to buy their freedom and get a place of their own?</p> <p>It is not as if the duke and duchess are strapped for cash. It is understood that Prince Harry has a personal fortune of \u00a330m \u2013 two thirds of it inherited from his mother \u2013 and that Markle is personally worth \u00a34m. Here\u2019s a radical thought: why not simply tell dad and grandma that they have more than enough to live on for several lifetimes; that they don\u2019t require <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/25/harry-and-meghans-new-home-cost-taxpayer-24m\" title=\"\">Frogmore Cottage</a>, and neither do they wish to exploit their \u201croyal brand\u201d by selling sweatshirts or patronage. If they really want to be the change they argue for, why not actually, amicably, hand back the titles and the trappings and model a life based on the principle of inclusivity they are keen to champion?</p> <p>Markle\u2019s recent assertion that it is \u201cnot enough to survive, the point of life is to thrive\u201d is a piece of wisdom she says she has repeated over and over to her husband. It carries the possibility of a whole other way of living than that represented by the monarchy. Now\u2019s the moment to prove that wisdom. Taking a truly independent path would not only allow Harry Windsor to reach full maturity, it might even prove a first step in the nation thinking how to finally do so as well.</p>",

It seemed unlikely, watching the Duchess of Sussex leave the chapel, that she would have much interest in a life in which she was routinely told where to go and how to behave. Perhaps as a consequence, the \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d the \u201cbiracial princess\u201d brought to the Windsors at her wedding was not allowed to last beyond the honeymoon. The charge list against her from the \u201cknow your place\u201d Stasi of the Daily Mail only grew. She wore the wrong denier tights to some garden party, was a bit slow to present her newborn son to the cameras, was tricky at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. If Harry\u2019s mother, daughter of an earl, experienced the culture shock of royal repression at 20, how must it all have seemed to Markle at 38? And so for a few of those reasons, I was inclined to cheer the headlines that suggested she and her husband wanted to give it up. On closer examination, inevitably, the cheer became a shrug. There were far too many caveats to what the Spectator calls the \u201cpseudo-abdication\u201d, far too many grounds to claim, in the spirit of our times, that the royal couple just want to have their cake and eat it. As in the rapid-fire table talk of Succession, the argument of their website moves seamlessly from the emotional high ground of independence and wellbeing to the bottom line of who gets what and how much. Quite rightly, in order to pursue their new status the royal couple are prepared to give up the estimated 5% of their income that comes directly from the public purse. But their case is damaged by special pleading. One ill-considered part of their website attempts to get deeper into the weeds of their funding and to pursue the most specious of all arguments about a hereditary monarchy: that it represents a real bargain for which we should all be grateful. The institution costs each British citizen about \u00a31 a year, the duke and duchess argue. Leave aside the maths that shows the true figure (\u00a389m divided by 65 million) is nearer \u00a31.36, the implication is that the royals provide far better value for money than a Netflix subscription and arguably offer far greater entertainment. For all their talk of independence there is a tacit understanding in this \u2013 presumably principally from Harry \u2013 that their personal sovereignty will always be circumscribed by the monarch\u2019s control of the purse strings. Royals are not allowed, this narrative goes, to make money, and therefore are not at liberty to make decisions about their lives. This is, of course, a rule that depends on the very British myth that to live off the sweated assets of inherited land is to be some kind of disinterested custodian, above the concerns of commerce. The Duchy of Cornwall, 135,000 acres granted to the Black Prince in 1337, brings in \u00a3192m annually. Ninety-five per cent of the money on which the duke and duchess of Sussex live is granted to them out of that generous pot, which in turn is granted to Prince Charles. It comes with obligations. The thought does not appear to have cropped up in Vancouver pillow talk that genuine independence might require them to give up that, too. The precise trigger \u2013 why now? \u2013 for the Windsor Two\u2019s break for the Canadian border is the cause of much speculation. It became clear on their recent official trip to South Africa that their generally laudable efforts to educate the world about global injustice from the steps of private jets was always likely to have the charge of hypocrisy wired in. At least Bono can sing. The decision to pursue lawsuits against the tabloid press seemed in part a thin-skinned reaction to such cynicism about their \u201cwokeness\u201d, but no doubt they also felt the palace could be more supportive of their legal efforts to protect a vestige of their privacy. Enough had long been enough. Or perhaps it was simply being liberated from keeping up appearances at Sandringham for Christmas that made them determined to retreat. Markle could have been forgiven for running a mile from her in-laws from the moment when Princess Michael of Kent celebrated her arrival in the family by wearing an outsized blackamoor brooch. But given her #MeToo campaigning, she might understandably have felt that the prospect of pulling Christmas crackers with the sex offender-defending uncle was never going to work. Maybe they decided to jump before they were pushed. In the aftermath of Prince Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview, the heir to the throne has been expressing public determination for a \u201cslimmed down\u201d monarchy \u2013 one that concentrated only on the line of succession. It\u2019s probably no more than coincidence that the second official portrait featuring just the Queen and her three primogeniture heirs was released last Monday to celebrate the \u201cmonarchy for a new decade\u201d. I guess Harry has got used to it, but who really wants to be the emotional new dad informed that his son will never be quite as favoured as his brother\u2019s? If the Sussexes genuinely want to do things on their own terms, however, it is clear that they will need to make more sacrifices than they have outlined. The palace believes that the new arrangement needs to be resolved quickly; the Queen wants a \u201cworkable solution\u201d by Tuesday. The \u201ccrisis talks\u201d that are under way this weekend between Prince Charles and his second son are therefore a rarified version of those that every parent has with their offspring at some point: do they continue to live off the bank of mum and dad, sleep in the spare room, be nagged about what time they are coming in, or are they prepared to take the financial hit in order to buy their freedom and get a place of their own? It is not as if the duke and duchess are strapped for cash. It is understood that Prince Harry has a personal fortune of \u00a330m \u2013 two thirds of it inherited from his mother \u2013 and that Markle is personally worth \u00a34m. Here\u2019s a radical thought: why not simply tell dad and grandma that they have more than enough to live on for several lifetimes; that they don\u2019t require Frogmore Cottage, and neither do they wish to exploit their \u201croyal brand\u201d by selling sweatshirts or patronage. If they really want to be the change they argue for, why not actually, amicably, hand back the titles and the trappings and model a life based on the principle of inclusivity they are keen to champion? Markle\u2019s recent assertion that it is \u201cnot enough to survive, the point of life is to thrive\u201d is a piece of wisdom she says she has repeated over and over to her husband. It carries the possibility of a whole other way of living than that represented by the monarchy. Now\u2019s the moment to prove that wisdom. Taking a truly independent path would not only allow Harry Windsor to reach full maturity, it might even prove a first step in the nation thinking how to finally do so as well.",

      "body": "<p>In common with most other five-year-olds, Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe enjoys drawing, making up stories and eating chocolate biscuits. She especially loves holding her father\u2019s hand. She takes it assertively, as if she is saying: \u201cThis is my daddy and no one can separate us.\u201d It\u2019s moving to see, and for her father, Richard Ratcliffe, it is also, painfully, very new.</p> <p>\u201cTaking my hand when we walk together \u2013 she wasn\u2019t doing that a month ago,\u201d he says. Gabriella returned to the UK in October from Iran, where she had been living with her grandparents since her British-Iranian mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/26/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-spends-40th-birthday-in-iranian-jail\" title=\"\">Nazanin, was imprisoned there nearly four years ago</a> on espionage charges. Gabriella was 18 months old when she last saw her father, who was denied a visa to visit her in Iran.</p> <p>At first, he says, she was quite shy. \u201cThere was a real stepdad dynamic. When she got sad or tired, she didn\u2019t want me.\u201d He has had to earn the right to parent her again. \u201cWe\u2019re much further on than we were. But it takes time to build trust.\u201d</p> <p>It was Gabriella\u2019s first week at school last week, but fears about how tensions with Iran could affect her mother\u2019s prison sentence have eclipsed any excitement her father might have felt in more normal circumstances. Until Donald Trump ordered the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, Ratcliffe had thought \u201cthere was a very good chance\u201d his wife would be released in the first half of this year, following a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-50698017\" title=\"\">prisoner swap</a> in December of US and Iranian citizens.</p> <p>Now he thinks she is unlikely to be released, even at the end of her five-year prison sentence next year. \u201cI think we would be very lucky to get back to a place where prisoners are being released ... If we get to the end of her sentence without her being freed, I would presume they will just add some more years on.\u201d</p> <p>The current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/british-ambassador-arrested-at-demonstration-in-tehran-reports\" title=\"\">political situation</a> is making him feel hopeless and Zaghari-Ratcliffe feel desolate, he says. \u201cShe got taken to the prison clinic in the middle of the night on Tuesday with palpitations, an irregular heartbeat and panic attacks.\u201d</p> <p>She was given beta blockers to calm her down. \u201cNazanin has lots of time to dwell on how unfair and hopeless her situation is, and a recurring panic has set in,\u201d says her husband.</p> <p>In phone calls, he no longer has anything to offer her in terms of hope. \u201cWe are obviously in a fundamentally much darker place than we were at the start of January in terms of the relationship between the west and Iran,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d85bbc3d3ccb68944b6533e2e70903bcd4f7ec4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d85bbc3d3ccb68944b6533e2e70903bcd4f7ec4f/0_122_1376_1422/968.jpg\" alt=\"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in Iran in August 2018.\" width=\"968\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in Iran in August 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Free Nazanin campaign/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had assumed that Boris Johnson would feel a strong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/06/boris-johnson-mistake-could-harm-case-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-say-family\" title=\"\">sense of responsibility</a> to bring Zaghari-Ratcliffe home once he became prime minister, especially after the election. \u201cHe has the power and the authority to do things he hadn\u2019t been able to before. I told Nazanin there was a chance,\u201d says Ratcliffe.</p> <p>But the prime minister has so far failed to speak to him or the families of other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/british-australian-women-detained-arrested-iran-tehran\" title=\"\">British citizens imprisoned in Iran</a>, although a meeting may take place in the next couple of weeks. \u201cI think he is reluctant to engage. There is that instinct, that many politicians have, of trying to duck out of hard conversations. You cannot do that. He doesn\u2019t have to tell me what I want to hear. But I do want him to meet me, sit down and say: \u2018Listen, I take responsibility for protecting her.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Last week, for the first time, the government acknowledged in parliament that Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s imprisonment was \u201chostage taking\u201d. Yet Johnson, Ratcliffe says, is behaving like a \u201cpolitical eunuch\u201d at the top table of power. \u201cIf the prime minister is going to protect British people, then his word needs to matter. It needs to be visible. It needs to be resonant.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Johnson seems reluctant to put his head above the parapet. \u201cI think the UK is looking to cause no offence.

      "bodyText": "In common with most other five-year-olds, Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe enjoys drawing, making up stories and eating chocolate biscuits. She especially loves holding her father\u2019s hand. She takes it assertively, as if she is saying: \u201cThis is my daddy and no one can separate us.\u201d It\u2019s moving to see, and for her father, Richard Ratcliffe, it is also, painfully, very new. \u201cTaking my hand when we walk together \u2013 she wasn\u2019t doing that a month ago,\u201d he says. Gabriella returned to the UK in October from Iran, where she had been living with her grandparents since her British-Iranian mother, Nazanin, was imprisoned there nearly four years ago on espionage charges. Gabriella was 18 months old when she last saw her father, who was denied a visa to visit her in Iran. At first, he says, she was quite shy. \u201cThere was a real stepdad dynamic. When she got sad or tired, she didn\u2019t want me.\u201d He has had to earn the right to parent her again. \u201cWe\u2019re much further on than we were. But it takes time to build trust.\u201d It was Gabriella\u2019s first week at school last week, but fears about how tensions with Iran could affect her mother\u2019s prison sentence have eclipsed any excitement her father might have felt in more normal circumstances. Until Donald Trump ordered the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, Ratcliffe had thought \u201cthere was a very good chance\u201d his wife would be released in the first half of this year, following a prisoner swap in December of US and Iranian citizens. Now he thinks she is unlikely to be released, even at the end of her five-year prison sentence next year. \u201cI think we would be very lucky to get back to a place where prisoners are being released ... If we get to the end of her sentence without her being freed, I would presume they will just add some more years on.\u201d The current political situation is making him feel hopeless and Zaghari-Ratcliffe feel desolate, he says. \u201cShe got taken to the prison clinic in the middle of the night on Tuesday with palpitations, an irregular heartbeat and panic attacks.\u201d She was given beta blockers to calm her down. \u201cNazanin has lots of time to dwell on how unfair and hopeless her situation is, and a recurring panic has set in,\u201d says her husband. In phone calls, he no longer has anything to offer her in terms of hope. \u201cWe are obviously in a fundamentally much darker place than we were at the start of January in terms of the relationship between the west and Iran,\u201d he says. He had assumed that Boris Johnson would feel a strong sense of responsibility to bring Zaghari-Ratcliffe home once he became prime minister, especially after the election. \u201cHe has the power and the authority to do things he hadn\u2019t been able to before. I told Nazanin there was a chance,\u201d says Ratcliffe. But the prime minister has so far failed to speak to him or the families of other British citizens imprisoned in Iran, although a meeting may take place in the next couple of weeks. \u201cI think he is reluctant to engage. There is that instinct, that many politicians have, of trying to duck out of hard conversations. You cannot do that. He doesn\u2019t have to tell me what I want to hear. But I do want him to meet me, sit down and say: \u2018Listen, I take responsibility for protecting her.\u2019\u201d Last week, for the first time, the government acknowledged in parliament that Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s imprisonment was \u201chostage taking\u201d. Yet Johnson, Ratcliffe says, is behaving like a \u201cpolitical eunuch\u201d at the top table of power. \u201cIf the prime minister is going to protect British people, then his word needs to matter. It needs to be visible. It needs to be resonant.\u201d Instead, Johnson seems reluctant to put his head above the parapet. \u201cI think the UK is looking to cause no offence. And that\u2019s a really hard path to walk,\u201d says Ratcliffe. He wants the prime minister to state publicly \u2013 and to make it clear to both the American and the Iranian authorities \u2013 that the UK\u2019s priority is to de-escalate the situation by bringing about the release of British citizens including his wife. Instead, he thinks Johnson sees her case as a distraction from \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m clinging on to wanting to meet the prime minister and just wanting him to be visible \u2013 to take a stand, and say, clearly, \u2018I\u2019m going to protect these people\u2019.\u201d In the meantime, he is trying to renew his relationship with a child who often cries herself to sleep at night, missing her mother and grandmother. \u201cWhen she came over, she would, at the beginning, have to sleep next to someone, physically touching them. She\u2019s better now, but she still likes to have someone in her room when she goes to sleep.\u201d Less than 24 hours before Gabriella was scheduled to fly to the UK, he was warned she would be prevented from leaving Iran.

The tribunal judgment was damning of the BBC\u2019s arguments for paying Jeremy Vine an extraordinary \u00a33,000 per episode on BBC 1\u2019s <em>Points of View</em>, a 15-minute programme. It was <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2206858-2018rjr.pdf\" title=\"\">a sum agreed in 2008</a> when he was \u201cup and coming\u201d but had not yet arrived at Destination Fame.</p> \n<p>Ahmed hosted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qjrk2/episodes/player\" title=\"\"><em>Newswatch</em></a>, which followed a similar 15-minute format on the BBC News channel.

The <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/immigration/missing-migrants/\">Center for Public Integrity</a> estimates that more than 2,000 of the deceased remain unidentified. Deaths are currently increasing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">The Missing Migrants Project</a>, which tracks migrant deaths and disappearances globally, has recorded the deaths of 496 people trying to cross the border from Mexico to the US in 2019, of which 217 were in Texas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the highest total for border deaths we have recorded in any year since 2014,\u201d said Kate Dearden, project officer for the Missing Migrant Project. She said only 114 people have been identified so far.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just 23%,\u201d she added.</p> <p>In the past decade hundreds of bodies have been buried haphazardly by county authorities, placed in unmarked <a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/illegal-mass-graves-of-migrant-remains-found-in-south-texas/\">mass graves</a> without analysis or records of their location.</p> <p>\u201cThey were just thrown in. It was a humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Eddie Canales of the <a href=\"https://southtexashumanrights.org/\">South Texas Human Rights Center</a>.</p> <p>Spradley agreed that earlier exhumations at another cemetery in the area exposed an acute lack of consideration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24debfffb7d7557e37036fc914a8007c26045b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24debfffb7d7557e37036fc914a8007c26045b31/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Kate Spradley takes notes while overseeing Texas State University graduate students exhuming bodies at the La Grulla cemetery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Kate Spradley takes notes while overseeing Texas State University graduate students exhuming bodies at the La Grulla cemetery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Campos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cVery little care was taken,\u201d said Spradley. \u201cWe would find trash buried with the bodies and trash on top of burials. They were treated like trash.\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, the exact number of migrant deaths on the US-Mexico border remains poorly understood, especially as <a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/many-texans-want-a-border-wall-without-a-federal-land-grab-thats-impossible/\">95% of land on the southern border of Texas is private</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDiscoveries are accidental, so it\u2019s hard to have the numbers,\u201d said Spradley.</p> <p>While the scope of the problem is daunting, Operation Identification has had limited, but meaningful, success. Since 2013, 36 individuals\u2019 exhumed remains have been identified at their lab in San Marcos, Texas, halfway between Austin and San Antonio.</p> <p>Returning from Star county\u2019s La Grulla cemetery, where the Guardian had witnessed the recent exhumation of the six body bags containing migrants\u2019 remains, to the project\u2019s lab, Spradley gestured to hundreds of cardboard boxes lined up around the walls.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not easy work,\u201d she said. Each contains remains and personal effects, awaiting identification.</p> <p>From one box, Spradley removed a luchador\u2019s wrestling mask and a small stuffed lion. In another box, there\u2019s a water bottle, still half-full.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c40f73865dfe9e7ec873edbb3fa90aca825da2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c40f73865dfe9e7ec873edbb3fa90aca825da2a/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stuffed lion carried by an unidentified migrant extracted from a box of their belongs att the Operation Identification facility.

Then any case information and DNA samples are sent to government databases and relevant NGOs in hopes of finding a match with missing person reports from other nations.</p> <p>Last year a family from Puebla, Mexico, recognized facial reconstruction photos of their loved one on the <a href=\"https://www.namus.gov/\">the National Missing, and Unidentified Persons System</a>, which had been provided by OpID.<strong> </strong>They went through a complicated process to have their DNA samples taken and sent to Spradley\u2019s lab, and a match and identity eventually emerged.</p> <p>The migrant was a deceased woman in her late twenties who had several small children.</p> <p>Canales of the South Texas Human Rights Center is involved in trying to ensure people don\u2019t end up as one of those statistics.</p> <p>Accompanying him on a drive through some of the 50,000 dry, scrubby acres of a ranch near the south-eastern end of the US-Mexico border in Texas, Canales explained that there is no official system to search for and retrieve migrants\u2019 bodies, especially outside public lands.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the border in Texas is private land like this,\u201d he said.

Canales believes that number is an undercount.</p> <p>\u201cFor every body found there are many more that never will be,\u201d he said, stepping out of the truck to refill large blue barrels with gallon jugs full of water. The barrels are placed near landmarks \u2013 a road, a clearing, a spot of shade \u2013 in the otherwise dense brushlands of south Texas.</p> <p>Canales has fielded hundreds of calls from distressed family members of missing migrants. Some relatives even end up managing to come to the US to reclaim their loved ones\u2019 remains and preserved belongings. He said the impact of knowing cannot be overstated.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they viewed the whole skeletal remains, there were still doubts. But the personal effects did it,\u201d said Canales, referring to a case in which there was a handwritten note that a sister remembered writing to her now deceased sibling. \u201cThen, the family got closure.\u201d</p> <p>While Spradley acknowledges that this kind of closure is denied to many, every identification is a small achievement. A scrap of humanity restored. A number turned back into a name.</p>",

The project is attempting to tackle the problem of such deaths, the numbers of which surge and dip over the years and are hard to confirm, but are always distressingly high, and the very patchy systems for recording and dealing with them. \u201cAlarming numbers of deceased persons have been buried as \u2018unknown\u2019 without proper analysis or DNA collection, leaving no hope for identification or repatriation,\u201d according to the project\u2019s mission statement. Since 1999 at least 7,500 are believed to have died on the southern border, according to data from Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The Center for Public Integrity estimates that more than 2,000 of the deceased remain unidentified. Deaths are currently increasing. The Missing Migrants Project, which tracks migrant deaths and disappearances globally, has recorded the deaths of 496 people trying to cross the border from Mexico to the US in 2019, of which 217 were in Texas. \u201cThis is the highest total for border deaths we have recorded in any year since 2014,\u201d said Kate Dearden, project officer for the Missing Migrant Project. She said only 114 people have been identified so far. \u201cThat\u2019s just 23%,\u201d she added. In the past decade hundreds of bodies have been buried haphazardly by county authorities, placed in unmarked mass graves without analysis or records of their location. \u201cThey were just thrown in. It was a humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Eddie Canales of the South Texas Human Rights Center. Spradley agreed that earlier exhumations at another cemetery in the area exposed an acute lack of consideration. \u201cVery little care was taken,\u201d said Spradley. \u201cWe would find trash buried with the bodies and trash on top of burials. They were treated like trash.\u201d Furthermore, the exact number of migrant deaths on the US-Mexico border remains poorly understood, especially as 95% of land on the southern border of Texas is private. \u201cDiscoveries are accidental, so it\u2019s hard to have the numbers,\u201d said Spradley. While the scope of the problem is daunting, Operation Identification has had limited, but meaningful, success. Since 2013, 36 individuals\u2019 exhumed remains have been identified at their lab in San Marcos, Texas, halfway between Austin and San Antonio. Returning from Star county\u2019s La Grulla cemetery, where the Guardian had witnessed the recent exhumation of the six body bags containing migrants\u2019 remains, to the project\u2019s lab, Spradley gestured to hundreds of cardboard boxes lined up around the walls. \u201cThis is not easy work,\u201d she said. Each contains remains and personal effects, awaiting identification. From one box, Spradley removed a luchador\u2019s wrestling mask and a small stuffed lion. In another box, there\u2019s a water bottle, still half-full. Remains are cleaned and processed. Then any case information and DNA samples are sent to government databases and relevant NGOs in hopes of finding a match with missing person reports from other nations. Last year a family from Puebla, Mexico, recognized facial reconstruction photos of their loved one on the the National Missing, and Unidentified Persons System, which had been provided by OpID. They went through a complicated process to have their DNA samples taken and sent to Spradley\u2019s lab, and a match and identity eventually emerged. The migrant was a deceased woman in her late twenties who had several small children. Canales of the South Texas Human Rights Center is involved in trying to ensure people don\u2019t end up as one of those statistics. Accompanying him on a drive through some of the 50,000 dry, scrubby acres of a ranch near the south-eastern end of the US-Mexico border in Texas, Canales explained that there is no official system to search for and retrieve migrants\u2019 bodies, especially outside public lands. \u201cMost of the border in Texas is private land like this,\u201d he said. He was heading out in his pickup to refill an informal water station to help those trekking through the vast, confusing border-area landscape. Since 2012 Canales has set up 170 local water stations, in hopes of saving migrants passing through the Brooks county area, where about 700 bodies have been found over the past decade. Canales believes that number is an undercount. \u201cFor every body found there are many more that never will be,\u201d he said, stepping out of the truck to refill large blue barrels with gallon jugs full of water. The barrels are placed near landmarks \u2013 a road, a clearing, a spot of shade \u2013 in the otherwise dense brushlands of south Texas. Canales has fielded hundreds of calls from distressed family members of missing migrants. Some relatives even end up managing to come to the US to reclaim their loved ones\u2019 remains and preserved belongings. He said the impact of knowing cannot be overstated. \u201cWhen they viewed the whole skeletal remains, there were still doubts. But the personal effects did it,\u201d said Canales, referring to a case in which there was a handwritten note that a sister remembered writing to her now deceased sibling. \u201cThen, the family got closure.\u201d While Spradley acknowledges that this kind of closure is denied to many, every identification is a small achievement. A scrap of humanity restored. A number turned back into a name.",

      "body": "<p>Which previous royal crisis does the current one most closely resemble? Given the reflexive British response to any royal drama, it was no time before crack monarchy experts identified the incredible similarities between the abdication of Edward VIII and an overdue realisation by the constitutionally insignificant Sussexes that palace life is unlikely to suit anyone independent and talented, especially when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/the-treatment-of-meghan-is-racist-we-should-feel-able-to-say-so?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">racism</a> intensifies those twin deterrents \u2013 the Queen\u2019s household and the British press. Don\u2019t both events feature US divorcees, separated only by 84 years and racial difference? Snap.</p> <p>If only the similarities had been spotted sooner and warnings issued. For what psychic could possibly have predicted, having read Meghan Markle\u2019s blog, or seen <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/footage-emerges-of-11yearold-meghan-markle-lobbying-us-firm-to-drop-sexist-dishwasher-ad-a3707021.html\" title=\"\">footage</a> of her, aged 11, condemning sexist TV ads, that she might not submit as readily as her otherwise unemployable in-laws, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, to a career principally composed, for its lead female members, of dutiful handshaking and smirking? Or guessed how very quickly this occupation might pall if, unlike Camilla, Kate and, indeed, Prince Andrew, Meghan were simultaneously to find herself stalked by obsessed celebrity-commentators, some of them partnering in this experiment with estranged members of her own family?</p> <p>If Meghan never, unlike Diana, Princess of Wales, had to run from photographers, she has been subjected, courtesy in particular of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, to a new, permissible variation on press harassment: relentless, condescending censure informed by what 70 female MPs recently described as \u201coutdated, colonial undertones\u201d. One day, a reprimand might focus on Meghan\u2019s relationship with her father, another on her tights, her friends, her \u201cbump-boasting\u201d, her extravagance, her ruthlessness, her unhappy staff, her christening photographs, her meanness to Kate. Not forgetting her <em>Vogue</em> editing, chapel dissing, Queen snubbing, baby showering, baby holding, baby hiding and Harry controlling. In the light of this trolling, the press\u2019s earlier pursuit of Diana practically radiates mutual respect.</p> <p>Among alternatives to the abdication, the Sussex crisis has been compared to Diana\u2019s unexpected decision in 1993 \u2013 shortly after the <em>Sunday Mirror</em> published illicit gym photographs of her on her back, in a leotard \u2013 to retreat, as it turned out temporarily, from public duties. After much private rehearsal, she delivered a <a href=\"https://www.settelen.com/diana_time_and_space.htm\" title=\"\">speech</a> that was, according to her disapproving private secretary, Patrick Jephson, \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d. \u201cI hope you can find it in your hearts to understand and to give me the time and space that has been lacking in recent years.\u201d The royal household had been alerted but only thanks to Jephson: \u201cUnknown to my boss, I had written a briefing note for the Queen herself.\u201d Colleagues were to expect a \u201ctearful and very public withdrawal\u201d, which, he writes in his heavily disdainful memoir, \u201cappealed to the martyr, the emotionally deprived child and the showgirl within her\u201d.</p> <p>Not having been around \u2013 quite \u2013 long enough for the abdication, but lucky enough to witness, as a <em>Guardian</em> reporter, Diana\u2019s sublime performance in 1993, I\u2019m more struck by the big difference between that and the Sussexes\u2019 exit: the civility the princess received from her customary persecutors. She had, to media dismay, already delivered one major shock, Andrew Morton\u2019s book, with which she initially denied any connection.</p> <p>Technically, like the Sussexes, the kind-of departing princess was letting down the Queen, occupying a free palace, sponging off taxpayers, had carefully \u201cplotted\u201d her escape \u2013 but had no thought of \u201cworking to become\u201d financially independent. Jephson thought she was, in the phrase currently popular with disapproving republicans and disapproving royalists alike, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/hrh-royal-titles-duke-duchess-sussex-a4330656.html\" title=\"\">having her cake and eating it</a>\u201d. And yet instead of asking something such as \u201cWho the f**k do they think they are?\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-7868371/PIERS-MORGAN-Queen-FIRE-Royal-Hustlers.html\" title=\"\">the <em>Mail</em> announced</a>: \u201cCharles Drove Her To It.\u201d \u201cEarly reports,\u201d Jephson wrote, \u201cwere of uncritical understanding and sympathy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why the hostility? Who knows. Why did Iago hate the Moor?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when it came to Diana\u2019s son and his wife, early reports abounded in name-calling and derision, principally from the voices whose sustained, seemingly visceral enmity has contributed to the Sussexes\u2019 unhappiness. Or to summarise these rebukes, in the new loyalty-sanctioned argot of the <em>Daily Mail</em>: how dare you fucking escape, you fucking bastards?</p> <p>Why the hostility? Who knows. Why did Iago hate the Moor? Claims about reckless constitutional damage have proved, however, a convenient front for motiveless malignity.</p> <p>The proposal that the Sussex exit, however inconvenient or half-baked, endangers the monarchy should, again, be compared to the serial jolts of the Diana years, also featuring Charles\u2019s Camillagate adventures, the princess\u2019s <em>Panorama</em> interview, Fayed freebies and a heartlessly misjudged funeral procession, from all of which the extended dependent family emerged prosperously intact.</p> <p>More topically, the Sussex announcement is arguably less of a blow to this cornerstone of the constitution than, say, the crown\u2019s inability to resist manipulation and lies orchestrated by the Downing Street bum-flasher, <a href=\"https://www.metro.news/scruff-at-the-top-guru-hangs-loose-to-crack-on-with-job/1865623/\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a>. Even with their failings officially confirmed by Madame Tussauds \u2013 where they are expected shortly to reappear in a flickering tableau around Richard III \u2013 the Sussexes\u2019 conduct may appear to some subjects less outrageous than Prince Andrew\u2019s. If the Queen felt similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/queens-fury-what-the-papers-said-about-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-bombshell\" title=\"\">fury</a> or disappointment when she found she\u2019d hosted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it never reached the press.</p> <p>Turning to another Epstein associate, we find <a href=\"https://en.vogue.me/culture/sarah-duchess-of-york-interview/\" title=\"\">Sarah Ferguson</a> flogging her new \u201clifestyle brand\u201d, Sarah Senses, in Riyadh, as a special guest of Prince <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman</a>. Perhaps, encouragingly for the future of SussexRoyal branded merch, the Saudi-loving duchess has yet to be identified as either a constitutional hazard or a royal disappointment. If anything, the departing Sussexes have surely strengthened the monarchy, not just by accelerating, with this unscheduled purge, the slimming-down demanded both by reformers and Prince Charles.</p> <p>Sympathy for the spurned Queen is absolute. And nothing, after decades of mutual suspicion, appears to have united the palace and sections of the press like the conviction that mutinous incomers are a greater threat to a monarchy than its longstanding connections with a predatory paedophile. They could both, however, be wrong.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Which previous royal crisis does the current one most closely resemble? Given the reflexive British response to any royal drama, it was no time before crack monarchy experts identified the incredible similarities between the abdication of Edward VIII and an overdue realisation by the constitutionally insignificant Sussexes that palace life is unlikely to suit anyone independent and talented, especially when racism intensifies those twin deterrents \u2013 the Queen\u2019s household and the British press. Don\u2019t both events feature US divorcees, separated only by 84 years and racial difference? Snap. If only the similarities had been spotted sooner and warnings issued. For what psychic could possibly have predicted, having read Meghan Markle\u2019s blog, or seen footage of her, aged 11, condemning sexist TV ads, that she might not submit as readily as her otherwise unemployable in-laws, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, to a career principally composed, for its lead female members, of dutiful handshaking and smirking? Or guessed how very quickly this occupation might pall if, unlike Camilla, Kate and, indeed, Prince Andrew, Meghan were simultaneously to find herself stalked by obsessed celebrity-commentators, some of them partnering in this experiment with estranged members of her own family? If Meghan never, unlike Diana, Princess of Wales, had to run from photographers, she has been subjected, courtesy in particular of the Daily Mail, to a new, permissible variation on press harassment: relentless, condescending censure informed by what 70 female MPs recently described as \u201coutdated, colonial undertones\u201d. One day, a reprimand might focus on Meghan\u2019s relationship with her father, another on her tights, her friends, her \u201cbump-boasting\u201d, her extravagance, her ruthlessness, her unhappy staff, her christening photographs, her meanness to Kate. Not forgetting her Vogue editing, chapel dissing, Queen snubbing, baby showering, baby holding, baby hiding and Harry controlling. In the light of this trolling, the press\u2019s earlier pursuit of Diana practically radiates mutual respect. Among alternatives to the abdication, the Sussex crisis has been compared to Diana\u2019s unexpected decision in 1993 \u2013 shortly after the Sunday Mirror published illicit gym photographs of her on her back, in a leotard \u2013 to retreat, as it turned out temporarily, from public duties. After much private rehearsal, she delivered a speech that was, according to her disapproving private secretary, Patrick Jephson, \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d. \u201cI hope you can find it in your hearts to understand and to give me the time and space that has been lacking in recent years.\u201d The royal household had been alerted but only thanks to Jephson: \u201cUnknown to my boss, I had written a briefing note for the Queen herself.\u201d Colleagues were to expect a \u201ctearful and very public withdrawal\u201d, which, he writes in his heavily disdainful memoir, \u201cappealed to the martyr, the emotionally deprived child and the showgirl within her\u201d. Not having been around \u2013 quite \u2013 long enough for the abdication, but lucky enough to witness, as a Guardian reporter, Diana\u2019s sublime performance in 1993, I\u2019m more struck by the big difference between that and the Sussexes\u2019 exit: the civility the princess received from her customary persecutors. She had, to media dismay, already delivered one major shock, Andrew Morton\u2019s book, with which she initially denied any connection. Technically, like the Sussexes, the kind-of departing princess was letting down the Queen, occupying a free palace, sponging off taxpayers, had carefully \u201cplotted\u201d her escape \u2013 but had no thought of \u201cworking to become\u201d financially independent. Jephson thought she was, in the phrase currently popular with disapproving republicans and disapproving royalists alike, \u201chaving her cake and eating it\u201d. And yet instead of asking something such as \u201cWho the f**k do they think they are?\u201d, the Mail announced: \u201cCharles Drove Her To It.\u201d \u201cEarly reports,\u201d Jephson wrote, \u201cwere of uncritical understanding and sympathy.\u201d But when it came to Diana\u2019s son and his wife, early reports abounded in name-calling and derision, principally from the voices whose sustained, seemingly visceral enmity has contributed to the Sussexes\u2019 unhappiness. Or to summarise these rebukes, in the new loyalty-sanctioned argot of the Daily Mail: how dare you fucking escape, you fucking bastards? Why the hostility? Who knows. Why did Iago hate the Moor? Claims about reckless constitutional damage have proved, however, a convenient front for motiveless malignity. The proposal that the Sussex exit, however inconvenient or half-baked, endangers the monarchy should, again, be compared to the serial jolts of the Diana years, also featuring Charles\u2019s Camillagate adventures, the princess\u2019s Panorama interview, Fayed freebies and a heartlessly misjudged funeral procession, from all of which the extended dependent family emerged prosperously intact. More topically, the Sussex announcement is arguably less of a blow to this cornerstone of the constitution than, say, the crown\u2019s inability to resist manipulation and lies orchestrated by the Downing Street bum-flasher, Dominic Cummings. Even with their failings officially confirmed by Madame Tussauds \u2013 where they are expected shortly to reappear in a flickering tableau around Richard III \u2013 the Sussexes\u2019 conduct may appear to some subjects less outrageous than Prince Andrew\u2019s. If the Queen felt similar fury or disappointment when she found she\u2019d hosted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it never reached the press. Turning to another Epstein associate, we find Sarah Ferguson flogging her new \u201clifestyle brand\u201d, Sarah Senses, in Riyadh, as a special guest of Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Perhaps, encouragingly for the future of SussexRoyal branded merch, the Saudi-loving duchess has yet to be identified as either a constitutional hazard or a royal disappointment. If anything, the departing Sussexes have surely strengthened the monarchy, not just by accelerating, with this unscheduled purge, the slimming-down demanded both by reformers and Prince Charles. Sympathy for the spurned Queen is absolute. And nothing, after decades of mutual suspicion, appears to have united the palace and sections of the press like the conviction that mutinous incomers are a greater threat to a monarchy than its longstanding connections with a predatory paedophile. They could both, however, be wrong. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

Several of the Democratic candidates have called for overhaul of the current system, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-town-hall-electoral-college.html\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/452738-sanders-says-he-favors-abolishing-the-electoral-college\">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/11/buttigieg-details-douglass-plan-black-americans/\">Pete Buttigieg</a>.</p> <p>The solution they propose in common is quite simple \u2013 replace the convoluted electoral college with a direct national popular vote that would hand the presidency to whichever candidate garners most votes across the country.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has the dubious distinction of being the only US president since Gallup began tracking presidential approval ratings in 1938 to have been permanently \u201cunder water\u201d \u2013 he has never been viewed favorably by half or more of the American electorate. Trump should, by historical precedent, be looking at a thumping defeat in the 2020 presidential election. But political scientists and strategists have told the Guardian that he could be thrown a re-election lifeline thanks to the country\u2019s quirky approach to democracy in the form of the electoral college. The political analyst Larry Sabato has calculated that the 3 November election could see Trump being outgunned by his Democratic challenger in the popular vote \u2013 the total number of votes cast nationwide \u2013 by twice the amount that Hillary Clinton surpassed him in 2016, yet still return to the White House for a second term. \u201cIt is entirely possible that in 2020 we will once again see Republicans losing the popular vote and winning the electoral college, this time potentially by even greater margins,\u201d he said. The electoral college was the compromise system for choosing US presidents devised by the founding fathers. Its aim was to balance the direct votes of qualified citizens with a vote in Congress. The result is that the occupant of the Oval Office is not elected directly by the American people but indirectly by state-based \u201celectors\u201d. There are 538 electors in total, which means that to win the White House the successful candidate must attract the votes of 270 of them. In most election cycles the electoral college results have been in sync with the popular vote. But in 2016 a dramatic gulf opened up. In the electoral college Trump won handsomely \u2013 by 306 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 232. But in the popular vote Clinton was the clear winner with 65.9m votes to Trump\u2019s 63.0m votes \u2013 a difference of two percentage points (48% to 46%). By Sabato\u2019s reckoning, that rift between the electoral college and the popular vote could be stretched further in November and see Trump win again. \u201cThe 2020 Democratic nominee could easily double Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote to at least three or four percentage points, and still lose, depending on where those votes came from,\u201d Sabato said. The fear that the electoral college could give Trump four more years to transform America in his image has rippled through the Democrats competing to challenge him in the election. Several of the Democratic candidates have called for overhaul of the current system, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. The solution they propose in common is quite simple \u2013 replace the convoluted electoral college with a direct national popular vote that would hand the presidency to whichever candidate garners most votes across the country. That may look straightforward on paper, but the practicalities of switching to a new system are daunting. To change would require an amendment to the US constitution which is much easier said than done. Not only would both the House and Senate in Congress need to approve the change by a two-thirds majority, but three-quarters of the individual state assemblies would have to ratify it (38 out of 50 states) . \u201cA constitutional amendment is out of the question,\u201d said Alan Abramowitz, professor of political science at Emory University. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to get two-thirds of the House and the Senate to support an amendment of any kind.\u201d Advocates of reform have devised clever ways around this roadblock that would essentially keep the electoral college in place but shift its method of counting to the popular vote without requiring a constitutional amendment. The most prominent of these attempts is the National Vote Interstate Compact, which seeks to persuade individual states to sign up to a collective agreement \u2013 the compact \u2013 which would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who garners the most popular votes. The compact would kick in only when enough states had joined to collectively pass the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency. Once that line had been crossed, the participating states would deliver the White House to the winner of the popular vote. The problem with this inventive scheme is that a mountain has yet to be climbed before the magic line of 270 is passed. So far the compact has been enacted into law in 15 states and Washington DC, which between them muster only 196 electoral votes \u2013 a deficit of 74. None of those jurisdictions are Republican-controlled, which is unsurprising given the electoral college has tended to be to the advantage of Republican presidential candidates. The last time the winner of a US presidential election lost the popular vote the discrepancy also helped a Republican \u2013 George W Bush, who in 2000 received 544,000 fewer votes than his vanquished Democratic rival ,Al Gore. You then have to go back to 1888 to find the phenomenon reoccurring. So rare was the anomaly of 2016, 2000 and 1888 that some experts think that a repeat \u201cmisfire\u201d, as the disparity is known, is unlikely in November. Abramowitz has studied all 11 presidential elections since the end of the second world war in which an incumbent was running for re-election \u2013 the last being Barack Obama in 2012 \u2013 and noted there were no misfires. \u201cIf the Trump campaign is counting on the electoral college gifting them the election again, that\u2019s a very high-risk strategy,\u201d he said. On the other hand, as the demography of America changes, the distorting influence of the electoral college appears to be growing. The US population is becoming more diverse, and more heavily concentrated in major cities that lean strongly Democratic. That in turn is creating a tendency for Democratic votes to be \u201cwasted\u201d \u2013 with vastly more being cast in states like California, New York and Illinois than are needed to win the electoral votes. By contrast, Republican voters \u2013 who tend to be less diverse \u2013 are spread out more sparsely in low-density rural states in a way that is more efficient under the electoral college. David Frum, George W Bush\u2019s former speechwriter, said the electoral college is just one of several factors that he calls \u201canti-majoritarian influences\u201d in play in the US today. \u201cIt is a pervasive fact up and down, from local elections to the presidency, that electoral outcomes track voter intent poorly,\u201d he said. Other factors include low levels of voter registration, hurdles to voting and the skewed voting system for the US Senate that apportions Wyoming\u2019s population of 579,000 the same number of senators (two) as California\u2019s 40 million. \u201cThe anti-majoritarian features favor rural America over urban America, light-populated over heavily-populated states,\u201d Frum said. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue that goes back deep into American history, but Trump is its latest benefactor.\u201d He added: \u201cTrump is an unpopular president.

In what appears to be a single continuous shot, the camera tracks a masked figure through crowded streets, into a hotel lobby, up an elevator, out of a window, and over the rooftops to a deadly assignation. It\u2019s an audacious, attention-grabbing curtain-raiser widely hailed as the film\u2019s strongest asset.</p> <p>For his latest movie \u2013 an awards-garlanded first world war drama that has already won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/golden-globes-2020-1917-and-fleabag-lead-british-invasion-with-major-wins\" title=\"\">best picture honours at the Golden Globes</a> \u2013 Mendes has returned to the lure of the \u201cone-shot\u201d format, this time stretching it out to feature length.

The result is a populist, immersive drama that leads the viewer through the trenches and battlefields of northern France, as two young British soldiers attempt to make their way through enemy lines on 6 April 1917.</p> <p>George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are perfectly cast as Schofield and Blake, the lance corporals enlisted to venture into enemy territory with a message for fellow troops poised to launch a potentially catastrophic assault. The Germans have made a \u201cstrategic withdrawal\u201d, suggesting that they are on the run. In fact they\u2019re lying in wait, armed and ready to repel the planned British push. Together, these young soldiers must reach their comrades and halt the attack \u2013 a race against time and insurmountable odds.</p> <p>With meticulous attention to detail (plaudits to production designer Dennis Gassner) and astonishingly fluid cinematography by Roger Deakins that shifts from ground level to God\u2019s-eye view, Mendes puts his audience right there in the middle of the unfolding chaos.

      "bodyText": "For the opening of his 2015 Bond movie Spectre, director Sam Mendes (who won an Oscar for his first feature, American Beauty) mounted a memorable sequence set amid Mexico City\u2019s day of the dead festival. In what appears to be a single continuous shot, the camera tracks a masked figure through crowded streets, into a hotel lobby, up an elevator, out of a window, and over the rooftops to a deadly assignation. It\u2019s an audacious, attention-grabbing curtain-raiser widely hailed as the film\u2019s strongest asset. For his latest movie \u2013 an awards-garlanded first world war drama that has already won best picture honours at the Golden Globes \u2013 Mendes has returned to the lure of the \u201cone-shot\u201d format, this time stretching it out to feature length. Like Hitchcock\u2019s Rope or Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Birdman, 1917 uses several takes and set-ups, seamlessly conjoined to give the appearance of a continuous cinematic POV, albeit with periodic ellipses. The result is a populist, immersive drama that leads the viewer through the trenches and battlefields of northern France, as two young British soldiers attempt to make their way through enemy lines on 6 April 1917. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are perfectly cast as Schofield and Blake, the lance corporals enlisted to venture into enemy territory with a message for fellow troops poised to launch a potentially catastrophic assault. The Germans have made a \u201cstrategic withdrawal\u201d, suggesting that they are on the run. In fact they\u2019re lying in wait, armed and ready to repel the planned British push. Together, these young soldiers must reach their comrades and halt the attack \u2013 a race against time and insurmountable odds. With meticulous attention to detail (plaudits to production designer Dennis Gassner) and astonishingly fluid cinematography by Roger Deakins that shifts from ground level to God\u2019s-eye view, Mendes puts his audience right there in the middle of the unfolding chaos. There\u2019s a real sense of epic scale as the action moves breathlessly from one hellish environment to the next, effectively capturing our reluctant heroes\u2019 sense of anxiety and discovery as they stumble into each new unchartered terrain. This is nail-biting stuff, interspersed with genuine shocks and surprises.

      "body": "<p>The grand Portico Library stands in the heart of the city centre of my home town, Manchester, and takes its name from the building\u2019s portico design.

It is also the home of the <a href=\"https://www.theportico.org.uk/portico-prize-for-literature\" title=\"\">Portico prize</a>, which has been part of the library\u2019s cultural activities since 1985, an award established to celebrate literature that \u201cevokes the spirit of the north of England\u201d.</p> <p>Once dubbed the \u201cBooker of the north\u201d, the biennial prize accepts submissions across all formats including fiction, nonfiction and poetry, and awards \u00a310,000 to an overall winner (to be announced on 23 January), while shortlisted authors are rewarded with honorary Portico Library membership.</p> <p>Previous winners include Anthony Burgess, Jenny Uglow and Sarah Hall. This year a welcome spotlight fell on dynamic small presses and independent publishers, with 10 such publishers making the 17-strong longlist.</p> <p>Why is the Portico prize necessary? \u201cSo many reasons,\u201d says CEO and chief librarian Thom Keep. \u201cThere\u2019s been a definite problem in the London-centric nature of the [publishing] industry and we\u2019re still in that rut. Politically it\u2019s never been more the case \u2013 there\u2019s a fundamental disconnect with the north.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a way of looking at the world from an outsider\u2019s view that\u2019s not smug and complacent.

A Manchester-Salford divide. A Liverpool-Wirral divide. A Tyneside-Wearside divide. We live in a disunited kingdom with two Englands of unequal partnership.\u201d</p> <p>This year the prize has been relaunched after a hiatus in 2017 for funding reasons. To celebrate its return, a series of events, Rewriting the North, has been exploring notions of northernness and challenging stereotypes. These themes have particular personal resonance. I have just written a book, <em>I Belong Here: A Journey Along the Backbone of Britain</em>, a response to being the victim of a race-hate crime on a train journey from Liverpool to Newcastle, and I was invited to read at one of the events \u2013 Nature, Identity and the City \u2013 beneath the Portico library\u2019s huge glass-domed ceiling.</p> <p>The man who racially abused me on the train told me to go back to where I\u2019m from and in the book, I do \u2013 I\u2019m from the north \u2013 and chronicle my walking adventure over the Pennines, known as the backbone of Britain through both urban and natural landscapes. During the reading, under an engraved Victorian sign that read \u201cPolite Literature\u201d, I recounted how my abuser called me a \u201cPaki cunt\u201d and asked if I had a British passport \u2013 there\u2019s no putting a polite veneer on such an experience.</p> <p>I would like my book to start a wider movement to do with place, storytelling and belonging and because of that I\u2019m seeking sponsors to found the <a href=\"http://www.anitasethi.com/i-belong-here\" title=\"\">I Belong Here foundation</a> in Manchester, in order to transform my experience of hate into one of hope. I want to encourage marginalised groups to share their stories, and help breach the gulf between inner-cities and natural landscapes. Not only is there a north-south divide, there is vast inequality within the north itself, including between urban areas and the countryside. As the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-macfarlane\" title=\"\">Robert Macfarlane</a> told me: \u201cto have a project which intends to give people the confidence to say not only \u2018I am a writer\u2019 but also \u2018I belong here\u2019 \u2026 and then seek to bring people from minority communities out into nature, well, this is the real work.\u201d</p> <p>Looking to the future, Portico\u2019s Thom Keep is optimistic, citing such hopeful signs as Manchester becoming a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/nov/02/a-new-chapter-begins-as-manchester-awarded-unesco-city-of-literature\" title=\"\">Unesco City of Literature</a> and the success of northern publishers such as <a href=\"https://commapress.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Comma Press</a> and <a href=\"https://bluemoosebooks.com/\" title=\"\">Bluemoose</a>. Everyone I spoke to agreed there needs to be systemic change to balance the unequal power structures that hinder regional talent from finding an outlet, that more and diverse voices from this fine region deserve to be heard in the world of writing and publishing.</p> <p>I put some of the questions raised here to the Portico prize\u2019s six shortlisted authors\u2026</p> <p><em>To find out more about the I Belong Here Foundation go to <a href=\"http://www.anitasethi.com/i-belong-here\" title=\"\">www.anitasethi.com/i-belong-here</a></em></p> <h2>Adelle Stripe: \u2018Boris is promising a reward now the north has voted Tory, but I doubt any of it will materialise\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51593544becb9b4cd2c746e606283834afe5dfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51593544becb9b4cd2c746e606283834afe5dfed/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adelle Stripe photographed near her home in Mytholmroyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is the north and we do what we want\u2019: Adelle Stripe photographed near her home in Mytholmroyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Shortlisted for Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile (Fleet)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Adelle Stripe was born in 1976 and grew up in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, and now lives in the Calder Valley, West Yorkshire. She is the author of three collections of poetry. The most recent, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://adellestripe.com/poetry/\" title=\"\">Dark Corners of the Land</a></strong></em><strong>, was </strong><em><strong>3:AM Magazine</strong></em><strong>\u2019s </strong><strong>poetry book of the year</strong><strong>. Her debut novel, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/18/black-teeth-brilliant-smile-adelle-stripe-review\" title=\"\">Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile</a></strong></em><strong>, </strong><strong>was inspired by the life and work of the playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/andrea-dunbar\" title=\"\">Andrea Dunbar</a>, best known for her black comedy</strong><em><strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/14/rita-sue-and-bob-too-andrea-dunbar-austerity-council-estate\" title=\"\">Rita, Sue and Bob Too</a></strong></em><strong>, who tragically </strong><strong>died of a brain haemorrhage in 1990 aged 29</strong><strong>. It is set against the backdrop of the </strong><strong>Buttershaw estate in Bradford during the Thatcher era</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>What compelled you to write </strong><em><strong>Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>I was a fan of Andrea Dunbar as a teenager and had some misguided notion about becoming a playwright one day. I wanted to know more about who Andrea was and where her work came from. I felt that she was an important person in the history of northern culture, who deserved to have a book written about her. That book didn\u2019t exist, I wanted to read it, so I wrote it myself.</p> <p><strong>What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d?</strong><br>There\u2019s a distinctive character \u2013 one of stubbornness, resilience and black humour.</p> <p><strong>How has that spirit influenced your work</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Certainly the tone and dialect in my writing captures some of those aspects, but I also think Andrea Dunbar\u2019s personality embodied them.</p> <p><strong>Who for you are the great northern writers?</strong><br>Pat Barker, Gordon Burn, Hilary Mantel, Ted Hughes.</p> <p><strong>What books did you </strong><strong>love </strong><strong>as a child?</strong><br>My parents weren\u2019t readers, but they had a comprehensive record collection and I will always consider music to be my first love. I learned so much from listening to songs or the wild stories of my grandparents. That was just as important as reading. I was an only child until the age of nine, so books were a way to escape from the world outside, which I often struggled to make sense of. I remember being captivated by <em>The Secret Garden </em>[by Frances Hodgson Burnett], <em>George\u2019s Marvellous Medicine </em>[Roald Dahl], <em>Call of the Wild </em>[Jack London]<em>, Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales</em> and <em>What Katy Did</em>. As a teenager, Hanif Kureishi\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/04/the-buddha-of-suburbia\" title=\"\">The Buddha of Suburbia </a></em>was an epiphany of sorts.</p> <p><strong>I read that friends jokingly refer to you and your partner, Ben Myers, as \u201cTed and Sylvia\u201d. What is it like living with another writer, who is also shortlisted for the Portico prize?</strong><br>Well it\u2019s nothing like the symbiotic relationship of Hughes and Plath. I don\u2019t read any of Ben\u2019s work until a galley copy appears, as I feel that would be a step too far. We discuss concepts, characters and plot during the composing stage, but beyond that, there\u2019s no interference. It\u2019s the most diplomatic way of living with each other. We share an office in the attic, with a partition wall. Of course I am delighted that <em>Under the Rock </em>is shortlisted. It\u2019s a novelty for both of us be on there together.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel there\u2019s a \u201cnorth-south divide\u201d?</strong><br>Yes. I spent 10 years living in London (and still love the dirty old town), but there\u2019s a huge cultural and economic divide between the two.</p> <p><strong>What are your views on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d?</strong><br>We have had so many empty promises made by various governments that I don\u2019t believe a word of any of it these days. Boris is promising a reward now the north has voted Tory, but I doubt any of it will materialise. Politicians are prize bullshitters.</p> <p><strong>Is the north like a different country?</strong><br>This is the north and we do what we want. It certainly feels like we are a completely different country from London, no doubt about that.</p> <p><strong>Have you found that people have stereotypes about the north? </strong><br>There\u2019s still a perception of the north being all council estates or pit villages, when in reality it\u2019s a diverse area, with distinctive character and landscape from town to town. The nuance is often lost in translation. I don\u2019t think enough books about the north are being published, so it made sense to set my work here, as we are completely underrepresented in the publishing industry. I hope the Portico prize will change that.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that the character of the north is changing? </strong><br>I don\u2019t think anything will change up here. We\u2019ll be used, rejected and forgotten about like we always have been. Central government is no friend of ours.</p> <p><strong>The Smiths or the Stone Roses?</strong><br>It has to be the Smiths \u2013 they were my favourite band as a teenager. I\u2019m so disappointed in what he who shall not be named has turned into. I\u2019m devastated and heartbroken that it turned out this way. But I still have loyalty to Johnny Marr. One of the reasons I became a writer is because of the Smiths. I started reading Oscar Wilde and Shelagh Delaney because of them.</p> <p><strong>Lowry or Hockney? </strong><br>Hockney, for his Wolds landscapes and dreamy California swimming pools.

His most recent book, </strong><em><strong>Under the Rock</strong></em><strong>, is an </strong><strong>exploration of </strong><strong>Scout Rock in West Yorkshire</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Why did you become a writer?</strong><br>I am compelled by an overwhelming fear of having to live in the real world. So long as I am writing books, I can at least exist with one foot in a kingdom entirely of my own making. <em>Under </em><em>the Rock </em>is an attempt to peel back the layers of history to see what squirms beneath the topsoil.</p> <p><strong>Where did you grow up?</strong><br>In the suburbs of Durham city. My parents were both teachers so there were books in the house. Because I\u2019m northern, the assumption is that I\u2019m working-class and from somewhere like Coronation Street. It\u2019s not the case. People think the north is a homogenous entity, when actually it\u2019s a rich and varied place \u2013 in culture, landscape, language, industry and politics. There are 20 million norths.</p> <p><strong>What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d?</strong><br>A combination of gallows humour, friendliness to outsiders, absurdism, hard work and a rebel streak born out of the knowledge that all major investment has \u2013 and always will \u2013 go to London and the south-east. So we get on with things and create our own culture.</p> <p><strong>How has that spirit</strong><strong> influenced your work?</strong><br>Almost all of my books are concerned with the collective telling of an alternative history of the north of England that hopefully dispels many of the stereotypes that exist, chief among them being that people here are somehow lesser or uncultured.</p> <p><strong>Has the north shaped your style, with regard to dialect and form?</strong><br>I\u2019m fascinated with dialect, the fluidity of language and the poetry of the landscape, and explore that fascination in everything I write.</p> <p><strong>Who for you are the great northern writers? </strong><br>The Venerable Bede, Alcuin of York, William Wordsworth, Thomas De Quincey, Ted Hughes, Pat Barker, Gordon Burn, Shelagh Delaney, Alan Garner, Ted Lewis, Malcolm Lowry, WH Auden, David Peace, Alan Bennett, John Godber, Beryl Bainbridge, Andrea Dunbar, Sid Chaplin, Kay Mellor, David Storey, Keith Waterhouse, Tony Harrison. I could go on\u2026</p> <p><strong>Did you encounter any barriers to being published?</strong><br>All my novels have been turned down by all the major publishing houses at some point or another. I\u2019ve had a couple of publishers say, \u201cWe\u2019ve done some northern novels and they didn\u2019t sell so we don\u2019t want another one.\u201d You have to fight for it. My partner, Adelle, says I\u2019m like a Yorkshire terrier. I latch on to something and won\u2019t let go. It made me more determined. I\u2019m also a fortysomething white male so I\u2019m not complaining about being discriminated against. In many ways I\u2019ve been lucky as I\u2019ve had support from indie publishers.</p> <p><strong>You</strong><strong> won the Portico prize in 2015 for your novel </strong><em><strong>Beastings</strong></em><strong>. What does being shortlisted again mean for you?</strong><br>It\u2019s fantastic. Being published always feels like a small victory; being read and recognised an even greater one.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that the character of the north is changing - and how do you predict it will transform further - in </strong><strong>today\u2019s political era</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It is transforming daily \u2013 currently for the worse. Many ex-mining villages in my homeland of Durham have just voted for the Conservative government. Recent history has been forgotten because it is not taught in schools and consequently an entire generation of disenfranchised miners and shipbuilders have been forgotten about. Battles literally fought in our lifetime are now rendered meaningless; the 1980s might as well be as distant as the 1780s. I believe it to be part of a wider collective mental breakdown of the national psyche. Sadly I think it will get worse before it gets better.</p> <p><strong>The Stone Roses or the Smiths?</strong><br>Happy Mondays, any day.</p> <p><strong>The Peak District or the Lake District? </strong><br>The Lakes. I was dragged up Helvellyn from the age of four, and now keep returning every year. I know the fells around Ullswater well \u2013 my novel <em>Beastings</em> is set there.</p> <p><strong>Lowry or Hockney?</strong><br>David Hockney. I especially loved his <em>Arrival of Spring </em>series of iPad drawings from 2011. I\u2019ve been to see that exhibition three or four times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Under the Rock </em>by Benjamin Myers is published by Elliott &amp; Thompson (\u00a39.99).

However, I had to wait until my parents had died before I could publish. They were traditional northern Catholics. My mum was delighted when I passed my 11-plus and with my dad you just didn\u2019t talk about your inner life at all, let alone grooming and abuse. It would have been difficult to square an honest account with my parents.</p> <p><strong>Tell </strong><strong>us about </strong><strong> your childhood.</strong><br>I was born in \u201964. My first memory was of the moon landings. I was sat on my grandad\u2019s knee in Accrington, and he pointed at the telly and said: \u201cThis is the future.\u201d There was a real sense that everything was going to get better and that the future was bright and shiny.</p> <p><strong>Have you encountered stereotypes about the north? </strong><br>When I went to university at Warwick, people would do parodies of my accent, using \u201cEy up\u201d and whippets, and wonder why I didn\u2019t fall about laughing. Writing can be a way of wrongfooting people about such stereotypes.</p> <p><strong>What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d?</strong><br>A huge question \u2013 I have whole sections of the book dedicated to answering that. It\u2019s something about resilience, conviviality, humour and community. At the same time those qualities coexist with other less heroic qualities: suspicion of change, nostalgia, sentimentality. The fascinating thing is that these two sets of attributes both occupy the same notional space. That is one of the things that interests me as a writer.</p> <p>I wanted to write from within these contradictions or ambivalence. To write with humour about the most desperate situations, uncover the farcical aspects as well as the tragic. The north has given me a relish of language. I adore the rhythms of Lancastrian speech, the use of understatement, their refusal to be impressed. The \u201cIt\u2019ll be reet\u201d riff in my book is just one example.</p> <p><strong>What writers </strong><strong>have inspired you, from the north or elsewhere?</strong><br>As a teenager I was more inspired by the music writers of the <em>NME</em> \u2013 people like Paul Morley and Ian Penman. Then I discovered American fiction and a whole universe opened up. Lorrie Moore, Anne Tyler, Joan Didion: writers whose every sentence carries.</p> <p><strong>Is the north a different country? </strong><br>Existentially, it is a whole other way of being, with its own priorities and perspectives. Politically, the north has been criminally underfunded right across the board \u2013 transport, NHS, arts, housing.</p> <p><strong>What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you?</strong><br>It is beyond my wildest dreams. I am chuffed as the book didn\u2019t do well commercially although it did critically. I think people have certain assumptions about my book \u2013 that it is going to be dark and distressing. It is also a comedy, about class and food and music and books.</p> <p><strong>The Smiths or Stone Roses?</strong><br>The Smiths. I bought the Smiths\u2019 first album in my first year at university and it echoed throughout campus and spoke directly to my inner landscape as did the following three albums. I know Morrissey\u2019s ended up a total arsehole though.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Gaskell or Charlotte Bront\u00eb?</strong><br>It\u2019s got to be Mrs G although I have a very soft spot for Anne.</p> <p><strong>The Peak District or Lake District?</strong><br>I go through the Peaks on my way to see my beloved girlfriend, Emma, in Manchester and so they always make my heart sing.</p> <p><strong>Lowry or Hockney?</strong><br>Hockney. No hesitation. I can\u2019t look at a Lowry without hearing that endlessly annoying earworm Matchstalk Men song\u2026 My loss, I\u2019m sure.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Boy with the Perpetual Nervousness </em>by Graham Caveney is published by Picador (\u00a39.99).

She grew up in Sunderland and has spent time living in Santa Cruz, Paris, Donegal, Barcelona and London. She teaches literature and creative writing classes and co-runs the literary magazine the </strong><em><strong>Grapevine</strong></em><strong>, which aims to give a platform to underrepresented writers. Her first novel, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/01/saltwater-jessica-andrews-review\" title=\"\">Saltwater</a></strong></em><strong>,</strong><em> </em><strong>was published last year.</strong></p> <p><strong>Where did the idea for </strong><em><strong>Saltwater</strong></em><strong> come from?</strong><br>It grew out of the tender, burning feeling I have when I think of my mam and my female friends and the ways in which they have not been protected on a systemic level thanks to the patriarchal structure of relationships.</p> <p><strong>What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d?</strong><br>A joy in spite of everything. It comes from a life lived close to an edge and it\u2019s that Saturday night feeling out on the streets, everyone dressed up and smelling of too much perfume, a kind of wild possibility. It\u2019s the spirit of \u201cFuck it\u201d and having a good time.</p> <p><strong>How has that spirit influenced your work?</strong><br>My protagonist, Lucy, is desperate to move away from her home in Sunderland, to somewhere new and glittering, and it is only when she leaves and feels her identity fracture that she understands the value of the place she was running away from. She carries \u201cthe north\u201d inside of her and later, when things are difficult for her, she remembers, \u201cI am tough as anything.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What writers </strong><strong>have inspired you, from the north or elsewhere?</strong><br>When I was growing up, music was probably my biggest influence. I learned a lot about northern poetry through Jarvis Cocker, Alex Turner and Tim Booth.</p> <p><strong>Did you encounter any barriers to being published?</strong><br>It\u2019s incredibly difficult for working-class writers to find the time and space in which to write. I did an MA in creative writing, using the small savings my grandad left when he died. To write my novel, I moved to Donegal and lived in my grandad\u2019s empty house so that I wouldn\u2019t have to work to pay rent. Those were of course privileges but it was tough. I think the biggest problem is a lack of self-worth. How can you believe your writing is any good if people treat you as if you were worthless?</p> <p><strong>Do you feel a north-south divide?</strong><br>Yes \u2013 definitely economically but also culturally. I always love the journey home to Bishop Auckland, where my family live now. I like arriving late and having to get the last bus back from Durham, known as \u201cthe party bus\u201d, because everyone gets on it after the pub.</p> <p><strong>What are your views on the so-called northern powerhouse?</strong><br>It is difficult to believe in it when the crushing effects of austerity are everywhere. In the current political climate, it feels like a clever piece of jargon rather than a true vehicle for change.</p> <p><strong>What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you?</strong><br>Validation that working-class lives are full of poetry and power.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that the character of the north is changing?</strong><br>It seems there\u2019s a shift in northern identity; people no longer have that proud industrial identity because those kinds of jobs no longer exist and they don\u2019t belong to unions any more. People are increasingly atomised and I think it\u2019s vitally important that working-class communities come together in solidarity to fight for our hospitals, our schools, our jobs, our libraries and our hope.</p> <p><strong>We last spoke in May 2019. How\u2019s your year been as a published author?</strong><br>It\u2019s been exciting and validating, particularly when young working-class women come up to me at events and say this book really means a lot to them.</p> <p><strong>You have a story out this month in </strong><em><strong>The Book of Newcastle </strong></em><strong>anthology\u2026</strong><br>Yes, in that I really wanted to explore female friendship and the emotional complexities if you move away from your home town and feel you\u2019re betraying friends.</p> <p><strong>The Stone Roses or the Smiths?</strong><br>100% the Smiths.</p> <p><strong>The Peak District or the Lake District?</strong><br>The Lake District, but only because it is closer to the sea.</p> <p><strong>Lowry or Hockney?</strong><br>Lowry!</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Saltwater </em>by Jessica Andrews is published by Sceptre (\u00a316.99).

He lives in Manchester.</strong></p> <p><strong>What inspired you to write your book?</strong><br>I grew up on a housing estate in County Durham and I am passionate about their importance and angry about how they\u2019re stigmatised. I wanted to understand how they had gone from being respectable homes for a third of the population to being a byword for deprivation and poverty. That led me to the issue of how social housing has been betrayed by successive governments since the 1970s. I was enraged and that anger shaped the book.</p> <p><strong>What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d?</strong><br>Historically, the north\u2019s history has often been one of economic hardship and adversity, but in many ways what I\u2019m attracted to is a lot more intimate than that. There\u2019s also so much beauty in the north. At some point, everybody has to think about themselves in relation to where they come from, to define with or against the collective narrative. There isn\u2019t one \u201cnorth\u201d \u2013 there are as many norths as there are people living there.</p> <p><strong>How has that spirit influenced your work in terms of content?</strong><br>For this book, in every way.<em> Ironopoli</em>s is set on Teesside and I wanted to dig into the folklore, which might be as deep as you can get into a place. A main character in the book is a river witch called Peg Powler, who lives in the Tees. As a literal spirit of the north, I thought setting her loose on an about-to-be-bulldozed housing estate might be an interesting way to say the things I wanted to say about the line between people and place and how that\u2019s currently under threat. It\u2019s better coming from her \u2013 she\u2019s got a much bigger reputation around those parts than I do.</p> <p><strong>Has the north influenced your style in terms of dialect and form?</strong><br>So much. I could hear the characters in the book speaking as I wrote, the cadence and swing of their accents and speech patterns.</p> <p><strong>Who are the great northern writers?</strong><br>Sid Chaplin was a trailblazer; born into a Durham mining family during the first world war. The sheer bloody-mindedness he must have had to claw himself out of the pits and into writing novels and newspaper columns can\u2019t be easily dismissed.</p> <p><strong>Did you encounter any barriers to getting published?</strong><br>The book took a long time to sell \u2013 which was unfun \u2013 but whether or not that was because I was writing a 550-page, structurally atypical novel about magic-realist housing estates in Middlesbrough, I couldn\u2019t tell you. Even now, I have serious impostor syndrome. I\u2019m from an unassuming, working-class background in the north-east and when I was younger the publishing world wasn\u2019t even a speck on the horizon.</p> <p><strong>What are your views on the </strong><strong>\u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d?</strong><br>A hollow bit of sloganeering on the part of a government that, for all its bluster about the north being able to take on the world, for all the stage-managed photo-ops of Gideon and Boris in their hard hats and hi-vis, has ripped the guts out of countless communities via a decade of austerity.</p> <p><strong>What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you?</strong><br>For someone like me with an independent publisher, to be on a shortlist like this means so much. Writing can be very lonely. You\u2019re sinking years of your life into something maybe only your mam is ever going to read (and maybe not even that if she\u2019s got a lot on). Writing can be so liberating, but publishing is a wasp\u2019s nest of doubt and anxiety. That goes double for a debut.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that the character of the north is changing \u2013 and how do you predict it will transform further \u2013 in the political era in which we are living?</strong><br>Identity is bound up in stability: stable jobs, stable homes, stable communities. But that is changing, as in other places, with the rise of zero-hours work, short-term tenancies and a slashed welfare system. The result is that everything becomes transitory. This fracturing is mirrored in our politics. The old 20th-century narratives might be done. We\u2019ve got ex-miners voting Tory now, so all bets are off.</p> <p><strong>The Peak District or the Lakes?</strong><br>I love them both.</p> <p><strong>Lowry or Hockney?</strong><br>Hockney, for the colour \u2026 though neither of them does much for me, to be honest.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ironopolis</em> by Glen James Brown is published by Parthian (\u00a39.99).

He also wrote the short film </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://rayrobinsonwriter.weebly.com/edith.html\" title=\"\">Edith</a></strong></em><strong>, on which his latest novel</strong><strong> is based.</strong></p> <p><strong>How did your latest book come about?</strong><br>I\u2019d been obsessing over the true story of Barry Prudom\u2019s time hiding out in Dalby Forest near Scarborough after spree-killing three people in the early 1980s. He managed to evade a massive police search for 18 days by going to ground and relying on his survival skills. I guess I was curious about his self-constructed mythology.</p> <p>What had brought him to this point? What could make someone cross into the realm of criminal violence? Mixed into this was a short story I\u2019d been tinkering with for a few years about an ageing man\u2019s secrets about the legitimacy of his son. This short story eventually became the screenplay for the short film <em>Edith</em>. When I put the two ideas together, <em>The Mating Habits of Stags </em>was the result. Added to this are my childhood memories of my grandfather.</p> <p><strong>What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d?</strong><br>Being friendly but bloody-minded. As George Orwell said: \u201cThe northerner has grit, he is grim, dour, plucky, warm-hearted and democratic.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Has the north influenced your style in terms of dialect and form?</strong><br>Jake\u2019s sections of the book are littered with the Yorkshire Dales\u2019 Old Norse dialect. [Jake is the novel\u2019s protagonist, a former farmhand and widower in his 70s]. My grandparents\u2019 generation were the last to speak the dialect in any meaningful way, and that\u2019s why the Sheila sections of the book are mostly free of Norse. [Sheila, a main character, is Jake\u2019s friend.] Instead, the dialect is just general North Riding (clashy, snicket, sneck, howay, addle, neb, apeth, etc).</p> <p>I chose not to represent the dialect phonetically as it\u2019s just plain daft, but \u201csummat\u201d strays so wildly from \u201csomething\u201d aurally, as does \u201cthissen\u201d (yourself) that I felt it necessary to include the phonetic spellings. Also, there are quite a few traditional Yorkshire folk songs throughout the book and these had to remain phonetic because otherwise they wouldn\u2019t scan or rhyme.</p> <p><strong>Who for you are the great northern writers?</strong><br>The two that have most influenced me are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/pat-barker\" title=\"\">Pat Barker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/broken-ghost-niall-griffiths-review\" title=\"\">Niall Griffiths</a>.</p> <p><strong>What books did you </strong><strong>love </strong><strong> as a child?</strong><br>I didn\u2019t read a book until I was 18, but I come from a family of inveterate bullshitters so I guess you could say I was immersed in a strong tradition of oral storytelling from an early age.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel there\u2019s a </strong><strong>north-south divide</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Yes, and a blatant one at that. But there\u2019s also a Lancashire-Yorkshire divide. A Manchester-Salford divide. A Liverpool-Wirral divide. A Tyneside-Wearside divide. We live in a disunited kingdom with two Englands of unequal partnership.</p> <p><strong>What are your views on the </strong><strong>\u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d?</strong><br>I think Westminster is just blowing rainbows up our arse.</p> <p><strong>Is the north a different country?</strong><br>If you class a region comprising a people with common and distinctive attributes occupying a more or less definite territory, then yes. But the north is so diverse in every aspect that the only thing that really unites us is a strong aversion to the south. If you mean how do northerners view themselves in the context of England, then you\u2019re asking how and why such a diverse and populous region has been excluded and shat upon by Westminster since the dark days Thatcher stuck the boot in.</p> <p><strong>What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you?</strong><br>I think the Portico is one of the few prizes that\u2019s actually worth its salt. Prizes like this one give readers a chance to discover voices that might otherwise never be heard among all the bombast of bestsellers. It also means Waterstones might start bloody stocking it!</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Gaskell or Charlotte Bront\u00eb?</strong><br>Emily all the way.</p> <p><strong>Lowry or Hockney?<br></strong>I\u2019ve always found Hockney a bit \u201cmeh\u201d, if I\u2019m honest. But Lowry\u2019s seascapes are haunting and sublime (and there isn\u2019t a bloody matchstalk man in sight).</p> <p><strong>The Peak District or the Lake District?</strong><br>That\u2019s a tricky one. I used to live in the Peaks and grew up not far away from the Lakes so both are special places to me, but I think the Lake District is a victim of its own beauty and the traffic such a ball-ache, so I\u2019ll have to say the Peaks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The grand Portico Library stands in the heart of the city centre of my home town, Manchester, and takes its name from the building\u2019s portico design. Founded in 1806 by a group of Manchester businessmen, it was once frequented by the likes of Elizabeth Gaskell and Emmeline Pankhurst, and stocks a treasure trove of books and archives. It is also the home of the Portico prize, which has been part of the library\u2019s cultural activities since 1985, an award established to celebrate literature that \u201cevokes the spirit of the north of England\u201d. Once dubbed the \u201cBooker of the north\u201d, the biennial prize accepts submissions across all formats including fiction, nonfiction and poetry, and awards \u00a310,000 to an overall winner (to be announced on 23 January), while shortlisted authors are rewarded with honorary Portico Library membership. Previous winners include Anthony Burgess, Jenny Uglow and Sarah Hall. This year a welcome spotlight fell on dynamic small presses and independent publishers, with 10 such publishers making the 17-strong longlist. Why is the Portico prize necessary? \u201cSo many reasons,\u201d says CEO and chief librarian Thom Keep. \u201cThere\u2019s been a definite problem in the London-centric nature of the [publishing] industry and we\u2019re still in that rut. Politically it\u2019s never been more the case \u2013 there\u2019s a fundamental disconnect with the north.\u201d Lancashire-born author and broadcaster Stuart Maconie highlights Britain\u2019s \u201cvery unequal playing field\u201d in his book Long Road from Jarrow: A Journey Through Britain Then and Now, which was longlisted for last year\u2019s Portico prize. \u201cIt was like walking from one Britain into another,\u201d he says now, \u201cfrom an affluent to an abandoned one.\u201d One of the 2020 prize\u2019s shortlisted authors, Ray Robinson, says that there\u2019s a \u201cblatant\u201d north-south divide, \u201cbut there\u2019s also a Lancashire-Yorkshire divide. A Manchester-Salford divide. A Liverpool-Wirral divide. A Tyneside-Wearside divide. We live in a disunited kingdom with two Englands of unequal partnership.\u201d This year the prize has been relaunched after a hiatus in 2017 for funding reasons. To celebrate its return, a series of events, Rewriting the North, has been exploring notions of northernness and challenging stereotypes. These themes have particular personal resonance. I have just written a book, I Belong Here: A Journey Along the Backbone of Britain, a response to being the victim of a race-hate crime on a train journey from Liverpool to Newcastle, and I was invited to read at one of the events \u2013 Nature, Identity and the City \u2013 beneath the Portico library\u2019s huge glass-domed ceiling. The man who racially abused me on the train told me to go back to where I\u2019m from and in the book, I do \u2013 I\u2019m from the north \u2013 and chronicle my walking adventure over the Pennines, known as the backbone of Britain through both urban and natural landscapes. During the reading, under an engraved Victorian sign that read \u201cPolite Literature\u201d, I recounted how my abuser called me a \u201cPaki cunt\u201d and asked if I had a British passport \u2013 there\u2019s no putting a polite veneer on such an experience. I would like my book to start a wider movement to do with place, storytelling and belonging and because of that I\u2019m seeking sponsors to found the I Belong Here foundation in Manchester, in order to transform my experience of hate into one of hope. I want to encourage marginalised groups to share their stories, and help breach the gulf between inner-cities and natural landscapes. Not only is there a north-south divide, there is vast inequality within the north itself, including between urban areas and the countryside. As the writer Robert Macfarlane told me: \u201cto have a project which intends to give people the confidence to say not only \u2018I am a writer\u2019 but also \u2018I belong here\u2019 \u2026 and then seek to bring people from minority communities out into nature, well, this is the real work.\u201d Looking to the future, Portico\u2019s Thom Keep is optimistic, citing such hopeful signs as Manchester becoming a Unesco City of Literature and the success of northern publishers such as Comma Press and Bluemoose. Everyone I spoke to agreed there needs to be systemic change to balance the unequal power structures that hinder regional talent from finding an outlet, that more and diverse voices from this fine region deserve to be heard in the world of writing and publishing. I put some of the questions raised here to the Portico prize\u2019s six shortlisted authors\u2026 To find out more about the I Belong Here Foundation go to www.anitasethi.com/i-belong-here Adelle Stripe: \u2018Boris is promising a reward now the north has voted Tory, but I doubt any of it will materialise\u2019 Shortlisted for Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile (Fleet) Adelle Stripe was born in 1976 and grew up in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, and now lives in the Calder Valley, West Yorkshire. She is the author of three collections of poetry. The most recent, Dark Corners of the Land, was 3:AM Magazine\u2019s poetry book of the year. Her debut novel, Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile, was inspired by the life and work of the playwright Andrea Dunbar, best known for her black comedy Rita, Sue and Bob Too, who tragically died of a brain haemorrhage in 1990 aged 29. It is set against the backdrop of the Buttershaw estate in Bradford during the Thatcher era. What compelled you to write Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile? I was a fan of Andrea Dunbar as a teenager and had some misguided notion about becoming a playwright one day. I wanted to know more about who Andrea was and where her work came from. I felt that she was an important person in the history of northern culture, who deserved to have a book written about her. That book didn\u2019t exist, I wanted to read it, so I wrote it myself. What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d? There\u2019s a distinctive character \u2013 one of stubbornness, resilience and black humour. How has that spirit influenced your work? Certainly the tone and dialect in my writing captures some of those aspects, but I also think Andrea Dunbar\u2019s personality embodied them. Who for you are the great northern writers? Pat Barker, Gordon Burn, Hilary Mantel, Ted Hughes. What books did you love as a child? My parents weren\u2019t readers, but they had a comprehensive record collection and I will always consider music to be my first love. I learned so much from listening to songs or the wild stories of my grandparents. That was just as important as reading. I was an only child until the age of nine, so books were a way to escape from the world outside, which I often struggled to make sense of. I remember being captivated by The Secret Garden [by Frances Hodgson Burnett], George\u2019s Marvellous Medicine [Roald Dahl], Call of the Wild [Jack London], Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales and What Katy Did. As a teenager, Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia was an epiphany of sorts. I read that friends jokingly refer to you and your partner, Ben Myers, as \u201cTed and Sylvia\u201d. What is it like living with another writer, who is also shortlisted for the Portico prize? Well it\u2019s nothing like the symbiotic relationship of Hughes and Plath. I don\u2019t read any of Ben\u2019s work until a galley copy appears, as I feel that would be a step too far. We discuss concepts, characters and plot during the composing stage, but beyond that, there\u2019s no interference. It\u2019s the most diplomatic way of living with each other. We share an office in the attic, with a partition wall. Of course I am delighted that Under the Rock is shortlisted. It\u2019s a novelty for both of us be on there together. Do you feel there\u2019s a \u201cnorth-south divide\u201d? Yes. I spent 10 years living in London (and still love the dirty old town), but there\u2019s a huge cultural and economic divide between the two. What are your views on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d? We have had so many empty promises made by various governments that I don\u2019t believe a word of any of it these days. Boris is promising a reward now the north has voted Tory, but I doubt any of it will materialise. Politicians are prize bullshitters. Is the north like a different country? This is the north and we do what we want. It certainly feels like we are a completely different country from London, no doubt about that. Have you found that people have stereotypes about the north? There\u2019s still a perception of the north being all council estates or pit villages, when in reality it\u2019s a diverse area, with distinctive character and landscape from town to town. The nuance is often lost in translation. I don\u2019t think enough books about the north are being published, so it made sense to set my work here, as we are completely underrepresented in the publishing industry. I hope the Portico prize will change that. Do you feel that the character of the north is changing? I don\u2019t think anything will change up here. We\u2019ll be used, rejected and forgotten about like we always have been. Central government is no friend of ours. The Smiths or the Stone Roses? It has to be the Smiths \u2013 they were my favourite band as a teenager. I\u2019m so disappointed in what he who shall not be named has turned into. I\u2019m devastated and heartbroken that it turned out this way. But I still have loyalty to Johnny Marr. One of the reasons I became a writer is because of the Smiths. I started reading Oscar Wilde and Shelagh Delaney because of them. Lowry or Hockney? Hockney, for his Wolds landscapes and dreamy California swimming pools. Only a Bradfordian would appreciate the sunlight in such a way. \u2022 Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile by Adelle Stripe is published by Fleet (\u00a38.99). To buy it for \u00a37.91 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-31763837 Benjamin Myers: \u2018I\u2019m fascinated by dialect and the poetry of the landscape\u2019 Shortlisted for Under the Rock: The Poetry of a Place (Elliott &amp; Thompson) Benjamin Myers was born in Durham in 1976 and lives in Yorkshire\u2019s Upper Calder Valley with his partner, Adelle Stripe. His novels include: The Gallows Pole (2017), which received the Roger Deakin award and was shortlisted for the Walter Scott prize; Turning Blue (2016); Beastings (2014), which won the Portico prize, and the Northern Writers\u2019 award; Pig Iron (2012), which won the inaugural Gordon Burn prize; and Richard (2010), a Sunday Times book of the year. His most recent book, Under the Rock, is an exploration of Scout Rock in West Yorkshire. Why did you become a writer? I am compelled by an overwhelming fear of having to live in the real world. So long as I am writing books, I can at least exist with one foot in a kingdom entirely of my own making. Under the Rock is an attempt to peel back the layers of history to see what squirms beneath the topsoil. Where did you grow up? In the suburbs of Durham city. My parents were both teachers so there were books in the house. Because I\u2019m northern, the assumption is that I\u2019m working-class and from somewhere like Coronation Street. It\u2019s not the case. People think the north is a homogenous entity, when actually it\u2019s a rich and varied place \u2013 in culture, landscape, language, industry and politics. There are 20 million norths. What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d? A combination of gallows humour, friendliness to outsiders, absurdism, hard work and a rebel streak born out of the knowledge that all major investment has \u2013 and always will \u2013 go to London and the south-east. So we get on with things and create our own culture. How has that spirit influenced your work? Almost all of my books are concerned with the collective telling of an alternative history of the north of England that hopefully dispels many of the stereotypes that exist, chief among them being that people here are somehow lesser or uncultured. Has the north shaped your style, with regard to dialect and form? I\u2019m fascinated with dialect, the fluidity of language and the poetry of the landscape, and explore that fascination in everything I write. Who for you are the great northern writers? The Venerable Bede, Alcuin of York, William Wordsworth, Thomas De Quincey, Ted Hughes, Pat Barker, Gordon Burn, Shelagh Delaney, Alan Garner, Ted Lewis, Malcolm Lowry, WH Auden, David Peace, Alan Bennett, John Godber, Beryl Bainbridge, Andrea Dunbar, Sid Chaplin, Kay Mellor, David Storey, Keith Waterhouse, Tony Harrison. I could go on\u2026 Did you encounter any barriers to being published? All my novels have been turned down by all the major publishing houses at some point or another. I\u2019ve had a couple of publishers say, \u201cWe\u2019ve done some northern novels and they didn\u2019t sell so we don\u2019t want another one.\u201d You have to fight for it. My partner, Adelle, says I\u2019m like a Yorkshire terrier. I latch on to something and won\u2019t let go. It made me more determined. I\u2019m also a fortysomething white male so I\u2019m not complaining about being discriminated against. In many ways I\u2019ve been lucky as I\u2019ve had support from indie publishers. You won the Portico prize in 2015 for your novel Beastings. What does being shortlisted again mean for you? It\u2019s fantastic. Being published always feels like a small victory; being read and recognised an even greater one. Do you feel that the character of the north is changing - and how do you predict it will transform further - in today\u2019s political era? It is transforming daily \u2013 currently for the worse. Many ex-mining villages in my homeland of Durham have just voted for the Conservative government. Recent history has been forgotten because it is not taught in schools and consequently an entire generation of disenfranchised miners and shipbuilders have been forgotten about. Battles literally fought in our lifetime are now rendered meaningless; the 1980s might as well be as distant as the 1780s. I believe it to be part of a wider collective mental breakdown of the national psyche. Sadly I think it will get worse before it gets better. The Stone Roses or the Smiths? Happy Mondays, any day. The Peak District or the Lake District? The Lakes. I was dragged up Helvellyn from the age of four, and now keep returning every year. I know the fells around Ullswater well \u2013 my novel Beastings is set there. Lowry or Hockney? David Hockney. I especially loved his Arrival of Spring series of iPad drawings from 2011. I\u2019ve been to see that exhibition three or four times. \u2022 Under the Rock by Benjamin Myers is published by Elliott &amp; Thompson (\u00a39.99).

Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315 Graham Caveney: \u2018Writing can be a way of wrongfooting people about stereotypes\u2019 Shortlisted for The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness (Picador) Graham Caveney, who was born 1964, grew up in Accrington, Lancashire, and has published four books: Shopping in Space: Essays on Blank American Fiction (1992; with Elizabeth Young); biographies of William Burroughs (The Priest, They Called Him, 1997) and Allen Ginsberg (Screaming with Joy, 1999). His most recent book, The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness (2017) is a memoir about growing up in the north of England during the 1970s and his experience of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest. How did The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness come about? I\u2019ve been writing this book for more than 30 years. However, I had to wait until my parents had died before I could publish. They were traditional northern Catholics. My mum was delighted when I passed my 11-plus and with my dad you just didn\u2019t talk about your inner life at all, let alone grooming and abuse. It would have been difficult to square an honest account with my parents. Tell us about your childhood. I was born in \u201964. My first memory was of the moon landings. I was sat on my grandad\u2019s knee in Accrington, and he pointed at the telly and said: \u201cThis is the future.\u201d There was a real sense that everything was going to get better and that the future was bright and shiny. Have you encountered stereotypes about the north? When I went to university at Warwick, people would do parodies of my accent, using \u201cEy up\u201d and whippets, and wonder why I didn\u2019t fall about laughing. Writing can be a way of wrongfooting people about such stereotypes. What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d? A huge question \u2013 I have whole sections of the book dedicated to answering that. It\u2019s something about resilience, conviviality, humour and community. At the same time those qualities coexist with other less heroic qualities: suspicion of change, nostalgia, sentimentality. The fascinating thing is that these two sets of attributes both occupy the same notional space. That is one of the things that interests me as a writer. I wanted to write from within these contradictions or ambivalence. To write with humour about the most desperate situations, uncover the farcical aspects as well as the tragic. The north has given me a relish of language. I adore the rhythms of Lancastrian speech, the use of understatement, their refusal to be impressed. The \u201cIt\u2019ll be reet\u201d riff in my book is just one example. What writers have inspired you, from the north or elsewhere? As a teenager I was more inspired by the music writers of the NME \u2013 people like Paul Morley and Ian Penman. Then I discovered American fiction and a whole universe opened up. Lorrie Moore, Anne Tyler, Joan Didion: writers whose every sentence carries. Is the north a different country? Existentially, it is a whole other way of being, with its own priorities and perspectives. Politically, the north has been criminally underfunded right across the board \u2013 transport, NHS, arts, housing. What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you? It is beyond my wildest dreams. I am chuffed as the book didn\u2019t do well commercially although it did critically. I think people have certain assumptions about my book \u2013 that it is going to be dark and distressing. It is also a comedy, about class and food and music and books. The Smiths or Stone Roses? The Smiths. I bought the Smiths\u2019 first album in my first year at university and it echoed throughout campus and spoke directly to my inner landscape as did the following three albums. I know Morrissey\u2019s ended up a total arsehole though. Elizabeth Gaskell or Charlotte Bront\u00eb? It\u2019s got to be Mrs G although I have a very soft spot for Anne. The Peak District or Lake District? I go through the Peaks on my way to see my beloved girlfriend, Emma, in Manchester and so they always make my heart sing. Lowry or Hockney? Hockney. No hesitation. I can\u2019t look at a Lowry without hearing that endlessly annoying earworm Matchstalk Men song\u2026 My loss, I\u2019m sure. \u2022 The Boy with the Perpetual Nervousness by Graham Caveney is published by Picador (\u00a39.99).

Free UK p&amp;p on orders over \u00a315 Jessica Andrews: \u2018I learned a lot about northern poetry from Jarvis Cocker, Alex Turner and Tim Booth\u2019 Shortlisted for Saltwater (Sceptre) Jessica Andrews was born in 1992. She grew up in Sunderland and has spent time living in Santa Cruz, Paris, Donegal, Barcelona and London. She teaches literature and creative writing classes and co-runs the literary magazine the Grapevine, which aims to give a platform to underrepresented writers. Her first novel, Saltwater, was published last year. Where did the idea for Saltwater come from? It grew out of the tender, burning feeling I have when I think of my mam and my female friends and the ways in which they have not been protected on a systemic level thanks to the patriarchal structure of relationships. What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d? A joy in spite of everything. It comes from a life lived close to an edge and it\u2019s that Saturday night feeling out on the streets, everyone dressed up and smelling of too much perfume, a kind of wild possibility. It\u2019s the spirit of \u201cFuck it\u201d and having a good time. How has that spirit influenced your work? My protagonist, Lucy, is desperate to move away from her home in Sunderland, to somewhere new and glittering, and it is only when she leaves and feels her identity fracture that she understands the value of the place she was running away from. She carries \u201cthe north\u201d inside of her and later, when things are difficult for her, she remembers, \u201cI am tough as anything.\u201d What writers have inspired you, from the north or elsewhere? When I was growing up, music was probably my biggest influence. I learned a lot about northern poetry through Jarvis Cocker, Alex Turner and Tim Booth. Did you encounter any barriers to being published? It\u2019s incredibly difficult for working-class writers to find the time and space in which to write. I did an MA in creative writing, using the small savings my grandad left when he died. To write my novel, I moved to Donegal and lived in my grandad\u2019s empty house so that I wouldn\u2019t have to work to pay rent. Those were of course privileges but it was tough. I think the biggest problem is a lack of self-worth. How can you believe your writing is any good if people treat you as if you were worthless? Do you feel a north-south divide? Yes \u2013 definitely economically but also culturally. I always love the journey home to Bishop Auckland, where my family live now. I like arriving late and having to get the last bus back from Durham, known as \u201cthe party bus\u201d, because everyone gets on it after the pub. What are your views on the so-called northern powerhouse? It is difficult to believe in it when the crushing effects of austerity are everywhere. In the current political climate, it feels like a clever piece of jargon rather than a true vehicle for change. What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you? Validation that working-class lives are full of poetry and power. Do you feel that the character of the north is changing? It seems there\u2019s a shift in northern identity; people no longer have that proud industrial identity because those kinds of jobs no longer exist and they don\u2019t belong to unions any more. People are increasingly atomised and I think it\u2019s vitally important that working-class communities come together in solidarity to fight for our hospitals, our schools, our jobs, our libraries and our hope. We last spoke in May 2019. How\u2019s your year been as a published author? It\u2019s been exciting and validating, particularly when young working-class women come up to me at events and say this book really means a lot to them. You have a story out this month in The Book of Newcastle anthology\u2026 Yes, in that I really wanted to explore female friendship and the emotional complexities if you move away from your home town and feel you\u2019re betraying friends. The Stone Roses or the Smiths? 100% the Smiths. The Peak District or the Lake District? The Lake District, but only because it is closer to the sea. Lowry or Hockney? Lowry! \u2022 Saltwater by Jessica Andrews is published by Sceptre (\u00a316.99). To buy it for \u00a314.95, go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p on orders over \u00a315 Glen James Brown: \u2018We\u2019ve got ex-miners voting Tory now so all bets are off\u2019 Shortlisted for Ironopolis Glen James Brown was born in County Durham in 1982, studied English at Leeds Beckett University and gained an MA in creative writing at the University of Chichester, where he won the Kate Betts Memorial award. Ironopolis is his first novel. He lives in Manchester. What inspired you to write your book? I grew up on a housing estate in County Durham and I am passionate about their importance and angry about how they\u2019re stigmatised. I wanted to understand how they had gone from being respectable homes for a third of the population to being a byword for deprivation and poverty. That led me to the issue of how social housing has been betrayed by successive governments since the 1970s. I was enraged and that anger shaped the book. What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d? Historically, the north\u2019s history has often been one of economic hardship and adversity, but in many ways what I\u2019m attracted to is a lot more intimate than that. There\u2019s also so much beauty in the north. At some point, everybody has to think about themselves in relation to where they come from, to define with or against the collective narrative. There isn\u2019t one \u201cnorth\u201d \u2013 there are as many norths as there are people living there. How has that spirit influenced your work in terms of content? For this book, in every way. Ironopolis is set on Teesside and I wanted to dig into the folklore, which might be as deep as you can get into a place. A main character in the book is a river witch called Peg Powler, who lives in the Tees. As a literal spirit of the north, I thought setting her loose on an about-to-be-bulldozed housing estate might be an interesting way to say the things I wanted to say about the line between people and place and how that\u2019s currently under threat. It\u2019s better coming from her \u2013 she\u2019s got a much bigger reputation around those parts than I do. Has the north influenced your style in terms of dialect and form? So much. I could hear the characters in the book speaking as I wrote, the cadence and swing of their accents and speech patterns. Who are the great northern writers? Sid Chaplin was a trailblazer; born into a Durham mining family during the first world war. The sheer bloody-mindedness he must have had to claw himself out of the pits and into writing novels and newspaper columns can\u2019t be easily dismissed. Did you encounter any barriers to getting published? The book took a long time to sell \u2013 which was unfun \u2013 but whether or not that was because I was writing a 550-page, structurally atypical novel about magic-realist housing estates in Middlesbrough, I couldn\u2019t tell you. Even now, I have serious impostor syndrome. I\u2019m from an unassuming, working-class background in the north-east and when I was younger the publishing world wasn\u2019t even a speck on the horizon. What are your views on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d? A hollow bit of sloganeering on the part of a government that, for all its bluster about the north being able to take on the world, for all the stage-managed photo-ops of Gideon and Boris in their hard hats and hi-vis, has ripped the guts out of countless communities via a decade of austerity. What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you? For someone like me with an independent publisher, to be on a shortlist like this means so much. Writing can be very lonely. You\u2019re sinking years of your life into something maybe only your mam is ever going to read (and maybe not even that if she\u2019s got a lot on). Writing can be so liberating, but publishing is a wasp\u2019s nest of doubt and anxiety. That goes double for a debut. Do you feel that the character of the north is changing \u2013 and how do you predict it will transform further \u2013 in the political era in which we are living? Identity is bound up in stability: stable jobs, stable homes, stable communities. But that is changing, as in other places, with the rise of zero-hours work, short-term tenancies and a slashed welfare system. The result is that everything becomes transitory. This fracturing is mirrored in our politics. The old 20th-century narratives might be done. We\u2019ve got ex-miners voting Tory now, so all bets are off. The Peak District or the Lakes? I love them both. Lowry or Hockney? Hockney, for the colour \u2026 though neither of them does much for me, to be honest. \u2022 Ironopolis by Glen James Brown is published by Parthian (\u00a39.99).

Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315 Ray Robinson: \u2018The north is so diverse\u2026 the only thing that really unites us is a strong aversion to the south\u2019 Shortlisted for The Mating Habits of Stags (Lightning Books) Ray Robinson was born in 1971 North Yorkshire, and his debut novel, Electricity (2006), was shortlisted for the James Tait Black memorial prize and the Authors\u2019 Club best first novel award. The screen version premiered at the BFI London film festival and won best screenplay at the National film awards. His other novels are The Man Without (2008), Forgetting Zo\u00eb (2010) and Jawbone Lake (2014). Forgetting Zo\u00eb was a winner of the inaugural Jerwood fiction uncovered prize. He also wrote the short film Edith, on which his latest novel is based. How did your latest book come about? I\u2019d been obsessing over the true story of Barry Prudom\u2019s time hiding out in Dalby Forest near Scarborough after spree-killing three people in the early 1980s. He managed to evade a massive police search for 18 days by going to ground and relying on his survival skills. I guess I was curious about his self-constructed mythology. What had brought him to this point? What could make someone cross into the realm of criminal violence? Mixed into this was a short story I\u2019d been tinkering with for a few years about an ageing man\u2019s secrets about the legitimacy of his son. This short story eventually became the screenplay for the short film Edith. When I put the two ideas together, The Mating Habits of Stags was the result. Added to this are my childhood memories of my grandfather. What for you is the \u201cspirit of the north\u201d? Being friendly but bloody-minded. As George Orwell said: \u201cThe northerner has grit, he is grim, dour, plucky, warm-hearted and democratic.\u201d Has the north influenced your style in terms of dialect and form? Jake\u2019s sections of the book are littered with the Yorkshire Dales\u2019 Old Norse dialect. [Jake is the novel\u2019s protagonist, a former farmhand and widower in his 70s]. My grandparents\u2019 generation were the last to speak the dialect in any meaningful way, and that\u2019s why the Sheila sections of the book are mostly free of Norse. [Sheila, a main character, is Jake\u2019s friend.] Instead, the dialect is just general North Riding (clashy, snicket, sneck, howay, addle, neb, apeth, etc). I chose not to represent the dialect phonetically as it\u2019s just plain daft, but \u201csummat\u201d strays so wildly from \u201csomething\u201d aurally, as does \u201cthissen\u201d (yourself) that I felt it necessary to include the phonetic spellings. Also, there are quite a few traditional Yorkshire folk songs throughout the book and these had to remain phonetic because otherwise they wouldn\u2019t scan or rhyme. Who for you are the great northern writers? The two that have most influenced me are Pat Barker and Niall Griffiths. What books did you love as a child? I didn\u2019t read a book until I was 18, but I come from a family of inveterate bullshitters so I guess you could say I was immersed in a strong tradition of oral storytelling from an early age. Do you feel there\u2019s a north-south divide? Yes, and a blatant one at that. But there\u2019s also a Lancashire-Yorkshire divide. A Manchester-Salford divide. A Liverpool-Wirral divide. A Tyneside-Wearside divide. We live in a disunited kingdom with two Englands of unequal partnership. What are your views on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d? I think Westminster is just blowing rainbows up our arse. Is the north a different country? If you class a region comprising a people with common and distinctive attributes occupying a more or less definite territory, then yes. But the north is so diverse in every aspect that the only thing that really unites us is a strong aversion to the south. If you mean how do northerners view themselves in the context of England, then you\u2019re asking how and why such a diverse and populous region has been excluded and shat upon by Westminster since the dark days Thatcher stuck the boot in. What does being shortlisted for this prize mean for you? I think the Portico is one of the few prizes that\u2019s actually worth its salt. Prizes like this one give readers a chance to discover voices that might otherwise never be heard among all the bombast of bestsellers. It also means Waterstones might start bloody stocking it! Elizabeth Gaskell or Charlotte Bront\u00eb? Emily all the way. Lowry or Hockney? I\u2019ve always found Hockney a bit \u201cmeh\u201d, if I\u2019m honest. But Lowry\u2019s seascapes are haunting and sublime (and there isn\u2019t a bloody matchstalk man in sight). The Peak District or the Lake District? That\u2019s a tricky one. I used to live in the Peaks and grew up not far away from the Lakes so both are special places to me, but I think the Lake District is a victim of its own beauty and the traffic such a ball-ache, so I\u2019ll have to say the Peaks.",

Brisbane Roar showed they were a force to be reckoned with in the <strong>W-League</strong>, trouncing Western Sydney 4-0 and turning the formbook on its head. The Roar are now in the top four and look capable of doing something with their ball movement and potency up front. The Wanderers have now tasted defeat this season but one suspects they will live to fight another day. In the <strong>Big Bash League</strong>, Adelaide Strikers were easy winners over Melbourne Renegades, last season\u2019s champions who have started their title defence with nine straight defeats. They have, officially, forgotten how to win. The Strikers were very, very good and, on this evidence, will be in the reckoning at the business end of the season. Well, that\u2019s it for Sportwatch this Sunday. I\u2019ve had a ball. Thanks for your company.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1acc198f085eda5c116674\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-12T07:42:21.737Z\">7.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BBL: Strikers beat Renegades by 63 runs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that, thankfully for the Renegades, is game over. They were never in this run-chase, tallying just 110 all out in response to Adelaide\u2019s 173-6. Only Webster did anything with the bat for the visitors, whereas the Strikers had winners everywhere: Wells and Short with the bat, Rashid, Head and Siddle with the ball. And they fielded wonderfully well. Another loss for the Renegades, their ninth on the bounce.

      "bodyText": "A couple of statements were made this afternoon. Brisbane Roar showed they were a force to be reckoned with in the W-League, trouncing Western Sydney 4-0 and turning the formbook on its head. The Roar are now in the top four and look capable of doing something with their ball movement and potency up front. The Wanderers have now tasted defeat this season but one suspects they will live to fight another day. In the Big Bash League, Adelaide Strikers were easy winners over Melbourne Renegades, last season\u2019s champions who have started their title defence with nine straight defeats. They have, officially, forgotten how to win. The Strikers were very, very good and, on this evidence, will be in the reckoning at the business end of the season. Well, that\u2019s it for Sportwatch this Sunday. I\u2019ve had a ball. Thanks for your company. And that, thankfully for the Renegades, is game over. They were never in this run-chase, tallying just 110 all out in response to Adelaide\u2019s 173-6. Only Webster did anything with the bat for the visitors, whereas the Strikers had winners everywhere: Wells and Short with the bat, Rashid, Head and Siddle with the ball. And they fielded wonderfully well. Another loss for the Renegades, their ninth on the bounce. Ouch. BBL: 17th over: Melbourne Renegades 104-8 (Wildermuth 1) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 Siddle returns to the attack to immediate effect, Patel finding Weatherald at short midwicket to depart for eight. And the evergreen paceman strikes again with the last ball of the over, enticing Christian into a false shot which winds up down the throat of Neser. Mercy rule, please. BBL: 16th over: Melbourne Renegades 103-6 (Christian 2, Patel 8) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 These two keep their partnership intact but don\u2019t make the inroads the Renegades need, scoring just seven runs off Conway\u2019s over. They now need 71 from 24 balls. That\u2019s a big ask. Just saying. BBL: 15th over: Melbourne Renegades 96-6 (Christian 1, Patel 2) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 And that\u2019s another wicket! Yes, I did copy-and-paste that from the previous post. Yes, I did copy-and-paste that from the previous post (geddit? I copied both sentences. Think about it). Anyway, Webster goes for 49, missing a straight one from Rashid and rightfully adjudged leg before. Rashid returns 2-19 from his four overs. What a star. The Renegades. What a rabble. BBL: 14th over: Melbourne Renegades 93-5 (Webster 49, Christian 0) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 And that\u2019s another wicket! Yes, I did copy-and-paste that from the previous post. Cooper\u2019s on his way now, holing out to Wells in the deep for not very many, and the Renegades are in all sorts of strife. That over from Conway not only brought a wicket, it also conceded just three runs. BBL: 13th over: Melbourne Renegades 90-4 (Webster 47, Cooper 0) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 And that\u2019s another wicket! Rashid takes his 50th wicket for the Strikers but notch this down to Siddle, who made great ground from third man to take a diving, tumbling catch and send Nabi on his way. Webster is batting beautifully but he needs help. Now. BBL: 12th over: Melbourne Renegades 84-3 (Webster 42, Nabi 5) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 Not a bad over for the Renegades, Head\u2019s over going for nine runs (including five wides ... well, one wide that found the rope), but the required rate is still very high at around two-a-ball. A good spell from Head, returning 2-26 from his four overs. BBL: 10th over: Melbourne Renegades 65-3 (Webster 31, Nabi 2) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 Another wicket falls, this time the important scalp of Marsh who plays around a straight, full one from Head and is castled for 21. That\u2019s two wickets, both bowled, for the Strikers skipper. And, it must be said now, good captaincy to bowl himself inside the first half of the innings. If Brisbane were good in the first half, they were irrepressible in the second. The Roar scored four unanswered goals in that second stanza and each was earned and fully deserved. The only surprise is that they didn\u2019t score more. Toby scored a brace, while Raso scored one but could easily have had a hat-trick. This could be the victory that kickstarts their season. For the Wanderers, this loss - their first of the season - might come to be viewed as the one they had to have. But though there is time, dropping all three points does their premiership aspirations no good at all. All credit to the Roar. They look right at home in the top four. BBL: 7th over: Melbourne Renegades 55-2 (Marsh 18, Webster 26) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 A good over from the very good Rashid Khan, conceding just four runs. How Webster, premeditating a sweep shot to a googly and missing everything, didn\u2019t get bowled is God\u2019s own private mystery. BBL: 6th over: Melbourne Renegades 51-2 (Marsh 16, Webster 24) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 The Renegades are now getting going. At the tailend of a Siddle over and the start of Neser\u2019s, five balls went for 22 runs in a 4-4-4-6-4 sequence. Neser\u2019s over ended up going for 2o runs and, as can be the case in T20 cricket, a few deliveries is all anyone needs to go from good to bad, bad to good and any transformation in between. W-League: GOAL! and another GOAL! Western Sydney 0-4 Brisbane Roar (Davidson, 68\u2019, Toby, 71\u2019) The wheels are now well and truly off this Wanderers wagon. Brisbane are now potentially looking at their biggest W-League win, with Davidson finding the net and Toby following three minutes later suit to make it a brace. Who saw this coming? Not I. Scary thing is, the Roar don\u2019t look like they\u2019re done yet. BBL: 3rd over: Melbourne Renegades 17-2 (Marsh 2, Webster 4) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 Early issues for the Renegades with Harper following Harris back to the pavilion courtesy of a delightful Peter Siddle yorker that uprooted middle stump. W-League: GOAL! Western Sydney 0-2 Brisbane Roar (Raso, 61\u2019) Another goal for Brisbane and another goal against Western Sydney for Raso, who\u2019s been the best player on the pitch today and is full value for this strike, a right-footed pearler from distance which finds its home in the left corner. Troubling times for the highly favoured Wanderers. BBL: 1st over: Melbourne Renegades 6-1 (Marsh 1, Harper 1) v Adelaide Strikers 173-6 The run-chase is under way but not the way the Renegades would\u2019ve liked. Harris smears Head through the covers for four before trying to repeat the dose, only to swing, miss and see his off-stump disturbed. Good bowling from Head, who could\u2019ve bowled flatter and fuller, but instead invited the big shot and was rewarded. W-League: GOAL! Western Sydney 0-1 Brisbane Roar (Toby, 50\u2019) The Wanderers begin the second half much the brighter but it\u2019s the Roar who draw first blood as Raso\u2019s shot cannons off the post and into the path of Toby, who drills the shot home through traffic for a richly deserved goal. So after a blistering start, a crawl in the middle and a brisk end to their innings, the Strikers post the exact par winning score at Adelaide Oval. Seventy-seven runs were scored off the last six overs, with Wells (58 off 38) and Short (41 off 28) putting on 80 runs for the fifth wicket and steering their side though the mid-dig slump. The Renegades had no multiple wicket takers, but Patel (1-26) and Boyce (1-22) were key in ensuring the Strikers didn\u2019t post a larger score. Cricket: Legends to star in bushfire relief game Ricky Ponting and Shane Warne are planning to recruit big names of sport, movies and music to join their star-studded teams in Cricket Australia\u2019s bushfire relief match. The two Australia legends will captain the teams in the Bushfire Cricket Bash to be played as a curtain-raiser to the Big Bash League final on 8 February. The matches will form part of a triple header of cricket on the same day, with Australia to host India in a women\u2019s T20 international in Melbourne, and funds from all three matches will go to bushfire relief. Australia coach Justin Langer and fellow former national team stars Adam Gilchrist, Brett Lee, Shane Watson, Alex Blackwell and Michael Clarke are already confirmed starters for the Bushfire Cricket Bash. \u201cHopefully a few (more) big names will get involved as well,\u201d Warne said on Sunday. \u201cFrom all sorts, whether it be music, film, TV or sports from different codes.\u201d International cricket legends Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni are on the wishlist. The venue will only be decided when the host of the BBL is confirmed, but the MCG looms as a likely option. Last year\u2019s runners-up, Melbourne Stars, are top of the BBL ladder, ahead of Sydney Sixers after eight games. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite excited if it is here because one more game at the MCG would be nice,\u201d Ponting said. - with thanks to AAP This first half has been more-or-less owned by the Roar but despite their edge in possession, territory and chances on goal, scores remain level. That is something for the Wanderers to take into half-time. They\u2019ll know they can\u2019t play much worse than that. But they\u2019re not even behind. BBL: 17th over: Adelaide Strikers 127-4 (Wells 34, Short 21) This is better from the Strikers. Short breaks the boundary drought with a six off Boyce before Wells gets in on the act with a couple of fours of his own. Three overs to go, the Strikers can now set themselves for something near the 170 mark. W-League: 39 mins: Western Sydney 0-0 Brisbane Roar More clear chances for Brisbane but still no breakthrough. Both Kellond-Knight and Gorry are denied before Polkinghorne, on the receiving end of a delightful cross, has her header saved by the keeper. They\u2019re really taking it up to Western Sydney and belying their position on the ladder. But just now, Raso receives the game\u2019s first yellow card for a rash challenge. BBL: 13th over: Adelaide Strikers 92-4 (Wells 16, Short 5) Some tight, excellent mid-innings bowling from the Renegades here. The Strikers just can\u2019t get a partnership going. Nielsen is the latest batsman to go, caught in the deep off the bowling of Patel for four. It\u2019s over five overs since Adelaide have scored a boundary. They need to get a wriggle on. W-League: 24 mins: Western Sydney 0-0 Brisbane Roar The Wanderers let the best chance of the game go begging as Vine, fed with the ball to her feet by Hamilton, can\u2019t get enough on the strike to beat the keeper. At the other end, Raso is presented with an almost equally gilt-edged chance but her shot is expertly stopped by Smith, who uses her legs to great effect. On another day, both shots go in. W-League: 20 mins: Western Sydney 0-0 Brisbane Roar No goals yet at a soggy Marconi Stadium and Brisbane are doing a good job at keeping the high-flying Wanderers on a short leash. There have been chances for both teams, but to date both keepers have been equal to the task. BBL: 9th over: Adelaide Strikers 76-3 (Wells 8, Nielsen 1) They\u2019re scrapping away, the Renegades. Head is now on his way, caught by Mennie off the bowling of Boyce for 22, and though the run-rate is still good, new batsmen are again at the crease. With a par score of around 173 at Adelaide Oval, it\u2019s hard to know how well the Strikers are travelling right now. ATP Cup: It\u2019s had its knockers, this fledgling tournament, but nobody can argue with the quality of the tennis it\u2019s produced. Yesterday, Djokovic and Nadal underlined their status as all-time greats with imperious displays to propel their nations into tonight\u2019s final. And both overcame adversity to prevail. There aren\u2019t many better scribes on this sport than Kevin Mitchell, who\u2019s been kind enough to treat us to this report. BBL: 6th over: Adelaide Strikers 59-2 (Head 14, Wells 0) Both openers are back in the pavilion but the runs are still flowing freely for the Strikers. Catches to Cooper have accounted for both batsmen, but it\u2019s the one to get rid of Salt that will top the highlights reel. Hard on the rope at deep midwicket, Cooper takes it cleanly inside the field of play, tosses it up in the air as momentum takes him over before returning to the field of play to finish the job. Unbelievably good fielding. Unthinkable a decade or so ago, but almost commonplace these days. W-League: not long now until the Wanderers-Roar game gets under way at Marconi Stadium. A win here for Western Sydney will keep their premiership hopes flickering. BBL: 3rd over: Adelaide Strikers 35-0 (Salt 13, Weatherald 22) The Renegades swap spin for pace, but as the saying goes, it just comes off the bat quicker. The Strikers take 18 runs off Mennie\u2019s over, with Weatherald accounting for all but one of them. The pick was a sumptuous six straight down the ground. Pretty to watch. BBL: 2nd over: Adelaide Strikers 18-0 (Salt 13, Weatherald 5) More spin to commence proceedings for the Renegades. And more runs for the Strikers, notably a six and a four to Salt off the pie-like offerings of Nabi. Believe it or not, the Renegades are still in with a chance of making the finals, and then defending their crown. That\u2019s if they win here, then win again and keep on winning. BBL: 1st over: Adelaide Strikers 6-0 (Salt 1, Weatherald 5) The loosener of all looseners from Patel results in a boundary off the the first ball. And all things considered, keeping his first over to six runs was a good result from the Renegades spinner. Big Bash: Adelaide have won the toss (or whatever they call it these days) and will bat first. Ripper of a day in Radelaide. Sunny, high-20s, all-time stadium. What more could you want? Happy Sunday, sports fans. I wish I were the bearer of gladder tidings - something along the lines of, \u2018How good were Australia in the ATP Cup semi-final? Join us later on for the liveblog of the final!\u2019 - alas, Australia weren\u2019t very good at all last night. So we\u2019ll just have to admire the tennis excellence of Spain and Serbia from afar and concentrate on this afternoon\u2019s domestic action. But clouds, silver linings and other such utterances, because there\u2019s enough on to keep us not only occupied, but hopefully enraptured also. I\u2019ll be your host with the most bad puns dad jokes captivating commentary for the Big Bash game between Adelaide Strikers and the winless champions of yesteryear (well, last year), Melbourne Renegades and the W-League encounter between Western Sydney and Brisbane Roar. And that ain\u2019t bad. You know how it rolls: strap yourself in and get in touch by Email or, if you prefer, by tweeting @scott_heinrich.",

Just take last year\u2019s first quarter, when all the FTSE 350 housebuilders enjoyed their traditional share price bounce. By the second quarter, though, it was different story: they all underperformed the index and, in share price terms, the roof fell in.",

      "bodyText": "Judges from 20 European countries joined their Polish counterparts on a silent march of protest through Warsaw on Saturday, in an unprecedented public display of international judicial solidarity. Wearing their robes, the judges, along with thousands of demonstrators from across the country, were marching against repressive new measures aimed at Polish judges that the president of the supreme court warned could lead to Poland\u2019s eventual departure from the EU. The protest made its way from the Polish supreme court through central Warsaw to the parliament building. Countries represented included the Netherlands, Norway and Bulgaria. Demonstrators shouted \u201cBravo!\u201d and \u201cThank you!\u201d as the European judges walked past in silence. \u201cIt is an extraordinary event,\u201d said Andrea Chis, an appellate court judge from Romania. \u201cThis is the first time we have come together to defend the independence of the judiciary, not just in Poland but across the EU.\u201d Hundreds of Romanian judges and prosecutors have signed a letter of \u201cunconditional support\u201d for their Polish colleagues. \u201cThe support is extremely important to us, we treasure it,\u201d said Monika Fr\u0105ckowiak, a district court judge from the north-west city of Pozna\u0144, and a co-organiser of the event. \u201cWe are European judges, we are part of Europe, and this is confirmation of that.\u201d Polish judges involved in politically sensitive cases, or who have expressed opposition to challenges to judicial independence, are frequently threatened with disciplinary proceedings and even criminal charges, and in many cases, subjected to state-led campaigns of intimidation. After taking office in 2015, Poland\u2019s ruling right-wing Law and Justice party assumed direct control of the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), a formerly independent body that oversees the appointment, promotion and discipline of all Polish judges. This allowed the government to fill a newly created judicial disciplinary chamber with party loyalists who have since proceeded to launch disciplinary proceedings against any judge who questions the new regime. In December, the Polish supreme court, which is still independent, ruled that the KRS and the new disciplinary chamber were unlawfully constituted. The government responded with legislation making it illegal for any Polish judge to question the legality of its appointments \u2013 in effect, to ban Polish judges from complying with a ruling issued by their own supreme court. If enacted, the proposals, which are currently under consideration in the Polish senate, would also make it illegal for Polish judges to refer legal questions directly to the European Court of Justice \u2013 despite such referrals being central to the functioning of the European legal system. That led to a stark warning last month from Ma\u0142gorzata Gersdorf, president of the Polish supreme court, that \u201csuch a solution will lead directly to Poland\u2019s exit from the EU\u201d. Her message appeared to be echoed by Koen Lenaerts, the president of the ECJ, during a visit to Poland on Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a member of the European Union if you don\u2019t have independent, impartial courts operating in accordance with fair trial rule, upholding union law,\u201d he told an audience at the University of Warsaw. Saturday\u2019s public display of support from their European colleagues is the culmination of several years of soul-searching on behalf of members of a profession that has found itself dragged unwillingly into the political fray by increasingly overt attacks on judicial independence in several European countries. Representatives of European judicial associations say that the traditional refrain that judges should only \u201cspeak through their judgments\u201d has been found wanting. \u201cJudges are reaching out to citizens, saying \u2018defend us, so that we can defend you\u2019,\u201d said Kees Sterk, a Dutch judge and president of the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary. \u201cIn countries where judicial independence is respected, then of course judges should not get involved in politics. But when judicial independence is being destroyed, you cannot expect them to allow themselves to be led like lambs to the slaughter. It is not just that judges are allowed to fight \u2013 it is their duty.\u201d",

Now it\u2019s not such an obvious thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>The average British skier spent \u00a31,335 on their holiday last year, a considerable amount, especially for cash-strapped younger people. Research by Mintel suggests millennials booking a ski holiday are most likely to be attracted by a low price, followed by guaranteed snow. Significantly, <a href=\"https://www.action-outdoors.co.uk\" title=\"\">Action Outdoors</a>, the UK arm of the French youth hostel agency, UCPA, which offers all-inclusive ski breaks for 18- to 25-year-olds for as little as \u00a3500, said it had seen a 15 to 20% year-on-year growth over the past 10 years.</p> <p>But Vanat said he did not believe price was the reason younger people were turning away from skiing: \u201cI don\u2019t think the price of skiing has really increased in a substantial way that could explain the change.

Verbier\u2019s Polaris festival is a four-day dance music festival; Mayrhofen draws 7,000 for Snowbombing, its electronic dance music extravaganza; no major French resort is now complete without a Folie Douce, the high altitude cabaret-cum-DJ set phenomenon that started in Tignes in 1980.</p> <p>Such events may help resorts diversify, especially as concerns about the paucity of snow become a prevailing theme.

And in March, the high altitude resort of Avoriaz is hosting its seventh Snowboxx festival with major name DJs including Annie Mac. \u201cWe started it because we were really bored by the standard package holiday options and wanted to create an exciting week for people who wanted to have a good time both on and off the piste,\u201d said Rob Tominey, CEO of Mainstage, the company behind the festival. \u201cThe 21-40 travel market is looking for a more all-round experience \u2013 they aren\u2019t content with skiing all day and eating fondue every night.\u201d Other resorts use music to attract a younger crowd. Verbier\u2019s Polaris festival is a four-day dance music festival; Mayrhofen draws 7,000 for Snowbombing, its electronic dance music extravaganza; no major French resort is now complete without a Folie Douce, the high altitude cabaret-cum-DJ set phenomenon that started in Tignes in 1980. Such events may help resorts diversify, especially as concerns about the paucity of snow become a prevailing theme. But not everyone is convinced they can save the ski industry. Vanat said: \u201cIt may attract young people but the question is, when they come, do they really ski?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the grand exhibition space of a Shanghai art museum, molecular blobs have been blown up on to giant screens to demonstrate the science element of a very long, very reverent summit on skincare hosted by Dior. The celebrity element is Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the face of a new range of creams and serums, who will shortly be on hand to help quantify how 30 years of advanced floral science and stem cell technology can help you look better. Being born looking like one of the most successful models of the century can also help, but no matter. </p> <p>\u201cHealth is becoming the new wealth,\u201d announces Edouard Mauvais-Jarvis, Dior\u2019s scientific communications director, to a room of 150 or so delegates. Gentle electronic music pulsates in a space with a Kubrick-meets-Instagram aesthetic: clinically all white, all bright, accented by pillars of pink peonies. Chic French PRs circle beauty journalists, editors and scientists, while kooky Asian influencers, like kooky influencers everywhere, take aloof but cute selfies.</p> <p>B\u00fcndchen \u2013 or Gisele, as she\u2019s mononymously known \u2013 bounds on stage after being introduced via video montages of her career and the new Dior beauty campaign. There are lingering, soft-focus shots of her sitting with her eyes closed on a mountain or looking wistful on a beach, set to soaring strings. The emphasis is on the model\u2019s credentials as an environmentalist, activist, mother and paragon of physical perfection. Dressed in flared blue jeans, white shirt tucked into a Christian Dior belt underneath a myrtle green blazer with black kitten heels, her trademark wavy blow-out bounces as she takes a seat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in your body being a temple,\u201d she says. Her voice is a deliciously Brazilian-accented husk. She has been put in conversation on stage with Chinese actress Li Bingbing and a local TV presenter to talk about personal wellbeing and the planet. \u201cWhat are we eating? What are our thoughts?\u201d Gisele asks the audience. \u201cBecause when you feel better, you look better. And if we hurt nature, we\u2019re hurting ourselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30258eb8fc05194861c4b79cf24f47e3be7dd1e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30258eb8fc05194861c4b79cf24f47e3be7dd1e6/0_541_4073_5086/801.jpg\" alt=\"Belle of the ball: Gisele at the 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp, New York City.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belle of the ball: Gisele at the 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp, New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presenter blinks and nods before inanely suggesting that \u201cIf the environment gets clean and prettier, we will become clean and prettier?\u201d Li looks fantastically bored. It is left to Gisele to carry the weight of the event, which she does with amped up professionalism: enthusiastic, chatty, smiling throughout. She talks about her environmental activism, the need for inner beauty and peace to be the main goal, and why nature is a \u201cone-word philosophy\u201d that allowed her to heal her wounds. The presenter, seemingly awe-struck, closes her eyes and nods in agreement.</p> <p>Gisele, pronounced Gi-zell-ee by her family, was 13 when she won her first modelling competition in S\u00e3o Paulo. She and her five sisters, including her twin Patricia, grew up in a middle-class home in a small town in southern Brazil. She writes at length in her 2018 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life</em>, about being bullied for looking too thin at school, of being a tomboy. The book is a hotchpotch of notes, a diary-slash-scrapbook of her life and how she apparently got there. She writes about being name-called \u201cOlly\u201d (as in Olive, Popeye\u2019s skinny missus) and wearing \u201ctwo pairs of pants to make my legs look thicker\u201d.</p> <p>But by the time Gisele arrived in New York, at 18, and made her catwalk debut for Alexander McQueen, she\u2019d been rebranded by him as \u201cthe Body\u201d and \u201cthe boobs from Brazil\u201d by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The following year, in 1999, she became a sensation. Editors and designers declared the teenager, with her 36-24-35 bust-waist-hip ratio, marked the return of the curve; she rang the death knell for the waifish angles of heroin chic. Throughout the noughties, she steadily became the highest-paid model in the world, and has now clocked more than 1,200 magazine covers.</p> <p>\u201cAll I cared about back then was to be like this,\u201d she says, when we sit down together. \u201cLike, I wanted to belong, I wanted people to like me and it was important to me so I would go out of my way to say yes to everybody. I wanted to please everybody. God forbid I would, like, disappoint anyone. And hey, that\u2019s why I got panic attacks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6becbbd97c399b0e7a16e27e861d4bc6c1716352\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6becbbd97c399b0e7a16e27e861d4bc6c1716352/0_186_2766_1660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Take me out to the ball game: Gisele with her husband Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, victors in Super Bowl 51, 5 February 2017, Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take me out to the ball game: Gisele with her husband Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, victors in Super Bowl 51, 5 February 2017, Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gisele was at the height of her modelling career when she says, gravely, that she \u201chit rock bottom\u201d. It was 2004. She was 24. She\u2019d worked for every major designer, become the $25m face of Victoria\u2019s Secret and landed her 76th cover of <em>Vogue</em>. She and Leonardo DiCaprio had been named one of the world\u2019s most beautiful couples by <em>People </em>magazine, and their relationship was a tabloid fixture. Yet it was her lifestyle, she says, that sent her spinning.</p> <p>\u201cI was eating steak and fries every night. I was drinking a bottle of wine and smoking cigarettes and having a mocha cappuccino for breakfast. That wasn\u2019t so good.\u201d For many this might qualify as an average Friday, but as a world-famous model Gisele developed severe anxiety. \u201cIt was uppers and downers, it wasn\u2019t drugs, but I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was drinking so much coffee during the day.\u201d</p> <p>In her book, she wrote that for the briefest split-second, feeling trapped, she looked out to the balcony of her apartment and considered a dark feeling. She lifts both hands from her lap now and chats at speed. \u201cWhen I had a panic attack, I thought I was going to die. I was scared. I couldn\u2019t breathe. And what I realised was that I am creating this for myself: we are creating the lives we are living with our actions and we have a choice. I chose to come into [my routine] because it was a tool that I found to heal myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7bbfae5886a638780f2a694bad549d321e18bec3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bbfae5886a638780f2a694bad549d321e18bec3/0_196_1980_2473/801.jpg\" alt=\"Golden girl: Gisele modelling Victoria\u2019s Secret in 2000.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden girl: Gisele modelling Victoria\u2019s Secret in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The episode marked a pivot to a newer, even more virtuous life. Gisele took up yoga, meditation, silent retreats, cut out sugar, alcohol, caffeine, carbs \u2013 every health kick that has since become so mainstream as to be unremarkable. But before Instagram, before <a href=\"https://goop.com/\" title=\"\">Goop</a>, before vloggers and a global wellness industry worth $4.2tn, there were celebrity gurus and faddy diets. There were hooey health tips plucked from beautiful, famous people and the army of nutritionists, trainers, doctors and dermatologists that kept them so. In this sense, Gisele was an early adopter.</p> <p>How does she feel seeing wellness and all she lived by transform pop culture? She shrieks. \u201cI have five sisters, and if I find a new recipe or something I like, I share it with the group. This is why I\u2019ve written the book. The whole point is more awareness, the more people get things like yoga, it\u2019s a positive thing. The more people become awakened and conscious of the very decisions they\u2019re going to make, then you don\u2019t have a bunch of people, like, half asleep, you know?\u201d</p> <p>All but one of her sisters, who is a federal judge, work (in various, not altogether clear ways) for the wellness brand worth hundreds of millions of dollars that Gisele has built around herself over the past two decades. Hers is a sun-kissed, barefoot hippy, organic aesthetic contrived as a lifestyle catalogue: all yoga poses at sunset and cosy sweaters and leggings, with inspirational mantras for simple, fuss-free, eco-living.</p> <p>Now, every morning, Gisele wakes up to the sound of the ocean waves from her phone speaker and begins a fastidious routine. Stretches and meditation come first, followed by swilling oil in her mouth for several minutes \u201cto clean out all the guck and detoxify teeth and gums\u201d. Then a workout listening \u201cto a YouTube video on maybe ancient Egypt or Greece,\u201d followed by drinking lemon and water, making healthy breakfasts and lunches for her kids, and sipping a green juice. The school run and a shower are completed before she begins her work in her garden office, the Sanctuary.</p> <p>Gisele swears she doesn\u2019t find the regime difficult: most of her meals are plant-based; snacks such as roasted pumpkin seeds are considered a treat. \u201cI do it because it makes me feel better. It makes me happier in my life. I make those choices because it gives me something right back. And I\u2019m happy that more people are getting access to that because the more people who know about it, the more it\u2019s going to make them happier. And if you have a happier world, the better it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e7de19c39a379790c4df73074179fe6c751bbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e7de19c39a379790c4df73074179fe6c751bbe4/31_0_4719_5898/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brown study: makeup by Yumi Lee using Dior Capture Totale Cell Energy; hair by David von Cannon; styling by Katie Mossman; nails by Deborah Lippmann.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t really care what anyone thinks. I care about living my truth.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nino Mu\u00f1oz/Parfums Christian Dior</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gisele\u2019s logic is as sunny and indefatigable as her disposition. A lot of people may strive to live like her, I say, but often the discipline gives way to more urgent priorities. \u201cThey just have to make the decision of working at it,\u201d she says earnestly. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with today\u2019s society, people want instant gratification where it\u2019s you know: \u2018I want to do something and [when] I wake up I want to look like this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018er, well, you know for me to cure my panic attacks, it took months. I could have taken a pill, but I decided no. I\u2019m going to wake up every morning and I\u2019m going to meditate and do breath work.\u2019 It took months.\u201d Which is fair, to a point. But not everyone has access to the financial and physical support she has. \u201cEverything starts with discipline,\u201d she says.</p> <p>If Gisele\u2019s lifestyle<em><strong> </strong></em>now is the warped embodiment of aspiration, it is one she has carefully curated. She split from DiCaprio in 2005, after it became clear he wasn\u2019t on the same journey, so to speak. In 2009 she married the NFL star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tom-brady\" title=\"\">Tom Brady</a>, after three years of dating. They have a 10-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter together, along with Brady\u2019s 12-year-old son from his previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.</p> <p>Gisele and Brady\u2019s is a cookie-cutter, loved-up wholesomeness. At their wedding, they gifted each guest a copy of pop-psychology guide <em>The Mastery of Love</em>. <em>Forbes</em> has named them one of the top three highest-earning celebrity couples of the past decade. When Brady\u2019s friendship with Donald Trump caused a sensational backlash, it was Gisele who distanced the couple from the president. As Brady put it: \u201cI talked to my wife and she said I can\u2019t talk about politics any more. I think that\u2019s a good decision for our family.\u201d</p> <p>What does she credit to their success as a couple? \u201cI\u2019ve been with my husband for more than 12 years now and, as you know, men are very\u2026 They want a lot of attention. They\u2019re like, they demand... They need a lot of attention, like children do, like your family, your friends. So I think the important part is to have fully present moments with everybody. I think that leads to fulfilment, because they don\u2019t have half of you, they have all of you in that moment and then they get recharged.\u201d Gisele seems to have cracked this one; despite the clock running down and her neat ability to filibuster rather than answer all my questions, she holds perfect eye contact and maintains she is \u201cfully here and I\u2019m having this experience and having an exchange. I\u2019m not picking up my phone or texting somebody or thinking about my laundry or my dogs. It\u2019s the same thing with my kids. When I\u2019m with them, I\u2019m with them, on the floor with them, talking with them, really listening to them. Same with my husband.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afe09e5bc6b9d670f8fb038678e47f0c333b8a2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afe09e5bc6b9d670f8fb038678e47f0c333b8a2f/0_2_2896_1738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Power couple: Gisele with Leonardo DiCaprio in 2005, before they split up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power couple: Gisele with Leonardo DiCaprio in 2005, before they split.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Haynes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a decade of backing tree-planting reforestation initiatives in Brazil and launching a clean water project in her hometown, Gisele\u2019s environmental activism is set to step up next year. Her Instagram feed, which she writes in Portuguese and English, is often scattered with missives that remind followers to take better care of the planet.</p> <p>Given her life at home and with work, is her carbon footprint a worry? Is she aware of what it is? \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something, but I can\u2019t say it right now. It has to do with the movement of regenerating the planet,\u201d she says. \u201cI do everything I can do. We compost. We have a garden. Yes, I could probably live in a smaller house, but we have solar panels. I tell my children it\u2019s about the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. If you go into my closet, for example, you\u2019re not going to believe it, because I have, like, the jeans I wore three years ago.\u201d It feels churlish to point out that in the civilian world, this is totally normal: Gisele\u2019s life exists on a plane of fabulousness because, well, surely, that is entirely the point of being Gisele.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I am,\u201d she adds, still keen to maintain low-key relatability. \u201cI don\u2019t need stuff. When you need stuff it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t really worked out the inside.\u201d</p> <p>We both laugh, given the irony of the statement coming from someone working in the fashion industry. \u201cThe fashion industry is not what I\u2019ve done,\u201d sing-songs Gisele. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do for work. And also, I haven\u2019t really done a lot of stuff because I feel like it\u2019s not in alignment with what I believe in. I say no to 95% of things that come to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2da84264c24eb3ccaab223a18a39a4c6c8226af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da84264c24eb3ccaab223a18a39a4c6c8226af7/138_0_5375_6720/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The body\u2019: makeup by Yumi Lee using Dior Capture Totale Cell Energy; hair by David von Cannon; styling by Katie Mossman; nails by Deborah Lippmann.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I mostly like to be outside with nature, doing something physical like surfing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nino Mu\u00f1oz/Parfums Christian Dior</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that she turns 40 this year and is fronting a line of anti-ageing products, I ask how much she worries about her face and body changing as she gets older. \u201cI think, for me, it\u2019s more about the way I feel, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like, I breastfed my kids for three years each because I felt it was the most important thing I could do and I wanted to give my children and myself that experience \u2013 you\u2019re not going to have that again. Yes, it\u2019s going to make your body change, yes I can work out to be fit and feel good and rejuvenated, but I can\u2019t change the fact that both my kids liked the left boob.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, at 30, Gisele said that \u201cthere should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.\u201d In 2015, seemingly going against her own well-pronounced principles on keeping all things in life natural, she was papped in Paris visiting a plastic surgeon for surgery on said left boob. Aware of the backlash that would ensue amid charges of hypocrisy, she bizarrely tried to disguise herself in a burqa but was caught out by paps who recognised her driver. She was ridiculed brutally online.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I did that [the breast surgery], I felt like I was trying to please. Because I was \u2018the Body\u2019 and\u2026\u201d She takes the briefest pause. \u201cLook, I think if you do something because it is what you feel is your truth, then there is no problem. Then whatever you do is going to bring you joy. But if you do it because it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s idea of you, that\u2019s the problem. So that was another lesson that I\u2019ve learned the hard way. I feel like today, where I\u2019m at with my life, I don\u2019t really care what anyone thinks. I care about living my truth. I care about being a great mother.\u201d</p> <p>She won\u2019t elaborate on her feelings about getting older, suffice to say that again, \u201cI mostly like to be outside with nature, doing something physical like surfing, horseback riding, I play volleyball, run around with my kids or take my dog for a walk. I don\u2019t really exercise because I think I want my butt to look good or this way.\u201d She smiles, fixed on wellness guru autopilot. \u201cIt\u2019s important to do those things that really nourish you, benefit you, make you feel good,\u201d she ends. \u201cI think that\u2019s vital.\u201d</p> <p><em>Gisele B\u00fcndchen is the face of Dior Capture Totale.

Being born looking like one of the most successful models of the century can also help, but no matter. \u201cHealth is becoming the new wealth,\u201d announces Edouard Mauvais-Jarvis, Dior\u2019s scientific communications director, to a room of 150 or so delegates. Gentle electronic music pulsates in a space with a Kubrick-meets-Instagram aesthetic: clinically all white, all bright, accented by pillars of pink peonies. Chic French PRs circle beauty journalists, editors and scientists, while kooky Asian influencers, like kooky influencers everywhere, take aloof but cute selfies. B\u00fcndchen \u2013 or Gisele, as she\u2019s mononymously known \u2013 bounds on stage after being introduced via video montages of her career and the new Dior beauty campaign. There are lingering, soft-focus shots of her sitting with her eyes closed on a mountain or looking wistful on a beach, set to soaring strings. The emphasis is on the model\u2019s credentials as an environmentalist, activist, mother and paragon of physical perfection. Dressed in flared blue jeans, white shirt tucked into a Christian Dior belt underneath a myrtle green blazer with black kitten heels, her trademark wavy blow-out bounces as she takes a seat. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in your body being a temple,\u201d she says. Her voice is a deliciously Brazilian-accented husk. She has been put in conversation on stage with Chinese actress Li Bingbing and a local TV presenter to talk about personal wellbeing and the planet. \u201cWhat are we eating? What are our thoughts?\u201d Gisele asks the audience. \u201cBecause when you feel better, you look better. And if we hurt nature, we\u2019re hurting ourselves.\u201d The presenter blinks and nods before inanely suggesting that \u201cIf the environment gets clean and prettier, we will become clean and prettier?\u201d Li looks fantastically bored. It is left to Gisele to carry the weight of the event, which she does with amped up professionalism: enthusiastic, chatty, smiling throughout. She talks about her environmental activism, the need for inner beauty and peace to be the main goal, and why nature is a \u201cone-word philosophy\u201d that allowed her to heal her wounds. The presenter, seemingly awe-struck, closes her eyes and nods in agreement. Gisele, pronounced Gi-zell-ee by her family, was 13 when she won her first modelling competition in S\u00e3o Paulo. She and her five sisters, including her twin Patricia, grew up in a middle-class home in a small town in southern Brazil. She writes at length in her 2018 New York Times bestseller, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life, about being bullied for looking too thin at school, of being a tomboy. The book is a hotchpotch of notes, a diary-slash-scrapbook of her life and how she apparently got there. She writes about being name-called \u201cOlly\u201d (as in Olive, Popeye\u2019s skinny missus) and wearing \u201ctwo pairs of pants to make my legs look thicker\u201d. But by the time Gisele arrived in New York, at 18, and made her catwalk debut for Alexander McQueen, she\u2019d been rebranded by him as \u201cthe Body\u201d and \u201cthe boobs from Brazil\u201d by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The following year, in 1999, she became a sensation. Editors and designers declared the teenager, with her 36-24-35 bust-waist-hip ratio, marked the return of the curve; she rang the death knell for the waifish angles of heroin chic. Throughout the noughties, she steadily became the highest-paid model in the world, and has now clocked more than 1,200 magazine covers. \u201cAll I cared about back then was to be like this,\u201d she says, when we sit down together. \u201cLike, I wanted to belong, I wanted people to like me and it was important to me so I would go out of my way to say yes to everybody. I wanted to please everybody. God forbid I would, like, disappoint anyone. And hey, that\u2019s why I got panic attacks.\u201d Gisele was at the height of her modelling career when she says, gravely, that she \u201chit rock bottom\u201d. It was 2004. She was 24. She\u2019d worked for every major designer, become the $25m face of Victoria\u2019s Secret and landed her 76th cover of Vogue. She and Leonardo DiCaprio had been named one of the world\u2019s most beautiful couples by People magazine, and their relationship was a tabloid fixture. Yet it was her lifestyle, she says, that sent her spinning. \u201cI was eating steak and fries every night. I was drinking a bottle of wine and smoking cigarettes and having a mocha cappuccino for breakfast. That wasn\u2019t so good.\u201d For many this might qualify as an average Friday, but as a world-famous model Gisele developed severe anxiety. \u201cIt was uppers and downers, it wasn\u2019t drugs, but I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was drinking so much coffee during the day.\u201d In her book, she wrote that for the briefest split-second, feeling trapped, she looked out to the balcony of her apartment and considered a dark feeling. She lifts both hands from her lap now and chats at speed. \u201cWhen I had a panic attack, I thought I was going to die. I was scared. I couldn\u2019t breathe. And what I realised was that I am creating this for myself: we are creating the lives we are living with our actions and we have a choice. I chose to come into [my routine] because it was a tool that I found to heal myself.\u201d The episode marked a pivot to a newer, even more virtuous life. Gisele took up yoga, meditation, silent retreats, cut out sugar, alcohol, caffeine, carbs \u2013 every health kick that has since become so mainstream as to be unremarkable. But before Instagram, before Goop, before vloggers and a global wellness industry worth $4.2tn, there were celebrity gurus and faddy diets. There were hooey health tips plucked from beautiful, famous people and the army of nutritionists, trainers, doctors and dermatologists that kept them so. In this sense, Gisele was an early adopter. How does she feel seeing wellness and all she lived by transform pop culture? She shrieks. \u201cI have five sisters, and if I find a new recipe or something I like, I share it with the group. This is why I\u2019ve written the book. The whole point is more awareness, the more people get things like yoga, it\u2019s a positive thing. The more people become awakened and conscious of the very decisions they\u2019re going to make, then you don\u2019t have a bunch of people, like, half asleep, you know?\u201d All but one of her sisters, who is a federal judge, work (in various, not altogether clear ways) for the wellness brand worth hundreds of millions of dollars that Gisele has built around herself over the past two decades. Hers is a sun-kissed, barefoot hippy, organic aesthetic contrived as a lifestyle catalogue: all yoga poses at sunset and cosy sweaters and leggings, with inspirational mantras for simple, fuss-free, eco-living. Now, every morning, Gisele wakes up to the sound of the ocean waves from her phone speaker and begins a fastidious routine. Stretches and meditation come first, followed by swilling oil in her mouth for several minutes \u201cto clean out all the guck and detoxify teeth and gums\u201d. Then a workout listening \u201cto a YouTube video on maybe ancient Egypt or Greece,\u201d followed by drinking lemon and water, making healthy breakfasts and lunches for her kids, and sipping a green juice. The school run and a shower are completed before she begins her work in her garden office, the Sanctuary. Gisele swears she doesn\u2019t find the regime difficult: most of her meals are plant-based; snacks such as roasted pumpkin seeds are considered a treat. \u201cI do it because it makes me feel better. It makes me happier in my life. I make those choices because it gives me something right back. And I\u2019m happy that more people are getting access to that because the more people who know about it, the more it\u2019s going to make them happier. And if you have a happier world, the better it\u2019s going to be.\u201d Gisele\u2019s logic is as sunny and indefatigable as her disposition. A lot of people may strive to live like her, I say, but often the discipline gives way to more urgent priorities. \u201cThey just have to make the decision of working at it,\u201d she says earnestly. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with today\u2019s society, people want instant gratification where it\u2019s you know: \u2018I want to do something and [when] I wake up I want to look like this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018er, well, you know for me to cure my panic attacks, it took months. I could have taken a pill, but I decided no. I\u2019m going to wake up every morning and I\u2019m going to meditate and do breath work.\u2019 It took months.\u201d Which is fair, to a point. But not everyone has access to the financial and physical support she has. \u201cEverything starts with discipline,\u201d she says. If Gisele\u2019s lifestyle now is the warped embodiment of aspiration, it is one she has carefully curated. She split from DiCaprio in 2005, after it became clear he wasn\u2019t on the same journey, so to speak. In 2009 she married the NFL star Tom Brady, after three years of dating. They have a 10-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter together, along with Brady\u2019s 12-year-old son from his previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan. Gisele and Brady\u2019s is a cookie-cutter, loved-up wholesomeness. At their wedding, they gifted each guest a copy of pop-psychology guide The Mastery of Love. Forbes has named them one of the top three highest-earning celebrity couples of the past decade. When Brady\u2019s friendship with Donald Trump caused a sensational backlash, it was Gisele who distanced the couple from the president. As Brady put it: \u201cI talked to my wife and she said I can\u2019t talk about politics any more. I think that\u2019s a good decision for our family.\u201d What does she credit to their success as a couple? \u201cI\u2019ve been with my husband for more than 12 years now and, as you know, men are very\u2026 They want a lot of attention. They\u2019re like, they demand... They need a lot of attention, like children do, like your family, your friends. So I think the important part is to have fully present moments with everybody. I think that leads to fulfilment, because they don\u2019t have half of you, they have all of you in that moment and then they get recharged.\u201d Gisele seems to have cracked this one; despite the clock running down and her neat ability to filibuster rather than answer all my questions, she holds perfect eye contact and maintains she is \u201cfully here and I\u2019m having this experience and having an exchange. I\u2019m not picking up my phone or texting somebody or thinking about my laundry or my dogs. It\u2019s the same thing with my kids. When I\u2019m with them, I\u2019m with them, on the floor with them, talking with them, really listening to them. Same with my husband.\u201d After a decade of backing tree-planting reforestation initiatives in Brazil and launching a clean water project in her hometown, Gisele\u2019s environmental activism is set to step up next year. Her Instagram feed, which she writes in Portuguese and English, is often scattered with missives that remind followers to take better care of the planet. Given her life at home and with work, is her carbon footprint a worry? Is she aware of what it is? \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something, but I can\u2019t say it right now. It has to do with the movement of regenerating the planet,\u201d she says. \u201cI do everything I can do. We compost. We have a garden. Yes, I could probably live in a smaller house, but we have solar panels. I tell my children it\u2019s about the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle. If you go into my closet, for example, you\u2019re not going to believe it, because I have, like, the jeans I wore three years ago.\u201d It feels churlish to point out that in the civilian world, this is totally normal: Gisele\u2019s life exists on a plane of fabulousness because, well, surely, that is entirely the point of being Gisele. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am,\u201d she adds, still keen to maintain low-key relatability. \u201cI don\u2019t need stuff. When you need stuff it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t really worked out the inside.\u201d We both laugh, given the irony of the statement coming from someone working in the fashion industry. \u201cThe fashion industry is not what I\u2019ve done,\u201d sing-songs Gisele. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do for work. And also, I haven\u2019t really done a lot of stuff because I feel like it\u2019s not in alignment with what I believe in. I say no to 95% of things that come to me.\u201d Given that she turns 40 this year and is fronting a line of anti-ageing products, I ask how much she worries about her face and body changing as she gets older. \u201cI think, for me, it\u2019s more about the way I feel, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like, I breastfed my kids for three years each because I felt it was the most important thing I could do and I wanted to give my children and myself that experience \u2013 you\u2019re not going to have that again. Yes, it\u2019s going to make your body change, yes I can work out to be fit and feel good and rejuvenated, but I can\u2019t change the fact that both my kids liked the left boob.\u201d In 2010, at 30, Gisele said that \u201cthere should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.\u201d In 2015, seemingly going against her own well-pronounced principles on keeping all things in life natural, she was papped in Paris visiting a plastic surgeon for surgery on said left boob. Aware of the backlash that would ensue amid charges of hypocrisy, she bizarrely tried to disguise herself in a burqa but was caught out by paps who recognised her driver. She was ridiculed brutally online. \u201cWhen I did that [the breast surgery], I felt like I was trying to please. Because I was \u2018the Body\u2019 and\u2026\u201d She takes the briefest pause. \u201cLook, I think if you do something because it is what you feel is your truth, then there is no problem. Then whatever you do is going to bring you joy. But if you do it because it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s idea of you, that\u2019s the problem. So that was another lesson that I\u2019ve learned the hard way. I feel like today, where I\u2019m at with my life, I don\u2019t really care what anyone thinks. I care about living my truth. I care about being a great mother.\u201d She won\u2019t elaborate on her feelings about getting older, suffice to say that again, \u201cI mostly like to be outside with nature, doing something physical like surfing, horseback riding, I play volleyball, run around with my kids or take my dog for a walk. I don\u2019t really exercise because I think I want my butt to look good or this way.\u201d She smiles, fixed on wellness guru autopilot. \u201cIt\u2019s important to do those things that really nourish you, benefit you, make you feel good,\u201d she ends. \u201cI think that\u2019s vital.\u201d Gisele B\u00fcndchen is the face of Dior Capture Totale.

      "body": "<p>With the air of melodrama unique to chic French women, the lady opposite me yanked open the overhead window then sat back down, grumbling to no one in particular and fanning herself with a copy of Paris Match. An aroma of pine filtered into the carriage and a breeze cooled my brow as the train clattered south to B\u00e9ziers. Edging up to the window, I looked down to where a curl of sand and green water had appeared, an oasis where children bobbed about in dinghies and leapt off limestone rocks. This was the essence of why I love train travel: it allows me to see what\u2019s behind the trees in the Massif Central; to smell the coconut being fried in huts in Kerala; and to spot rainbows hovering in the spray of Niagara Falls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f42f30fc9664760696632b13851db8ded96daf06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f42f30fc9664760696632b13851db8ded96daf06/0_0_6766_4516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Only on a train \u2026 the writer chats to a Tibetan nun on a train in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Only on a train \u2026 the writer chats to a Tibetan nun in China</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week earlier I had set off from London St Pancras to Paris with the aim of travelling around the world in 80 trains. In 2010, I had travelled around India in 80 trains and come away in thrall to the railways \u2013 so much so that I decided to embark on a global railway adventure. For a long time, the rise of high-speed trains and budget airlines appeared to threaten the notion of romantic rail travel. But I wanted to see what slow travel means to people all over the world and what long-distance trains still have to offer the modern-day traveller. Hanging a map on my wall, I pinned cities of interest and tied coloured string from one to the next, watching the next seven months of my life wind around the world with surprising simplicity. With the exception of visas for Russia, China and Vietnam, few logistical issues arose. I bought rail passes for Europe, Japan and America, and booked long-distance journeys such as the Trans-Mongolian and The Canadian, before setting off, sewing in the other trains with ease.</p> <p>Over the first four weeks, Europe\u2019s TGVs, AVEs and Freccia Rossas swept me from city to city, allowing me to lunch on cassoulet in Toulouse and be in Barcelona in time for a dinner of <em>gambas al ajillo</em>. Punctual, quiet and efficient, the air-conditioned trains fulfilled their primary purpose \u2013 taking me from one destination to the next \u2013 but they were devoid of soul. Passengers boarded, stashed their bags and sat in silence, staring at phones and munching paper-wrapped panini. I threaded through Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia before arriving in Moscow to board the Godfather of trains \u2013 the Trans-Mongolian to Beijing. It was here that the journey truly began\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d90268dfc7234486c00ca23fb21bf469a4f1707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d90268dfc7234486c00ca23fb21bf469a4f1707/0_355_5890_3536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Russian locomotive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Russian locomotive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the morning of departure, sirens wailed and police cordons appeared around Moscow, closing metro stations and blocking access to supermarkets owing to the arrival of Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. This meant I was unable to stockpile anything other than a four-pack of instant noodles, a couple of Kinder Bueno bars and all the biscuits and herbal teabags from my hotel room before embarking on the four-night leg to Irkutsk in Siberia.</p> <p>Once on board, I surveyed my compartment \u2013 complete with cracked window and condom wrapper under the berth \u2013 before wandering up the corridor, glancing into my neighbours\u2019 digs and wincing at the smell of dried <em>omul</em> (a fish found only in Lake Baikal) drifting in a warm fug. Long and thin as though ironed into strips, the yellowing fish was a staple in the makeshift pantries set up by my companions, along with loaves of bread and rounds of cheese wrapped in wet cloth. Breaking into a panic, I followed the tiring sound of Euro-trance and found the disco-dining car, relieved to see a kitchen, even though the chef was lighting a cigarette off the hob while smiling at me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42eedf6939347719bd99b0f383577549560cd794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42eedf6939347719bd99b0f383577549560cd794/0_246_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trans-Siberian train window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trans-Siberian train window</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once the train had jolted out of Moscow, I slid into a red booth and tucked into a slightly faggy-tasting pork escalope draped in dill. As we sped through the bleakness of the suburbs, I was joined by Aleksandr and Aleksandr, both in Adidas vests and sliders, and wondering what on earth I was doing on board.</p> <p>\u201cThis train is trash, I hate it!\u201d declared Aleksandr I, a young lawyer. A lack of roads meant that he was condemned to using the Trans-Mongolian twice a month to attend court hearings 13 hours away in Kirov: one person\u2019s bucket-list adventure is another\u2019s nightmare commute. He said he had never seen an English person on board the train which, it transpired, was a domestic service used by Russians only \u2013 rather than the fancy Rossiya service preferred by tourists. Aleksandr II was visiting his parents, a five-day journey away, and was convinced I was a spy, photographing every page of my diary under the guise of liking my handwriting.</p> <p>In between attempts to read War and Peace, I spent the next four days lying in damp, tangled sheets watching leafless trees flit by the window. Most afternoons I\u2019d play cards with kids or swap tat with soldiers, offering second-class stamps in exchange for a tube of Pringles or a smoke grenade, enjoying the clamour and constant companionship. But at dusk I\u2019d stand alone in the corridor meditating on the mists as they swirled in great halos. Charged by the sight of the world moving at pace before my eyes, I\u2019d still myself, knowing I was privileged to witness how deeply this train carved through the Earth, shining a light into its darkest corners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c441322a92db3385d2ba179ee6a385321df1b723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c441322a92db3385d2ba179ee6a385321df1b723/0_0_5596_3736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant owners grilling fresh mutton kebabs in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restaurant owners grilling fresh mutton kebabs in China</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like most travellers, I broke up the journey in Irkutsk and spent a day chugging around Lake Baikal on the old <a href=\"https://www.russiaeguide.com/circum-baikal-railway-tour.html\" title=\"\">Circum-Baikal steam railway</a> before boarding the overnight Rossiya service to Ulaanbaatar. Fitted with soft-cushioned berths, automatic doors and heated toilets, the train rocked me into gentle slumber until I was screamed awake in the pre-dawn darkness by a sadistic <em>provodnitsa</em> (carriage attendant).</p> <p>Often, an unavoidable side effect of long-distance train travel is finding yourself at the mercy of awkward timetables. Faced with the dilemma of spending five days in Mongolia \u2013 which wasn\u2019t enough time to trek across the countryside \u2013 or a measly two nights in the capital Ulaanbaatar before the final leg to Beijing, I opted for the latter, spooning up mutton broth with students at a popular restaurant called Modern Nomads, where the staff wore Genghis Khan outfits and white-collar workers sat around drinking Johnnie Walker and watching bad music videos. The following morning the final train thundered towards China across the Gobi desert, a thirsty, rust-red terrain mottled with tufts of yellowing grass. In the distance sat round nomads\u2019 gers, their funnels piping smoke into the sky, double-humped camels tethered to the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9133603ea88d6ba8625c59438e4e985a09ef57af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9133603ea88d6ba8625c59438e4e985a09ef57af/0_101_6873_4124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beijing street scene with people and motor rickshaw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">End of the line \u2026 Beijing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It had been almost six weeks since I\u2019d glided out of St Pancras, and I was 6,000 miles away, all of which I\u2019d covered by rail. Inching through forests, curving around coasts and burrowing deep into the guts of towns and cities, these slow trains had destroyed my concepts of distance and space, and replaced them with a new truth: that we couldn\u2019t be more close or connected.

      "bodyText": "With the air of melodrama unique to chic French women, the lady opposite me yanked open the overhead window then sat back down, grumbling to no one in particular and fanning herself with a copy of Paris Match. An aroma of pine filtered into the carriage and a breeze cooled my brow as the train clattered south to B\u00e9ziers. Edging up to the window, I looked down to where a curl of sand and green water had appeared, an oasis where children bobbed about in dinghies and leapt off limestone rocks. This was the essence of why I love train travel: it allows me to see what\u2019s behind the trees in the Massif Central; to smell the coconut being fried in huts in Kerala; and to spot rainbows hovering in the spray of Niagara Falls. A week earlier I had set off from London St Pancras to Paris with the aim of travelling around the world in 80 trains. In 2010, I had travelled around India in 80 trains and come away in thrall to the railways \u2013 so much so that I decided to embark on a global railway adventure. For a long time, the rise of high-speed trains and budget airlines appeared to threaten the notion of romantic rail travel. But I wanted to see what slow travel means to people all over the world and what long-distance trains still have to offer the modern-day traveller. Hanging a map on my wall, I pinned cities of interest and tied coloured string from one to the next, watching the next seven months of my life wind around the world with surprising simplicity. With the exception of visas for Russia, China and Vietnam, few logistical issues arose. I bought rail passes for Europe, Japan and America, and booked long-distance journeys such as the Trans-Mongolian and The Canadian, before setting off, sewing in the other trains with ease. Over the first four weeks, Europe\u2019s TGVs, AVEs and Freccia Rossas swept me from city to city, allowing me to lunch on cassoulet in Toulouse and be in Barcelona in time for a dinner of gambas al ajillo. Punctual, quiet and efficient, the air-conditioned trains fulfilled their primary purpose \u2013 taking me from one destination to the next \u2013 but they were devoid of soul. Passengers boarded, stashed their bags and sat in silence, staring at phones and munching paper-wrapped panini. I threaded through Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia before arriving in Moscow to board the Godfather of trains \u2013 the Trans-Mongolian to Beijing. It was here that the journey truly began\u2026 On the morning of departure, sirens wailed and police cordons appeared around Moscow, closing metro stations and blocking access to supermarkets owing to the arrival of Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. This meant I was unable to stockpile anything other than a four-pack of instant noodles, a couple of Kinder Bueno bars and all the biscuits and herbal teabags from my hotel room before embarking on the four-night leg to Irkutsk in Siberia. Once on board, I surveyed my compartment \u2013 complete with cracked window and condom wrapper under the berth \u2013 before wandering up the corridor, glancing into my neighbours\u2019 digs and wincing at the smell of dried omul (a fish found only in Lake Baikal) drifting in a warm fug. Long and thin as though ironed into strips, the yellowing fish was a staple in the makeshift pantries set up by my companions, along with loaves of bread and rounds of cheese wrapped in wet cloth. Breaking into a panic, I followed the tiring sound of Euro-trance and found the disco-dining car, relieved to see a kitchen, even though the chef was lighting a cigarette off the hob while smiling at me. Once the train had jolted out of Moscow, I slid into a red booth and tucked into a slightly faggy-tasting pork escalope draped in dill. As we sped through the bleakness of the suburbs, I was joined by Aleksandr and Aleksandr, both in Adidas vests and sliders, and wondering what on earth I was doing on board. \u201cThis train is trash, I hate it!\u201d declared Aleksandr I, a young lawyer. A lack of roads meant that he was condemned to using the Trans-Mongolian twice a month to attend court hearings 13 hours away in Kirov: one person\u2019s bucket-list adventure is another\u2019s nightmare commute. He said he had never seen an English person on board the train which, it transpired, was a domestic service used by Russians only \u2013 rather than the fancy Rossiya service preferred by tourists. Aleksandr II was visiting his parents, a five-day journey away, and was convinced I was a spy, photographing every page of my diary under the guise of liking my handwriting. In between attempts to read War and Peace, I spent the next four days lying in damp, tangled sheets watching leafless trees flit by the window. Most afternoons I\u2019d play cards with kids or swap tat with soldiers, offering second-class stamps in exchange for a tube of Pringles or a smoke grenade, enjoying the clamour and constant companionship. But at dusk I\u2019d stand alone in the corridor meditating on the mists as they swirled in great halos. Charged by the sight of the world moving at pace before my eyes, I\u2019d still myself, knowing I was privileged to witness how deeply this train carved through the Earth, shining a light into its darkest corners. Like most travellers, I broke up the journey in Irkutsk and spent a day chugging around Lake Baikal on the old Circum-Baikal steam railway before boarding the overnight Rossiya service to Ulaanbaatar. Fitted with soft-cushioned berths, automatic doors and heated toilets, the train rocked me into gentle slumber until I was screamed awake in the pre-dawn darkness by a sadistic provodnitsa (carriage attendant). Often, an unavoidable side effect of long-distance train travel is finding yourself at the mercy of awkward timetables. Faced with the dilemma of spending five days in Mongolia \u2013 which wasn\u2019t enough time to trek across the countryside \u2013 or a measly two nights in the capital Ulaanbaatar before the final leg to Beijing, I opted for the latter, spooning up mutton broth with students at a popular restaurant called Modern Nomads, where the staff wore Genghis Khan outfits and white-collar workers sat around drinking Johnnie Walker and watching bad music videos. The following morning the final train thundered towards China across the Gobi desert, a thirsty, rust-red terrain mottled with tufts of yellowing grass. In the distance sat round nomads\u2019 gers, their funnels piping smoke into the sky, double-humped camels tethered to the ground. It had been almost six weeks since I\u2019d glided out of St Pancras, and I was 6,000 miles away, all of which I\u2019d covered by rail. Inching through forests, curving around coasts and burrowing deep into the guts of towns and cities, these slow trains had destroyed my concepts of distance and space, and replaced them with a new truth: that we couldn\u2019t be more close or connected. From one country to the next, I\u2019d sat at the foot of my berth, my view universal: hawkers sold their wares, lovers held hands, and children played football. I\u2019d watched the skies close in, the ground level out, the seas pull apart and the land unlock. And now, as we sped towards the Chinese capital, billboards closing in, wires swinging low and buildings edging towards the tracks, I felt an undeniable sense of place. Slowing into the station, the train creaked and came to a halt. Through the roar of the crowd, rumbling of cases and muffled announcements, I stepped on to the platform and allowed Beijing to sweep me into its embrace. How to do it The Eurostar from London to Paris starts at \u00a344 one-way. Consider an Interrail pass for travelling across Europe: a seven-days in one month option covering 31 countries costs \u00a3260 adult or \u00a3 216 youth. There is also a weekly train direct from Paris Gare de l\u2019Est to Moscow from \u00a3267 one-way (see seat61.com for details).Booking from Moscow to Beijing takes a bit of planning as each segment needs to be reserved separately; Real Russia\u2019s advisers can help with what can be a daunting exercise, booking each segment, making hotel reservations and organising Russian and Chinese visas.

      "body": "<p>Gay Haines had stowed her mobile phone in her hand baggage before her flight to Barbados and forgot to set it to flight mode. The mistake cost her dear. On arrival, she discovered that she had racked up charges of \u00a31,095, twice the price of the transatlantic fare. \u201cI had not used it to make or receive calls and when I opened it after landing there was no mention of any charges,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Haines is one of dozens of air and sea passengers who have received shock bills after their phones connected automatically to a satellite roaming network. While EU rules cap roaming fees outside Europe at \u20ac50, the legislation does not apply to satellite networks on planes and boats, which charge premium rates for data, wanted or not, unless customers actively switch off data roaming.</p> <p>Some ferry passengers have been hit when their mobiles connected to the onboard system, even when sailing within the European Union, where data charges must not exceed tariffs customers pay at home.</p> <p>Emma Hamilton\u2019s monthly bill from O2 almost doubled after a return ferry trip to Ireland, even though she never left EU waters.</p> <p>\u201cMy phone activated a rest-of-the-world 24-hour pass, apparently an obscure bolt-on that kicks in when you go outside Europe,\u201d she says. \u201cI reminded the call centre that Ireland and the UK are in Europe but was told it applied anyway.\u201d</p> <p>O2 told the <em>Observer</em> that customers should turn off data roaming before boarding ferries to prevent them connecting to onboard satellite services.</p> <p>As pressure grows on airlines and ferry operators to provide internet services, an increasing number of passengers face being caught out \u2013 without even touching their phone \u2013 by premium rates set and billed by their home service provider. These can be over \u00a310 per MB, the amount required to browse one web page. They can kick in if a passenger simply takes a single photo.</p> <p>Extortionate charges can also stack up if a boat or plane passes close to national borders. Mobile phones are configured to pick up the strongest signal and if that happens to come from a country outside the EU, international roaming charges will kick in.</p> <p>Haines\u2019s phone signal was automatically relayed from aircraft antenna via satellite to a ground network operated by AeroMobile. The Crawley-based company, a subsidiary of Panasonic Avionics, began offering inflight services in 2008 and 23 airlines have signed up. Airborne users are not automatically sent text messages by their provider detailing charges. Moreover, cabin crew on the Virgin Atlantic flight made no mention of potential charges if passengers fail to heed advice to switch to flight mode. The airline, which offers the service on half of its fleet, acknowledged that while onboard announcements warn of international roaming charges when using AeroMobile, they do not say that those who don\u2019t use it can also be liable. It declined to state the cut it received from the charges.</p> <p>Haines\u2019s bill was levied by her company\u2019s service provider, Intercity Technology, which sells phones and services to businesses and uses the Vodafone network.</p> <p>Intercity confirmed its inflight service connects automatically, even if the phone is stowed in the overhead locker. It says: \u201cIt\u2019s included in customers\u2019 monthly bill as an over- charge for roaming in a country not covered by their selected tariff.\u201d It insists it alerts customers to unusual charges and, if necessary, suspends data to protect their interests.</p> <p>Haines claims she never received an alert. \u201cThe first I knew about it was when my data was cut off when I arrived at Barbados,\u201d she says. \u201cI assumed there had been fraudulent activity. It was only later that Intercity informed me of the reason.\u201d</p> <p>Intercity has offered to contribute \u00a3500 towards her bill as a goodwill gesture. It also promised to remind all customers to switch to flight mode.</p> <p>AeroMobile says it advises airline clients to announce that roaming charges apply on board. \u201cThe passenger will receive a text from the onboard system telling them they are connected to the mobile service. However, it is their home operator that must communicate the cost.\u201d</p> <p>Intercity didn\u2019t respond to requests for its satellite roaming charges. Vodafone, its network provider, charges up to \u00a37.20 per MB of data for airline connections, compared with \u00a36 by Three. BT\u2019s charge is \u00a39.20. All include this in their data roaming and spend cap, so customers have their data cut off after the bill reaches \u00a335, unless they have asked for it to be lifted. EE requires customers to buy an add-on at \u00a336 a day for 5MB. Virgin Mobile says its customers can\u2019t connect to satellite services.</p> <p>The charges can confuse customer service staff as well as customers. When Ali Hines was billed for downloading \u00a343 of data from a Norwegian network while flying home from Indonesia, she was told by O2 that her phone must have picked up a superior signal over the border. Hines pointed out she was 10,000km from Norway at the time of the download and was then told, like Haines, she had inadvertently connected to AeroMobile.</p> <p>She insists her phone was switched off, whereupon O2 reckoned it must have connected while boarding or leaving the aircraft, although the download was three hours after takeoff. \u201cThey\u2019ve since refunded the charge, but there\u2019s nothing to stop this from happening again,\u201d she says.</p> <p>O2 confirmed the phone had connected to AeroMobile, which uses a Norwegian mast, and that she should have received a text alert. Its satellite roaming charges are \u00a37.50 per MB.</p> <p>\u201cWe are sorry Ms Hines was given incorrect information and have credited \u00a351 to her account,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Gay Haines, who is still left owing \u00a3600, plans to escalate her complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. \u201cI cannot believe I am the only idiot who forgot to turn their phone to flight,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>How to avoid extra charges</h2> <p>\u2022 The EU has banned mobile phone providers charging extra fees for users to use their allowance of minutes, texts or (most) data within EU territory. Take care if you are near a border as phones connect to the strongest signal, which could be in a non-EU country.</p> <p>\u2022 Think twice before turning your data-roaming cap off. Providers have to cut you off when you\u2019ve used \u20ac50 under EU rules, unless you ask them to lift the cap. If you do, you risk unlimited bills.</p> <p>\u2022 In the air or at sea, your mobile could connect to a network in a non-EU country or an onboard satellite system on your ship or a nearby ship, in which case EU rules won\u2019t apply. Switch your device into flight mode to avoid this.</p> <p>\u2022 Complain to a dispute resolution scheme. If you feel you were unfairly charged and can\u2019t resolve the issue with your provider, you can take your complaint to the Communications Ombudsman or adjudicator Cisas.</p>",

The airline, which offers the service on half of its fleet, acknowledged that while onboard announcements warn of international roaming charges when using AeroMobile, they do not say that those who don\u2019t use it can also be liable. It declined to state the cut it received from the charges. Haines\u2019s bill was levied by her company\u2019s service provider, Intercity Technology, which sells phones and services to businesses and uses the Vodafone network. Intercity confirmed its inflight service connects automatically, even if the phone is stowed in the overhead locker. It says: \u201cIt\u2019s included in customers\u2019 monthly bill as an over- charge for roaming in a country not covered by their selected tariff.\u201d It insists it alerts customers to unusual charges and, if necessary, suspends data to protect their interests. Haines claims she never received an alert. \u201cThe first I knew about it was when my data was cut off when I arrived at Barbados,\u201d she says. \u201cI assumed there had been fraudulent activity. It was only later that Intercity informed me of the reason.\u201d Intercity has offered to contribute \u00a3500 towards her bill as a goodwill gesture. It also promised to remind all customers to switch to flight mode. AeroMobile says it advises airline clients to announce that roaming charges apply on board. \u201cThe passenger will receive a text from the onboard system telling them they are connected to the mobile service. However, it is their home operator that must communicate the cost.\u201d Intercity didn\u2019t respond to requests for its satellite roaming charges. Vodafone, its network provider, charges up to \u00a37.20 per MB of data for airline connections, compared with \u00a36 by Three. BT\u2019s charge is \u00a39.20. All include this in their data roaming and spend cap, so customers have their data cut off after the bill reaches \u00a335, unless they have asked for it to be lifted. EE requires customers to buy an add-on at \u00a336 a day for 5MB. Virgin Mobile says its customers can\u2019t connect to satellite services. The charges can confuse customer service staff as well as customers. When Ali Hines was billed for downloading \u00a343 of data from a Norwegian network while flying home from Indonesia, she was told by O2 that her phone must have picked up a superior signal over the border. Hines pointed out she was 10,000km from Norway at the time of the download and was then told, like Haines, she had inadvertently connected to AeroMobile. She insists her phone was switched off, whereupon O2 reckoned it must have connected while boarding or leaving the aircraft, although the download was three hours after takeoff. \u201cThey\u2019ve since refunded the charge, but there\u2019s nothing to stop this from happening again,\u201d she says. O2 confirmed the phone had connected to AeroMobile, which uses a Norwegian mast, and that she should have received a text alert. Its satellite roaming charges are \u00a37.50 per MB. \u201cWe are sorry Ms Hines was given incorrect information and have credited \u00a351 to her account,\u201d it says. Gay Haines, who is still left owing \u00a3600, plans to escalate her complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. \u201cI cannot believe I am the only idiot who forgot to turn their phone to flight,\u201d she said. How to avoid extra charges \u2022 The EU has banned mobile phone providers charging extra fees for users to use their allowance of minutes, texts or (most) data within EU territory. Take care if you are near a border as phones connect to the strongest signal, which could be in a non-EU country. \u2022 Think twice before turning your data-roaming cap off. Providers have to cut you off when you\u2019ve used \u20ac50 under EU rules, unless you ask them to lift the cap. If you do, you risk unlimited bills. \u2022 In the air or at sea, your mobile could connect to a network in a non-EU country or an onboard satellite system on your ship or a nearby ship, in which case EU rules won\u2019t apply. Switch your device into flight mode to avoid this. \u2022 Complain to a dispute resolution scheme. If you feel you were unfairly charged and can\u2019t resolve the issue with your provider, you can take your complaint to the Communications Ombudsman or adjudicator Cisas.",

The game, inevitably, was the top-rated programme of the week but so many people were still there at the end that the post-game show, a mixture of interviews, analysis and prize-giving, was No 2.

Twenty years ago the executives of major bookmaking firms were generally lifers who had started out in the shops.

Which newspaper declared on New Year\u2019s Day 1973 \u2013 when we joined what became the EU \u2013 \u201cEUROPE, HERE WE COME\u201d adding that \u201cfor 10 years\u201d it had \u201ccampaigned for this day\u201d and that \u201cwe have not wavered in our conviction that Britain\u2019s best and brightest future is in Europe\u201d? Yes, you have got it in one: the Daily Mail. Funny old world.",

Last year, the Labour party announced that if it formed a government it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-to-drop-social-mobility-as-labour-goal\" title=\"\">replace the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-to-drop-social-mobility-as-labour-goal\" title=\"\">social </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-to-drop-social-mobility-as-labour-goal\" title=\"\">mobility </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-to-drop-social-mobility-as-labour-goal\" title=\"\">commission</a> with a social justice commission. While a broad spectrum of society believes that social outcomes should not be determined by parental incomes, the fact remains that the most reliable guide to a young person\u2019s economic future is still the level of family wealth. As a consequence there is a perception that social mobility applies only to the bright and gifted.</p> <p>Mohamed is clearly bright and gifted, but his book is concerned not just with people like himself. Although he uses his own story as an illustration of the problems that beset the underprivileged, he argues for the kind of root-and-branch societal reform that will benefit everyone, not just the smartest. It is a thoughtful and nuanced book, packed with relevant data and unafraid to reject fashionable theories. As such, it is a sophisticated read. So what kind of audience did he intend to reach?</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got various audiences that I have most hope for,\u201d he says, offering me some cakes made by a Hungarian neighbour. His voice is mellifluously assured. You could imagine him shining in court. \u201cI really hope that parents and teachers are going to read it. I\u2019m hoping what I\u2019ve gone through and the lessons I\u2019ve learned are going to be useful to people. I hope it will be useful to someone like me when I was 15 or 16 and trying to figure this stuff out.\u201d</p> <p>Mohamed says that he\u2019d have loved to have had such a volume to refer to at that age, when he was full of unanswered questions about the mysterious world beyond his limited social confines in Brent. But any 15- or 16-year-old reading a book of this breadth of analysis and eloquence will have already marked themselves out as exceptional.</p> <p>And that perhaps is the fundamental paradox at the heart of the book. The more Mohamed argues for raising the poor as a whole, the more he appears like a special case himself. That isn\u2019t necessarily a problem \u2013 after all, if he weren\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t have got himself into a position to be listened to. But the effect of his pristine prose is to underline the impression of someone inexorably bound for success.</p> <p>Of course, as he is at pains to clarify, any sense of destiny is an illusion. At so many points of his life, things could have gone in a different direction. Had Somalia not been so unstable, his father would have remained there. Had his father not died in a car crash, Mohamed would almost certainly still be in Kenya today. Had a teacher not intervened here, a mentor there, who knows where he may have ended up?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a lot to savour in Mohamed\u2019s climb, but his real point is that it shouldn\u2019t be unusual</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those major sort of counterfactuals that bothers me to this day,\u201d he says, pouring more tea. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit in the book about when I went back to Kenya 10 years later, and there was a huge part of me thinking: \u2018Gosh, like, if I had stayed here, what would have become of me? What kind of human being would I have grown up to be?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When he was 18, Mohamed gained British citizenship, which meant he could get a passport and travel. So he returned to Nairobi for the first time since he\u2019d buried his father, looking for clues to his identity. He stayed with an uncle who, like his brother (Mohamed\u2019s father), was a natural entrepreneur who had built a thriving business and a large house. His uncle\u2019s multilingual children had attended the best private schools and their lives seemed prepared for them. By contrast, the fatherless Mohamed felt adrift. Yet instead of feeling any resentment, he returned to Britain with renewed inspiration.</p> <p>He realised that the future was there to grasp. No one thought he would do much with his life and that was in a way empowering \u2013 \u201cthe absence of expectation was a liberating force,\u201d he writes. It marked the beginning of his conscious socioeconomic ascent. For those who enjoy a triumph-over-adversity narrative, there is a lot to savour in Mohamed\u2019s climb. But his real point is that it shouldn\u2019t be unusual and the path he took should be much more readily available to many more people from his kind of background.</p> <p>Mohamed is keen to locate that background in as wide a setting as possible, which includes people who suffer from all kinds of inequality \u2013 not just refugees or ethnic minorities, but anyone who feels the system has not been designed to work for them. It lends the book a much more inclusive outlook, as Mohamed always has an eye on what unites rather than divides people. But it also means that the problem of inequality seems monumental. What\u2019s the solution?</p> <p>\u201cIf there were an easy answer we would have found it by now,\u201d Mohamed writes in the introduction to his book. Nonetheless, he goes on to call for a massive social programme of investment in pre-school care, education, social care, housing, youth clubs, and much else besides.</p> <p>Though grateful for the asylum his family was granted in the UK, he is scathing about how, in his eyes, they were abandoned by the authorities. After basic housing and benefits were accounted for, they were left to fend for themselves. And while he calls for support for all those at the bottom of the social ladder, the book is at its most impassioned when arguing for better treatment of people in the position he was in.</p> <p>Given that there is already plenty of festering resentment about migrants in general, I say that it would take a brave politician to call for a vast increase in spending on new arrivals.</p> <p>\u201cI have a simple answer to that,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cIf you are not prepared to front load that support in a financially significant way, don\u2019t bother helping these people. Don\u2019t bother opening your borders up to them. Don\u2019t bother letting them in. Because if you allow us in, but then leave us to fend for ourselves, without the proper infrastructure support and nurturing and understanding of the country that we\u2019re in, the more likely it is that you will fall through the cracks. The more likely it is that you\u2019re not going to end up like me. And the more likely it is that you\u2019re going to end up like my half-brother, who\u2019s been in and out of prison, had lots of issues and has struggled, like many more Somalis who are struggling.\u201d</p> <p>This is almost certainly true. But global politics is a messy business. North-east France is already overflowing with migrants desperate to cross to the UK. What would happen to their numbers if they knew that a radically improved social package awaited them on the other side of the channel? Such unpleasant questions are understandably beyond the remit of Mohamed\u2019s book, but not, presumably, the calculations of politicians operating with an increasingly insular outlook. Mohamed is well aware of changing times.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you saw in Germany, where Angela Merkel made the decision to take over a million refugees, I actually think that that kind of decision without the proper investment to back it up is much more harmful than good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66ea732c93bea48c6a1b081d0284d705b4a08eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ea732c93bea48c6a1b081d0284d705b4a08eed/0_83_3424_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hashi Mohamed, far left, in 1992, aged nine, with his brother and cousins in Nairobi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hashi Mohamed, far left, in 1992, aged nine, with his brother and cousins in Nairobi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Hashi Mohamed</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But proper investment, it seems, is not necessarily enough. Mohamed\u2019s fiancee is a Somali refugee from Sweden who now lives in London. The two of them regularly travel to see her family and therefore he has spent quite a bit of time in Sweden. At one time, he says, refugees could expect comprehensive support in Sweden, but since the spike in asylum seekers, between 2014 and 2016, it has become a harsher climate for new arrivals, and social tensions are growing. In any case, he says, the notion that Sweden was ever some kind of egalitarian utopia is a myth.</p> <p>\u201cThey have spent so much more on their education system, so much on their welfare state, so much on helping those people who are at the bottom rung of society. And yet, when you see the actual mobility \u2013 how much more money are you earning than your parents? How much more professional are you in terms of the job that you\u2019re in? How much more are you accepted by Swedish society? \u2013 they\u2019re not doing that much better than we are.\u201d</p> <p>In which case, I say, however appealing and beneficial a huge expansion in the welfare state might be, it is no guarantee of the kind of social mobility he would like to see. He agrees, but takes a philosophical line on this question.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that if we can find a way of bucking the trend at the earliest possible moment, if we can find a way of plugging the hole based on to whom you are born, and where you are born, in those early stages, what you then go on to do with it later for me is neither here nor there. So in other words, if we can make sure that every single child from birth until about 18 is able to have the most stable, the most consistent, the most educationally nourishing environment, if they get to 18, and they fuck it all up, then fine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb81566900025a0a8a468efc6931873cae2cc41e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb81566900025a0a8a468efc6931873cae2cc41e/0_0_3561_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Trafalgar Square, London, c 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Trafalgar Square, London, c 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Hashi Mohamed</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all his convictions, Mohamed is no ideologue, much less a dogmatic thinker. He acknowledges, for example, that there can be drawbacks to increased state intervention, and one of those might be a failure to develop individual or familial responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we first came, we didn\u2019t have that much help, or there was help available but we didn\u2019t know where to get it. And what is interesting is that actually, as a family unit, we became a bit closer. Because when you feel that there\u2019s this big bad world out there that you don\u2019t understand, the bonds that then get stronger at home are actually quite profound.\u201d</p> <p>None of that alters his belief that, overall, a pronounced increase in state spending on the poor will deliver better results for society at large. At root, though, he is a pragmatist. As he writes in his book: \u201cI have to deal with the world as it is, rather than as it should be.\u201d It is why he speaks as he does, with his establishment vowels \u2013 as he notes, it opens up more doors. And it\u2019s why he has little time for identity politics.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot ignore the suspicion,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat at heart, both identity politics and the kind of structural lack of imagination that keeps people like me from progressing have something in common: they both encourage people to see themselves in terms of a single, disadvantageous aspect of their rich and varied individuality.\u201d</p> <p>There is indeed a point, he says, in employing intersectional social categories to draw attention to the various prejudices and disadvantages that might be restricting people\u2019s options. But he doesn\u2019t believe that it helps if people then define themselves by those categories.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you start referring to yourself as a person of colour, where does that definition of who you are begin and end?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt begins: \u2018Because I\u2019m not white.\u2019 And it ends: \u2018Because I\u2019m not white.\u2019 So the whole essence of who you are has been defined by something of an other, something over there. Now, if that is where your self-identification begins and ends, in my mind, that\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/14/children-hard-work-social-mobility-estate-background\">Telling children 'hard work gets you to the top' is simply a lie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the kind of statement that won\u2019t endear Mohamed to some readers, but he is never less than admirably true to himself, trying to make sense of a complex, fractious world as best he can. His book does not provide all the answers, even to his own story, let alone the many more he seeks to address. But it\u2019s a careful and affecting study of personal struggle, social mobility and international migration that brings a fresh and well-informed voice to the debate.</p> <p>These are issues that aren\u2019t going to go away, and nor, I suspect, is Mohamed. I ask him if he\u2019s thought of going into politics and he says it\u2019s a question he often hears. He lists all the reasons why it doesn\u2019t attract him \u2013 the uncertainty, harassment, the threat to his livelihood, family concerns.</p> <p>\u201cI just can\u2019t see it in the short term,\u201d he says, before adding, just in case, \u201cbut who knows?\u201d</p> <p>Who, indeed. All that can be said with certainty is that, if he did change his mind, it would be far from the most surprising thing to have happened in an already extraordinary life.</p>",

No one thought he would do much with his life and that was in a way empowering \u2013 \u201cthe absence of expectation was a liberating force,\u201d he writes. It marked the beginning of his conscious socioeconomic ascent. For those who enjoy a triumph-over-adversity narrative, there is a lot to savour in Mohamed\u2019s climb. But his real point is that it shouldn\u2019t be unusual and the path he took should be much more readily available to many more people from his kind of background. Mohamed is keen to locate that background in as wide a setting as possible, which includes people who suffer from all kinds of inequality \u2013 not just refugees or ethnic minorities, but anyone who feels the system has not been designed to work for them. It lends the book a much more inclusive outlook, as Mohamed always has an eye on what unites rather than divides people. But it also means that the problem of inequality seems monumental. What\u2019s the solution? \u201cIf there were an easy answer we would have found it by now,\u201d Mohamed writes in the introduction to his book. Nonetheless, he goes on to call for a massive social programme of investment in pre-school care, education, social care, housing, youth clubs, and much else besides. Though grateful for the asylum his family was granted in the UK, he is scathing about how, in his eyes, they were abandoned by the authorities. After basic housing and benefits were accounted for, they were left to fend for themselves. And while he calls for support for all those at the bottom of the social ladder, the book is at its most impassioned when arguing for better treatment of people in the position he was in. Given that there is already plenty of festering resentment about migrants in general, I say that it would take a brave politician to call for a vast increase in spending on new arrivals. \u201cI have a simple answer to that,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cIf you are not prepared to front load that support in a financially significant way, don\u2019t bother helping these people. Don\u2019t bother opening your borders up to them. Don\u2019t bother letting them in. Because if you allow us in, but then leave us to fend for ourselves, without the proper infrastructure support and nurturing and understanding of the country that we\u2019re in, the more likely it is that you will fall through the cracks. The more likely it is that you\u2019re not going to end up like me. And the more likely it is that you\u2019re going to end up like my half-brother, who\u2019s been in and out of prison, had lots of issues and has struggled, like many more Somalis who are struggling.\u201d This is almost certainly true. But global politics is a messy business. North-east France is already overflowing with migrants desperate to cross to the UK. What would happen to their numbers if they knew that a radically improved social package awaited them on the other side of the channel? Such unpleasant questions are understandably beyond the remit of Mohamed\u2019s book, but not, presumably, the calculations of politicians operating with an increasingly insular outlook. Mohamed is well aware of changing times. \u201cWhat you saw in Germany, where Angela Merkel made the decision to take over a million refugees, I actually think that that kind of decision without the proper investment to back it up is much more harmful than good.\u201d But proper investment, it seems, is not necessarily enough. Mohamed\u2019s fiancee is a Somali refugee from Sweden who now lives in London. The two of them regularly travel to see her family and therefore he has spent quite a bit of time in Sweden. At one time, he says, refugees could expect comprehensive support in Sweden, but since the spike in asylum seekers, between 2014 and 2016, it has become a harsher climate for new arrivals, and social tensions are growing. In any case, he says, the notion that Sweden was ever some kind of egalitarian utopia is a myth. \u201cThey have spent so much more on their education system, so much on their welfare state, so much on helping those people who are at the bottom rung of society. And yet, when you see the actual mobility \u2013 how much more money are you earning than your parents? How much more professional are you in terms of the job that you\u2019re in? How much more are you accepted by Swedish society? \u2013 they\u2019re not doing that much better than we are.\u201d In which case, I say, however appealing and beneficial a huge expansion in the welfare state might be, it is no guarantee of the kind of social mobility he would like to see. He agrees, but takes a philosophical line on this question. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that if we can find a way of bucking the trend at the earliest possible moment, if we can find a way of plugging the hole based on to whom you are born, and where you are born, in those early stages, what you then go on to do with it later for me is neither here nor there. So in other words, if we can make sure that every single child from birth until about 18 is able to have the most stable, the most consistent, the most educationally nourishing environment, if they get to 18, and they fuck it all up, then fine.\u201d For all his convictions, Mohamed is no ideologue, much less a dogmatic thinker. He acknowledges, for example, that there can be drawbacks to increased state intervention, and one of those might be a failure to develop individual or familial responsibility. \u201cWhen we first came, we didn\u2019t have that much help, or there was help available but we didn\u2019t know where to get it. And what is interesting is that actually, as a family unit, we became a bit closer. Because when you feel that there\u2019s this big bad world out there that you don\u2019t understand, the bonds that then get stronger at home are actually quite profound.\u201d None of that alters his belief that, overall, a pronounced increase in state spending on the poor will deliver better results for society at large. At root, though, he is a pragmatist. As he writes in his book: \u201cI have to deal with the world as it is, rather than as it should be.\u201d It is why he speaks as he does, with his establishment vowels \u2013 as he notes, it opens up more doors. And it\u2019s why he has little time for identity politics. \u201cI cannot ignore the suspicion,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat at heart, both identity politics and the kind of structural lack of imagination that keeps people like me from progressing have something in common: they both encourage people to see themselves in terms of a single, disadvantageous aspect of their rich and varied individuality.\u201d There is indeed a point, he says, in employing intersectional social categories to draw attention to the various prejudices and disadvantages that might be restricting people\u2019s options. But he doesn\u2019t believe that it helps if people then define themselves by those categories. \u201cWhen you start referring to yourself as a person of colour, where does that definition of who you are begin and end?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt begins: \u2018Because I\u2019m not white.\u2019 And it ends: \u2018Because I\u2019m not white.\u2019 So the whole essence of who you are has been defined by something of an other, something over there. Now, if that is where your self-identification begins and ends, in my mind, that\u2019s not healthy.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of statement that won\u2019t endear Mohamed to some readers, but he is never less than admirably true to himself, trying to make sense of a complex, fractious world as best he can. His book does not provide all the answers, even to his own story, let alone the many more he seeks to address. But it\u2019s a careful and affecting study of personal struggle, social mobility and international migration that brings a fresh and well-informed voice to the debate. These are issues that aren\u2019t going to go away, and nor, I suspect, is Mohamed. I ask him if he\u2019s thought of going into politics and he says it\u2019s a question he often hears. He lists all the reasons why it doesn\u2019t attract him \u2013 the uncertainty, harassment, the threat to his livelihood, family concerns. \u201cI just can\u2019t see it in the short term,\u201d he says, before adding, just in case, \u201cbut who knows?\u201d Who, indeed. All that can be said with certainty is that, if he did change his mind, it would be far from the most surprising thing to have happened in an already extraordinary life.",

A recent find is Skinwork. It\u2019s a teeny, insider\u2019s haunt in the basement of the fashionable Alex Eagle lifestyle store in Soho. When I visited, I hadn\u2019t had a facial for a while \u2013 despite what people think, I don\u2019t spend every second of my life having treatments \u2013 so my skin was dire. It wasn\u2019t responding positively to anything. You can use great products, but the truth is the older you get, unless you have the best genetics in the world, sometimes the only thing that helps is a treatment. Skinwork are interesting as they don\u2019t use myriad products but focus on massage and the skill of the facialist \u2013 great for smoothing fine lines, plumping skin, cleansing and radiance boosting. My favourite element is the anti-bac pore extraction technique that\u2019s like a Hoover for the skin. Results? Magnificent. This was boosted by the chemical self-neutralising peel, added as a final step. I recommend this for anyone with pigmentation issues.

Subtle use of bronzer and highlighter, as seen at Self-Portrait SS20, will help you radiate an illusion of happiness. Avoid any with glittery particles (they stick in your pores), resist a heavy hand (a light dusting will do) and if you go for liquid or cream, mix in your serum for a more natural look. Finish with a pop of lip colour and, who knows, the faux optimism might become real. 1. NARS Tinted Glow Booster \u00a328, narscosmetics.co.uk 2.

A recent find is Skinwork. It\u2019s a teeny, insider\u2019s haunt in the basement of the fashionable Alex Eagle lifestyle store in Soho. When I visited, I hadn\u2019t had a facial for a while \u2013 despite what people think, I don\u2019t spend every second of my life having treatments \u2013 so my skin was dire. It wasn\u2019t responding positively to anything. You can use great products, but the truth is the older you get, unless you have the best genetics in the world, sometimes the only thing that helps is a treatment. Skinwork are interesting as they don\u2019t use myriad products but focus on massage and the skill of the facialist \u2013 great for smoothing fine lines, plumping skin, cleansing and radiance boosting. My favourite element is the anti-bac pore extraction technique that\u2019s like a Hoover for the skin. Results? Magnificent. This was boosted by the chemical self-neutralising peel, added as a final step. I recommend this for anyone with pigmentation issues.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Morrison\u2019s allegiance to the party\u2019s centre-right faction has given him more rhetorical flexibility in his response to climate change than conservative MPs ever allowed his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull.</p> \n<p>But conservatives will become suspicious \u2013 and unruly \u2013 if the man they believe to be one of their own actually wants to back up this latest change in rhetoric with action or substantial policy change.</p> \n<p>On the other flank of the party, there is an emerging view \u2013 from a clutch of at least a dozen MPs \u2013 that climate anxiety can no longer be ignored.

I stopped walking to work, my early morning strolling along the canal. It started messing with my gardening, too \u2013 kneeling can feel crucial for weeding and sowing seed. So here I lie. I postponed the surgery until January when the plot is largely inactive. A good time for a gardener to be inactive, too. I found coping strategies, starting with less heavy digging. I pulled myself up off the ground with a spade. I stand like a scarecrow. And I learned the joy of weeding lying down. There is something intimate about being at the same height as your seedlings. It comes with a tender feeling, close to cuddling in (a vegetable) bed. You are almost stroking the soil with a hand hoe. Picking persistent weeds, sometimes crops, at eye level, gathering a pile behind, it has been a more equal partnership though perhaps best \u2013 or at least easiest \u2013 when it is not too wet. But there is a deeper connection here I feel, too: between me and the soil and seed. Gardening at ground level, alert to minute changes. More giving of myself, offering my services in another way, but with more muddy laundry. My gardening has been less interventionist. With less call for constant change. Our vegetables and flowers have been sometimes left alone. The plot has been given more of a voice. I learned \u2013 I think \u2013 to listen. And I learned to appreciate the lesson.

      "body": "<p><strong>Animus Vinho Verde, Portugal 2018 (\u00a34.79, <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\">Aldi</a>)</strong> Mid-January is a time when most of us are hunkering down and looking to save a few pennies after the splurges of last month. And a question that might emerge as we ponder where to cut our spending while waiting for the fateful pat of the credit card bill on the doormat: is it actually possible to enjoy wine on the cheap anymore? Since February last year, a remarkable 61% of the price of a \u00a35 bottle of wine is made up of duty and VAT (that\u2019s the \u00a32.23 flat duty rate plus 83p in VAT). So when you factor in the costs of packaging and transport (as well as the supplier\u2019s and retailer\u2019s margins, however thin they may be), there can be little wonder that drinking pleasure at this price point has become increasingly hard to come by. Hard, but as Aldi\u2019s perky, citrussy, light Portuguese white proves, not entirely impossible.</p> <p><strong>Waitrose Rich and Intense Italian Red, Puglia, Italy NV (\u00a34.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>) </strong>Although both Aldi and Lidl have been adding (often very good) bottles at higher prices, the German discounters are still more or less synonymous with the cheaper end of the market with which they made their name \u2013 and they are still masters of the unglamorous art of sourcing bottles that are more than merely drinkable while still giving change from a fiver. Quite a lot of change in the case of <a href=\"https://www.lidl.co.uk/en/p/red-wine/cimarosa-south-african-pinotage/p9982\">Lidl\u2019s</a> Cimarosa South Africa Pinotage 2018, a wine that calls for that quaintly euphemistic wine critics\u2019 term gluggable: ie a wine whose simple, juicy qualities are magnified by its absurdly small (\u00a33.99) price tag. The same word can be applied to much of Waitrose\u2019s sub-\u00a35 own-label range, where the wine names take the form of descriptions and, in the case of the dark cherry succulence of the Italian edition, proves that this poshest of supermarkets can do cheap pretty well, too.</p> <p><strong>The Wine Atlas Feteasca Neagra, Romania 2018 (\u00a35.25, <a href=\"https://www.asda.com/\">Asda</a>)</strong> One way of finding a bargain is to look for a country or region where the quality of the wines is out of sync with its reputation \u2013 which is really just a polite way of saying, \u201clook for the unfashionable\u201d. Romania, for example, may not have the cachet of western European regions, but the country\u2019s wine producers have been slowly rebuilding their industry in the past couple of decades, and the best of its production is some of the best value wines around. Certainly, few other regions can make decent, recognisable pinot noir at the sort of prices that Romania manages in wines such as <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose--pinot-noir--romanian--red-wine/806942-278305-278306\">Waitrose</a> Romanian Pinot Noir 2018 (\u00a35.99), which is a charmingly light, soft, summer-berried confection. Just as good is the pair of wines made from native Romanian grape varieties for Asda\u2019s Wine Atlas range: a rounded, peachy white Feteasca Regala 2018 (\u00a35.25) and the spicy, supple Feateasca Neagra red.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Animus Vinho Verde, Portugal 2018 (\u00a34.79, Aldi) Mid-January is a time when most of us are hunkering down and looking to save a few pennies after the splurges of last month. And a question that might emerge as we ponder where to cut our spending while waiting for the fateful pat of the credit card bill on the doormat: is it actually possible to enjoy wine on the cheap anymore? Since February last year, a remarkable 61% of the price of a \u00a35 bottle of wine is made up of duty and VAT (that\u2019s the \u00a32.23 flat duty rate plus 83p in VAT). So when you factor in the costs of packaging and transport (as well as the supplier\u2019s and retailer\u2019s margins, however thin they may be), there can be little wonder that drinking pleasure at this price point has become increasingly hard to come by. Hard, but as Aldi\u2019s perky, citrussy, light Portuguese white proves, not entirely impossible. Waitrose Rich and Intense Italian Red, Puglia, Italy NV (\u00a34.99, Waitrose) Although both Aldi and Lidl have been adding (often very good) bottles at higher prices, the German discounters are still more or less synonymous with the cheaper end of the market with which they made their name \u2013 and they are still masters of the unglamorous art of sourcing bottles that are more than merely drinkable while still giving change from a fiver. Quite a lot of change in the case of Lidl\u2019s Cimarosa South Africa Pinotage 2018, a wine that calls for that quaintly euphemistic wine critics\u2019 term gluggable: ie a wine whose simple, juicy qualities are magnified by its absurdly small (\u00a33.99) price tag. The same word can be applied to much of Waitrose\u2019s sub-\u00a35 own-label range, where the wine names take the form of descriptions and, in the case of the dark cherry succulence of the Italian edition, proves that this poshest of supermarkets can do cheap pretty well, too. The Wine Atlas Feteasca Neagra, Romania 2018 (\u00a35.25, Asda) One way of finding a bargain is to look for a country or region where the quality of the wines is out of sync with its reputation \u2013 which is really just a polite way of saying, \u201clook for the unfashionable\u201d. Romania, for example, may not have the cachet of western European regions, but the country\u2019s wine producers have been slowly rebuilding their industry in the past couple of decades, and the best of its production is some of the best value wines around. Certainly, few other regions can make decent, recognisable pinot noir at the sort of prices that Romania manages in wines such as Waitrose Romanian Pinot Noir 2018 (\u00a35.99), which is a charmingly light, soft, summer-berried confection. Just as good is the pair of wines made from native Romanian grape varieties for Asda\u2019s Wine Atlas range: a rounded, peachy white Feteasca Regala 2018 (\u00a35.25) and the spicy, supple Feateasca Neagra red.

When I looked back through my inbox, I found at least half a dozen frothing email threads initiated by Max over two years. Please, chefs, don\u2019t be like Max. Don\u2019t inundate me with needy messages. Just send me a simple, cleanly written menu, which is short on adjectives and big on intent. Leave it at that.

Shooting living things as a way, say, of compensating for small genitalia is sad. But if you have a problem with game being shot solely for the table, then stop reading now.

Starters \u00a36.95-\u00a38.95, mains \u00a315.95-\u00a324.95, desserts \u00a35.95-\u00a37.95, wines from \u00a318.50 Max Gott always bags his target, at least eventually. For the table, it\u2019s the pheasants, partridge and deer he shoots then serves at his compact bistro on a suburban shopping parade in Newcastle. In this case, it\u2019s also me. When I looked back through my inbox, I found at least half a dozen frothing email threads initiated by Max over two years. Please, chefs, don\u2019t be like Max. Don\u2019t inundate me with needy messages. Just send me a simple, cleanly written menu, which is short on adjectives and big on intent. Leave it at that. Max only got away with sending me all the additional messages because of a certain self-deprecating charm. He kept apologising while also not shutting up, which is a neat trick if you can pull it off. He was trying to do something a little different, he said: serving game he\u2019d shot himself on the hills of Northumberland without banging on about it on the menu, in case that made those people who don\u2019t like to be reminded that meat comes from living things, all frothy and uncomfortable. There was a bit of foraging, too, he said, but he didn\u2019t bang on about that either, because he knew it could be annoying. In his restaurant, he said, it was all about the daily specials. And so, if I ever happened to be passing, might I? Two years on, I have. Some people find the idea of shooting game reprehensible. Where it\u2019s merely for sport I agree. Shooting living things as a way, say, of compensating for small genitalia is sad. But if you have a problem with game being shot solely for the table, then stop reading now.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In New South Wales, there were 123 bush and grass fires going, with 47 yet to be contained.

It now appears we should count among Stephen Graham\u2019s strings to bow, arrows in quiver, the ability to captivate as a rampantly unlikable Welsh flatfoot, every preening inch the poisonously obdurate mid-80s police cliche from which the force still shudders to escape.</p> <p>What might have been an at best incidental sideshow of power play between him and the equally fine Mark Addy, in <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/white-house-farm/2a5719a0001\" title=\"\">White House Farm</a></strong>, threatens to overwhelm the whole six parts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/oct/29/archive-essex-family-murders-trial-1986\" title=\"\">this true-life story</a>. That it doesn\u2019t, that it only complements it, is due to writer Kris Mrksa (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/30/death-in-paradise-the-slap\" title=\"\">The Slap</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/27/requiem-kris-mrksa\" title=\"\">Requiem</a></em>), a thoroughbred cast including Freddie Fox and Gemma Whelan and, frankly, the nerve of ITV drama bosses in insisting on a full six episodes. The temptation of the times is a fast drop for weak attention spans, but they have let this settle and breathe, and somewhere in the clouds there is a Graeco-Roman muse, peeling her grapes and quietly applauding.</p> <p>The temptation is to Wiki how the story unfolded. I beg of you: don\u2019t \u2013 because if you can resist racing to the (still technically ambiguous, or at least contested, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/24/jeremy-bamber-waits-evidence-clear-name-essex-police\" title=\"\">most recently by the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/24/jeremy-bamber-waits-evidence-clear-name-essex-police\" title=\"\">Guardian</a></em>) concluding conviction in the still notorious case of the shootings of Jeremy Bamber\u2019s adoptive family, you will be rewarded and in spades. It\u2019s such a squirrelly tale, lies and jealousies circling and leapfrogging their own tails, and Fox, as young \u2013 ahem \u2013 victim Jeremy, plays a blinder, with just the right mix of vulnerability and sly thwarted entitlement. Oops, bit of a spoiler there.</p> <p>I believe I was getting (briefly) married around that time and it brought it all back \u2013 the woeful decor, the poodle haircuts, the incipient sexism \u2013 but, crucially, the fast-changing mores of that mid-decade, in which the (much compromised) goodness of the 70s was in an indecorous tussle with naked greed. In this capturing of the very spirit of the age, and in much more, it is a haunting triumph.</p> <p>As chance would have it\u2026 you wait ages for a wee fable of an entire extended family being slaughtered in their own beds, and \u2013 two in the same week! <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/deadwater-fell\" title=\"\">Deadwater Fell</a></strong> is of course a fiction, and as such can never have hoped to compete with the sheer wackiness of true-life crime: no writer of fiction would ever dare to cram in the exuberant coincidences, the tiny forgotten niggling spitefulnesses, which lead in many real-life cases to the breakthroughs. Yet I have to say writer Daisy Coulam has done a bang-up job: this so often feels like a recreation of an actual outrage.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf5SBTELzUk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hf5SBTELzUk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf5SBTELzUk\">Watch a trailer for Deadwater Fell.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She\u2019s ably helped by the cast: David Tennant, who was partly behind this production, and Cush Jumbo excel as neighbours in a credibly idyllic west-coast Scottish haven, until the good doctor\u2019s (Tennant) house burns down, with his darling family inside.</p> <p>Utterly intriguing, this four-parter plays with your prejudices until the end. Personally I felt I was clued in early: Tennant has a \u201ccontrolled\u201d beard, ie one allowed to topiarise into a certain neck-length, at which it\u2019s ruthlessly denuded to pale, whereas his best mate, and subsequently best enemy, copper Matthew McNulty, has a hardscrabble film of face-dirt. Who would you trust? Big shout-out by the way to Maureen Beattie: such a wonderful actor, and those young eyes still linger.</p> <p>Gareth Malone in <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000d2db\" title=\"\">The Choir: Aylesbury Prison</a></strong>, seemed to age before our eyes. He lined, and greyed, and suddenly all the best of him came out. Because he is a rather grand improviser, and musician, and human being, he alone perhaps was able to walk into those cells, accompanied by the redoubtable Officer Harrison, who was about nine feet tall, gave a surly grin and an \u201cOK!\u201d circled-fingers sign when any inmate showed hope, and should perhaps get his own show. Mr Malone had to be accompanied everywhere: when prison fights broke out, as they did often and stomping-damagingly, he was just manhandled into the nearest mousehole and locked in.</p> <p>But he emerged, blinking, to attempt to engage with the hundreds of young offenders \u2013 murderers, and the gentler, and the nastier \u2013 and invite them to try to sing. None wanted to: all the young offenders, both black and white, wanted to rap, often about guns and revenge. Yet Malone persevered: rather smartly (and partly through necessity: the wings are acres apart, gang fights break out whenever the wings meet, a drear continuation of postcode battles), he took one-on-one sessions, rather than insisting on a full choir. And encouraged each young man to tell his <em>own</em> story, rather than parrot others\u2019 ideals of vengeance and retribution. These stories featured heavily the words mum, regret, sorry; the phrases \u201cwrong choice\u201d and \u201cone bad step\u201d; the concepts of vicious circles and blind alleys. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3727ab25afad609d5bebdb0ca13e1e7efb455a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3727ab25afad609d5bebdb0ca13e1e7efb455a6/0_143_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Malone in Aylesbury prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Malone took The Choir to Aylesbury prison and \u2018seemed to age before our eyes\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan MAcNamara/BBC/TwentyTwenty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Malone gentled in some chords to allow the best of them to adapt their own lyrics to form something slowly rhythmic, meaningful, punchy: the look of surprise on his face with small successes was little compared to the happy shock on the faces of the boys who realised they\u2019d just <em>created</em> something.</p> <p>The end result wasn\u2019t quite the luvvie triumph some might have dreamed of. No Hollywood sudden-finds there. But a few prisoners \u2013 a terrible small few, who had dared to open their minds \u2013 enjoyed it, punched air, and the tears of one father in the audience, wiping his spectacles, watching his son just <em>being</em>, open to change, open to something more, was heavy affecting. They may have been few, but they were a keen few: and a brave few, going against the hive-brain, the gang-brain.</p> <p>The (incidentally splendid) and eventually tearful governor wants, now, a resident musician, just to encourage, because it\u2019s in her power. Not one of Malone\u2019s outstanding knock-\u2019em-dead triumphs, then, yet I suspect he\u2019ll look back on his deathbed \u2013 fast approaching apparently: he\u2019d wrinkled to Zimmer-age by the end \u2013 as his proudest. As he should. Why are we jailing so many people with mental health problems? Why are we still running scared of tabloid headlines in our 1950s intransigence on drug laws?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccNrWp2NE5A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ccNrWp2NE5A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccNrWp2NE5A\">Watch a trailer for Meat the Family.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/meat-the-family\" title=\"\">Meat the Family</a></strong> was an eventually admirable exercise, if cynical in the commissioning. A bunch of families are invited to live with the sheep, piggies, chickadees for a few weeks before deciding to a) eat them, or b) save them from the slaughterhouse and send them instead to some sunlit dancey uplands to live and frolic safely ever more.</p> <p>The first family ate them, although the kids chose first the chicken that hadn\u2019t been friendly enough.

      "bodyText": "White House Farm (ITV) | ITV Hub Deadwater Fell (Channel 4) | All 4 The Choir: Aylesbury Prison (BBC Two) | iPlayer Meat the Family (Channel 4) | All 4 The talent of some people, lovely though they may be in life, just makes you want to spit with churlishness: enough already, don\u2019t be greedy. It now appears we should count among Stephen Graham\u2019s strings to bow, arrows in quiver, the ability to captivate as a rampantly unlikable Welsh flatfoot, every preening inch the poisonously obdurate mid-80s police cliche from which the force still shudders to escape. What might have been an at best incidental sideshow of power play between him and the equally fine Mark Addy, in White House Farm, threatens to overwhelm the whole six parts of this true-life story. That it doesn\u2019t, that it only complements it, is due to writer Kris Mrksa (The Slap, Requiem), a thoroughbred cast including Freddie Fox and Gemma Whelan and, frankly, the nerve of ITV drama bosses in insisting on a full six episodes. The temptation of the times is a fast drop for weak attention spans, but they have let this settle and breathe, and somewhere in the clouds there is a Graeco-Roman muse, peeling her grapes and quietly applauding. The temptation is to Wiki how the story unfolded. I beg of you: don\u2019t \u2013 because if you can resist racing to the (still technically ambiguous, or at least contested, most recently by the Guardian) concluding conviction in the still notorious case of the shootings of Jeremy Bamber\u2019s adoptive family, you will be rewarded and in spades. It\u2019s such a squirrelly tale, lies and jealousies circling and leapfrogging their own tails, and Fox, as young \u2013 ahem \u2013 victim Jeremy, plays a blinder, with just the right mix of vulnerability and sly thwarted entitlement. Oops, bit of a spoiler there. I believe I was getting (briefly) married around that time and it brought it all back \u2013 the woeful decor, the poodle haircuts, the incipient sexism \u2013 but, crucially, the fast-changing mores of that mid-decade, in which the (much compromised) goodness of the 70s was in an indecorous tussle with naked greed. In this capturing of the very spirit of the age, and in much more, it is a haunting triumph. As chance would have it\u2026 you wait ages for a wee fable of an entire extended family being slaughtered in their own beds, and \u2013 two in the same week! Deadwater Fell is of course a fiction, and as such can never have hoped to compete with the sheer wackiness of true-life crime: no writer of fiction would ever dare to cram in the exuberant coincidences, the tiny forgotten niggling spitefulnesses, which lead in many real-life cases to the breakthroughs. Yet I have to say writer Daisy Coulam has done a bang-up job: this so often feels like a recreation of an actual outrage. She\u2019s ably helped by the cast: David Tennant, who was partly behind this production, and Cush Jumbo excel as neighbours in a credibly idyllic west-coast Scottish haven, until the good doctor\u2019s (Tennant) house burns down, with his darling family inside. Utterly intriguing, this four-parter plays with your prejudices until the end. Personally I felt I was clued in early: Tennant has a \u201ccontrolled\u201d beard, ie one allowed to topiarise into a certain neck-length, at which it\u2019s ruthlessly denuded to pale, whereas his best mate, and subsequently best enemy, copper Matthew McNulty, has a hardscrabble film of face-dirt. Who would you trust? Big shout-out by the way to Maureen Beattie: such a wonderful actor, and those young eyes still linger. Gareth Malone in The Choir: Aylesbury Prison, seemed to age before our eyes. He lined, and greyed, and suddenly all the best of him came out. Because he is a rather grand improviser, and musician, and human being, he alone perhaps was able to walk into those cells, accompanied by the redoubtable Officer Harrison, who was about nine feet tall, gave a surly grin and an \u201cOK!\u201d circled-fingers sign when any inmate showed hope, and should perhaps get his own show. Mr Malone had to be accompanied everywhere: when prison fights broke out, as they did often and stomping-damagingly, he was just manhandled into the nearest mousehole and locked in. But he emerged, blinking, to attempt to engage with the hundreds of young offenders \u2013 murderers, and the gentler, and the nastier \u2013 and invite them to try to sing. None wanted to: all the young offenders, both black and white, wanted to rap, often about guns and revenge. Yet Malone persevered: rather smartly (and partly through necessity: the wings are acres apart, gang fights break out whenever the wings meet, a drear continuation of postcode battles), he took one-on-one sessions, rather than insisting on a full choir. And encouraged each young man to tell his own story, rather than parrot others\u2019 ideals of vengeance and retribution. These stories featured heavily the words mum, regret, sorry; the phrases \u201cwrong choice\u201d and \u201cone bad step\u201d; the concepts of vicious circles and blind alleys. Malone gentled in some chords to allow the best of them to adapt their own lyrics to form something slowly rhythmic, meaningful, punchy: the look of surprise on his face with small successes was little compared to the happy shock on the faces of the boys who realised they\u2019d just created something. The end result wasn\u2019t quite the luvvie triumph some might have dreamed of. No Hollywood sudden-finds there. But a few prisoners \u2013 a terrible small few, who had dared to open their minds \u2013 enjoyed it, punched air, and the tears of one father in the audience, wiping his spectacles, watching his son just being, open to change, open to something more, was heavy affecting. They may have been few, but they were a keen few: and a brave few, going against the hive-brain, the gang-brain. The (incidentally splendid) and eventually tearful governor wants, now, a resident musician, just to encourage, because it\u2019s in her power. Not one of Malone\u2019s outstanding knock-\u2019em-dead triumphs, then, yet I suspect he\u2019ll look back on his deathbed \u2013 fast approaching apparently: he\u2019d wrinkled to Zimmer-age by the end \u2013 as his proudest. As he should. Why are we jailing so many people with mental health problems? Why are we still running scared of tabloid headlines in our 1950s intransigence on drug laws? Meat the Family was an eventually admirable exercise, if cynical in the commissioning. A bunch of families are invited to live with the sheep, piggies, chickadees for a few weeks before deciding to a) eat them, or b) save them from the slaughterhouse and send them instead to some sunlit dancey uplands to live and frolic safely ever more. The first family ate them, although the kids chose first the chicken that hadn\u2019t been friendly enough. There is hope though: a couple of diehard carnivore families, faced with the faces of the sheep or the pigs, might relent \u2013 and this is doing more already for children, and parents, learning about the sheer volumes processed, the lack of sunlight, the whole grim shebang of battery farming, than any number of smug whiny documentaries. Best quote though was from a Dutch organic chicken farmer: \u201cIf we don\u2019t want the mass production, we don\u2019t want to feed the world. So we must stop getting babies.\u201d In this brave new decade, ideas and ideals all up for grabs, when are we going to start talking about that?",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has indicated the government could bolster its carbon emission reduction efforts as he flagged a royal commission into Australia\u2019s horror bushfire season and warned of a \u201cnew normal\u201d that will require a greater role for the commonwealth. Speaking at length about the government\u2019s response to the bushfires which have claimed 28 lives and more than 2,000 homes, the prime minister also acknowledged for the first time that he could have done better in the \u201cstrained\u201d emotional environment on the ground, despite visiting affected communities \u201cin good faith\u201d. \u201cThere are things I could have handled on the ground much better,\u201d Morrison told ABC Insiders\u2019 host David Speers on Sunday. \u201cThese are sensitive, emotional environments [but] prime ministers are flesh and blood too in how they engage with these people. \u201cThey\u2019re very strained environments ... You would do things differently and learn from every event but the important thing is the actions we have taken.\u201d Morrison has been criticised for his interactions in fire-razed communities, including in the town of Cobargo, where he walked away from a young woman demanding more resources for the Rural Fire Service and took the hand of a firefighter who did not want to meet him. On Kangaroo Island he was caught on tape saying there had been \u201cno loss of life\u201d, when two men had been killed after fighting fires on a neighbour\u2019s property. Facing pressure to do more on climate change, Morrison said the government could \u201cevolve\u201d its policies, including emission reduction targets that are pegged to 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2030. While insisting the Coalition was on track to \u201cmeet and beat\u201d the targets, he said the government would look to improve its performance. \u201cIn the years ahead we are going to continue to evolve our policy in this area to reduce emissions even further,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reduce emissions and do the best job we possibly can and get better and better and better at it. I want to do that with a balanced policy which recognises Australia\u2019s broader national economic interests and social interest.\u201d When pressed on whether this could mean a change in the government\u2019s 2030 targets, Morrison said the \u201cchallenging task\u201d required a balanced approach. \u201cIn meeting and beating those targets, we will always be taking up the opportunities of measures that enable us to achieve lower emissions, but lower emissions at the same time as we stay true to the policy I took to the last election,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThere will be new technologies, as there has been since the Kyoto targets were first set, and we will look to embrace those and we will look to take the opportunities that are in front of us to ensure that we don\u2019t just meet these targets but we beat the targets that we have set.\u201d Morrison said the government had the \u201coption\u201d of using carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol and \u201cif they\u2019re needed, it is the government\u2019s policy to use them in the future\u201d. Doubts have been raised about the Australian government\u2019s ability to meet its Paris targets, with the use of carryover credits criticised as an \u201caccounting trick\u201d that may add up to as much as 80% of Australia\u2019s emission reduction achievement. Morrison, who is attempting to balance the political differences in his party room and in electorates held by the Coalition, insisted the government would not be willing to jeopardise jobs or the economy and would not adopt policies that would put up electricity prices or impose a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll reduce our emissions further without a carbon tax, without putting up prices, and without shutting down traditional industries upon which regional Australians depend.\u201d He acknowledged there was an \u201carray\u201d of views within the Coalition about the importance of climate change after commentary from conservative MPs who have downplayed the role of the warming climate in the bushfire season, instead focusing on arson and hazard reduction. The former head of Morrison\u2019s department, Martin Parkinson, has blamed \u201ccivil war\u201d within the Coalition for the government not developing a more ambitious climate policy, warning global efforts were insufficient to halt warming at 2C.

A national inquiry \u2013 most likely a royal commission \u2013 would be established that acknowledged the role of climate change, and he intended to take a proposal to cabinet for endorsement in the coming weeks.

The married father of two from Wonthaggi has been remembered as one of the longest serving, most experienced and fittest firefighters. \u201cThis is a significant loss for the Forest Fire Management Victoria family and the community as a whole,\u201d its chief fire officer, Chris Hardman, said on Sunday morning. Slade was on a taskforce working at the fire\u2019s edge. \u201cAlthough we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can\u2019t be predicted,\u201d Hardman said. \u201cIt would have been a traumatic experience for everybody on that taskforce.\u201d Slade had worked on major fire incidents in the past including the Ash Wednesday bushfires. His 40 years\u2019 service was recognised in a presentation in November. Another Forest Fires Management worker, Mat Kavanagh, 43, died on duty when his vehicle crashed on the Goulburn Valley Highway on 3 January. Hardman said despite the deaths firefighters would continue to be deployed. \u201cWe have to be out there ... It\u2019s a long time before the risks around these fires are over,\u201d he said. Firefighters would be out in the field until late February or March, or possibly longer. \u201cI think we need to be really clear unless we get really significant rains ... 100-150mm of rain \u2013 we\u2019re going to be in this for the long haul,\u201d he said. Emergency Management Victoria Commissioner Andrew Crisp said \u201cbenign conditions\u201d were forecast in coming days, including thunderstorms expected to bring rain. Victoria police and WorkSafe were investigating Slade\u2019s death. Victoria police will prepare a report for the coroner. Two other men, Mick Roberts, from Buchan, and Fred Becker, from Maramingo Creek, were killed in the fires at East Gippsland on New Year\u2019s Day. Meanwhile a third person has been charged over an alleged New South Wales south coast looting in which a fire-damaged electrical goods business in Batemans Bay was robbed twice. NSW police raided two homes on Friday afternoon and seized electrical items. A 38-year-old man was arrested in Tilba Tilba and a 31-year-old woman was arrested in Narooma on Friday evening. On Saturday afternoon a third man, 26, was stopped in Batemans Bay and police allegedly found mobile phones inside his car. They allege the phones were stolen from the electrical goods business. He was arrested, charged with receiving stolen property and refused bail to appear at Batemans Bay local court on Sunday. The 38-year-old man was charged with larceny, entering a building to commit an indictable offence and possessing a prohibited drug. The 31-year-old woman was charged with larceny and entering a building to commit an indictable offence. NSW police deputy commissioner Gary Worboys said hundreds of officers were deployed on the NSW south coast to stamp out looting. \u201cIf people want to steal, if people want to skulk around in the fire grounds and get up to mischief, we have a visible police presence and we have police in plain clothes and we have aircraft in the air that are looking over these grounds,\u201d he said. Firefighters are preparing to use a week of calmer conditions to contain the most volatile parts of bushfires in eastern Victoria and southern NSW. The state of disaster in Victoria lifted at midnight on Saturday after firefighters managed to slow the progress of a 60,000ha fire that threatened the alpine townships of Bright and Harrietville in north-east Victoria on Friday night. Visitors were encouraged to return to Kangaroo Island \u2013 49% of which has burned \u2013 and the south coast of NSW, as firefighters finished conducting property assessments and cleared dangerous trees away from roads. An off-duty volunteer firefighter with the NSW Rural Fire Service was in Sydney\u2019s Concord hospital with serious burns to his legs, elbows and hands on Saturday, after he was burned while protecting his property near Tumbarumba on Friday night. Four other RFS firefighters suffered minor injuries. Three had recovered enough to return to the fireground by midday on Saturday. Authorities in Victoria issued an emergency warning for Mount Buffalo and the Buckland Valley on Saturday afternoon as one spur of the Abbeyard fire, which raced to the top of Mount Buffalo on Friday night, joining with an existing fire and burning its way up one side of the horn, turned north-east and burned down into Goldie Spur. Incident controller Paul Bates, from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, said that fire did not spread as aggressively as predicted on Friday night. \u201cDuring the day we had seven helicopters bombing or dropping water on the fire,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat limited fire runs ... They can\u2019t put the fire out but they can slow it down and buy us time.\u201d The northern flank of the fire was about 10km south of Bright and Harrietville, in upper Buckland Valley near the Demon Ridge Track, as of 8pm on Saturday. \u201cWe are not, in the next seven days, based on the next seven-day forecast, looking for another [heat] spike day,\u201d Bates said. \u201cSo we are hoping to start backburning, if conditions are safe, on Sunday evening.\u201d It was, said the Alpine Valley mayor, Peter Roper, \u201ca delightful day in north-east Victoria\u201d on Saturday \u2013 wildly different to the hot, blustery and smokey conditions on Friday, when smoke obscured visibility down to a few hundred metres. Roper estimated the cost, in lost tourism revenue, of the fires to the alpine shire at $90m. He said although it was relatively safe at the moment, they would not be able to encourage tourists to return until firefighters had more than a week of manageable weather to strengthen containment lines \u2013 meaning they had lost the rest of the summer holidays. \u201cI think we might lose some businesses [because of the bushfires]. That\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said. The Bureau of Meteorology said conditions would remain mild in Victoria for several days but temperatures would increase later in the week, bringing thunderstorms. \u201cWhile the increase in temperature does tend to make fire danger worse, the humidity counteracts that,\u201d a senior meteorologist, Richard Russell, said. Fire conditions in Victoria over the next week would be \u201cnot as bad as we\u2019ve seen recently\u201d but \u201cwe are still right in the middle of summer though\u201d. NSW and South Australia are facing similar outlooks. The wind and temperatures will be enough to cause flare-ups but there is no horror day looming on the seven-day forecast. The number of houses lost in NSW since October has climbed to 1,995, the RFS said, and 20 people \u2013 including three volunteer firefighters \u2013 have died in that state alone.",
