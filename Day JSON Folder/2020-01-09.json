      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland\u2019s political parties have been challenged to return to Stormont and restore powersharing on Friday after a dramatic night of developments in political efforts to resurrect devolution. The UK and Irish governments jointly published a suggested deal late on Thursday and urged the five main parties to sign up and re-enter the region\u2019s institutions. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith wrote to the speaker of the defunct Assembly requesting him to convene a sitting on Friday - so issuing a challenge to the parties to turn up and get back to business. \u201cNow is decision time,\u201d Mr Smith said as he stood in front of Parliament Buildings on Thursday night. \u201cWe have had three years of talks, finally there is good deal on the table that all parties can support and on that basis I have tonight written to the speaker of this Assembly and asked him to recall it tomorrow to enable the restoration of the executive before the weekend. \u201cI urge all parties to come here tomorrow and serve the people of Northern Ireland.\u201d The document shown to the parties on Thursday night contained promises of extra cash for the region and the creation of two \u201clanguage commissioners\u201d as part of a plan to remove barriers that have blocked previous attempts to revive power sharing. The move appeared to have produced a breakthrough following three years of political deadlock. The Democratic Unionist party gave the plan a cautious welcome. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said: \u201cOn balance, we believe there is a basis upon which the [Northern Ireland] assembly and executive can be re-established in a fair and balanced way.\u201d The former first minister added: \u201cThis is not a perfect deal \u2026 there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes. There will always need to be give and take.\u201d Dealing with the most controversial issue that has prevented a return to regional government for the region, ministers from London and Dublin presented an agreement that includes commissioners to protect the Irish language alongside Ulster Scots. Sinn F\u00e9in has called a meeting of its ruling council to deliberate on the proposals. It is understood the Ard Chomhairle (ruling council) will meet in Belfast around lunchtime. The national officer board will meet in the morning and subsequently make a recommendation to the Ard Chomhairle members to either accept or reject the deal. Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said: \u201cWe are studying the text and will give it careful consideration.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s key demand to re-enter coalition with the DUP had been for a stand-alone Irish Language Act which would put Gaelic on an equal par to English. Unionists opposed such a move but, in a bid to address their concerns, the two governments have drawn up plans for \u201can Ulster British Language Commissioner dealing with Ulster Scots language and associated culture and heritage\u201d. The governments also proposed created a new devolved ministry or \u201cOffice for Identity and Cultural Expression\u201d, which they said in their document would \u201cpromote cultural diversity and inclusion across all identities and cultures.\u201d This week marked the third year since devolved power sharing agreement collapsed. Sinn F\u00e9in withdrew from the regional government over the DUP\u2019s role in a controversial, botched green energy scheme that wasted hundreds of millions pounds. Both Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith and the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, used the word \u201cbalance\u201d to describe the range of compromises contained within their document, which the five main parties \u2013 most crucially Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP \u2013 must accept if power sharing is to be restored. The document they showed the parties \u2013 which also included the centrist Alliance party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party \u2013 is titled \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d. Coveney warned the parties that there was \u201cno public patience, for more process and more discussions\u201d. In a joint move to pile pressure on the parties, in particular the DUP, to back the proposed agreement, the governments also dangled the carrot of extra cash for Northern Ireland\u2019s health service and education system if a compromise could be found. There will also be a major reform of the \u201cpetition of concern\u201d, a parliamentary mechanism designed to prevent domination in the regional assembly by one community over another. It allows for a party or parties from one community to veto any legislation which it believes discriminates against their voters. In effect the petition of concern has been used over the last decade by the DUP to veto a majority vote in favour of gay marriage equality in the last assembly before it collapsed in 2017. The key element of the new agreement emphasised that it \u201cwill not be a veto for any one party\u201d. Ulster Unionist party Leader, Steve Aiken, did not reject the agreement. He said his party is \u201ccommitted to a return of devolution that is fair and sustainable\u201d, and if the assembly is recalled on Friday his assembly members \u201cwould attend and consider the business put before them\u201d.\ufeff",

Intelligence sources told the Guardian their assessments suggest two surface-to-air missiles had targeted the Boeing 737-800 passenger jet that crashed in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing all 176 people onboard. Morrison told reporters in Canberra: \u201cAustralia has received similar intelligence to \u2026 Canada and from out of the United States\u2026 all of that intelligence presented to us today does not suggest an intentional act.\u201d Morrison said a full and independent inquiry into the incident was needed, and the black boxes from the plane \u2013 which Iran is currently refusing to release \u2013 should be made available to investigators outside of Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical that a full and transparent investigation is undertaken into this terrible event and that would include undertaking all efforts to ensure we get recovery of the black box recorder that can obviously inform that investigation.\u201d Morrison\u2019s comments follow those of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau who said his country \u201cwill not rest\u201d until it got justice for the loss of Canadian lives. Of the 176 people onboard, 79 were Iranian, 63 were Canadian and 11 were Ukrainian (including nine crew members), along with 10 Swedes, seven Afghans, three Britons and three German nationals. \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cCanadians want answers.

The Iranian missile strikes were retribution for the US assassination, by reaper drone, of Iran\u2019s most powerful general Qassem Soleimani, in an attack at Baghdad airport last week. Australia is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network \u2013 along with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand \u2013 that cooperates on intelligence measures, and so will have seen the same intelligence material its allies have. The black boxes from the flight have been found and secured by Iranian authorities who say they will not share them with US aviation authorities or with the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, but will give Ukrainian investigators access to the investigation. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said there was now a \u201cbody of information\u201d that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. \u201cThis may well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d The US president, Donald Trump, said he had \u201csuspicions\u201d the plane had been accidentally shot down. \u201cSomeone could have made a mistake on the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say it was mechanical, I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s even a question.

Operation Okra comprises a special operations task group, as well as task group Taji, which works to train Iraqi security forces. Taji is based at the Taji military base, about 30km north of Baghdad. The base was not targeted this week, despite early reports it had been. The base did close operations during the week. As Iraq\u2019s security situation has deteriorated dramatically over the past few months, Iraqi interpreters working alongside Australian diggers have raised concerns that they will be targeted by Iranian-backed militias who have publicly threatened Iraqi nationals who support foreign forces. Interpreters have told the Guardian they fear they will be abandoned if Australian troops are forced to leave Iraq, and say they are being practicably prevented from applying for visas.",

It\u2019s just so uncomfortable, he has fury and venom in his eyes. He\u2019s very tortured.\u201d</p> \n<p>It seems unlikely that a group of royal correspondents will get close enough to experience this level of disdain again. On Wednesday night the Duke and Duchess of Sussex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family\">unexpectedly announced their intention</a> to withdraw cooperation with the traditional travelling band of journalists who cover the monarchy for British newspapers, part of a shake-up which will see the couple attempt to take a step back from public life and control their image. And in a statement notable for its sense of grievance, it was the members of the so-called \u201croyal rota\u201d who bore the brunt.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-to-restrict-media-access-in-snub-to-tabloids\">a swipe at the established order</a>, the Sussexes said there was an international \u201cmisconception\u201d that Britain\u2019s royal correspondents were credible sources for information on the work of members of the royal family or on their private lives. In reality, they claimed, these reporters indulged in \u201cfrequent misreporting\u201d, and even accurate stories were rewritten by editors to present false impressions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He has grown increasingly into adulthood irritated with media coverage and had an almost unhealthy obsession with it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI thought this was an inevitable moment but I\u2019m surprised it happened now,\u201d said the former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt, who interviewed Harry on multiple occasions. Hunt said the prince would fixate on negative coverage: \u201cHe always talked about his desire to be normal.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe has grown increasingly into adulthood irritated with media coverage and had an almost unhealthy obsession with it, to the extent he would even read the comments beneath the articles online. He would then take up issues with the correspondents from those papers when he met them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6b5a775b2991ed8c84c6b7771ca36a0e0715e5f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6b5a775b2991ed8c84c6b7771ca36a0e0715e5f/0_0_2514_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Meghan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalists \u2018weren\u2019t invited\u2019 on the Sussexes\u2019 trip to Australia in October 2018, said Prince Harry.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead, the couple intend to take an approach more in common with the image management techniques practiced by modern celebrities, communicating directly with the public through social media and carefully choosing which parts of the media they deal with. Rather than feeling obliged to provide universal access, they will deal with outlets they feel foster \u201cinclusivity, diversity and tolerance\u201d \u2013 singling out the likes of National Geographic rather than the British tabloids.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe current structure makes it challenging for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to personally share moments in their lives directly with members of the public,\u201d the Sussexes said, as part of a complaint about the ability of tabloids to profit from them.</p> \n<p>Hunt said the ability to control media interest was achievable by Hollywood stars, but was more difficult while the Duke remained a royal: \u201cCelebrities do it, but is it deliverable while you remain HRH Prince Harry, son of Diana, and sixth in line to the throne? That\u2019s the challenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harry\u2019s disdain for the media was inevitably shaped by the death of his mother, Princess Diana, killed in a Paris car crash while being chased by paparazzi, when he was just 12 years old. The subsequent public mourning \u2013 which prompted the Daily Mail\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/dec/14/news-photography-dailymail\">infamous declaration</a> that it would never again buy paparazzi images \u2013 permanently tarred his relationship with the press. This only worsened throughout his 20s and early 30s as tabloids bought pictures of him wearing a Nazi uniform and dancing naked in a Las Vegas hotel.</p> \n<p>But by the mid-2010s Harry had managed to turn the media to his advantage, harnessing the attention to focus on his work on the Invictus Games for injured soldiers, and talking frankly about his mental health while going on regular formal visits. Much of this coverage was provided by the royal rota, the group of dedicated royal correspondents for seven national print newspapers who take turns to cover the vast majority of royal visits and share the material they produce across the industry.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey get really quite positive coverage out of it, and we get access that we are thankful and privileged to have,\u201d said one journalist involved in the arrangement, who said other royals often host drinks parties to get to know the individuals who are covering them.</p> \n<p>But any chances of a friendly rapprochement between the press and Harry changed when he began dating Meghan Markle in 2016, raising the potential of a glamorous American actor marrying into the royal family. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\">very first statement</a> issued regarding their relationship confirmed the pair were an item but attacked the \u201cpressure, scrutiny and harassment\u201d she had felt from the press.</p> \n<p>That statement also criticised the \u201cracial undertones of comment pieces\u201d about Meghan \u2013 an apparent reference to comments by Mail on Sunday columnist Rachel Johnson, who had written that if the couple had children, \u201cthe Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11bb69ff83ae5e716b388bd63009c64772ed9442\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11bb69ff83ae5e716b388bd63009c64772ed9442/0_0_3039_1824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The start of married life: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle walk down the steps after their wedding at Windsor Castle in Windsor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The start of married life: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle walk down the steps after their wedding at Windsor Castle in Windsor.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchhall/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>References to Meghan\u2019s race would continue to feature in many of the most controversial pieces about her, but royal correspondents covering the pair said they felt it was the coverage of Meghan\u2019s extended family in the run-up to their May 2018 wedding which caused the relationship with the media to break down beyond repair. The Mail on Sunday in particular regularly featured the thoughts of Meghan\u2019s father Thomas Markle about the future son-in-law he had never met, while Piers Morgan at ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain regularly interviewed Thomas and other distant relatives.</p> \n<p>Matters came to a head on the penultimate day of an otherwise well-received royal tour of southern African countries in October 2019, when it was revealed that Meghan had made the highly unusual move to sue the Mail on Sunday for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\">printing parts of a handwritten letter</a> she had sent to her father.</p> \n<p>Weeks later, it was confirmed that Harry was separately seeking claims against the publishers of the Sun and the Mirror over allegations of historical phone hacking, meaning the couple were targeting three of the biggest newspaper companies \u2013 seemingly confident that they neither feared nor cared about any consequences.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd4ad9fd8b92ab2a880cbcf71c43c65f5ecba635\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd4ad9fd8b92ab2a880cbcf71c43c65f5ecba635/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dancing duke: Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex Royal in Nyanga township, Cape Town, on their first visit to South Africa in September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dancing duke and duchess: Prince Harry and Meghan in Nyanga township, Cape Town, on a seemingly successful royal tour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Journalists on the rota insist they are the wrong target for the couple\u2019s ire, since their articles for print newspapers tend to focus on the straightforward reporting of sanitised official events. Many of the more vicious pieces have been written by columnists and showbiz reporters working for the same titles \u2013 a distinction which matters little to the outside world, but means that the aggressive reporting coverage is unlikely to stop. </p> \n<p>The royals \u2013 and Meghan in particular \u2013 drive enormous online interest from both fans and haters of the couple, with almost any comment or claim about the pair consistently generating more traffic than original reporting on nearly any other topic. There has been a particular spike in interest from US readers, helping British outlets such as MailOnline and the Sun.</p> \n<p>How the Sussexes will now communicate with the public \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/how-harry-and-meghan-may-start-cutting-the-royal-purse-strings\">and seek financial independence</a> \u2013 remains to be seen. An individual from a major social media marketing agency suggested that if the Sussexes wanted to start monetising their official Instagram account with its 10 million followers, they could charge brands upwards of \u00a3250,000 for endorsements.</p> \n<p>But Hunt said the press and the monarchy had traditionally needed each other, and this was a test of whether that still held true: \u201cIt\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. Both parties get something out of it. One party, the royals, have balked at it on many occasions but they obviously see the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. But clearly for Harry and Meghan they don\u2019t feel that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s just so uncomfortable, he has fury and venom in his eyes. He\u2019s very tortured.\u201d It seems unlikely that a group of royal correspondents will get close enough to experience this level of disdain again. On Wednesday night the Duke and Duchess of Sussex unexpectedly announced their intention to withdraw cooperation with the traditional travelling band of journalists who cover the monarchy for British newspapers, part of a shake-up which will see the couple attempt to take a step back from public life and control their image. And in a statement notable for its sense of grievance, it was the members of the so-called \u201croyal rota\u201d who bore the brunt. In a swipe at the established order, the Sussexes said there was an international \u201cmisconception\u201d that Britain\u2019s royal correspondents were credible sources for information on the work of members of the royal family or on their private lives. In reality, they claimed, these reporters indulged in \u201cfrequent misreporting\u201d, and even accurate stories were rewritten by editors to present false impressions. \u201cI thought this was an inevitable moment but I\u2019m surprised it happened now,\u201d said the former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt, who interviewed Harry on multiple occasions. Hunt said the prince would fixate on negative coverage: \u201cHe always talked about his desire to be normal. \u201cHe has grown increasingly into adulthood irritated with media coverage and had an almost unhealthy obsession with it, to the extent he would even read the comments beneath the articles online. He would then take up issues with the correspondents from those papers when he met them.\u201d Instead, the couple intend to take an approach more in common with the image management techniques practiced by modern celebrities, communicating directly with the public through social media and carefully choosing which parts of the media they deal with. Rather than feeling obliged to provide universal access, they will deal with outlets they feel foster \u201cinclusivity, diversity and tolerance\u201d \u2013 singling out the likes of National Geographic rather than the British tabloids. \u201cThe current structure makes it challenging for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to personally share moments in their lives directly with members of the public,\u201d the Sussexes said, as part of a complaint about the ability of tabloids to profit from them. Hunt said the ability to control media interest was achievable by Hollywood stars, but was more difficult while the Duke remained a royal: \u201cCelebrities do it, but is it deliverable while you remain HRH Prince Harry, son of Diana, and sixth in line to the throne? That\u2019s the challenge.\u201d Harry\u2019s disdain for the media was inevitably shaped by the death of his mother, Princess Diana, killed in a Paris car crash while being chased by paparazzi, when he was just 12 years old. The subsequent public mourning \u2013 which prompted the Daily Mail\u2019s infamous declaration that it would never again buy paparazzi images \u2013 permanently tarred his relationship with the press. This only worsened throughout his 20s and early 30s as tabloids bought pictures of him wearing a Nazi uniform and dancing naked in a Las Vegas hotel. But by the mid-2010s Harry had managed to turn the media to his advantage, harnessing the attention to focus on his work on the Invictus Games for injured soldiers, and talking frankly about his mental health while going on regular formal visits. Much of this coverage was provided by the royal rota, the group of dedicated royal correspondents for seven national print newspapers who take turns to cover the vast majority of royal visits and share the material they produce across the industry. \u201cThey get really quite positive coverage out of it, and we get access that we are thankful and privileged to have,\u201d said one journalist involved in the arrangement, who said other royals often host drinks parties to get to know the individuals who are covering them. But any chances of a friendly rapprochement between the press and Harry changed when he began dating Meghan Markle in 2016, raising the potential of a glamorous American actor marrying into the royal family. The very first statement issued regarding their relationship confirmed the pair were an item but attacked the \u201cpressure, scrutiny and harassment\u201d she had felt from the press. That statement also criticised the \u201cracial undertones of comment pieces\u201d about Meghan \u2013 an apparent reference to comments by Mail on Sunday columnist Rachel Johnson, who had written that if the couple had children, \u201cthe Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA\u201d. References to Meghan\u2019s race would continue to feature in many of the most controversial pieces about her, but royal correspondents covering the pair said they felt it was the coverage of Meghan\u2019s extended family in the run-up to their May 2018 wedding which caused the relationship with the media to break down beyond repair. The Mail on Sunday in particular regularly featured the thoughts of Meghan\u2019s father Thomas Markle about the future son-in-law he had never met, while Piers Morgan at ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain regularly interviewed Thomas and other distant relatives. Matters came to a head on the penultimate day of an otherwise well-received royal tour of southern African countries in October 2019, when it was revealed that Meghan had made the highly unusual move to sue the Mail on Sunday for printing parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her father. Weeks later, it was confirmed that Harry was separately seeking claims against the publishers of the Sun and the Mirror over allegations of historical phone hacking, meaning the couple were targeting three of the biggest newspaper companies \u2013 seemingly confident that they neither feared nor cared about any consequences. Journalists on the rota insist they are the wrong target for the couple\u2019s ire, since their articles for print newspapers tend to focus on the straightforward reporting of sanitised official events. Many of the more vicious pieces have been written by columnists and showbiz reporters working for the same titles \u2013 a distinction which matters little to the outside world, but means that the aggressive reporting coverage is unlikely to stop. The royals \u2013 and Meghan in particular \u2013 drive enormous online interest from both fans and haters of the couple, with almost any comment or claim about the pair consistently generating more traffic than original reporting on nearly any other topic. There has been a particular spike in interest from US readers, helping British outlets such as MailOnline and the Sun. How the Sussexes will now communicate with the public \u2013 and seek financial independence \u2013 remains to be seen. An individual from a major social media marketing agency suggested that if the Sussexes wanted to start monetising their official Instagram account with its 10 million followers, they could charge brands upwards of \u00a3250,000 for endorsements. But Hunt said the press and the monarchy had traditionally needed each other, and this was a test of whether that still held true: \u201cIt\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. Both parties get something out of it. One party, the royals, have balked at it on many occasions but they obviously see the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. But clearly for Harry and Meghan they don\u2019t feel that\u2019s the case.\u201d",

The government committed itself in the Conservative election manifesto to reviewing the Gambling Act, drawn up in 2005 under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government. It was this piece of legislation that led, among other things, to a boom in gambling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/15/children-bombarded-with-betting-adverts-during-world-cup\">adverts attached to televised sport</a>.</p> <p>In the chamber on Thursday morning, MPs from all parties demanded that the planned review of the Act be accelerated. With the possible exception of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/02/fobts-row-minister-quit-over-claim-pro-gambling-mp-secured-delay\">reliable gambling advocate Shipley MP Philip Davies</a>, who rose to defend the industry, it\u2019s unlikely that many of them are panting for looser ties on betting firms.</p> <p>New legislation could clip the industry\u2019s wings severely. Late last year a cross-party group of MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/03/call-for-radical-overhaul-of-online-casinos-after-far-reaching-inquiry\">proposed a bevy of reforms</a>, the most eye-catching a \u00a32 limit on online casino-style slot games.</p> <p>That would bring these roulette-style games into line with their real-world cousins, fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which were effectively killed off by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/maximum-stake-for-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-cut-to-2\">same stake restriction</a> imposed in April last year.</p> <p>The day after the Guardian revealed details of the report, investors staged a major sell-off of gambling stocks, chipping \u00a31bn off the value of the UK industry. A few weeks later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/gambling-report-shows-industrys-reliance-on-loss-making-customers\">another Guardian expos\u00e9</a>, this time about the extent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/it-keeps-you-coming-back-the-rise-of-vip-gambling-schemes\">so-called VIP schemes</a>, sent shares tumbling again.</p> <p>In other words, sharp-suited investors in the City \u2013 who are handsomely rewarded to get these things right, at least most of the time \u2013 think the gambling industry could emerge from a regulatory shake-up a lot less profitable than it is now.</p> <p>Viewed through that prism, a grand gesture to waive FA Cup broadcast exclusivity looks like short-term financial pain for long-term reputation and regulatory gain. It\u2019s a shrewd move, co-ordinated through the industry\u2019s new trade body, the Betting &amp; Gaming Council.</p> <p>The organisation, set up last year, has been seeking to heal a schism among the industry\u2019s major players. Some want to come out swinging against advocates of stronger regulation, whereas others believe the industry must move swiftly and comprehensively to prove that enough is being done to address problem gambling.</p> <p>This time, firms with differing opinions have come together to offer a collective olive branch. But there are much bigger fights ahead and that strategic rift could well open again. For now, it should come as no surprise that the betting industry has chosen to keep its powder dry.</p> <p><em>For those concerned about their gambling, or that of a loved one, there is free help and advice available online at <a href=\"https://www.begambleaware.org/\">BeGambleAware.org</a> or by calling the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133.</em></p>",

The reason for their show of magnanimity is that there is far more at stake than a few FA Cup ties. The government committed itself in the Conservative election manifesto to reviewing the Gambling Act, drawn up in 2005 under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government. It was this piece of legislation that led, among other things, to a boom in gambling adverts attached to televised sport. In the chamber on Thursday morning, MPs from all parties demanded that the planned review of the Act be accelerated. With the possible exception of reliable gambling advocate Shipley MP Philip Davies, who rose to defend the industry, it\u2019s unlikely that many of them are panting for looser ties on betting firms. New legislation could clip the industry\u2019s wings severely. Late last year a cross-party group of MPs proposed a bevy of reforms, the most eye-catching a \u00a32 limit on online casino-style slot games. That would bring these roulette-style games into line with their real-world cousins, fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which were effectively killed off by the same stake restriction imposed in April last year. The day after the Guardian revealed details of the report, investors staged a major sell-off of gambling stocks, chipping \u00a31bn off the value of the UK industry. A few weeks later, after another Guardian expos\u00e9, this time about the extent of so-called VIP schemes, sent shares tumbling again. In other words, sharp-suited investors in the City \u2013 who are handsomely rewarded to get these things right, at least most of the time \u2013 think the gambling industry could emerge from a regulatory shake-up a lot less profitable than it is now. Viewed through that prism, a grand gesture to waive FA Cup broadcast exclusivity looks like short-term financial pain for long-term reputation and regulatory gain. It\u2019s a shrewd move, co-ordinated through the industry\u2019s new trade body, the Betting &amp; Gaming Council. The organisation, set up last year, has been seeking to heal a schism among the industry\u2019s major players. Some want to come out swinging against advocates of stronger regulation, whereas others believe the industry must move swiftly and comprehensively to prove that enough is being done to address problem gambling. This time, firms with differing opinions have come together to offer a collective olive branch. But there are much bigger fights ahead and that strategic rift could well open again. For now, it should come as no surprise that the betting industry has chosen to keep its powder dry.

The statement added: \u201cWe do not tolerate assaults on our hard-working officers and will push for the strongest possible punishment. \u201cWe have referred the incident to the police and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d HMP Whitemoor is a 458-capacity maximum security prison housing more than 400 Category A and B prisoners on three wings, including a number of the highest-risk inmates. In a statement, the Met said: \u201cDue to certain circumstances relating to this incident, it was deemed appropriate for the investigation to be carried out by officers from the Met police counter-terrorism command. \u201cHowever, we must stress that at this early stage of the investigation we are keeping an open mind with regards to any motives, and inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident are ongoing.\u201d In February 2019, a small number of prison staff received medical treatment after violence broke out at the prison. Usman Khan, who carried out a terrorist attack in London Bridge on 29 November before being shot dead by police, had previously served a sentence at HMP Whitemoor. In 2015, it emerged that an inmate at Whitemoor was kept in segregation for two and a half years. The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for HMP Whitemoor also revealed that it held seven of the 24 prisoners detained in segregation for more than six months across England\u2019s high-security jails. Inspectors said a staffing \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d meant staff at the segregation unit had been inexperienced and their management had been \u201cpoor\u201d. Prison rules enable a governor to arrange for a prisoner to be segregated \u2013 kept away from other inmates \u2013 for up to 72 hours, before seeking authorisation from the secretary of state. Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, if they are deemed dangerous to other prisoners, or as punishment for disruptive behaviour.",

The prime minister won a vote on the EU withdrawal bill at third reading by 330 votes to 231, a majority of 99. Before the election, MPs had thwarted Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill and threatened to do the same to Johnson\u2019s revised deal. However, the make-up of the new parliament is now strongly pro-Brexit, with Johnson\u2019s sizeable Tory majority. The bill will now go to the House of Lords where peers could give it a more challenging hearing but are still unlikely to block its passage. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman warned the House of Lords, where Johnson does not have a majority, not to frustrate the progress of the legislation. \u201cThe country did deliver a very clear message that they want Brexit to be resolved,\u201d he said. The bill passed without amendment in the Commons in marked contrast to torturous previous efforts of May and Johnson to get Brexit legislation through before the election. Opposition MPs tried to force an amendment committing the government to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after Brexit. The previous government had accepted an amendment from Labour peer Lord Dubs seeking continued protections for child refugees after Brexit but Johnson ditched that commitment after the election. A new Conservative MP used his maiden speech to defend the government\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "A six-month cocaine ban for a young jockey provoked a war of words on Thursday between racing\u2019s ruling body and the Professional Jockeys Association, whose chief executive made an emotionally charged statement accusing the British Horseracing Authority of a last-ditch betrayal, which its officials vigorously denied. \u201cThis is a really dark day for the BHA,\u201d declared Paul Struthers, moments after a panel confirmed that 23-year-old Robbie Downey would have to serve a suspension handed down by French officials, even though Downey insists he has never taken cocaine and could not follow the original proceedings, as he does not understand French. Struthers, together with the solicitor Rory Mac Neice, made an application on Downey\u2019s behalf, asking the BHA not to reciprocate the ban handed down by France-Galop in October. From conversations with officials since then, they believed the BHA was likely to remain neutral and might even be talked into supporting the application. But on Wednesday afternoon came word that, after taking advice from a barrister, the BHA had decided to oppose it.

Some kind of event that disabled the electronics to that system. It takes a lot to disable the electronics on a sophisticated aircraft like the 737-800.\u201d</p> \n<p>OpsGroup, an aviation safety information sharing site set up immediately after MH17 was downed in 2014, warned operators that until further contrary evidence emerged the Ukrainian crash should be treated as a potential \u201cshootdown\u201d.</p> \n<p>The reality, as was pointed out by aviation forums, was that it had happened before, not just in 2014 with MH17 but also in 1988 when the USS Vincennes, an American guided-missile destroyer, shot down an Iranian airliner, killing everyone on board.</p> \n<p>The unverified picture of the seeker head of the Tor-M1 missile seemed to some to be too good to be true, lying on the ground and largely intact, but accounts circulating on social media also included claims that bangs had been heard by residents on the ground before the crash.</p> \n<p>The images of the crash debris were also pored over. While some apparent evidence of fragment damage to the aircraft turned out to be debris from the ground, other images showed ragged holes in one of the engines and scorching to one side of the cockpit, and other parts of the aircraft.</p> \n<p>That seemed inconsistent with a massive accidental fuel leak and fire of the kind that brought down the Air France Concorde at Charles de Gaulle airport in 2000 after a fuel tank was punctured by debris on the runway.</p> \n<p>While US officials would not disclose the intelligence they claim to have that indicates an Iranian missile was to blame, they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communications intercepts and other similar intelligence.</p> \n<p>It is an assessment, however, that starkly contradicts Iran\u2019s own preliminary investigative report, which was released Thursday. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/iran-plane-crash-report-ukraine-boeing-flames-turn-back-radio-call\">claimed the aircraft was trying to turn back</a> for the airport when it went down, a claim greeted with some scepticism due to the lack of communications with the jet making it impossible to judge whether the air crew were actively piloting the plane or whether it simply swung off course as it plunged towards the ground.</p>",

      "bodyText": "To civil aviation professionals, including pilots, engineers and former crash investigators, there was something immediately puzzling about the crash of the Ukraine International Airlines passenger jet that fell burning out of the sky minutes after takeoff from Tehran. Conversation on forums, and in a risk assessment that was rapidly produced by the organisations OpsGroup, pointed to the sudden and catastrophic nature of the event, including the loss of both communications and tracking systems. Fail-safe systems that would have allowed the aircraft to get back safely in the event of engine failure appeared to have been compromised in an instant. Others pointed to what looked like penetrating holes in the airframe, leading some to compare them to the damage suffered by the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 shot down over Ukraine by a Buk surface-to-air missile five years ago. By Thursday morning, there was another piece in the puzzle to contend with: an unverified photograph from the crash site purporting to show the \u201cseeker head\u201d from a Russian-built Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile of the kind used by Iranian air defence units. Hours later those suspicions appeared to become more concrete as US defence and intelligence officials supplied the alleged missing link that many had been waiting for. They disclosed that the US had picked up the signature of an anti-aircraft missile battery locking on to the Ukrainian plane, and then the infrared heat signal of two missile launches followed by that of an explosion on the plane. By Thursday evening that assessment was supported by Canada, where many of the victims came from. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe have intelligence from multiple sources \u2013 including our allies and our own intelligence: the evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.\u201d Shortly after Boris Johnson said there was now a \u201cbody of information\u201d that indicated the Tehran plane crash was caused by an Iranian missile. The statements come amid tensions between the US and Iran following the American assassination of the head of the al-Quds Force in Baghdad and the Iranian retaliation in a missile barrage targeting US forces in Iraq in the hours ahead of the crash. Aviation insiders had already been warning against a rival theory, that the relatively new Boeing 737-800, which had been serviced just two days before, could have suffered a so-called uncontained engine failure, where debris is blown out of a failing engine into the fuselage and damages key systems. In three of these incidents \u2013 two involving Boeing jets owned by Southwest Airlines, and one involving a Qantas Airbus taking off from Singapore in 2010 \u2013 the aircraft landed safety with only one death, thanks to the significant \u201credundancy\u201d, or fail-safe designs, built into modern planes to allow them to land safely after an engine failure. Among those troubled by details of the crash was Larry Vance, a former aviation investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, who told Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper that \u201csimple engine failure\u201d could not explain the crash. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t fit the scenario at all,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we had some kind of event that knocked the transponder off the plane. Some kind of event that disabled the electronics to that system. It takes a lot to disable the electronics on a sophisticated aircraft like the 737-800.\u201d OpsGroup, an aviation safety information sharing site set up immediately after MH17 was downed in 2014, warned operators that until further contrary evidence emerged the Ukrainian crash should be treated as a potential \u201cshootdown\u201d. The reality, as was pointed out by aviation forums, was that it had happened before, not just in 2014 with MH17 but also in 1988 when the USS Vincennes, an American guided-missile destroyer, shot down an Iranian airliner, killing everyone on board. The unverified picture of the seeker head of the Tor-M1 missile seemed to some to be too good to be true, lying on the ground and largely intact, but accounts circulating on social media also included claims that bangs had been heard by residents on the ground before the crash. The images of the crash debris were also pored over. While some apparent evidence of fragment damage to the aircraft turned out to be debris from the ground, other images showed ragged holes in one of the engines and scorching to one side of the cockpit, and other parts of the aircraft. That seemed inconsistent with a massive accidental fuel leak and fire of the kind that brought down the Air France Concorde at Charles de Gaulle airport in 2000 after a fuel tank was punctured by debris on the runway. While US officials would not disclose the intelligence they claim to have that indicates an Iranian missile was to blame, they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communications intercepts and other similar intelligence. It is an assessment, however, that starkly contradicts Iran\u2019s own preliminary investigative report, which was released Thursday. That claimed the aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down, a claim greeted with some scepticism due to the lack of communications with the jet making it impossible to judge whether the air crew were actively piloting the plane or whether it simply swung off course as it plunged towards the ground.",

      "bodyText": "An Iranian missile commander has claimed this week\u2019s strikes aimed US troops at military bases in Iraq were just the start of \u201cbig operations\u201d across the region. The remarks by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) aerospace commander Brig Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who is in charge of missile forces, marked a much more aggressive tone that the official line pursued by Iran\u2019s foreign ministry. The country\u2019s diplomats have insisted that the missile strikes on two bases \u201cconcluded\u201d the Iranian response to the US drone strike killing of top IRGC general, Qassem Suleimani. Hajizadeh suggested they were just the start. \u201cThe missile strikes on one of the United States\u2019 most important bases within the framework of Martyr Suleimani operation were the start of big operations which will continue in the entire region,\u201d the general told reporters in Tehran on Thursday. Hajizadeh gave the press conference in front of the flags of Iran-aligned militia groups including those of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilisation Forces and Yemen\u2019s Houthis, an unusual piece of symbolism of Iran\u2019s reach through regional networks \u2013 networks that Suleimani had established as the head of the Quds force, the elite external wing of the IRGC. Hajizadeh claimed the ballistic missile strikes on the al-Asad and Erbil bases, both Iraqi facilities hosting a US presence, were aimed at damaging the American \u201cmilitary machine\u201d and not inflicting US casualties, though he repeated apparently false Iranian claims that some Americans had been killed. \u201cIf we were looking to kill, we could have designed the operation in a way such that 500 [Americans] would be killed in the first step, and if they had responded, a further 4,000 to 5,000 would be killed in the next steps within 48 hours,\u201d he claimed. According to Jeffrey Lewis, at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, which published satellite images of the missile damage, it was a carefully calibrated attack. \u201cIt was meant to be a proportional legalistic response aimed at a military target,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were trying to avoid casualties. They saw it as a legitimate target, without worrying whether they killed American service personnel.\u201d He added that the Iranians used ballistic missiles, rather than cruise missiles, \u201cbecause they wanted it to be clear where the missiles came from\u201d. In Washington, the House of Representatives passed a war powers resolution, demanding that the administration halt any further US military action against Iran, beyond self-defence, without congressional approval. However, the resolution is non-binding and it looked unlikely that Democrats had won over enough Republicans to win a similar vote in the Senate. Efforts by senior officials to justify the killing of Suleimani in a closed-door congressional briefing on Wednesday backfired when members of Congress complained that the administration was not providing sufficient details about its claim that the drone strike prevented an imminent attack. The Republican senator Mike Lee called it the \u201cprobably the worst briefing I have seen, at least on a military issue, in the nine years I\u2019ve served in the United States Senate\u201d. Lee said the officials would not even answer a hypothetical question on whether the administration would need congressional authority to carry out an assassination of Iran\u2019s supreme leader. \u201cThe fact that there was nothing but a refusal to answer that question was perhaps the most deeply upsetting thing to me in that meeting,\u201d Lee told National Public Radio. In seeking to justify the Suleimani killing, Donald Trump made a new claim on Thursday about the Iranian general\u2019s plans to attack Americans in Iraq. \u201cWe caught a total monster, and we took him out,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey were looking to blow up our embassy.\u201d Asked for more details, Trump said \u201cI think it was obvious,\u201d adding that Suleimani \u201chad more than that particular embassy in mind\u201d. Trump expanded on his suggestion made in his televised address the previous day that Nato could play an expanded role in the Middle East, in place of US troops. On Thursday, he even suggested a name for such a force: Natome. \u201cIf you add the two words Middle East at the end of it,\u201d Trump said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that work beautifully? It\u2019s Nato plus me. \u201cWe can come home, or largely come home and use Nato. This is an international problem,\u201d Trump said.

Top stories The Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed in Tehran on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by Iran, western security officials believe. UK sources told the Guardian they had seen US intelligence that suggests an Iranian anti-aircraft missile was responsible, with US media also reporting that the signature from an Iranian anti-aircraft missile battery had been identified as active shortly before the aircraft crashed, killing all 176 on board. Iran\u2019s aviation authority has confirmed it will give Ukrainian investigators access to the plane\u2019s black boxes. Residents in large areas of Victoria have again been advised to leave their homes, with \u201cextreme\u201d conditions throughout south-eastern Australia prompting concerns that at least two major fires could merge. NSW is also bracing for severe fire conditions, with temperatures forecast to reach more than 40C in large parts of the state, while in South Australia more than 200 firefighters are battling to contain a fire that has burned more than a third of Kangaroo Island. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has extended the state of disaster declaration for 48 hours. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex defied instructions from the Queen in announcing their decision to step back from public life, media have claimed, with Buckingham Palace reportedly \u201cblindsided\u201d and senior family members left \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201churt\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s announcement sparked a ferocious response from tabloid media, with some claiming \u201cMegxit\u201d left Prince Charles and William \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d. Readers have shown themselves more sympathetic, with one stating: \u201cThe British newspapers have unfairly targeted Meghan Markle since the wedding.\u201d Australia A psychiatric panel in Israel has found alleged child sex abuser Malka Leifer fit to stand trial and accused her of faking mental illness to avoid extradition, according to her lawyers. Leifer\u2019s alleged victims immediately welcomed the latest development in the five-year Jerusalem court case, which has strained relations between Israel and Australia. Australians will continue to fly into airspace around Iran that has been blacklisted by US authorities, with Qantas beholden to code-sharing arrangements with Etihad and Emirates for services departing Melbourne and Sydney. A disability pensioner has told a Melbourne court three police officers punched, pepper-sprayed and hosed him like a \u201cdog\u201d, with the trio facing unlawful assault charges. The world A Mexican asylum seeker has taken his own life on a bridge across the Rio Grande after being refused entry to the US, in an incident highlighting the often desperate plights of those being turned away by Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration. Ten new songbird species and subspecies have been identified on a trio of previously under-explored Indonesian islands in the largest discovery of its kind in more than a century, according to a new study. An Interpol red notice has been issued for fugitive businessman Carlos Ghosn, with Japan\u2019s justice minister condemning the former Nissan boss\u2019s dramatic escape to Lebanon. One of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s most provocative loyalists is under fire, with the education minister, Abraham Weintraub \u2013 responsible for the schooling of millions \u2013 being ridiculed for a series of humiliating spelling howlers.

      "body": "<p>Senior royals may have been surprised by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s announcement on Wednesday night \u2013 but the building blocks were laid as long ago as last summer.</p> \n<p>Applications to trademark their brand \u201cSussex Royal\u201d for a range of goods and activities were lodged with UK intellectual property authorities in late June by Natalie Campbell and Sara Latham, key advisers to the couple, before ownership was switched to the royal couple in December.</p> \n<p>The manner of the application \u2013 trademarking goods and services ranging from books, stationery and clothing to promotional and public awareness campaigns \u2013 helped to add a layer of discretion, even if the couple had been expected to launch their foundation this year, and have been using \u201cSussex Royal\u201d on Instagram for months.</p> \n<p>One other, little noticed, development last year was a failed attempt in April to trademark hundreds of items from adhesive bras to energy drinks in the name of \u201cSussex Royal\u201d. The application, which came from Malta in the name of John Burnett, appears to have been an attempt to \u201csquat\u201d on the couple\u2019s name but fell foul of the special protection which \u201cRoyal\u201d has in UK intellectual property law.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt may have made the Sussexes think about the fact that people were trying to squat on their trademarks, and taken a step forward,\u201d said Sally Britton, a partner at Mishcon de Reya and expert on intellectual property law.</p> \n<p>But it was interesting, she added, that registers showed the couple only appeared to have filed in the UK. Anyone expecting a major brand launch might have expected an international filing programme, but that could change at any time.</p> \n<p>In other ways, much of their approach was typical: \u201cFiling a trademark application is recommended so that you can secure monopoly protection and that is what they have done here in the UK. What you are not seeing here is them filing for things like razors or beauty products. It\u2019s quite a tight specification.\u201d</p> \n<p>One potentially interesting flashpoint could come, however, if the Queen refuses to give consent to the use of \u201cRoyal\u201d in future trademark applications by the couple.</p> \n<p>The involvement of Latham, the couple\u2019s communications secretary who worked for the Clintons in the US, and Campbell, who last year became their director of insight and innovation after moving from the role as an aide to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reflects the extent to which women have been central to their project.</p> \n<p>Latham has been dubbed by sections of the press as one of the \u201cwise women\u201d around the couple \u2013 the others being private secretary Fiona Mcilwham, who has two decades of experience at the foreign office, and Heather Wong, their assistant private secretary who has experience of US government and politics.</p> \n<p>But hard-nosed financial counsel will also be needed if they are to replace funding streams such as the \u00a34.9m paid by Prince Charles to his sons from his Duchy of Cornwall estate. Harry\u2019s share accounts for 95% of the couple\u2019s income.</p> \n<p>Other wealth includes his estimated \u00a320m inheritance from his mother, some \u00a37m which came from his great-grandmother, and Meghan\u2019s own past earnings. Her net worth has been put at around \u00a34m, having earned around \u00a337,000 per episode as an actor in the legal drama, Suits.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c2b8a51c-cb3d-41e7-bb79-1d9a091d0c28\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2Q5bXvEgMg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The question of just how much the Sussexes could make \u201cunshackled\u201d from Buckingham Palace is hard to gauge, but one guide is the couple\u2019s wedding. It generated \u00a31bn for the British economy, including a tourist spend of \u00a3300m in travel and accommodation and \u00a350m on merchandise, according to an estimate by the consultancy Brand Finance.</p> \n<p>Two new appointed directors of their foundation in September were Stefan Paul Allesch-Taylor, a financier behind a number of coffee brands, and Steven Cooper, a former banker. </p> \n<p>But it is within Meghan\u2019s professional background on the other side of the Atlantic where the most intriguing possibilities lie. A hint of a potential future direction lies in a corner of the couple\u2019s newly launched website via a link to <a href=\"https://madebyarticle.com/\">MadebyArticle</a>, a digital creative agency in Toronto, where she lived when filming Suits.</p> \n<p>Previously responsible for her old lifestyle brand, <a href=\"http://thetig.com/\">Tig</a>, the Sussexes are listed alongside other clients including menswear label Hypebeast and <a href=\"https://ca.tokyosmoke.com/\">Tokyo Smoke</a> \u2013 a lifestyle cannabis brand \u201chelping Canada celebrate legalisation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Christine Ross, one of the founders of Effervescence Group, a content and consultancy business which has made a fortune out of building up the fashion blog <a href=\"http://www.meghansmirror.com/\">Meghan\u2019s Mirror</a> in parallel with her rise, suggested that possible future ventures that combined commercial opportunities with their charitable projects could include Prince Harry\u2019s Apple TV+ project with Oprah, spotlighting mental health.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cI think that a charitably-based clothing line, perhaps with an emphasis on sustainability \u2026 would be an incredibly popular business venture that the Sussexes could undertake \u2013 similar to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/01/how-meghan-markles-workwear-collection-will-help-women-into-work\">Duchess of Sussex\u2019s \u2018Smart Set\u2019 capsule collection for her patronage, SmartWorks</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>A return to television and film meanwhile is considered much less likely, however coveted she would be by Hollywood moguls.</p> \n<p>\u201cPersonally, I would be amazed if she went back to film,\u201d said Bumble Ward, a veteran publicist-turned-studio executive in Los Angeles.</p>",

The manner of the application \u2013 trademarking goods and services ranging from books, stationery and clothing to promotional and public awareness campaigns \u2013 helped to add a layer of discretion, even if the couple had been expected to launch their foundation this year, and have been using \u201cSussex Royal\u201d on Instagram for months. One other, little noticed, development last year was a failed attempt in April to trademark hundreds of items from adhesive bras to energy drinks in the name of \u201cSussex Royal\u201d. The application, which came from Malta in the name of John Burnett, appears to have been an attempt to \u201csquat\u201d on the couple\u2019s name but fell foul of the special protection which \u201cRoyal\u201d has in UK intellectual property law. \u201cIt may have made the Sussexes think about the fact that people were trying to squat on their trademarks, and taken a step forward,\u201d said Sally Britton, a partner at Mishcon de Reya and expert on intellectual property law. But it was interesting, she added, that registers showed the couple only appeared to have filed in the UK. Anyone expecting a major brand launch might have expected an international filing programme, but that could change at any time. In other ways, much of their approach was typical: \u201cFiling a trademark application is recommended so that you can secure monopoly protection and that is what they have done here in the UK. What you are not seeing here is them filing for things like razors or beauty products. It\u2019s quite a tight specification.\u201d One potentially interesting flashpoint could come, however, if the Queen refuses to give consent to the use of \u201cRoyal\u201d in future trademark applications by the couple. The involvement of Latham, the couple\u2019s communications secretary who worked for the Clintons in the US, and Campbell, who last year became their director of insight and innovation after moving from the role as an aide to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reflects the extent to which women have been central to their project. Latham has been dubbed by sections of the press as one of the \u201cwise women\u201d around the couple \u2013 the others being private secretary Fiona Mcilwham, who has two decades of experience at the foreign office, and Heather Wong, their assistant private secretary who has experience of US government and politics. But hard-nosed financial counsel will also be needed if they are to replace funding streams such as the \u00a34.9m paid by Prince Charles to his sons from his Duchy of Cornwall estate. Harry\u2019s share accounts for 95% of the couple\u2019s income. Other wealth includes his estimated \u00a320m inheritance from his mother, some \u00a37m which came from his great-grandmother, and Meghan\u2019s own past earnings. Her net worth has been put at around \u00a34m, having earned around \u00a337,000 per episode as an actor in the legal drama, Suits. The question of just how much the Sussexes could make \u201cunshackled\u201d from Buckingham Palace is hard to gauge, but one guide is the couple\u2019s wedding. It generated \u00a31bn for the British economy, including a tourist spend of \u00a3300m in travel and accommodation and \u00a350m on merchandise, according to an estimate by the consultancy Brand Finance. Two new appointed directors of their foundation in September were Stefan Paul Allesch-Taylor, a financier behind a number of coffee brands, and Steven Cooper, a former banker. But it is within Meghan\u2019s professional background on the other side of the Atlantic where the most intriguing possibilities lie. A hint of a potential future direction lies in a corner of the couple\u2019s newly launched website via a link to MadebyArticle, a digital creative agency in Toronto, where she lived when filming Suits. Previously responsible for her old lifestyle brand, Tig, the Sussexes are listed alongside other clients including menswear label Hypebeast and Tokyo Smoke \u2013 a lifestyle cannabis brand \u201chelping Canada celebrate legalisation\u201d. Christine Ross, one of the founders of Effervescence Group, a content and consultancy business which has made a fortune out of building up the fashion blog Meghan\u2019s Mirror in parallel with her rise, suggested that possible future ventures that combined commercial opportunities with their charitable projects could include Prince Harry\u2019s Apple TV+ project with Oprah, spotlighting mental health. She added: \u201cI think that a charitably-based clothing line, perhaps with an emphasis on sustainability \u2026 would be an incredibly popular business venture that the Sussexes could undertake \u2013 similar to the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s \u2018Smart Set\u2019 capsule collection for her patronage, SmartWorks.\u201d A return to television and film meanwhile is considered much less likely, however coveted she would be by Hollywood moguls. \u201cPersonally, I would be amazed if she went back to film,\u201d said Bumble Ward, a veteran publicist-turned-studio executive in Los Angeles.",

The tone has been sent out in an array of diplomatic tweets since the assassination of General Qassem Suleimani, but also conveyed personally by the Saudi Arabian deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman. He held meetings this week with Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, in Washington and then in London with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace; Britain\u2019s senior defence adviser for the Middle East, Lt Gen Sir John Lorimer; and the prime minister\u2019s foreign policy adviser, David Quarrey. He also met senior figures in the Foreign Office. The White House, in a break with protocol, only confirmed the meeting with Trump after the Saudi side had tweeted pictures of the meeting. The meetings, and de-escalation message, echoed by other oil-rich Gulf states such asthe United Arab Emirates (UAE), came at the point of maximum concern that the Iran-US standoff could turn into a full-scale conflagration. Analysts said the message from Riyadh would have been that it did not want its territory to be in the frontline of any assault on Iran \u2013 even if it knew it could not avoid involvement if the conflict developed. In the critical days after the assassination of Suleimani, many Iranian commanders warned the Gulf states of the consequences if their territories became a launchpad for strikes on Tehran.

Saudi Arabia\u2019s vulnerability to Iran was exposed in September by the drone and missile attack on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais.

Harry sought a meeting with the monarch as soon as the couple and their son, Archie, returned from their six-week break in Canada. However, the Queen thought such a meeting should only take place once he had discussed the plans in more detail with Charles.</p> \n<p>The couple were urged not to go public about the plans, it is understood.</p> \n<p>Harry had originally contacted his father about spending more time in Canada and America just before Christmas, but was told he needed to come up with a thought-out plan, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-harry-queen-meghan-markle-defied-plans-senior-royals-a4330341.html\">according to royal editor Robert Jobson of the Evening Standard</a>.</p> \n<p>He then sent a draft proposal to Charles early in the New Year, but was informed more time was required to think through the complexities of various issues, including funding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c2b8a51c-cb3d-41e7-bb79-1d9a091d0c28\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2Q5bXvEgMg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/queens-fury-what-the-papers-said-about-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-bombshell\">\u201cdisappointment\u201d among royal family members</a> at the couple\u2019s announcement. Though Charles is understood to share the disappointment at the way the news came out, he is also thought to be resolute that a solution needs to be found swiftly. It is believed there was no rage or fury, but instead a pragmatic sense of \u201clets get this done\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is thought that Harry and Meghan emailed a copy of their statement to both Charles and Prince William around 10 minutes before <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?hl=en\">they released it on Instagram</a>, but with no follow-up phone call or further consultation it is believed their message was not seen in time.</p> \n<p>As the Duchess of Cambridge celebrated her 38th birthday at Kensington Palace on Thursday, and royal aides attended crisis meetings, myriad questions about the implications of the Sussexes\u2019 plans remain unanswered and it was confirmed that Meghan had already returned to Canada.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/prince-harry-meghan-two-most-spoiled-brats-in-history-pundits-provoked-by-royal-rupture\">string of royal commentators criticised the decisio</a>n to step back from the royal family, with some describing it as the biggest surprise since the Panorama interview with Princess Diana, Harry\u2019s mother. Others saw it as a declaration of independence, and the establishment of a separate court \u2013 a rival court \u2013 to the one based at Buckingham Palace.</p> \n<p>Royal author Penny Junor, compared it to Diana announcing she was stepping back from 50 of her charities without consulting anybody. \u201cThe problem is that they are not working for themselves, they are working for a family firm, and to be making announcements of this sort without consulting is beyond bizarre,\u201d Junor said.</p> \n<p>But Meghan received support from her close friend Jessica Mulroney, Canadian stylist and wife of Canadian TV presenter Ben Mulroney, who posted a quote attributed to US singer and filmmaker Gina Carey, saying: \u201cA strong woman looks a challenge in the eye and gives it a wink.\u201d</p> \n<p>As yet there are no indications as to how the couple intend to become financially independent.</p> \n<p>Their <a href=\"https://sussexroyal.com/\">website</a> claims they receive just 5% of their funding for official duties from public money through the sovereign grant, the formula for funding the monarchy. But this does not take into account the high costs of their armed security detail, or their domestic and overseas travel.</p> \n<p>Media often seek to justify criticism of the couple by claiming public interest because they receive public funding. They may hope relinquishing this funding strips away such justification, and grants them greater powers to protect their privacy.</p> \n<p>The remaining 95% of their funding comes from Charles\u2019s private income from the Duchy of Cornwall. They have not made clear if they intend to become financially independent of Charles. On becoming king, Charles will inherit the Duchy of Lancaster, and could continue to fund the Sussexes through that.</p> \n<p>Harry inherited \u00a37m from his late mother\u2019s estate, which will have grown with investment. He and William also inherited her dresses and valuable jewellery. He is also thought to have received money from a trust fund left by the Queen Mother.</p> \n<p>David McClure, author of Royal Legacy, about royal finances, estimated the couple could be worth up to \u00a318m in total. He warned: \u201cThe history of senior royals making money \u2026 is a toxic mix. It hasn\u2019t worked well in the past.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2002, the Earl and Countess of Wessex both stood down from their businesses, in television and PR, after accusations they were cashing in on their royal status. Sophie Wessex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/the-fake-sheikhs-top-scoops-from-sophie-wessex-to-svens-sexploits\">was caught in a \u201cfake sheikh\u201d sting by an undercover journalist</a> trying to bid for business, which led to a major review by the palace of the royals\u2019 commercial interests.</p> \n<p>No light has yet been shed on who will meet the high costs of the couple\u2019s security. The Sussexes\u2019 website states they are classified as \u201cinternationally protected people\u201d, requiring armed security from the Metropolitan police.</p> \n<p>While in the UK, it seems the couple expect their bill to be met by taxpayers. If in Canada, which is a Commonwealth realm, the costs may fall to Canadian taxpayers. Shuttling across the Atlantic would significantly increase the cost of their security detail.</p> \n<p>The entire royal family\u2019s security costs the taxpayer more than \u00a3100m a year.</p> \n<p>In an escalation of their war against British tabloids, Harry and Meghan said they now intend to hand-pick selected journalists to cover their engagements, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-to-restrict-media-access-in-snub-to-tabloids\">will no longer participate in the \u201croyal rota\u201d system, which allowed accredited royal correspondents from UK newspapers access to their events</a>.</p> \n<p>Amid the fallout, wax figures of the couple were removed from the royal set at Madame Tussauds London. Steve Davies, general manager at the attraction, said they would now stand separately.</p>",

Harry sought a meeting with the monarch as soon as the couple and their son, Archie, returned from their six-week break in Canada. However, the Queen thought such a meeting should only take place once he had discussed the plans in more detail with Charles. The couple were urged not to go public about the plans, it is understood. Harry had originally contacted his father about spending more time in Canada and America just before Christmas, but was told he needed to come up with a thought-out plan, according to royal editor Robert Jobson of the Evening Standard. He then sent a draft proposal to Charles early in the New Year, but was informed more time was required to think through the complexities of various issues, including funding. There was \u201cdisappointment\u201d among royal family members at the couple\u2019s announcement. Though Charles is understood to share the disappointment at the way the news came out, he is also thought to be resolute that a solution needs to be found swiftly. It is believed there was no rage or fury, but instead a pragmatic sense of \u201clets get this done\u201d. It is thought that Harry and Meghan emailed a copy of their statement to both Charles and Prince William around 10 minutes before they released it on Instagram, but with no follow-up phone call or further consultation it is believed their message was not seen in time. As the Duchess of Cambridge celebrated her 38th birthday at Kensington Palace on Thursday, and royal aides attended crisis meetings, myriad questions about the implications of the Sussexes\u2019 plans remain unanswered and it was confirmed that Meghan had already returned to Canada. A string of royal commentators criticised the decision to step back from the royal family, with some describing it as the biggest surprise since the Panorama interview with Princess Diana, Harry\u2019s mother. Others saw it as a declaration of independence, and the establishment of a separate court \u2013 a rival court \u2013 to the one based at Buckingham Palace. Royal author Penny Junor, compared it to Diana announcing she was stepping back from 50 of her charities without consulting anybody. \u201cThe problem is that they are not working for themselves, they are working for a family firm, and to be making announcements of this sort without consulting is beyond bizarre,\u201d Junor said. But Meghan received support from her close friend Jessica Mulroney, Canadian stylist and wife of Canadian TV presenter Ben Mulroney, who posted a quote attributed to US singer and filmmaker Gina Carey, saying: \u201cA strong woman looks a challenge in the eye and gives it a wink.\u201d As yet there are no indications as to how the couple intend to become financially independent. Their website claims they receive just 5% of their funding for official duties from public money through the sovereign grant, the formula for funding the monarchy. But this does not take into account the high costs of their armed security detail, or their domestic and overseas travel. Media often seek to justify criticism of the couple by claiming public interest because they receive public funding. They may hope relinquishing this funding strips away such justification, and grants them greater powers to protect their privacy. The remaining 95% of their funding comes from Charles\u2019s private income from the Duchy of Cornwall. They have not made clear if they intend to become financially independent of Charles. On becoming king, Charles will inherit the Duchy of Lancaster, and could continue to fund the Sussexes through that. Harry inherited \u00a37m from his late mother\u2019s estate, which will have grown with investment. He and William also inherited her dresses and valuable jewellery. He is also thought to have received money from a trust fund left by the Queen Mother. David McClure, author of Royal Legacy, about royal finances, estimated the couple could be worth up to \u00a318m in total. He warned: \u201cThe history of senior royals making money \u2026 is a toxic mix. It hasn\u2019t worked well in the past.\u201d In 2002, the Earl and Countess of Wessex both stood down from their businesses, in television and PR, after accusations they were cashing in on their royal status. Sophie Wessex was caught in a \u201cfake sheikh\u201d sting by an undercover journalist trying to bid for business, which led to a major review by the palace of the royals\u2019 commercial interests. No light has yet been shed on who will meet the high costs of the couple\u2019s security. The Sussexes\u2019 website states they are classified as \u201cinternationally protected people\u201d, requiring armed security from the Metropolitan police. While in the UK, it seems the couple expect their bill to be met by taxpayers. If in Canada, which is a Commonwealth realm, the costs may fall to Canadian taxpayers. Shuttling across the Atlantic would significantly increase the cost of their security detail. The entire royal family\u2019s security costs the taxpayer more than \u00a3100m a year. In an escalation of their war against British tabloids, Harry and Meghan said they now intend to hand-pick selected journalists to cover their engagements, and will no longer participate in the \u201croyal rota\u201d system, which allowed accredited royal correspondents from UK newspapers access to their events. Amid the fallout, wax figures of the couple were removed from the royal set at Madame Tussauds London. Steve Davies, general manager at the attraction, said they would now stand separately.",

The man, who was reportedly in his 30s and has not been identified, had attempted to cross from the Mexican city of Reynosa into Pharr, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon. But he was turned back on the international bridge and shortly after 5pm cut his own throat. Footage published by the local El Ma\u00f1ana de Reynosa newspaper showed armed Mexican police sealing off the area where the man\u2019s body had fallen as cars and lorries continued to advance over the bridge. There was no immediate suggestion why the man had decided to take his own life but local authorities said they were investigating. The incident was not the first of its kind. In 2017, a 45-year-old Mexican migrant named Guadalupe Olivas Valencia jumped to his death in Tijuana less than an hour after being \u201crepatriated\u201d from the US. Olivas Valencia had reportedly been working illegally as a gardener in California to support his three children back in Mexico when he was deported. This week\u2019s suicide again cast a light on the bleak conditions facing the growing number of migrants being turned away from the US\u2019s southern border and the dangers facing them back home, in crime-ridden communities in Central America and Mexico. In the past year, more than 57,000 asylum seekers have been pushed back into Mexico as part of a Trump administration scheme called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) project, or Remain in Mexico. Activists claim the initiative is endangering vulnerable asylum seekers by forcing them to wait months for court hearings in some of Mexico\u2019s most dangerous border towns. Last month the advocacy group Human Rights First accused the White House of exposing asylum seekers to \u201clife-threatening dangers\u201d after documenting 636 cases of kidnapping, rape, torture, assault and other violent attacks against those returned to Mexico. Among the victims were a nine-year-old disabled girl and her mother, who were kidnapped and raped after being sent back to Tijuana. The Human Rights First researcher Kennji Kizuka said that with schemes such as Remain in Mexico the Trump administration was moving \u201cto essentially shut down asylum and refugee access to the United States\u201d. \u201cAll these polices are edging us closer and closer to zero refugees or asylum seekers [being] admitted to the US,\u201d Kizuka said. \u201cIt all just grows out of the xenophobia of the administration \u2013 at base that is what it is.\u201d In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

The problem for the Sussexes, said PR guru Mark Borkowski, is the cost of living in North America, even royalist Toronto, coupled with the cost of security \u2013 testing, he says, even for the Beckhams \u2013 requires deep pockets and the couple will have to be highly selective and judicious in their choice of commercial hook-ups.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe foundation they\u2019re setting up has real purpose and they want to be embrace better-world projects so any charity donations or investment has to be clean money,\u201d said Borkowski, mindful of the wave of scandals currently plaguing institutional and foundational gifting.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe type of people who want to launder their image through the royals are exactly the kind of people they need to keep away from. They don\u2019t have a lot of choice so they\u2019ll have to do a lot of commercial deals that might cheapen what they\u2019re trying to do. So it\u2019s difficult water to navigate.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be a force to be reckoned with but it\u2019s a long journey and there\u2019s always another circus coming to town,\u201d Borkowski added.</p> \n<p>Whatever course they choose to follow, he advises, don\u2019t look to the Kardashians and Jenners.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/how-harry-and-meghan-may-start-cutting-the-royal-purse-strings\">How Harry and Meghan may start cutting the royal purse strings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThey may look to them as a great machine, a multinational corporation exploiting celebrity at every turn, but that\u2019s different from acting as a hybrid NGO for good. They\u2019re going to have to sell more than a few mugs and plates to make this thing real.\u201d</p> \n<p>If any of their friends can provide a roadmap, it could be George Clooney who set up and sold a tequila brand for $1bn. Or the Obamas, who recently inked a new deal with Instagram as part of a growing media empire.</p> \n<p>But what kind of life the couple anticipate is open to question. Canada, lying within the commonwealth, might seem a better option than New York, where <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-hypocrites-abdicate-or-stay/\">the New York Post </a>this morning imagined the couple in a tenement apartment.</p> \n<p>\u201cPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are hypocrites \u2013 abdicate or stay!\u201d the paper trumpeted.</p> \n<p>For the Sussexes the issue of employment will be simpler for Meghan to solve than for a husband setting out on a first-job search at age 35.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he can say I\u2019m an expert in human behavior, so the best thing he can do first is support his wife and learn from her,\u201d says Australian celebrity life coach Patrick Wanis. </p> \n<p>Prince Harry, Wanis said, needs to locate his passion. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have great ideas. He needs to think, where can my passion make a difference?

      "bodyText": "Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s surprise decision \u2013 at least to members of the royal family, now said to be \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d\u2013 to split the confines of palace life for North America, most likely Canada, appears to be a more carefully plotted escape than anyone recognized. The couple trademarked more than 100 items including pencils, socks and bookmarks to their Sussex Royal brand more than six months ago, according to the Daily Mail, in a move that could possibly set them up to pursue lucrative business opportunities in a life in the New World. With a new website and cushioned for the road to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d by an estimated \u00a334m ($44m) fortune from the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s TV earnings and an inheritance from the prince\u2019s mother, the couple may be free to pursue book deals, TV deals, public speaking, fashion and brand partnerships after the fashion of celebrity empire builders like the Obamas, Gwyneth Paltrow and the Kardashians. US retail expert Andy Barr told the paper he would expect Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s global product empire to generate revenues of around $500m. \u201cThey are effectively trading on the back of the Royal name which is ironic given they are seemingly trying to escape its clutches,\u201d Barr told MailOnline. Meghan announced last September she was teaming up with fashion designer Misha Nonoo to create a capsule collection of workwear clothes to benefit the UK women\u2019s charity Smart Works, which provides clothing and tools to unemployed women. But fashion is a hard road, and Nonoo\u2019s business empire is still relatively limited. The problem for the Sussexes, said PR guru Mark Borkowski, is the cost of living in North America, even royalist Toronto, coupled with the cost of security \u2013 testing, he says, even for the Beckhams \u2013 requires deep pockets and the couple will have to be highly selective and judicious in their choice of commercial hook-ups. \u201cThe foundation they\u2019re setting up has real purpose and they want to be embrace better-world projects so any charity donations or investment has to be clean money,\u201d said Borkowski, mindful of the wave of scandals currently plaguing institutional and foundational gifting. \u201cThe type of people who want to launder their image through the royals are exactly the kind of people they need to keep away from. They don\u2019t have a lot of choice so they\u2019ll have to do a lot of commercial deals that might cheapen what they\u2019re trying to do. So it\u2019s difficult water to navigate. \u201cThey\u2019ll be a force to be reckoned with but it\u2019s a long journey and there\u2019s always another circus coming to town,\u201d Borkowski added. Whatever course they choose to follow, he advises, don\u2019t look to the Kardashians and Jenners. \u201cThey may look to them as a great machine, a multinational corporation exploiting celebrity at every turn, but that\u2019s different from acting as a hybrid NGO for good. They\u2019re going to have to sell more than a few mugs and plates to make this thing real.\u201d If any of their friends can provide a roadmap, it could be George Clooney who set up and sold a tequila brand for $1bn. Or the Obamas, who recently inked a new deal with Instagram as part of a growing media empire. But what kind of life the couple anticipate is open to question. Canada, lying within the commonwealth, might seem a better option than New York, where the New York Post this morning imagined the couple in a tenement apartment. \u201cPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are hypocrites \u2013 abdicate or stay!\u201d the paper trumpeted. For the Sussexes the issue of employment will be simpler for Meghan to solve than for a husband setting out on a first-job search at age 35. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he can say I\u2019m an expert in human behavior, so the best thing he can do first is support his wife and learn from her,\u201d says Australian celebrity life coach Patrick Wanis. Prince Harry, Wanis said, needs to locate his passion. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have great ideas. He needs to think, where can my passion make a difference? At 35, he\u2019s probably environmentally conscious.\u201d But Wanis, who has clients across the US, offered a strict warning: \u201cDon\u2019t mix up with plasticity of Los Angeles, and stay away from the trappings, the glitter, glam artificiality and emptiness of celebrity style. I wouldn\u2019t be spending my time at this party or that event \u2013 unless he wants to be a philanthropist and show up to every Met gala opening. The lure of the glamorous celebrity lifestyle is actually quite dangerous.\u201d The prince, he said: \u201cNeeds to focus on who am I? What excites me? And how can I make a difference? He can open a door but he needs to think which door do I want to open? He has a fantastic chance to create a legacy that no other Royal has had.\u201d But, he adds: \u201cCan other people see him beyond his title and his power? He has a clean slate, and he needs to communicate his humanness and his passion.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The news that Harry and Meghan are \u201cstepping back\u201d from their roles is to be welcomed (Report, 9 January). However, they will still be trading on their royal titles, so are clearly not willing to give up the accompanying prestige. Meanwhile, their wish to \u201ccarve out a progressive new role within this institution\u201d sounds like an oxymoron. There is nothing progressive about an institution which rewards its members through birth or marriage. The sooner the entire family steps back from our public life altogether, taking the institution with it, the better our country will be for it. Theo Morgan Chair, Labour for a Republic \u2022 Hurray and hurrah! The meanness afforded to Meghan from the established press, and indeed the establishment, has been appalling. It comes as no surprise that if Harry and Meghan as a couple wish to remain sane and to be able to raise a non-dysfunctional family, as well as stay very connected to Meghan\u2019s heritage, this appears to be extremely sensible. More power to them! Catherine Roome Staplehurst, Kent \u2022 How heartening to read about a young couple getting themselves off benefits and aiming for long-term employment. What a fine example to thousands of others! Patricia Baker-Cassidy Oxford \u2022 You gotta laugh, ain\u2019t ya?! Multi-millionaires step back from royal family to \u201cwork to become financially independent\u201d. Sue Morhall Mistley, Essex \u2022 A good start for Prince Harry would be to repay the \u00a32.4m in public money spent on the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage. Maybe give up the titles and be Mr and Mrs Mountbatten-Windsor? Helen Evans Ruthin, Denbighshire \u2022 Meghxit? Philip Mervyn West Kirby, Wirral \u2022 David Jones writes of becoming a monarchist in 1977 in part because he was surrounded by envious Germans (Letters, 7 January). Times must have changed. I know of no one here who would prefer a hereditary monarch to a president. The royals are regarded with sometimes amused bewilderment \u2013 or rather, just as with Brexit, Germans think it must all be some ironic, self-parodying, Monty Pythonish thing that they don\u2019t quite get, you know, what with having no sense of humour. Brian Smith Berlin, Germany \u2022 I too find royal weddings of zero interest (Off heir! Let\u2019s ban televised royal weddings, G2, 7 January). I could say the same about any TV soap, Crufts, Strictly Come Dancing and much besides. While the attractions of such \u201centertainments\u201d is inexplicable to me, I acknowledge that they all have a wide, if diminishing, number of fans and supporters. A royal wedding may represent the last twitchings of an irrelevant institution, but it is not a public execution or live bear-baiting. It is not actively harmful. Let those who derive pleasure from royal weddings be catered for. The last time I checked, watching programmes on TV was voluntary. Malcolm Bowden Poole, Dorset \u2022 Since the BBC and ITV have declined to screen the next royal wedding, can the Guardian also commit to not liveblogging it like they did the last one?

For Ben the individual\u2019s inner relationship with God came first and last: from this source everything else flowed or made sense (including the church). Ben read extraordinarily widely, especially modern English and Irish literature, always somehow absorbing the insights he gained into his inner faith-core.

      "bodyText": "The finding that the outbreak of viral pneumonia in China that has struck 59 people may be caused by a coronavirus, the family of viruses behind Sars, which spread to 37 countries in 2003, causing global panic and killing more than 750 people, means that health authorities will be watching closely. China says the illness is not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), nor Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), both of which are caused by coronaviruses, and so far it appears milder than both. Unlike Sars, it does not appear to spread easily between humans and unlike Mers, which has a mortality rate of about 35%, nobody has died. But the identification in preliminary laboratory tests by the Chinese of a novel coronavirus emerging once more from animals to infect humans is worrying for global health experts. When Sars appeared in China in 2002, it was not swiftly identified and contained. It spread around the world \u2013 particularly to Canada \u2013 via travellers. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome and an expert in tropical diseases, said: \u201cEpidemics of diseases known and unknown are one of our greatest global health threats \u2013 threats that are with us constantly. \u201cA cluster of patients with an unusual respiratory infection is, and should always be, a worry. The level of concern raises again when the illness is linked to an animal food source. This is how new viruses jump across the species barrier \u2013 as was the case with Sars, Mers, avian flu and Ebola.\u201d The source of the virus is not yet known but investigations have centred on a market in Wuhan selling live animals and seafood.

It\u2019s possible to draw some comparisons with the US and UK economies given the very high levels of employment and rising wage growth, but fairly benign inflationary pressures.</p> <p>One key difference is the pace of growth, with the UK economy only managing around 1% last year while the US grew at 2%. This suggests the Bank of England could justify an \u2018insurance\u2019 rate cut due to continued Brexit headwinds which may ease temporarily, but could still turn into a hurricane come December!</p> <p>\u201cEconomic data for January and February will be key in determining whether any other members of the Bank\u2019s MPC join the two who voted to cut rates at the previous two meetings. Unless the economy tips into recession, it seems unlikely that the Bank would opt for a series of rate cuts and/or quantitative easing that would potentially drive Sterling movement lower.

The economy has been sluggish, slack has been growing, and inflation is below target. Much hinges on the speed with which domestic confidence returns.

With the relatively limited space to cut Bank Rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, that\u2019s really more of a question for Carney\u2019s successor, Andrew Bailey, who takes over on March 16.</p> <p>But obviously Carney knows which way the BoE is leaning today... so his comments have knocked more than half a cent off the pound.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap Stocks on Wall Street have hit a fresh record high today, on signs that the US and Iran are de-escalating their conflict. Tech stocks are having another strong day, with consumer goods makers, banks, and industrial groups also doing well. Donald Trump has applauded the rally, saying it is good for Americans\u2019 401k pension pots. European markets also rallied, with Germany\u2019s DAX ending the day at a two-year high. The pound has weakened, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggested UK interest rates could soon be cut if the economy doesn\u2019t pick up speed. Sterling hit a two-week low around $1.303. John Lewis has announced the shock departure of a senior executive, and revealed that profits have shrunk after disappointing Christmas trading at its department stores. Its staff bonus could be cancelled this year, a blow to around 80,000 staff. Marks &amp; Spencer is another Christmas loser, after suffering weak clothing sales. The high street chain overstocked on skinny jeans and also bought too many mince pies Airline veteran Willie Walsh is retiring, after a long stint running British Airways and IAG Tech retailer Dixons Carphone is considering an appeal after being fined \u00a3500,000 for a serious data breach that affected 14 million customers Goodnight! GW The Carlos Ghosn saga has taken another twist, a day after the business chief-turned-fugitive lashed out at Japan over the fraud case brought against him. A Lebanese judge has banned Ghosn from leaving Lebanon, after holding a meeting with the former Nissan chief to discuss Interpol\u2019s \u2018red notice\u2019, and his trips to Israel in the past (which Lebanon\u2019s citizens aren\u2019t allowed to do). Japanese officials have also hit back at Ghosn, who yesterday claimed he had been extremely unfairly treated since his arrest on financial misconduct charges 14 months ago. Masako Mori, Japan\u2019s justice minister, accused Ghosn of making \u201cabstract, unclear or baseless assertions\u201d about the Japanese criminal justice system, and said his mysterious escape late last month was unjustified. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has closed higher too, up 23 points or 0.3% at 7598. Retail stocks had a bad day, though, with online grocer Ocado down 4.3%, Kingfisher losing 2.9% and Next dropping by 1.5%. Marks &amp; Spencer (which recently fell out of the FTSE 250) have slumped by 11% today after their disappointing Christmas results. Back in the markets, Germany\u2019s DAX index has closed at a two-year high as investor optimism sweeps shares higher. Oof! The Information Commissioner says that 14 million customers were affected by the security breach at Dixons, even more than we thought. The ICO also says that thousands of Dixons tills were hacked, and it took nine months before the company realised. They say: An ICO investigation found that an attacker installed malware on 5,390 tills at DSG\u2019s Currys PC World and Dixons Travel stores between July 2017 and April 2018, collecting personal data during the nine month period before the attack was detected. The company\u2019s failure to secure the system allowed unauthorised access to 5.6 million payment card details used in transactions and the personal information of approximately 14 million people, including full names, postcodes, email addresses and failed credit checks from internal servers. That\u2019s why the ICO has imposed the maximum penalty allowed: Back in the UK, consumer electronics firm Dixons Carphone has been fined \u00a3500,000 for a data breach. This is the maximum penalty allowed under the Data Protection Act (since superseded by the GDPR which allows much higher penalties). The breach occurred in 2018, and affected up to 10m customers. Dixons CEO Alex Baldock says they\u2019re very sorry about the incident, and also disappointed by the ICOs decision -- which the firm could challenge. He says: \u201cWe are very sorry for any inconvenience this historic incident caused to our customers. When we found the unauthorised access to data, we promptly launched an investigation, added extra security measures and contained the incident. We duly notified regulators and the police and communicated with all our customers. We have no confirmed evidence of any customers suffering fraud or financial loss as a result. We have upgraded our detection and response capabilities and, as the ICO acknowledges, we have made significant investment in our Information Security systems and processes. We are disappointed in some of the ICO\u2019s key findings which we have previously challenged and continue to dispute. We\u2019re studying their conclusions in detail and considering our grounds for appeal.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of how strongly the biggest US tech firms have rallied: Never wrong for long, eh Donald? The president has now deleted his tweet about the markets, and replaced it with a new one with 401k spelled correctly. I guess we\u2019ll never know what a 409k was... Broker-dealer LPL Financial says stocks are rallying on hopes of a de-escalation in the US-Iran crisis. The prospect of China and the US signing a preliminary trade deal next week are also helping, they write: Market participants remain squarely focused on the Mideast this morning. Consensus seems to be landing on de-escalation, based on the latest developments and statements from the country\u2019s leaders, buoying investor sentiment. That stance is supported by falling WTI crude oil and gold prices on Wednesday. Though expected, we received confirmation that high-level Chinese trade representatives will sign the phase-one trade agreement on January 15, reportedly at the White House. Nearly every sector on the broader S&amp;P 500 index is also up today, lifting the index to a record high. Energy is the only laggard, as oil prices retreat in the face of easing Middle East tensions (for the moment, anyway...). President Trump has hailed the stock market\u2019s performance, suggesting US savers should be feeling a lot richer. The Dow Jones industrial average is now up around 60% since Trump won the presidential election in November 2016. That\u2019s partly due to his tax cuts and moves to encourage US companies to repatriate profits held abroad. But in his enthusiasm, Trump may have mistyped -- Americans use a 401(k) to save for their retirement, of course. Wall Street is on track to post its fifth day of gains this year, out of six trading sessions. That could be a sign that 2020 is going to be a decent 12 months for investors, although its obviously still early days. Financial companies, consumer stocks and industrial groups are all also rallying today, although tech is the best performer. Apple is leading the risers on the Dow, up 1.7% at $308 per share. That\u2019s a new record high, and more than double its value in the last year! Traders are piling in, after Apple announced record App Store sales over Christmas. Boom! Wall Street has romped to yet another record high, on hopes that the US and Iran have calmed the risk of military conflict. The S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have all scaled new peaks. Here\u2019s the situation: Dow: up 120 points or 0.4% at 28,865 S&amp;P 500: up 15 points or 0.5% at 3,268 Nasdaq: up 72 points or 0.8% at 9,202 points Technology stocks are driving higher, a sign that traders are less worried about global conflict and trade wars, and more optimistic about growth prospects this year. This follows confirmation that no-one was killed by the missiles fired by Iran at US bases in Iraq early yesterday morning. With Donald Trump claiming yesterday that Iran was \u201cstanding down\u201d, investors are hoping that both sides are trying to de-escalate the situation. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, has said earlier today that Tehran\u2019s missile strikes on bases in Iraq were intended to damage the US\u2019 military machine and not kill troops. He added that Iran wants to drive American troops out of the Middle East, as an \u201cappropriate revenge\u201d for the US killing of Major General Qassem Soleimani. Two major US retail chains have also struggled over the festive period. Kohl\u2019s, America\u2019s largest department chain, has reported a 0.2% drop in sales in November and December -- a crucial time for the sector, with Black Friday followed by Christmas. It blames weak sales of women\u2019s clothing. Earnings are now expected to hit the bottom of its previous guidance. Rival department store chain JC Penney did even worse, with a 7.5% plunge in sales over the last nine weeks. My colleague Zoe Wood has dug deeper into Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Christmas blues, and discovered that it even botched its mince pie orders, so badly that profitability will be be lowed than hoped. That\u2019s on top of its bungled move into skinny men\u2019s jeans (see earlier). Zoe explains: By comparison, sales in its food halls were up 1.4% as shoppers responded to new ranges and lower prices. Sales rose 4% over the all-important holiday fortnight but the retailer bought too much of seasonal lines such as mince pies, leading to waste \u2013 although surplus stock was diverted to local charities, including food banks, via its partnership with the Neighbourly app. The waste generated by the food business had affected the retailer\u2019s profit margins, which it said would now be at the bottom end of analysts\u2019 expectations. M&amp;S shares, which were relegated from the FTSE 100 index last year, tumbled almost 10% to 198p on Thursday morning. Mark Carney has also produced two charts today, which show how the UK economy has fared since the EU referendum. This one shows how growth fell below potential last year, as part of a wider global slowdown. This one shows how inflation climbed steadily after the pound\u2019s 2016 slump, eroding real wages... just as growth began to lag behind the rest of Europe. Andy Scott, associate director at financial consultant JCRA, says any interest rate cuts in 2010 could be driven by Brexit fears. Here\u2019s his take on Mark Carney\u2019s speech this morning: \u201cWe saw in the US last year that the Federal Reserve opted for \u2018insurance\u2019 rate cuts due to the headwinds created by the trade war with China. It\u2019s possible to draw some comparisons with the US and UK economies given the very high levels of employment and rising wage growth, but fairly benign inflationary pressures. One key difference is the pace of growth, with the UK economy only managing around 1% last year while the US grew at 2%. This suggests the Bank of England could justify an \u2018insurance\u2019 rate cut due to continued Brexit headwinds which may ease temporarily, but could still turn into a hurricane come December! \u201cEconomic data for January and February will be key in determining whether any other members of the Bank\u2019s MPC join the two who voted to cut rates at the previous two meetings. Unless the economy tips into recession, it seems unlikely that the Bank would opt for a series of rate cuts and/or quantitative easing that would potentially drive Sterling movement lower. Instead, we expect Brexit - specifically the trade negotiations - to continue to be the primary influence on the currency\u2019s movement in 2020, which suggests we could be in for another volatile year!\u201d Breaking: 350 steelmaking jobs are being cut in South Yorkshire and South Wales, in a new year blow to the industry Liberty Steel announced the redundancies this morning, blaming \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d. It includes 72 jobs lost at a steelworks in Newport, Wales. Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary of the steelworkers\u2019 union Community, hopes that the company won\u2019t force workers out: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows yet again that challenges remain for the UK\u2019s steel industry and that is why we reiterate our call on government to meet with unions and employers in the industry to discuss action on the outstanding issues which we have been campaigning on for some time, such as energy costs, business rates and procurement. \u201cWe will be sitting down with Liberty Steel to look at their plans in detail and examine the rationale behind these proposals. In the meantime, we recognise that the company has indicated its intention to achieve any reductions through voluntary redundancy \u2013 we will be holding them to that commitment.\u201d Mark Carney has managed to send the pound down to a two-week low. Sterling hasn\u2019t been as low as $1.302 since 27 December, when City traders were struggling back to work following their Christmas break. An interest rate cut might infuriate Britain\u2019s savers -- including pensioners -- who have suffered from low rates of return for a decade. Mary Carney suggests they shouldn\u2019t complain, as they benefit in other ways: The vast majority of savers who might lose some interest income from lower policy rates stand to gain from increases in asset prices that result from monetary policy stimulus, since only 2% of UK households have material deposit holdings without material financial assets or property wealth. The problem here, though, is that older people might not want to cash in the equity in their homes or liquidate their share portfolio. Mark Carney\u2019s dovish comments are pushing sterling down, says CNBC\u2019s Julianna Tatelbaum: Mark Carney has also declared that the Bank of England could widen its asset-purchase scheme if needed. That would mean buying up more government debt with new money, on top of the \u00a3435bn of gilts already purchased. He says this is another policy tool, on top of a potential interest rate cut to almost zero (from 0.75% today): At present, there is sufficient headroom to at least double the August 2016 package of \u00a360 billion asset purchases, a number that will increase with further gilt issuance. That would deliver the equivalent of around a 100 basis point cut to Bank Rate on top of the near 75 basis points of conventional policy space. The Bank can also used its \u2018forward guidance\u2019 to loosen monetary conditions, Carney adds (basically by promising not to raise interest rates for some time). Newsflash: Outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney has hinted that UK interest rates could be cut soon. Speaking at an inflation targeting conference in London, Carney declared that the BoE could respond \u201cpromptly\u201d if the UK economy doesn\u2019t strengthen soon. He warned that there\u2019s no guarantee that growth will rebound, even though businesses now have more certainty over Brexit. And this means policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee are split over what to do (two voted for a rate cut last month). Carney says: This rebound is not, of course, assured. The economy has been sluggish, slack has been growing, and inflation is below target. Much hinges on the speed with which domestic confidence returns. As is entirely appropriate, there is a debate at the MPC over the relative merits of near term stimulus to reinforce the expected recovery in UK growth and inflation. And if growth doesn\u2019t revive, the governor adds, there\u2019s a case for acting quickly: There are downside risks from global growth and the possibility that uncertainties over future trading relationships could remain entrenched. With the relatively limited space to cut Bank Rate, if evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response. Of course, that\u2019s really more of a question for Carney\u2019s successor, Andrew Bailey, who takes over on March 16. But obviously Carney knows which way the BoE is leaning today... so his comments have knocked more than half a cent off the pound. It\u2019s dropped to $1.302 since Carney spoke, down from $1.308. More to follow.... High street gift card retailer Card Factory has suffered a poor Christmas. Shares in the company have slumped by 20% to a record low, after it warned that the festive period was \u201cchallenging\u2019. It blamed political uncertainty, saying: The general election and weak consumer sentiment ensured that the long-running trend of declining high street footfall was maintained. This means Card Factory expects profits to drop to \u00a381m to \u00a383m, from \u00a389.4m last year. I\u2019m not completely convinced that the general election can be blamed -- surely Johnson, Corbyn, Swinson et al were sent a few \u201cgood luck\u201d cards? The broader problem, as we\u2019ve seen from John Lewis too, is that the high street is in serious trouble. Retail expert Ian Shepherd says Card Factory needs to get its online house in order, fast. Marks &amp; Spencer shares are continuing to slide, as the City digests today\u2019s Christmas trading. They\u2019re now down 10.7%. Investors aren\u2019t happy about the latest drop in clothing sales, and M&amp;S\u2019s warning of glitches in food supply and gifting. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Christmas trading woes were partly down to a reckless flirtation with men\u2019s skinny jeans. The high street chain seems to have ordered too many of these slim-fitting trousers, rather than the more capacious range which some chaps  might prefer (particularly when Christmas dinner is calling). My colleague Zoe Wood explains: Clothing sales at M&amp;S stores open more than one year were down 1.7% after an attempt to make its menswear ranges more fashionable \u2013 customers told it last year that they were \u201ctoo old\u201d \u2013 backfired. The revamp involved replacing some regular \u201crelaxed\u201d fit trousers with slim and skinny options but the sartorial leap proved too dramatic for its customer base, with the new lines ending up on its sale rails. The retailer \u201cgot the balance wrong\u201d, Rowe admitted. CEO Steve Rowe also said there was evidence that Britons were thinking more carefully about the quantity and quality of what it buy, even at Christmas, with demand for its women and men\u2019s cashmere jumpers up 15% and 40% respectively. Another surprise departure: Willie Walsh is quitting as boss of International Airlines Group, the firm behind British Airways. It\u2019s not a Paula Nicholds-style shock, though -- Walsh had been expected to leave by 2021. But it ends a long stint running BA, including several bruising clashes with staff and a historic pilots strike last year. What\u2019s the solution to John Lewis\u2019s woes? Simon Neville of PA reckons it should recruit namesake Dave Lewis, once he departs Tesco. Lewis certainly has experience of turning a struggling retailer around, but is there a role for him in the Partnership\u2019s new structure? Paula Nicholds new job was \u201cexecutive director, brand\u201d - rather than actually running the department stores. Retail analyst Steve Dresser has another theory -- Amazon could buy them! However, John Lewis\u2019s partnership structure makes such a move very difficult. Nice summary from the Daily Mail\u2019s Tom Witherow: Tesco\u2019s shares have jumped almost 2%, as investors applaud its Christmas trading figures. Although a 0.1% rise in UK sales isn\u2019t exactly sparkling, it\u2019s a resilient performance in a tough market. CEO Dave Lewis (who is leaving later this year), suggests the rise in healthier eating boosted sales: Over the Christmas period we outperformed the market in both volume and value terms, with a strong performance in fresh food. Further improvements in price and quality were complemented by our \u2018Festive 5\u2019 vegetable offer and an enthusiastic customer response to our significantly expanded range of plant-based foods Retail analyst Nick Bubb says Paula Nickolds resignation is a \u201cbombshell\u201d, adding; It is hard not to link the inexorable profit pressure on John Lewis with the shock news that John Lewis MD Paula Nickolds is to step down\u2026 Losing one senior manager is unfortunate. But shedding two in three months, over a confusing managerial shake-up, is pretty careless of John Lewis -- especially when your chair is leaving. As Bubb puts it: Having already lost Waitrose MD Rob Collins and with an unproven Sharon White about to take over from Charlie Mayfield as Executive Chairman, this is not an ideal state of affairs\u2026 Oh dear. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s shares have dropped 7.5% in early trading as its latest Christmas results fail to impress the City. Although like-for-like sales rose by 0.2% in the last quarter of 2019, traders aren\u2019t impressed that clothing and food sales fell by 1.7% on a comparable basis. CEO Steve Rowe says performance improved, but also blames various operational problems which held M&amp;S back: As we drive a faster pace of change, disappointing one-off issues - notably waste and supply chain in the Food business, the shape of buy in Menswear and performance in our Gifting categories - held us back from delivering a stronger result. However, the changes we made earlier in the year in Clothing have arrested the worst of the issues of the first six months and we are progressively building a much stronger team for the future.\u201d John Lewis\u2019s poor performance proves that you need more than a cute fire-breathing dragon to succeed at Christmas. Richard Lim, CEO of Retail Economics, says that trading at the Partnership is tough, and not helped by Black Friday: \u201cExcitable Edgar did little to fire up Christmas sales with declines across non-food and a woeful performance in the online business which barely showed any signs of growth. \u201cThe later timing of Black Friday may ultimately have been the destructive force at play. Consumers appear to have pulled forward gift purchases to take advantage of deep discounts at the expense of Christmas trading. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, in this hyper-competitive industry, their price matching promise is likely to have eroded margins further against the backdrop of rising operating costs. \u201cWaitrose performed better but continues to undergo a transformation in the business. The shining light was an impressive performance in their online proposition.\u201d Digging into John Lewis\u2019s Christmas trading figures... it appears that sales of computers, phones and other electronics kit were disappointing. Tech sales at its department stores fell by 4.0% in the seven weeks to 4 January, while home products fell 3.4%.Beauty products, though, rose by 4.7%. The company adds: We saw significant variation in levels of demand with Black Friday sales up 10.0% on the equivalent period last year, followed by more subdued demand in the subsequent weeks. John Lewis isn\u2019t alone in its struggles. The overall UK high street had a rubbish 2019, with total sales down by 0.1%. That\u2019s the worst result since at least 1995, when the British Retail Consortium started counting the numbers. Sales slid by 0.9% in November and December -- which is usually a bumper time for retailers. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, says: \u201c2019 was the worst year on record and the first year to show an overall decline in retail sales.\u201d Retail analyst Patrick O\u2019Brien reckons John Lewis has blundered by merging its department store and supermarket management together. It certainly felt like an odd move when it was announced last autumn, if only because it was cobbled together by outgoing chairman Charlie Mayfield. Now his successor, Sharon White, has to pick up the pieces. John Lewis has paid its staff a bonus every year for decades -- it last suspended it during the second world war. So it would be a serious shock if the Partnership cannot afford to reward its workers this year. Last year it was only worth 3% of basic pay, down from a tasty 18% in 2011. Some instant reaction to John Lewis\u2019s Christmas trading: Crumbs! Paula Nickolds, the first woman to run John Lewis\u2019s department stores, has quit. Nickolds, who became John Lewis\u2019s managing director three years ago, appears to have baulked at a management shake-up announced back in October. She was due to become executive director of brand, heading marketing, service and digital innovation across the group in February. Instead, she\u2019s resigned -- ending a 25-year stint (Nicholds started as a graduate trainee and worked her way to the top). It creates another headache for incoming chair Dame Sharon White, who starts next month. John Lewis says: After some reflection on the responsibilities of her proposed new role, we have decided together that the implementation of the Future Partnership structure in February is the right time for her to move on and she will leave the Partnership with our gratitude and best wishes for the future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Three of Britain\u2019s major retailers are reporting results for the key Christmas period today, and it\u2019s a decidedly mixed picture. The John Lewis Partnership - which includes Waitrose \u2013 has reported a slump in gross sales, down 1.8% year on year in the seven weeks from 17 November to 4 January. Its department stores fared particularly badly, with sales down 2% on a like-for-like basis. That wiped away a stronger performance at Waitrose, where online sales increased by 16.7% over the pre-Christmas period. And in a blow to its workers, John Lewis Partnership is warning that employees may not receive their usual bonus -- which used to be worth several weeks pay. It warns: The Partnership Board will meet in February to decide whether it is prudent to pay a Partnership Bonus. The decision will be influenced by our level of profitability, planned investment and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.\u201d Outgoing Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield warns that earnings at the Partnership will be much weaker than last year: At the full year, we expect profits in Waitrose &amp; Partners to be broadly in line with last year. In John Lewis &amp; Partners we will reverse the losses incurred in the first half of the year, but profits will be substantially down on last year. We therefore expect that Partnership profit before exceptionals will be significantly lower than last year. Supermarket chain Tesco appears to have done better, with a 0.1% rise in like-for-like sales in the UK despite the tough retail climate. Marks &amp; Spencer has had a mixed time. It has just reported total UK sales for the last 13 weeks of 2019 fell 0.6% (but was up 0.2% on a like-for-like basis). Total food sales rose by 1.5%, but clothing -- a long-running problem for M&amp;S - slumped by 3.7%. Homewear group Dunelm and high street chain Card Factory are also reporting results, on a busy morning for retail news. Also coming up today After getting into a geopolitical tizzy\u2019s on Wednesday, the markets are calmer today as US-Iran tensions ease a little. The missile attack launched against two US bases appears to have avoided any casualties - meaning Tehran has responded to the death of general Suleimani without provoking a US retaliation. This pushed US stocks higher last night, with the Nasdaq hitting another record high.

We will lose a lot of biodiversity in the future and we have limited resources to conserve what we have. How are we to conserve our biodiversity if we don\u2019t know where it is? We really need a new push for biodiversity discovery and I hope that this study will provide the impetus for that.\u201d</p> <p>Rheindt first visited some of the islands in the study while on a solo exploring trip in 2009, returning four years later with a field permit from the Indonesian government and a research team.

      "bodyText": "Ten new songbird species and subspecies have been identified on a trio of previously under-explored Indonesian islands in the largest discovery of its kind in more than a century, according to a new study. Hidden away on the remote Wallacean islands of Taliabu, Peleng and Batudaka, close to where British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace independently developed the theory of evolution to Charles Darwin, five new bird species and five subspecies were detected during a six-week expedition to the area, off the coast of Sulawesi. Although birds are among the most comprehensively documented animal classes, with only a handful of new species identified each year, the pioneering methodology used in the study, published in the journal Science, has raised the prospect of further discoveries around the world. The researchers concentrated their efforts on the islands of Taliabu and Peleng due to their likely high biodiversity because of their genetic isolation over the last few million years, revealed by using sea-depth analysis of the deep water channels in the archipelago. Nine of the 10 new forms were discovered on Peleng and Taliabu. The new species identified in the study led by Frank Rheindt at National University of Singapore include the Peleng fantail, the Peleng leaf warbler, the Taliabu grasshopper warbler, the Taliabu myzomela and the Taliabu leaf warbler. The new sub-species include the Togian jungle flycatcher, the Banggai mountain leaftoiler, the Taliabu snowy-browed flycatcher, the Taliabu island thrush and the Sula mountain leaftoiler. The findings mark the largest number of new species identified from such a small geographically confined region in more than 100 years. Approximately 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean are believed to await formal scientific description, but researchers fear that much of the world\u2019s biodiversity is at risk of disappearing before it can be identified. Although the new species and subspecies have only just been formally identified, researchers warned that rampant forest destruction on the islands caused by logging and forest fires driven by the climate crisis threaten the survival of the birds. \u201cIt\u2019s a real surprise to see that in the 21st century there\u2019s still a place on Earth, a relatively limited area, where there are five new subspecies and five news species of birds to be found,\u201d said Prof Rheindt. \u201cIt goes to show that there are still many areas on Earth that are underexplored. \u201cIn this era of environmental crisis, the year 2019 has shown that we have entered a critical stage. We will lose a lot of biodiversity in the future and we have limited resources to conserve what we have. How are we to conserve our biodiversity if we don\u2019t know where it is? We really need a new push for biodiversity discovery and I hope that this study will provide the impetus for that.\u201d Rheindt first visited some of the islands in the study while on a solo exploring trip in 2009, returning four years later with a field permit from the Indonesian government and a research team. The majority of the birds, nine of the 10, were discovered on the little-explored highlands of the Indonesia islands, which were difficult to access. \u201cThe islands I visited are separated from Sulawesi by deep seas and that\u2019s an incredibly important point, because the depth of the sea is a very important factor in how much endemism \u2013 species that are not shared with any other place on Earth \u2013 we can expect on an island. \u201cEvery time there is an ice age, the global sea level recedes by up to 120m. All of these places that we see as islands today are not really islands. But the islands I chose for this exploration are true islands in that they have never been connected to Sulawesi because deep sea separates [them]. Hence, you might expect a lot of special species there that are not found anywhere else on Earth.\u201d In the last 20 years, only 161 new species of birds have been found worldwide, with even fewer in restricted geographic areas. There are roughly 11,000 recognised bird species, yet it is believed many more remain to be discovered. Of the new species, the Peleng fantail is identifiable by the distinct black scaling below it black breast patch, its clean white throat and unique courtship vocalisation. The Taliabu grasshopper warbler, also conspicuous for its vocalisations, has fine dusky speckling which increases toward its breast and lower throat. The scarlet-bodied Taliabu myzomela inhabits forest canopy and was photographed feeding at flowers. The Taliabu leaf warbler, which has been scientifically named after a former Indonesian environment minister, is most notable for its entirely lemon underparts. Finally, the Peleng leaf warbler is identifiable by its lack of both a central crown stripe and wingbars, and its lemon-yellow underparts contrasting with a white throat.

It was an embarrassing portrait of India. No matter how many explanatory notes you have in the programme, you experience dance when the lights go down and something moving hits your eye. How can you put all the good intentions and explanations that you signal in the programme into that experience? That discussion is long overdue.</p> <p>Blackface is still seen in some international versions of La Bayad\u00e8re. I remember reading an argument against airbrushing such \u201cexotic\u201d aspects of this ballet, saying it was an \u201cinstructive reminder of bygone sins\u201d. I find that a very frivolous way of talking about something so huge as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery\">slavery</a> and the exploitation of people. I\u2019m offended as a British Asian to sit in an audience and see supposedly Indian holy men [the fakirs] move like servile monkeys.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every branch of the arts has had to engage with the legacy of colonialism, so I don't see why ballet can't do the same</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If many of the 19th-century ballet classics have the same entitled and Eurocentric viewpoint, then this is something that surely has to be tempered. Every branch of the arts has had to engage with the legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/colonialism\">colonialism</a>, so I don\u2019t see why ballet can\u2019t do the same. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy answer but one has to make a start. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/08/inspired-by-the-east-review-europes-glorious-fascination-with-islam\">British Museum\u2019s exhibition on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/08/inspired-by-the-east-review-europes-glorious-fascination-with-islam\">orientalism</a> displays contested paintings of eastern women by European artists, but at the end three contemporary Middle Eastern female artists are given the space to respond. One leaves with an understanding of the past and respect for the present.</p> <p>Shakespeare presents us with similar challenges in Othello, or the compliant woman in The Taming of the Shrew or the conversion of Jewish Jessica at the end of The Merchant of Venice. All these plays have been successfully staged for the modern audience, with its different historical and religious sensitivities, without losing the power of the original text. What is the text of the dance? It\u2019s the choreography, and in Bayad\u00e8re the tale of love and betrayal. It\u2019s not the harem pants or the orientalism. Surely classical dance can survive without the navel jewels?</p> <p>La Bayad\u00e8re is a choreographically robust ballet and the intention is not to vandalise it. I\u2019m not criticising the choreographer, Marius Petipa. He was a man of his time, who did brilliantly well for his time. I would like to think we could do equally brilliantly for our time.</p> <h2><strong>Phil Chan, </strong><strong>former dancer, arts educator</strong></h2> <p><strong>Co-founded Final Bow for Yellowface, a campaign dedicated to eliminating outdated representations of Asians on stage</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c225814acfa345450d58e1c49ee6045c253b729c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c225814acfa345450d58e1c49ee6045c253b729c/20_46_1689_1715/985.jpg\" alt=\"Georgina Pazcoguin and Phil Chan, co-founders of Final Bow for Yellowface.\" width=\"985\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creative problem-solving \u2026 Georgina Pazcoguin and Phil Chan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenneth Edwards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we only ever see Asians in the media as two-dimensional caricatures, our imaginal worlds become impoverished.

The company received thousands of letters complaining about Nutcracker\u2019s Chinese dance but he didn\u2019t feel it was his work to change [it was created by legendary choreographer George Balanchine].</p> <p>Is it possible to retain tradition while updating works to be more respectful? Our aim isn\u2019t to call out racist elements in classical ballets, but to spark creative problem-solving. In the Balanchine choreography, a cliche of a Chinaman pops out of a box. What if it was a jumping cricket instead? Crickets are a respectful image from Chinese culture and logically could perform the same choreography, all big jumps. What does it take away? Nothing. We\u2019re not asking companies to redo the whole Nutcracker, or stop doing it altogether. We\u2019re just talking about changing some of the shuffling, head bobbing and gross makeup.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we don't make ballets bigger to respond to the world we live in today, they're going to die</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are actually very conservative in our approach, because we are dancers too. But what we\u2019re saying is that if we don\u2019t change it, if we don\u2019t imagine ways to make these ballets bigger to respond to the world we live in today, they\u2019re going to die.</p> <p>If you think about what a performing art is, change is an inherent part of it. It\u2019s not fixed like sculpture or painting. The original Black Swan tutu was canary yellow; Giselle had national dances in the second act until Petipa changed it; there are several versions of Balanchine\u2019s Apollo. So if we\u2019re changing some things, why are we are clinging to outdated representations of race?</p> <p>I\u2019ve developed a tool, a grid with two axes, to help understand potential problems and find solutions. On one axis you have \u201ccharacter\u201d at one end and \u201ccaricature\u201d at the other. The second goes from \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d to \u201cfantasy\u201d. You could say Madama Butterfly is character, not caricature \u2013 Cio Cio San has emotional depth \u2013 but it\u2019s also fantasy, it\u2019s not historically accurate. Le Corsaire is also fantasy, but it traffics unflattering tropes of Arabs, so I would say it\u2019s caricature. It\u2019s one way to think about this constructively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e72cf084e6bbe83b0977122984110afab0ec93a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e72cf084e6bbe83b0977122984110afab0ec93a/0_0_3000_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unflattering \u2026 Frederick Ashton, Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev rehearse for Le Corsaire in London, in 1962.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"783\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unflattering \u2026 Frederick Ashton, Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev rehearse for Le Corsaire in London, in 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Harris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m currently working on a new Bayad\u00e8re with dance scholar Doug Fullington.

My Corsaire, rather than taking place at an Arabian slave bazaar, would be at a children\u2019s dance competition with a director saying: \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to watch 50 kids do crazy variations and pick the best one to join our company.\u201d That\u2019s Corsaire! It takes away the misogyny, the slavery, the orientalism \u2013 and you can still put sequins everywhere.</p> <p>Our message is to think about other ways to do this work for today.

Birmingham Royal Ballet reworked its Chinese variation last year after removing yellow makeup from the costume in 2018. There\u2019s the Arabian dance too \u2013 you can\u2019t change one and not the other \u2013 and this year BRB have also removed the darker makeup that was once required for the men in the Arabian dance. Having these conversations eliminates the hysteria around change and makes us understand that these things need to be considered.</p> <p>My whole career has been in England and I have never experienced any discrimination because of my colour. But the same isn\u2019t true for some other dancers in other countries. I\u2019ve seen complaints about dancers not being promoted and so on. At BRB we have quite a diverse company, I think we\u2019re definitely leading the way in that sense.</p> <p>Ballet was created as a white, elitist art form, but we can\u2019t be boxed in by views from the past. Back then they never would have thought it would touch dancers from the Caribbean, like myself. If you look at the number of countries the dancers in BRB come from, it\u2019s amazing. We\u2019ve grown. And all audiences need to be accepting of the change. We need to be looking at talent, rather than colour.</p> <h2><strong>Georgina Pazcoguin, dancer and campaigner</strong></h2> <p><strong>Soloist at New York City Ballet, aka The Rogue Ballerina, co-founder of Final Bow for Yellowface</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQvigrb9AbA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UQvigrb9AbA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I\u2019m Filipino American and I\u2019m the first Asian woman ever promoted out of the corps de ballet at New York City Ballet. I didn\u2019t know how hard this trajectory would be, to push back on a bias held for generations. It has required so much extra work and trauma, I\u2019ve had to prove my talent is undeniable in every aspect.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had the experience of being made to feel \u201cother\u201d. My first experience of feeling uncomfortable was performing the Chinese divertissement in George Balanchine\u2019s Nutcracker, prior to its recent adaptation. I put on the wig, I was made to accentuate my already Asian features. I was 21 or 22, I didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to explain it, I just knew that this wasn\u2019t right. Certainly at that point nobody could go up to Peter Martins and say: \u201cExcuse me, this is racist.\u201d So I just ended up making a caricature out of the caricature. Everything that was so offensive, the fan, the nodding head, I used humour to deal with it. At one point I bobbed my head so hard I lost my wig.</p> <p>I\u2019m now known for dancing Coffee, the \u201cArabian\u201d variation in Nutcracker. How do I feel about that? Depending on which production you\u2019re viewing, it\u2019s a very fine line. It is exoticising, it feeds into orientalism, but the dance can be flipped into a powerful statement about what it is to be a woman. I\u2019ve made it my choice to step into my sensuality and make it athletic, not just sexy. I always feel very empowered when I\u2019m dancing Coffee.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re at a breaking point with humanity. We have to really try to see each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the past couple of years I\u2019ve been part of the diversity initiative at City Ballet. I want to encourage dancers to find ways to advocate for themselves. Ballet dancers, especially women, are made to feel like we are replaceable. We feel that if we speak up it\u2019s going to be used against us \u2013 and sometimes it is. But the more dancers speak up, the more we\u2019re going to change that. You can\u2019t expect someone to grasp your lens of experience, especially when it comes to most white male directors. I say this with utmost respect to men, but the white male gaze has dominated decision-making in the ballet world. We as dancers are accountable for asking questions of our leaders because no matter what our gender or race or intentions, we all have blind spots.</p> <p>As society\u2019s views change, ballet has to adapt. We\u2019re slow on the uptake in a lot of different ways \u2013 our full length ballets mostly feature an outdated power dynamic. It doesn\u2019t take much to remove the offensiveness. There are a lot of traditionalists who think tinkering with anything is blasphemy. But removing brownface from Bayad\u00e8re is not ruining the ballet. It\u2019s simply employing your suspension of disbelief.</p> <p>We\u2019re at a breaking point with humanity. We have to really try to see each other. I think ballet is a conduit for inspiring that connection. Even though I\u2019m on stage I have a direct connection to the audience. It\u2019s different to visiting a museum, it\u2019s very much a present art, an actual physical exchange between the dancers and the audience. That\u2019s where the magic of ballet is.</p>",

It was an embarrassing portrait of India. No matter how many explanatory notes you have in the programme, you experience dance when the lights go down and something moving hits your eye. How can you put all the good intentions and explanations that you signal in the programme into that experience? That discussion is long overdue. Blackface is still seen in some international versions of La Bayad\u00e8re. I remember reading an argument against airbrushing such \u201cexotic\u201d aspects of this ballet, saying it was an \u201cinstructive reminder of bygone sins\u201d. I find that a very frivolous way of talking about something so huge as slavery and the exploitation of people. I\u2019m offended as a British Asian to sit in an audience and see supposedly Indian holy men [the fakirs] move like servile monkeys. If many of the 19th-century ballet classics have the same entitled and Eurocentric viewpoint, then this is something that surely has to be tempered. Every branch of the arts has had to engage with the legacy of colonialism, so I don\u2019t see why ballet can\u2019t do the same. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy answer but one has to make a start. The British Museum\u2019s exhibition on orientalism displays contested paintings of eastern women by European artists, but at the end three contemporary Middle Eastern female artists are given the space to respond. One leaves with an understanding of the past and respect for the present. Shakespeare presents us with similar challenges in Othello, or the compliant woman in The Taming of the Shrew or the conversion of Jewish Jessica at the end of The Merchant of Venice. All these plays have been successfully staged for the modern audience, with its different historical and religious sensitivities, without losing the power of the original text. What is the text of the dance? It\u2019s the choreography, and in Bayad\u00e8re the tale of love and betrayal. It\u2019s not the harem pants or the orientalism. Surely classical dance can survive without the navel jewels? La Bayad\u00e8re is a choreographically robust ballet and the intention is not to vandalise it. I\u2019m not criticising the choreographer, Marius Petipa. He was a man of his time, who did brilliantly well for his time. I would like to think we could do equally brilliantly for our time. Phil Chan, former dancer, arts educator Co-founded Final Bow for Yellowface, a campaign dedicated to eliminating outdated representations of Asians on stage If we only ever see Asians in the media as two-dimensional caricatures, our imaginal worlds become impoverished. Surely, given rich cultures to draw from, we can find better representations? Georgina Pazcoguin and I founded Final Bow for Yellowface in 2017 after New York City Ballet\u2019s then artistic director Peter Martins called me into his office to see if I had any fresh insights on The Nutcracker. The company received thousands of letters complaining about Nutcracker\u2019s Chinese dance but he didn\u2019t feel it was his work to change [it was created by legendary choreographer George Balanchine]. Is it possible to retain tradition while updating works to be more respectful? Our aim isn\u2019t to call out racist elements in classical ballets, but to spark creative problem-solving. In the Balanchine choreography, a cliche of a Chinaman pops out of a box. What if it was a jumping cricket instead? Crickets are a respectful image from Chinese culture and logically could perform the same choreography, all big jumps. What does it take away? Nothing. We\u2019re not asking companies to redo the whole Nutcracker, or stop doing it altogether. We\u2019re just talking about changing some of the shuffling, head bobbing and gross makeup. We are actually very conservative in our approach, because we are dancers too. But what we\u2019re saying is that if we don\u2019t change it, if we don\u2019t imagine ways to make these ballets bigger to respond to the world we live in today, they\u2019re going to die. If you think about what a performing art is, change is an inherent part of it. It\u2019s not fixed like sculpture or painting. The original Black Swan tutu was canary yellow; Giselle had national dances in the second act until Petipa changed it; there are several versions of Balanchine\u2019s Apollo. So if we\u2019re changing some things, why are we are clinging to outdated representations of race? I\u2019ve developed a tool, a grid with two axes, to help understand potential problems and find solutions. On one axis you have \u201ccharacter\u201d at one end and \u201ccaricature\u201d at the other. The second goes from \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d to \u201cfantasy\u201d. You could say Madama Butterfly is character, not caricature \u2013 Cio Cio San has emotional depth \u2013 but it\u2019s also fantasy, it\u2019s not historically accurate. Le Corsaire is also fantasy, but it traffics unflattering tropes of Arabs, so I would say it\u2019s caricature. It\u2019s one way to think about this constructively. I\u2019m currently working on a new Bayad\u00e8re with dance scholar Doug Fullington. It\u2019s not set in India but in Busby Berkeley\u2019s Hollywood, so our production will have cowgirls dancing with lassos, but we\u2019re going back to the notations of Petipa\u2019s choreography. My Corsaire, rather than taking place at an Arabian slave bazaar, would be at a children\u2019s dance competition with a director saying: \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to watch 50 kids do crazy variations and pick the best one to join our company.\u201d That\u2019s Corsaire! It takes away the misogyny, the slavery, the orientalism \u2013 and you can still put sequins everywhere. Our message is to think about other ways to do this work for today. Because that\u2019s what good, living art does. What makes a ballet a classic is that it can withstand the warping of time. C\u00e9line Gittens, dancer Principal, Birmingham Royal Ballet I performed in Petrushka, in the original format, in my second or third year of the company. I think it was 2007. Being new to the company, my initial thought was: this is theatre, this is what they need to do in order to portray certain characters \u2013 they apply makeup to make the Moor black \u2013 which is why I never questioned it. I was new, trying to do my job the best I could. Things have moved on. We\u2019re reassessing everything to be in line with the contemporary world. Blackface is unacceptable. But it\u2019s an interesting conversation to have because otherwise Petrushka is a genuine masterpiece, part of our ballet heritage, but it\u2019s just not acceptable to perform it. In The Nutcracker, we\u2019ve reconsidered some of the things that are unacceptable. Birmingham Royal Ballet reworked its Chinese variation last year after removing yellow makeup from the costume in 2018. There\u2019s the Arabian dance too \u2013 you can\u2019t change one and not the other \u2013 and this year BRB have also removed the darker makeup that was once required for the men in the Arabian dance. Having these conversations eliminates the hysteria around change and makes us understand that these things need to be considered. My whole career has been in England and I have never experienced any discrimination because of my colour. But the same isn\u2019t true for some other dancers in other countries. I\u2019ve seen complaints about dancers not being promoted and so on. At BRB we have quite a diverse company, I think we\u2019re definitely leading the way in that sense. Ballet was created as a white, elitist art form, but we can\u2019t be boxed in by views from the past. Back then they never would have thought it would touch dancers from the Caribbean, like myself. If you look at the number of countries the dancers in BRB come from, it\u2019s amazing. We\u2019ve grown. And all audiences need to be accepting of the change. We need to be looking at talent, rather than colour. Georgina Pazcoguin, dancer and campaigner Soloist at New York City Ballet, aka The Rogue Ballerina, co-founder of Final Bow for Yellowface I\u2019m Filipino American and I\u2019m the first Asian woman ever promoted out of the corps de ballet at New York City Ballet. I didn\u2019t know how hard this trajectory would be, to push back on a bias held for generations. It has required so much extra work and trauma, I\u2019ve had to prove my talent is undeniable in every aspect. I\u2019ve had the experience of being made to feel \u201cother\u201d. My first experience of feeling uncomfortable was performing the Chinese divertissement in George Balanchine\u2019s Nutcracker, prior to its recent adaptation. I put on the wig, I was made to accentuate my already Asian features. I was 21 or 22, I didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to explain it, I just knew that this wasn\u2019t right. Certainly at that point nobody could go up to Peter Martins and say: \u201cExcuse me, this is racist.\u201d So I just ended up making a caricature out of the caricature. Everything that was so offensive, the fan, the nodding head, I used humour to deal with it. At one point I bobbed my head so hard I lost my wig. I\u2019m now known for dancing Coffee, the \u201cArabian\u201d variation in Nutcracker. How do I feel about that? Depending on which production you\u2019re viewing, it\u2019s a very fine line. It is exoticising, it feeds into orientalism, but the dance can be flipped into a powerful statement about what it is to be a woman. I\u2019ve made it my choice to step into my sensuality and make it athletic, not just sexy. I always feel very empowered when I\u2019m dancing Coffee. In the past couple of years I\u2019ve been part of the diversity initiative at City Ballet. I want to encourage dancers to find ways to advocate for themselves. Ballet dancers, especially women, are made to feel like we are replaceable. We feel that if we speak up it\u2019s going to be used against us \u2013 and sometimes it is. But the more dancers speak up, the more we\u2019re going to change that. You can\u2019t expect someone to grasp your lens of experience, especially when it comes to most white male directors. I say this with utmost respect to men, but the white male gaze has dominated decision-making in the ballet world. We as dancers are accountable for asking questions of our leaders because no matter what our gender or race or intentions, we all have blind spots. As society\u2019s views change, ballet has to adapt. We\u2019re slow on the uptake in a lot of different ways \u2013 our full length ballets mostly feature an outdated power dynamic. It doesn\u2019t take much to remove the offensiveness. There are a lot of traditionalists who think tinkering with anything is blasphemy. But removing brownface from Bayad\u00e8re is not ruining the ballet. It\u2019s simply employing your suspension of disbelief. We\u2019re at a breaking point with humanity. We have to really try to see each other. I think ballet is a conduit for inspiring that connection. Even though I\u2019m on stage I have a direct connection to the audience. It\u2019s different to visiting a museum, it\u2019s very much a present art, an actual physical exchange between the dancers and the audience. That\u2019s where the magic of ballet is.",

      "body": "<p>Whatever happens when Taiwan\u2019s voters go to the polls on Saturday, its president, Tsai Ing-wen, has made a truly remarkable comeback. Just over two years ago, her Democratic Progressive party (DPP) was humiliated in the midterm local elections. A year ago, her prospects of reelection looked so dim that senior party figures urged her not to run again. Yet for months, polls have given her <a href=\"https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/presidential-polls-on-the-eve-of-the-polling-blackout/\" title=\"\">a hefty lead</a> over her main challenger.</p> <p>Ms Tsai can take some credit. The shock of 2018\u2019s result was a wake-up call. The impact of controversial pension reforms which fuelled that defeat has largely been absorbed. The economy is improving, with wage growth and high employment. </p> <p>Yet her resurgence is also down to the men she faces: Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT) in the election, and in the broader sense, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Han, a socially conservative, populist figure seized the mayoralty of Kaohsiung as an energetic campaigner.

      "bodyText": "Whatever happens when Taiwan\u2019s voters go to the polls on Saturday, its president, Tsai Ing-wen, has made a truly remarkable comeback. Just over two years ago, her Democratic Progressive party (DPP) was humiliated in the midterm local elections. A year ago, her prospects of reelection looked so dim that senior party figures urged her not to run again. Yet for months, polls have given her a hefty lead over her main challenger. Ms Tsai can take some credit. The shock of 2018\u2019s result was a wake-up call. The impact of controversial pension reforms which fuelled that defeat has largely been absorbed. The economy is improving, with wage growth and high employment. Yet her resurgence is also down to the men she faces: Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT) in the election, and in the broader sense, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Han, a socially conservative, populist figure seized the mayoralty of Kaohsiung as an energetic campaigner. But the \u201cHan wave\u201d has ebbed and while some remain devoted, he has proved deeply polarising \u2013 while his performance in office has impaired the KMT\u2019s positioning as the party of competence and good management. His calls for closer ties with Beijing have been toned down as he slides in the polls. While domestic issues tend to loom larger in the simultaneous parliamentary contest, Ms Tsai has ensured that cross-straits relations have dominated the presidential race. Her party has campaigned on the slogan \u201cResist China, Defend Taiwan\u201d. Though the self-ruled island has never been under the jurisdiction of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Beijing regards it as a renegade province which must return to the fold. The KMT fled there after losing the civil war in 1949, but since the decades of one-party rule ended, it has increasingly emphasised its capacity to manage good relations with Beijing. Ms Tsai\u2019s predecessor, the KMT\u2019s Ma Ying-jeou, oversaw a significant thaw.

Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement, and the response of authorities, have sharpened those anxieties and solidified support for Ms Tsai. Concerns about Beijing\u2019s impact have been exacerbated by a Russian-style influence and misinformation campaign during the election itself and by the KMT\u2019s choice of strongly pro-unification candidates for its party list in the legislative contest. Should Ms Tsai win on Saturday as expected, and especially if her party wins the parliamentary election, this will be an astonishing turnaround. It will also be the easy part.

Instead the Queen\u2019s speech promised only to try to reach a \u201ccross-party agreement\u201d in an unlikely bid to co-opt or blame the opposition for the Tories\u2019 failure. He offers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/25/boris-johnson-under-fire-over-vague-social-care-funding-plans\" title=\"\">a \u00a31bn emergency bung</a> to keep the collapsing system afloat a little longer.</p> <p>Until the budget in March, the true complexion of this government remains opaque. Promises, vague assurances and aspirations for the north will flood the press, but only hard cash on the table will tell us who they are and what they intend. Johnson likes infrastructure he can brand his own, so northern railways can expect eye-catching investment. But how far will his chancellor \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/nationalisation-state-save-steel-port-talbot-tata-industrial-policy\" title=\"\">Ayn Rand devotee</a> and believer in a small state \u2013 burst the party\u2019s self-imposed limits for current spending? We already know their priorities will be the NHS, police and schools \u2013 but what of everything else that has been parched dry by austerity, where the IFS notes that 14% cuts are already \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/manifestos\" title=\"\">baked-in</a>\u201d?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not as if care in 2010 was anything to boast about, but the deterioration since is shocking.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s put that \u00a31bn pledged for social care into context. Johnson promises people the \u201cdignity and security they deserve and that no one who needs care has to sell their home to pay for it\u201d. That\u2019s two separate promises, with the second the most concrete and hardest to break. In 2014, following the Dilnot report, David Cameron\u2019s government passed a law to fix this: the Care Act. The <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2017/12/08/plans-cap-social-care-costs-2020-pulled-government/\" title=\"\">law fixed a \u00a372,000</a> cap as the most anyone need spend on care before the state stepped in to pay the rest, so that those entering residential care would be less likely to have to sell their home to pay for it. But the \u00a34bn cost was more than his chancellor George Osborne would tolerate: he postponed it to 2020, and then indefinitely.</p> <p>There is no need for a new act to simply implement this \u2013 but it would cost \u00a34bn. Yet that only compensates the better off for what they currently pay themselves, without adding anything to the desperate inadequacies of the care provided. It would, however, right the random injustice of dementia sufferers losing their homes and savings while those lucky enough to drop dead pay nothing. It may be fiscally regressive to spend \u00a34bn on compensating the haves rather than improving bad care for all, but applying the principle of the NHS to social care \u2013 taking everyone out of life\u2019s unfair health lottery \u2013 feels fair to most people, shocked when they first encounter the social care payment system.</p> <p>What of the other part of the Johnson promise, his pledge to give \u201cdignity and security\u201d in care so lacking from the Garside House Nursing Home? Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, says that to return social care to the same standard and spending per head as in 2010 would now cost another \u00a310bn. It\u2019s not as if care in 2010 was anything to boast about, but the deterioration since has been shocking. Funding has dropped by \u00a3700m in real terms since 2010/11, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/social-care-system-crisis-point\" title=\"\">resulting in 400,000 fewer people using the service</a> than in 2010, at the beginning of the Tories\u2019 first term. The threshold for qualifying for any care at all has risen so steeply that <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-news/articles/2018/july/1.4-million-older-people-arent-getting-the-care-and-support-they-need--a-staggering-increase-of-almost-20-in-just-two-years/\" title=\"\">Age UK finds 1.4 million people</a> are not receiving the care they need. Of these, 300,000 have \u201cvery substantial\u201d needs. People are dying at home alone and uncared for, or are shipped into A&amp;E at the last minute contributing to the NHS beds crisis \u2013 whose worst performance figures ever recorded are <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/Statistical-commentary-December-2019-v2-l9sh7.pdf\" title=\"\">published today</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEach year we delay, it gets worse,\u201d says Charlesworth.

      "bodyText": "Under the nose of parliament, right there in Westminster, Garside House Nursing Home run by Sanctuary Care Ltd has just been given an \u201coverall inadequate\u201d rating from the Care Quality Commission. It is judged not \u201csafe\u201d, \u201ceffective\u201d, \u201cresponsive\u201d or \u201cwell-led\u201d and requires improvement for \u201ccaring\u201d in its 40 beds for people with dementia, disabilities and for end-of-life care. It is now in special measures and under investigation by the police over allegations of abuse and mistreatment. The everyday horrors of social care pass barely reported these days, cruelties behind net curtains or inside institutional \u201chomes\u201d stay largely hidden. Brexit will worsen an already severe staffing crisis, with more than 580,000 new recruits required by 2035 to keep up with our ageing population, on top of the current 122,000 vacancies. Boris Johnson pledged in his first speech as prime minister: \u201cWe will fix the crisis in social care once and for all, and with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.\u201d No plan exists. Instead the Queen\u2019s speech promised only to try to reach a \u201ccross-party agreement\u201d in an unlikely bid to co-opt or blame the opposition for the Tories\u2019 failure. He offers a \u00a31bn emergency bung to keep the collapsing system afloat a little longer. Until the budget in March, the true complexion of this government remains opaque. Promises, vague assurances and aspirations for the north will flood the press, but only hard cash on the table will tell us who they are and what they intend. Johnson likes infrastructure he can brand his own, so northern railways can expect eye-catching investment. But how far will his chancellor \u2013 an Ayn Rand devotee and believer in a small state \u2013 burst the party\u2019s self-imposed limits for current spending? We already know their priorities will be the NHS, police and schools \u2013 but what of everything else that has been parched dry by austerity, where the IFS notes that 14% cuts are already \u201cbaked-in\u201d? Let\u2019s put that \u00a31bn pledged for social care into context. Johnson promises people the \u201cdignity and security they deserve and that no one who needs care has to sell their home to pay for it\u201d. That\u2019s two separate promises, with the second the most concrete and hardest to break. In 2014, following the Dilnot report, David Cameron\u2019s government passed a law to fix this: the Care Act. The law fixed a \u00a372,000 cap as the most anyone need spend on care before the state stepped in to pay the rest, so that those entering residential care would be less likely to have to sell their home to pay for it. But the \u00a34bn cost was more than his chancellor George Osborne would tolerate: he postponed it to 2020, and then indefinitely. There is no need for a new act to simply implement this \u2013 but it would cost \u00a34bn. Yet that only compensates the better off for what they currently pay themselves, without adding anything to the desperate inadequacies of the care provided. It would, however, right the random injustice of dementia sufferers losing their homes and savings while those lucky enough to drop dead pay nothing. It may be fiscally regressive to spend \u00a34bn on compensating the haves rather than improving bad care for all, but applying the principle of the NHS to social care \u2013 taking everyone out of life\u2019s unfair health lottery \u2013 feels fair to most people, shocked when they first encounter the social care payment system. What of the other part of the Johnson promise, his pledge to give \u201cdignity and security\u201d in care so lacking from the Garside House Nursing Home? Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, says that to return social care to the same standard and spending per head as in 2010 would now cost another \u00a310bn. It\u2019s not as if care in 2010 was anything to boast about, but the deterioration since has been shocking. Funding has dropped by \u00a3700m in real terms since 2010/11, resulting in 400,000 fewer people using the service than in 2010, at the beginning of the Tories\u2019 first term. The threshold for qualifying for any care at all has risen so steeply that Age UK finds 1.4 million people are not receiving the care they need. Of these, 300,000 have \u201cvery substantial\u201d needs. People are dying at home alone and uncared for, or are shipped into A&amp;E at the last minute contributing to the NHS beds crisis \u2013 whose worst performance figures ever recorded are published today. \u201cEach year we delay, it gets worse,\u201d says Charlesworth. She quotes a Competition and Markets Authority survey of the private care home sector: \u201cThe rates local authorities pay to care providers doesn\u2019t provide enough for a quality service. Care homes used to cross-subsidise their state-funded patients with self-funders \u2013 but they can\u2019t do that now. The result is the closure of nursing homes.\u201d Then there is the workforce crisis, which she says is due to low pay and poor conditions. A quarter of people in the social care sector are on zero-hours contracts \u2013 see Ken Loach\u2019s latest gruelling expos\u00e9 in Sorry We Missed You. The post-Brexit visa squeeze will do nothing to help the dire staffing situation: 40% of London care workers are from overseas. This is the challenge for Boris Johnson\u2019s first budget, which will reveal his true intent. Will he spend \u00a314bn to rescue homeowners from forced sales and to restore social care at least to the bare standards of 2010? Garside House in special measures on his Westminster doorstep is only the latest warning. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>At least 450,000 demonstrators marched in towns and cities across France on Thursday as teachers, district nurses and lawyers joined strike action over pension changes, as the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/french-strikes-talks-begin-in-bid-to-end-month-long-stoppages\">longest transport stoppages in decades</a> entered their 36th day.</p> <p>By morning rush hour, there were more than 124 miles (200km) of traffic jams in the greater Paris area as public transport was badly disrupted, leaving millions of commuters struggling to get to work.</p> <p>More than a third of teachers stopped work across the country and dozens of schools closed in the capital. Rail services across France were severely hit and there were warnings of potential delays and disruption to flights. Energy workers were also striking, with refinery stoppages. Thousands of police officers were poised for a protest march in the centre of Paris.</p> <p>It is more than a week since Emmanuel Macron called for a \u201cquick compromise\u201d to end the biggest strikes of his presidency. The government hopes negotiations over the next 24 hours end the deadlock over changes to the pensions system.

Commuters in Paris and the surrounding <em>banlieues, </em>where millions depend on trains, have been particularly affected.</p> <p>The protest movement against Macron\u2019s flagship pensions overhaul has now lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers\u2019 stoppages of May 1968. The rail stoppage, which began on 5 December, is now France\u2019s longest continuous train strike since the creation of the national rail service in the 1930s.</p> <p>The government says it will create a single, universal points-based pensions system for all, which will get rid of dozens of special systems for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris opera staff. But there is a major sticking point over the government\u2019s additional aim to tinker with France\u2019s retirement age.</p> <p>The prime minister has argued that to balance the pension budget, workers would be incentivised to stay in the labour force until 64 in order to take home a full pension, instead of leaving at the official retirement age of 62. Unions fear people will be made to work longer for lower pensions. Even moderate unions are angry at any change to the retirement age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"606f9d204c734782ee50c7f4018e82b994c83ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/606f9d204c734782ee50c7f4018e82b994c83ba4/0_268_4178_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters disperse as tear gas is fired by French police during a demonstration on day 36 of the strike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters disperse as tear gas is fired by French police during a demonstration on day 36 of the strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastien Salom-Gomis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philippe Herbeck, a striking train-driver from the Force Ouvri\u00e8re union, said he and colleagues had already lost one and a half month\u2019s salary in the longest strike he\u2019d ever known. \u201cWe\u2019re not out for ourselves, we\u2019re encouraging other professions to join in to protect the whole French system.

It\u2019s about capitalism.

Since his election in 2017, he has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d, in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs.</p> <p>Changing France\u2019s pension system is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At least 450,000 demonstrators marched in towns and cities across France on Thursday as teachers, district nurses and lawyers joined strike action over pension changes, as the country\u2019s longest transport stoppages in decades entered their 36th day. By morning rush hour, there were more than 124 miles (200km) of traffic jams in the greater Paris area as public transport was badly disrupted, leaving millions of commuters struggling to get to work. More than a third of teachers stopped work across the country and dozens of schools closed in the capital. Rail services across France were severely hit and there were warnings of potential delays and disruption to flights. Energy workers were also striking, with refinery stoppages. Thousands of police officers were poised for a protest march in the centre of Paris. It is more than a week since Emmanuel Macron called for a \u201cquick compromise\u201d to end the biggest strikes of his presidency. The government hopes negotiations over the next 24 hours end the deadlock over changes to the pensions system. But to achieve this, officials must win over the moderate CFDT union, whose leader, Laurent Berger, said on Wednesday night: \u201cWe are far from a deal.\u201d Talks will resume on Friday. An Odoxa poll for Le Figaro found that 61% of the French public still feel the strike is justified but 57% want it to stop. Commuters in Paris and the surrounding banlieues, where millions depend on trains, have been particularly affected. The protest movement against Macron\u2019s flagship pensions overhaul has now lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers\u2019 stoppages of May 1968. The rail stoppage, which began on 5 December, is now France\u2019s longest continuous train strike since the creation of the national rail service in the 1930s. The government says it will create a single, universal points-based pensions system for all, which will get rid of dozens of special systems for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris opera staff. But there is a major sticking point over the government\u2019s additional aim to tinker with France\u2019s retirement age. The prime minister has argued that to balance the pension budget, workers would be incentivised to stay in the labour force until 64 in order to take home a full pension, instead of leaving at the official retirement age of 62. Unions fear people will be made to work longer for lower pensions. Even moderate unions are angry at any change to the retirement age. Philippe Herbeck, a striking train-driver from the Force Ouvri\u00e8re union, said he and colleagues had already lost one and a half month\u2019s salary in the longest strike he\u2019d ever known. \u201cWe\u2019re not out for ourselves, we\u2019re encouraging other professions to join in to protect the whole French system. We don\u2019t want the government\u2019s individualistic approach to pensions, we want to make sure there is a real system of solidarity and future pensions don\u2019t start shrinking away.\u201d At the Paris demonstration, Andr\u00e9 Villanueva, an Air France ground-staff worker at Charles de Gaulle airport and a member of the CGT union, said: \u201cThe government isn\u2019t seriously negotiating, it\u2019s just bluff. This is about people\u2019s futures. If you\u2019ve got a lot of money you\u2019ll always be able to get health treatment, go on holiday and retire comfortably. This is about protecting the majority of people who haven\u2019t and who work hard for a basic retirement.\u201d Chantal Sevens, 67, a retired administrator from a private health group, said: \u201cPeople are worried that this reform will in fact simply benefit the big groups running private pension funds. It\u2019s about capitalism. It feels like the very principle of our social security system is under threat.\u201d The dispute cuts to the heart of Macron\u2019s presidential project and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, he has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d, in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs. Changing France\u2019s pension system is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in France.",

Plenkovi\u0107 said that claims about the behaviour of officers manning the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina had not been proven and that two reported gunfire incidents had been found to be accidental. In 2018, the Guardian released footage of asylum seekers from Algeria, Syria and Pakistan, being captured and seemingly beaten by the Croatian police as they attempted to cross the Bosnia-Croatia border into the EU. In November last year, an 18-year-old Afghan man was left with life-threatening injuries to his chest and abdomen after an officer opened fire, apparently unintentionally. Plenkovi\u0107 told reporters in Zagreb that claims against officers were allegations and not facts. He said: \u201cCroatia unlike some other countries did not opt for the erection of barriers nor install barbed wires with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Why? Because Bosnia and Herzegovina is a neighbouring country, a friendly country. \u201cWe shall not do that. What we shall do in preventing illegal migration is to respect our laws, international standards and conventions and all humanitarian aspects. If there are any allegations which might be problematic, everything we have heard is verified, checked and investigated. This is what we shall continue doing.\u201d Plenkovi\u0107, taking part in a joint press conference with the European council president, Charles Michel, said there was an urgent need to reinforce the EU\u2019s \u201cmost external borders \u2026 between Turkey and Greece and between Turkey and Bulgaria\u201d. Croatia hopes to join the border control-free Schengen Area of the EU by the end of 2020. The youngest EU member state is one of only six countries in the bloc that is not part of Schengen.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s easy to forget what a successful sitcom The Nanny was back in the 1990s. It won an Emmy and a Rose D\u2019Or. It was the subject of a reunion special just five years after it went off the air. It has been remade countless times around the world; as Dadi in Turkey, La Tata in Italy and My Fair Nanny in Russia. So the news that The Nanny will soon become a Broadway musical makes perfect sense.</p> <p>Creators Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/01/fran-drescher-rachel-bloom-the-nanny-broadway-musical-1202824670/\">announced</a> the project yesterday, with the pair writing the new show\u2019s book and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019s Rachel Bloom and Adam Schlesinger hired to write the songs. And while this might be premature, I think it could work. On TV, intentionally or otherwise, The Nanny always had a slightly unworldly quality to it, and a sense of self-awareness that drifted back and forth from total sincerity to flat-out fourth-wall-breaking. It always felt like more of a live performance than a fully realised sitcom, and so it might turn out that Broadway is its natural home.</p> <p>And if that\u2019s the case, the floodgates will open. Every sitcom you ever heard of will be rushing out its own version of a Broadway musical. That isn\u2019t to say that they should, however. Here are three sitcoms that deserve a musical, and three that absolutely do not.</p> <h2>Cheers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8b496a3063c36ab90f04f2bea301a049c33f9fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b496a3063c36ab90f04f2bea301a049c33f9fe/0_156_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Cheers was the perfect sitcom, and the elements that made it perfect would easily translate to the stage. It\u2019s primarily set in one location, for example, which would keep costs down. There\u2019s enough chemistry between Sam and Diane to underpin the requisite emotional stakes. And best of all, each character is distinct enough to carry at least one song. Frasier could get a fuddy duddy Gilbert and Sullivan patter number. Carla could grouch out something aggressive. And then there\u2019s Cliff, by far the most suitable candidate for an Andrew Lloyd-Webber-style torch song about a life squandered.</p> <p><em>Should it be a musical? Yes</em></p> <h2>30 Rock</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cfe0b7b24d63257f7dc515a2db5c58967200e52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cfe0b7b24d63257f7dc515a2db5c58967200e52/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you remember 30 Rock\u2019s insistence on occasionally meandering into the flabby wastelands of its live episodes, you\u2019ll understand why it should never be let anywhere near a theatre. 30 Rock is a great sitcom, and it has great incidental music, but its charm came from its speed and snappy editing. The live episodes were slower and far less precise, and you can easily imagine that this would translate to a Broadway musical. Unless it\u2019s just 90 minutes of people singing Werewolf Bar Mitzvah, in which case sign me up.</p> <p><em>Should it be a musical? No</em></p> <h2>It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc1bb485b1761f5140dbbad587e04535da41c157\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1bb485b1761f5140dbbad587e04535da41c157/0_226_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Now, this is a bit of a cheat, because It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has already sort of received the musical treatment. In 2009 it adapted the classic music-heavy episode The Nightman Cometh into a 45-minute <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_JnWCwz0Ak\">live show</a> that toured around six American cities. The results, by all accounts were fantastic. The fact that it isn\u2019t already a Broadway musical actively makes me angry.</p> <p><em>Should it be a musical? Yes</em></p> <h2>Saved by the Bell</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef40f471e98a805037e5a63cbda10b473f89bb77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef40f471e98a805037e5a63cbda10b473f89bb77/0_10_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saved by the Bell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There might be a musical in Saved by the Bell. If nothing else, Jessie Spano\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_JnWCwz0Ak\">caffeine pill-induced freakout performance of I\u2019m So Excited</a> could be expanded into a full-blown number complete with a lightshow and dancing girls. However, just because it\u2019s feasible, it doesn\u2019t mean that a Saved by the Bell musical should actually happen. Think of the crowds they would have to perform to.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s easy to forget what a successful sitcom The Nanny was back in the 1990s. It won an Emmy and a Rose D\u2019Or. It was the subject of a reunion special just five years after it went off the air. It has been remade countless times around the world; as Dadi in Turkey, La Tata in Italy and My Fair Nanny in Russia. So the news that The Nanny will soon become a Broadway musical makes perfect sense. Creators Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson announced the project yesterday, with the pair writing the new show\u2019s book and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019s Rachel Bloom and Adam Schlesinger hired to write the songs. And while this might be premature, I think it could work. On TV, intentionally or otherwise, The Nanny always had a slightly unworldly quality to it, and a sense of self-awareness that drifted back and forth from total sincerity to flat-out fourth-wall-breaking. It always felt like more of a live performance than a fully realised sitcom, and so it might turn out that Broadway is its natural home. And if that\u2019s the case, the floodgates will open. Every sitcom you ever heard of will be rushing out its own version of a Broadway musical. That isn\u2019t to say that they should, however. Here are three sitcoms that deserve a musical, and three that absolutely do not. Cheers Cheers was the perfect sitcom, and the elements that made it perfect would easily translate to the stage. It\u2019s primarily set in one location, for example, which would keep costs down. There\u2019s enough chemistry between Sam and Diane to underpin the requisite emotional stakes. And best of all, each character is distinct enough to carry at least one song. Frasier could get a fuddy duddy Gilbert and Sullivan patter number. Carla could grouch out something aggressive. And then there\u2019s Cliff, by far the most suitable candidate for an Andrew Lloyd-Webber-style torch song about a life squandered. Should it be a musical? Yes 30 Rock If you remember 30 Rock\u2019s insistence on occasionally meandering into the flabby wastelands of its live episodes, you\u2019ll understand why it should never be let anywhere near a theatre. 30 Rock is a great sitcom, and it has great incidental music, but its charm came from its speed and snappy editing. The live episodes were slower and far less precise, and you can easily imagine that this would translate to a Broadway musical. Unless it\u2019s just 90 minutes of people singing Werewolf Bar Mitzvah, in which case sign me up. Should it be a musical? No It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia Now, this is a bit of a cheat, because It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has already sort of received the musical treatment. In 2009 it adapted the classic music-heavy episode The Nightman Cometh into a 45-minute live show that toured around six American cities. The results, by all accounts were fantastic. The fact that it isn\u2019t already a Broadway musical actively makes me angry. Should it be a musical? Yes Saved by the Bell There might be a musical in Saved by the Bell. If nothing else, Jessie Spano\u2019s caffeine pill-induced freakout performance of I\u2019m So Excited could be expanded into a full-blown number complete with a lightshow and dancing girls. However, just because it\u2019s feasible, it doesn\u2019t mean that a Saved by the Bell musical should actually happen. Think of the crowds they would have to perform to. Wave after wave of ironic fortysomethings all dressed in bad clothes and whooping at Mr Belding. The cast would be drained of all their spirit by the second performance. Should it be a musical? No Bewitched A perfect candidate for a Broadway musical because every single episode was ultimately identical. A woman is a witch. Her husband doesn\u2019t want her to use her powers. His mother-in-law, enraged by his oppressive hold over her daughter, causes a magical mishap. The woman fixes it with magic to appease her bully of a husband. Everyone is happy again. What a perfect, universal lesson for everyone. Should it be a musical? Yes Friends A Friends musical would arguably be the most successful musical in the history of the world, given the sustained popularity of it as a television series. It would make money hand over fist regardless of quality. But would it be a worthwhile enterprise? Would it further the evolution of a noble art form while attempting to say something new about the human condition? Or would it just be loads of people in dated wigs singing songs called Pivot and We Were On A Break? Should it be a musical? No. But will it be? Probably",

The striker, who was hurt in the 1-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day, had been left to expect the worst after scans last Friday revealed a serious tear. He knew that he would not be back until March at the earliest. The reality has proved to be even more shocking \u2013 a setback to cast a shadow over Tottenham\u2019s season and, in terms of the England team, far from ideal in the countdown to Euro 2020. Will the captain have the time to recover maximum sharpness before the tournament kicks off? England\u2019s opening tie is against Croatia on 14 June. They play each of their three group ties at Wembley, which is also the venue for the semi-finals and final.

      "body": "<p>I was 18, and a sophomore in college, when Elizabeth Wurtzel\u2019s Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America was published. It wasn\u2019t really the kind of book I typically went for \u2013 I tended toward highly serious poetry and fiction, in my own way of coping with being a painfully self-conscious teenage girl \u2013 and I remember being a little taken aback at the casualness of her voice, her photo on the cover, the obvious self-marketing of it all. (Once again, I was 18, and sheltered.) But the book was good. It was carefully allusive and full of sharp details (cutting lines of cocaine on a Pogues CD; a tote bag of bloodied clothes). The voice on the page was smart, swerving, prickly, sometimes coy and self-aggrandizing, but undismissable. It practically bolted off the page, so inhabited, so present was it in every sentence. It was there even in what is typically a perfunctory author\u2019s note explaining that names have been changed; Wurtzel added: \u201cOtherwise, unfortunately for me, every detail is accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Opening the book by portraying herself curled up at a party crying while people looked on, a little bit annoyed by her latest outburst, Wurtzel unsparingly outed herself as a sometimes-out-of-control person \u2013 a \u201crock and roll girl who has violated her body with a tattoo and a nose ring,\u201d a girl her loving mother had given up on \u2013 suffering from almost unrelenting depression. It may be hard to believe now, but this was, in the moment, a radical thing to do. In doing so, it helped open the door for scores of young writers to disclose in literary memoirs, without the screen of fiction, what once would have seemed taboo.</p> <p>From today\u2019s vantage, her self-conscious, performative, complex persona, her willingness to mine her own life for material, especially <em>messy</em> material, looks \u2026 well, like what writers of autobiographical nonfiction often do. But in part that\u2019s because she did it, and did it well. Without Prozac Nation as a model before them, so many writers \u2013 me among them \u2013 might not have gone on to write memoirs about periods of difficulty.</p> <p>In 1994, I didn\u2019t know that a young woman could write like this, with a voice that was brash and unapologetically honest \u2013 both glamorizing and pragmatically humane. Because Wurtzel was a good writer, she mythologized her life with immersive intensity: when we first meet her in the book, she\u2019s in a puddle of black skirt on a white tile floor; later she describes her first suicide attempt, as an 11-year-old at summer camp, as the product of her recognition that she couldn\u2019t be like the other girls applying blue eye shadow as they \u201cpoured themselves into Sasson jeans and covered up with quilted satin jackets in pink and purple.\u201d (Sasson jeans!) She was jaded and hardboiled, which made her alluring, but also desperately sad, intense, needy, unrelenting \u2013 all of which she knew, and let the reader know she knew.</p> <p>It was this combination of factors \u2013 the very thing that led some critics to hate the book (\u201ca coy bid for public attention\u201d) \u2013 that was the source of its power: she started a dialogue about mental illness because she allowed all the challenging complexity of her suffering to come through.</p> <p>This was the thing about Prozac Nation: it didn\u2019t just popularize a new genre of memoir. It also, in combination with books like William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible and Peter Kramer\u2019s Listening to Prozac, helped change how Americans viewed \u2013 and talked about \u2013 mental illness, transforming depression from a silent, stigmatized affliction to a mainstream condition that could affect anyone.</p> <p>Wurtzel helped normalize depression, just as the frank, hilarious friend you meet in high school, or in college, or as a new mother, helps normalize all the things you are scared to say out loud or even acknowledge to yourself.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to overstate how much this altered the popular consciousness, especially for young people. In 1994, I barely knew you could talk about depression and mental illness. I had a boyfriend who had tried to commit suicide before I met him, a boyfriend who confided in me that he took Prozac, a fact I treated with tender protectiveness, worrying over him in the dark reaches of the night when I woke and he was far away. It was a fact I wouldn\u2019t have freely shared, even anonymously, because I didn\u2019t know anyone else on antidepressants.</p> <p>Now mental illness \u2013 depression in particular \u2013 is part of our lingua franca. Wurtzel\u2019s memoir helped accomplish this. At the time, though, I remember there was a feeling in the air, among some of the young writers I knew, that her book was not quite serious. That by adopting a slightly theatrical attitude toward herself and by <em>revealing</em> so much (\u201cluridly intimate,\u201d one reviewer wrote), she was cheapening something or making easy what was supposed to be hard to share \u2013 or, perhaps, more palatably packaged. After all, she wrote with what almost felt like glee (because her voice is so infectious) about the sex and drug binges, the masochism, the despair, the inability to stop herself.</p> <p>The irony is that from today all this looks prescient; as a writer, she was in possession of the wit, the theatrical habit for self-revelation that has become a hallmark of being a social media persona. (\u201cI was a hashtag before there was Twitter,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/elizabeth-wurtzel-on-discovering-the-truth-about-her-parents.html\">wrote</a> in <em>The Cut</em> in 2018.) Interestingly, she also identified the dangers of the medical system\u2019s casual overprescribing of SSRIs without understanding enough about how they worked. But perhaps what\u2019s most striking about rereading Prozac Nation today is that the book is not nearly as \u201ccynical\u201d or \u201cdisaffected\u201d in that characteristic Gen X way as I had remembered it.

Actually grabbed it at the side ... Just do one man look just so you get the motion right, come on.\u201d</p> <p>Atkinson said cut marks were found on a canvas wardrobe in Chowdhury\u2019s room which were \u201cconsistent with just such knife training\u201d, and that knife and wooden training swords were later found in a search of the defendant\u2019s bedroom.</p> <p>In another recording, he told his sister: \u201cI\u2019m doing another attack, bruv \u2026 No I\u2019m serious, bro, it\u2019s about time now.\u201d</p> <p>Sneha Chowdhury, 25, of the same address, is on trial alongside her brother. After the siblings were arrested in July 2019, she told police that the conversations with her brother were light-hearted.</p> <p>But accusing her of failing to stop her brother, Atkinson said: \u201cTheir conversation made all too clear both that he was planning a terrorist attack and that the time of that attack was drawing very close.\u201d</p> <p>From January 2019, three undercover officers worked to earn Mohiussunnath Chowdhury\u2019s trust and the court heard that he had a conversation with one of them \u2013 nicknamed Mikael \u2013 about a van attack at a Pride parade.</p> <p>Mikael asked Chowdhury if he wanted a van for \u201csomething like the gay thing\u201d they had discussed, the jury was told. Atkinson said Chowdhury was \u201canimated and smiling\u201d when discussing it and was clearly looking at using the vehicle \u201cas a weapon in a terrorist attack\u201d.</p> <p>Chowdhury also insisted that Mikael get a gun, the court heard.</p> <p>Chowdhury was found not guilty of the incident outside Buckingham Palace after telling an Old Bailey jury he wanted to be killed by police and had no intention to hurt anyone but himself.</p> <p>He denies charges of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, collecting information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and disseminating terrorist publications.</p> <p>His sister denies two charges of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.</p> <p>The case continues.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A man cleared of a 2017 sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace demonstrated to his sister how to stab someone as he plotted a terrorist atrocity last year, a court has heard. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 28, of Luton, is accused of planning attacks against targets including Madame Tussauds and the London Pride parade, two years after a jury acquitted him on charges relating to the 2017 incident. On Thursday, prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told Woolwich crown court that in June last year, unaware their family home had been bugged, Chowdhury was secretly recorded talking to his sister, Sneha Chowdhury, 25. He said: \u201cGrab them yeah. Actually grabbed it at the side ... Just do one man look just so you get the motion right, come on.\u201d Atkinson said cut marks were found on a canvas wardrobe in Chowdhury\u2019s room which were \u201cconsistent with just such knife training\u201d, and that knife and wooden training swords were later found in a search of the defendant\u2019s bedroom. In another recording, he told his sister: \u201cI\u2019m doing another attack, bruv \u2026 No I\u2019m serious, bro, it\u2019s about time now.\u201d Sneha Chowdhury, 25, of the same address, is on trial alongside her brother. After the siblings were arrested in July 2019, she told police that the conversations with her brother were light-hearted. But accusing her of failing to stop her brother, Atkinson said: \u201cTheir conversation made all too clear both that he was planning a terrorist attack and that the time of that attack was drawing very close.\u201d From January 2019, three undercover officers worked to earn Mohiussunnath Chowdhury\u2019s trust and the court heard that he had a conversation with one of them \u2013 nicknamed Mikael \u2013 about a van attack at a Pride parade. Mikael asked Chowdhury if he wanted a van for \u201csomething like the gay thing\u201d they had discussed, the jury was told. Atkinson said Chowdhury was \u201canimated and smiling\u201d when discussing it and was clearly looking at using the vehicle \u201cas a weapon in a terrorist attack\u201d. Chowdhury also insisted that Mikael get a gun, the court heard. Chowdhury was found not guilty of the incident outside Buckingham Palace after telling an Old Bailey jury he wanted to be killed by police and had no intention to hurt anyone but himself. He denies charges of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, collecting information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and disseminating terrorist publications. His sister denies two charges of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has given a ringing endorsement to Boris Johnson and Brexit, offering a pointer as to which European capitals are likely to be friendliest to post-Brexit Britain. Orb\u00e1n said Johnson and Donald Trump were \u201cthe most courageous, the most dynamic and the most ready to effect change\u201d of all the politicians in the world today. The admiration is mutual: it emerged this week that Tim Montgomerie, a former aide of Johnson, said he expected Britain and Hungary to forge a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d after Brexit, and praised Orb\u00e1n\u2019s thinking on the \u201climits of liberalism\u201d. Most European leaders have expressed their dismay at Brexit, but Orb\u00e1n, who believes Europe is \u201cunder attack\u201d from Muslim migrants and has claimed the Jewish Hungarian-American philanthropist and financier George Soros has a plot to destroy Europe, said he is a fan. \u201cThey have opened this vast door of opportunities for themselves. I\u2019m sure there is a success story that will be written there,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n, during his annual press conference in Budapest on Thursday. He implied that if Hungary had the same financial, diplomatic and military strength as Britain, it may also have considered leaving the bloc. His comments came as Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, warned in a speech in Sweden that failure to seal a deal on trade over the next 11 months would damage the UK more than the 27 remaining member states. \u201cYes, the UK represents 9% of all EU27 trade. But more significantly, the EU27 accounts for 43% of all UK exports and 50% of its imports,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cSo, it is clear that if we fail to reach a deal, it will be more harmful for the UK than for the EU27.\u201d Also on Thursday, Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, warned that negotiations over access to British waters for the EU fishing fleet had the potential to end in a repeat of the cod wars of the 1970s, when the UK was forced to deploy the Royal Navy to deal with outbreaks of violence on the seas. Speaking as his country assumed the six-month presidency of the EU council , Plenkovi\u0107 said he \u201cnever thought Brexit was a very bright idea\u201d. Orb\u00e1n, however, criticised European leaders who thought Brussels held the cards in the negotiations and called on Europe to be \u201cgenerous\u201d during the next 11 months. \u201cI think the EU misunderstands the situation, because they believe that a good relationship with UK is the Brits\u2019 interest, but it is our interest too, the other members of the EU,\u201d he said. He paid a lengthy tribute to Johnson\u2019s election victory last month. \u201cThe whole world was against him: the liberal leftist media, the global Soros network and all the tools of the pro-remain EU, but just because he and the British people believe in democracy, they\u2019ve done it,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n. The Hungarian prime minister has been in power since 2010, and in 2018 he won a third consecutive term. His government is in trouble with Brussels over corruption and rule of law issues, and has spent the past five years campaigning relentlessly on the supposed threat to \u201cChristian Europe\u201d from migration. Orb\u00e1n has promoted conspiracy theories, usually with antisemitic undertones, about the overarching influence of George Soros in Hungary and across Europe, and has also tapped into another far-right conspiracy theory, that of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d. He has built a fence along the country\u2019s border with Serbia, and his government has been accused by human rights groups of starving migrants by denying them food in the transit zones where they must process asylum claims. While all this has been criticised by rights groups and many European politicians, Montgomerie, a former journalist who was hired as a senior adviser to Johnson last September, praised the Hungarian government\u2019s ideology, saying there was a lot for Britain to learn from Orb\u00e1n, and promising close relations with the country after Brexit. \u201cBudapest and Hungary have been home, I think, for an awful lot of interesting early thinking on the limits of liberalism, and I think we are seeing that in the UK as well.

National action plans have been adopted by many of the worst affected countries; a UK team of experts has been deployed 90 times to respond to the urgent needs of survivors; and several leading national militaries have improved training and doctrine in line with the aims of PSVI. Further progress has come in the form of legal reform in key nations, sometimes leading to prosecutions and compensation awards, as well as new funding for NGOs and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, and a new global effort on tackling stigma among victims. The 2014 global summit demonstrated that there is a vast global appetite to address these issues if efforts are focused and led. From 2012 to 2014, clear championing of PSVI by the UK, at the most senior levels, showed that considerable momentum could be generated through persistent and senior advocacy by a prominent nation present in most global fora, allied to an imaginative campaign. There are many obstacles to global action on such issues and, to many governments, our raising of the issue with them at the highest level seemed to come as a shock. When I presented the case for action to the G8 foreign ministers in London in 2013, they initially reacted with surprise (in many cases) and obvious bemusement (on the part of some). An issue of this kind was not seen as part of a standard foreign policy discussion, but many of the ministers involved went on to become passionate supporters of the initiative, others became regional champions of the work, and every one of the 156 nations signing the declaration made formal commitments to which they should be held. However, despite the valiant efforts of Lord Ahmad, there are clear signs of the usual global inertia returning. There should be a systematic review of the commitments made by the countries and organisations that participated in the 2014 summit, involving NGOs and survivor organisations. Where countries have fallen short of their previous commitments, there should be a diplomatic campaign to urge them to keep their promises, as well as to generate the political will needed to address current conflicts where sexual violence has been rampant. There is a compelling need for a permanent international investigatory body, capable of gathering evidence and preparing case files, to increase the prospects of more successful prosecutions. And governments should increase the proportion of their development budgets that they devote to programmes supporting survivors of sexual violence and other gender-based crimes. The UK is still in a position to lead, and the fact that the government plans to hold a major conference this year presents an opportunity to intensify its work.

      "body": "<p>From 31 January any mention of the word Brexit will officially be punishable by death. Anyone who is even suspected of thinking about Brexit will be condemned to a public show trial. As far as the government is concerned, the UK will have left the EU and that\u2019s an end to it. Even to discuss the details of a future arrangement will be considered grossly unpatriotic, with offenders being sent to re-education camps.</p> <p>This is the way the Brexit department ends. Not with a bang, but by being airbrushed out of history. And to mark the occasion of his department\u2019s final question session in the Commons, Stephen Barclay was determined to end his ministerial career as he had started it \u2013 with complete and utter anonymity. For Barclay it is a matter of pride to never say anything memorable. His whole job as Brexit secretary was to do next to nothing and he has fulfilled the brief superbly. At times he has even uttered sentences that have put himself to sleep.</p> <p>\u201cIs this the end of the department?\u201d said Hilary Benn plaintively. The chairman of the Brexit select committee can see his own position disappearing at the very moment when he knows his job was really only just beginning. Another reason why Dominic Cummings was so keen to see the end of the Brexit department. Parliamentary scrutiny is for losers.</p> <p>It looks that way, Barclay shrugged. He did not seem unduly bothered that his department was being wound up prematurely. Why should he? He knows there will always be a place in government for someone who can effortlessly fill dead air with even deader air and Boris Johnson is sure to offer him something else.

      "bodyText": "From 31 January any mention of the word Brexit will officially be punishable by death. Anyone who is even suspected of thinking about Brexit will be condemned to a public show trial. As far as the government is concerned, the UK will have left the EU and that\u2019s an end to it. Even to discuss the details of a future arrangement will be considered grossly unpatriotic, with offenders being sent to re-education camps. This is the way the Brexit department ends. Not with a bang, but by being airbrushed out of history. And to mark the occasion of his department\u2019s final question session in the Commons, Stephen Barclay was determined to end his ministerial career as he had started it \u2013 with complete and utter anonymity. For Barclay it is a matter of pride to never say anything memorable. His whole job as Brexit secretary was to do next to nothing and he has fulfilled the brief superbly. At times he has even uttered sentences that have put himself to sleep. \u201cIs this the end of the department?\u201d said Hilary Benn plaintively. The chairman of the Brexit select committee can see his own position disappearing at the very moment when he knows his job was really only just beginning. Another reason why Dominic Cummings was so keen to see the end of the Brexit department. Parliamentary scrutiny is for losers. It looks that way, Barclay shrugged. He did not seem unduly bothered that his department was being wound up prematurely. Why should he? He knows there will always be a place in government for someone who can effortlessly fill dead air with even deader air and Boris Johnson is sure to offer him something else. Not least when there are other deadbeats such as Andrea Leadsom and Liz Truss whom he can easily replace. That\u2019s one of the joys of the current cabinet. So many jobs, so little talent.

      "body": "<p>Harry Kupfer, who has died aged 84, was a towering figure in opera production with a career spanning 60 years. A native of Berlin, for the first two decades he worked largely behind the iron curtain, but a handful of productions in the west in the 1970s led to a landmark Flying Dutchman at the Bayreuth festival in 1978, followed by an equally trailblazing staging of Wagner\u2019s Ring there in 1988.</p> <p>The two greatest avowed influences on Kupfer\u2019s dramaturgy were Walter Felsenstein and Bertolt Brecht \u2013 he called them his \u201cspiritual forefathers\u201d. From the former (though he never worked directly with him) he imbibed the principles of realistic music theatre (as opposed to singers\u2019 opera), emphasising the importance of character, motivation and dramatic immediacy. From the latter he inherited the idea of distancing the audience from the action on stage: theatregoers should be critical and engaged rather than passive and emotionally manipulated. The result of this twin influence was a style that was intellectually rigorous but at the same time powerfully communicative.</p> <p>The Bayreuth Flying Dutchman that brought him to worldwide attention provided an incisive psychological reassessment of the predicament of the heroine, Senta, in terms of socially induced alienation and neurosis, but also an electrifying theatrical experience. In the same year he made his UK debut with an Elektra for Welsh National Opera (WNO) that matched the score\u2019s savage violence with a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne depicting a barbaric slaughterhouse, littered with blood-spattered carcasses. His characteristically polemical Fidelio, also for WNO (1981) alluded in its final tableau to freedom fighters past and present, while his Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande for English National Opera (1981) dispensed with naturalistic props, treating the work as an allegory akin to Thomas Mann\u2019s Magic Mountain, with its metaphors of psychosomatic illness and its inhabitants reluctant to leave the refuge of the sanatorium.</p> <p>Kupfer\u2019s Bayreuth Ring was a densely allusive, socially critical exploration of the cycle that integrated mythological and contemporary planes so as to address the issues of accumulated wealth and power, ruination of the natural environment and global destruction, while remaining faithful to the work\u2019s timeless universality. Before a note of music was heard, a post-holocaust group of men and women stared bitterly out at the audience, suggesting that we were observing a true cycle of human history \u2013 one we have the power to transcend if only we would learn the lesson. The ash tree in Die Walk\u00fcre was dead and the forest in Siegfried had clearly been laid waste by an ecological disaster. The image of Valhalla as a Manhattan-style skyscraper alluded to the role of capital in this apocalyptic scenario. Replete with socio-political awareness, psychological observation and striking theatricality, it remains one of the key productions in the Ring\u2019s stage history.</p> <p>Kupfer spoke of his approach to production as beginning, perhaps surprisingly, not with the text but with the music. \u201cAll my fantasy comes when I hear or read the music,\u201d he said. Having attempted to grasp the composer\u2019s meaning, he then turned to the text, creating a dialectical relationship between the two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94ac07b66a333116c3dd500ec46fbd55e1f74788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94ac07b66a333116c3dd500ec46fbd55e1f74788/0_78_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A performance of Richard Wagner\u2019s Das Rheingold at the Berlin Staatsoper, 1996, directed by Harry Kupfer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A performance of Richard Wagner\u2019s Das Rheingold at the Berlin Staatsoper, 1996, directed by Harry Kupfer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Impatient with those who wanted opera to provide a haven from politics, Kupfer also spoke of his desire to build a bridge from the time of a work\u2019s creation to the present day and of his wish to provoke the audience to find its own context for a work. He was one of the finest exponents of what is known in German as Personenregie (\u201cdirection of the characters\u201d), encompassing a fusion of text, music, gesture, mime, characterisation and stage choreography.</p> <p>Always well prepared himself, he expected his singers to know their parts perfectly by the first rehearsal. While his approach was undoubtedly serious, he had a wry sense of humour and his style was explicatory rather than dogmatic. In his prime he was energetic and constantly mobile, except when drawing on his pipe. In the rehearsal room he was demanding but endlessly stimulating, working in meticulous detail with his singing actors to tease out textual nuances and embody them with appropriate stage action.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"https://johntomlinson.org/\" title=\"\">John Tomlinson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/aug/07/classicalmusicandopera.proms20031\" title=\"\">Anne Evans</a>, his Wotan and Br\u00fcnnhilde in the Bayreuth Ring, have spoken of his remarkable ability to develop original but convincing characterisations in collaboration with his performer colleagues. A notable example was seen in Act III of Die Walk\u00fcre. According to an aper\u00e7u of Kupfer, it gradually dawns on Wotan that his fathering of a noble race will one day provide the hero required to deny Alberich the ring and create a new generation free of its curse. Tomlinson\u2019s ecstatic demeanour and Evans\u2019s portrayal of the Valkyrie, \u201clike a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis,\u201d as she has described it, combined with singing and playing of the highest quality, produced an enactment of shattering potency.</p> <p>Kupfer was born in Berlin and was an opera enthusiast from an early age. He often absented himself from school on days when he could hear Der Rosenkavalier or Tristan und Isolde at the Staatsoper under Erich Kleiber. In postwar East Germany, after studying theatre science at the Hans Otto Theaterschule in Leipzig, he became an assistant at the Landestheater in Halle, where he made his production debut with Rusalka in 1958. He was then successively Oberspielleiter (senior director) at the Theater der Werftstadt in Stralsund (1958\u201362), senior resident director at the St\u00e4dtische Theater in Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz; 1962\u201366) and opera director of the Nationaltheater in Weimar (1966\u201372). From 1967 to 1972 he also taught at the Franz Liszt Musikhochschule in Weimar.</p> <p>In 1971 he made his debut at the Berlin Staatsoper with Die Frau ohne Schatten and the following year was appointed opera director at the Dresden Staatsoper, remaining in the post until 1981 and winning renown for himself and the opera house with adventurous programming and challenging productions of works such as Moses und Aron (1975), Tristan und Isolde (1975) and Simon Boccanegra (1980).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d77a7e43b7bfdd0007a678aa9508ec34492054eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d77a7e43b7bfdd0007a678aa9508ec34492054eb/0_221_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, by Bertolt Brecht, staged by Harry Kupfer at the Dresden Semperoper, 2005.

A typically successful production at the Komische Oper was that of The Marriage of Figaro (1986), which highlighted the social repression and chauvinism of the world depicted by Beaumarchais. In 1989 two of his many Komische Oper productions were brought to Covent Garden: a Bartered Bride that got behind the folksy facade to the underlying social realities, and an Orfeo ed Euridice that addressed the dilemma of the artist in society, relocating the myth against a bleak background of contemporary urban decline.</p> <p>With the conductor <a href=\"https://danielbarenboim.com/\" title=\"\">Daniel Barenboim</a> he built up a complete cycle of the major Wagner works at the Berlin Staatsoper in the 90s. Parsifal was one of several works he revisited on more than one occasion. His third production, for Tokyo (2014), placed a trio of silent Buddhist monks on stage, gradually drawn into the action and acting as spiritual advisers to Parsifal as he achieves enlightenment. His Rosenkavalier for Salzburg in the same year was representative in its deftness of social observation and ravishingly executed, with scenography by his long-term designer <a href=\"http://arsis-artists.com/en/hans-schavernoch/\" title=\"\">Hans Schavernoch</a>.</p> <p>New works he premiered included Udo Zimmermann\u2019s Levins M\u00fchle (Dresden, 1973), Penderecki\u2019s Die Schwarze Maske (Salzburg, 1986) \u2013 for which he collaborated with the composer on the libretto \u2013 and Aribert Reimann\u2019s Bernarda Albas Haus (Munich, 2000).</p> <p>He continued to work on the international stage until his death, returning to the Komische Oper with an acclaimed production of Handel\u2019s Poro in 2019.</p> <p>His wife, the soprano Marianne Fischer, died in 2008. He is survived by their daughter, Kristiane.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>\u2022 Harry Alfred Robert Kupfer, opera director, born 12 August 1935; died 30 December 2019</p>",

Kupfer\u2019s Bayreuth Ring was a densely allusive, socially critical exploration of the cycle that integrated mythological and contemporary planes so as to address the issues of accumulated wealth and power, ruination of the natural environment and global destruction, while remaining faithful to the work\u2019s timeless universality. Before a note of music was heard, a post-holocaust group of men and women stared bitterly out at the audience, suggesting that we were observing a true cycle of human history \u2013 one we have the power to transcend if only we would learn the lesson. The ash tree in Die Walk\u00fcre was dead and the forest in Siegfried had clearly been laid waste by an ecological disaster. The image of Valhalla as a Manhattan-style skyscraper alluded to the role of capital in this apocalyptic scenario. Replete with socio-political awareness, psychological observation and striking theatricality, it remains one of the key productions in the Ring\u2019s stage history. Kupfer spoke of his approach to production as beginning, perhaps surprisingly, not with the text but with the music. \u201cAll my fantasy comes when I hear or read the music,\u201d he said. Having attempted to grasp the composer\u2019s meaning, he then turned to the text, creating a dialectical relationship between the two. Impatient with those who wanted opera to provide a haven from politics, Kupfer also spoke of his desire to build a bridge from the time of a work\u2019s creation to the present day and of his wish to provoke the audience to find its own context for a work. He was one of the finest exponents of what is known in German as Personenregie (\u201cdirection of the characters\u201d), encompassing a fusion of text, music, gesture, mime, characterisation and stage choreography. Always well prepared himself, he expected his singers to know their parts perfectly by the first rehearsal. While his approach was undoubtedly serious, he had a wry sense of humour and his style was explicatory rather than dogmatic. In his prime he was energetic and constantly mobile, except when drawing on his pipe. In the rehearsal room he was demanding but endlessly stimulating, working in meticulous detail with his singing actors to tease out textual nuances and embody them with appropriate stage action. Both John Tomlinson and Anne Evans, his Wotan and Br\u00fcnnhilde in the Bayreuth Ring, have spoken of his remarkable ability to develop original but convincing characterisations in collaboration with his performer colleagues. A notable example was seen in Act III of Die Walk\u00fcre. According to an aper\u00e7u of Kupfer, it gradually dawns on Wotan that his fathering of a noble race will one day provide the hero required to deny Alberich the ring and create a new generation free of its curse. Tomlinson\u2019s ecstatic demeanour and Evans\u2019s portrayal of the Valkyrie, \u201clike a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis,\u201d as she has described it, combined with singing and playing of the highest quality, produced an enactment of shattering potency. Kupfer was born in Berlin and was an opera enthusiast from an early age. He often absented himself from school on days when he could hear Der Rosenkavalier or Tristan und Isolde at the Staatsoper under Erich Kleiber. In postwar East Germany, after studying theatre science at the Hans Otto Theaterschule in Leipzig, he became an assistant at the Landestheater in Halle, where he made his production debut with Rusalka in 1958. He was then successively Oberspielleiter (senior director) at the Theater der Werftstadt in Stralsund (1958\u201362), senior resident director at the St\u00e4dtische Theater in Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz; 1962\u201366) and opera director of the Nationaltheater in Weimar (1966\u201372). From 1967 to 1972 he also taught at the Franz Liszt Musikhochschule in Weimar. In 1971 he made his debut at the Berlin Staatsoper with Die Frau ohne Schatten and the following year was appointed opera director at the Dresden Staatsoper, remaining in the post until 1981 and winning renown for himself and the opera house with adventurous programming and challenging productions of works such as Moses und Aron (1975), Tristan und Isolde (1975) and Simon Boccanegra (1980). From 1981 he was director of Komische Oper Berlin and professor at the Musikhochschule Hanns Eisler, also in Berlin. A typically successful production at the Komische Oper was that of The Marriage of Figaro (1986), which highlighted the social repression and chauvinism of the world depicted by Beaumarchais. In 1989 two of his many Komische Oper productions were brought to Covent Garden: a Bartered Bride that got behind the folksy facade to the underlying social realities, and an Orfeo ed Euridice that addressed the dilemma of the artist in society, relocating the myth against a bleak background of contemporary urban decline. With the conductor Daniel Barenboim he built up a complete cycle of the major Wagner works at the Berlin Staatsoper in the 90s. Parsifal was one of several works he revisited on more than one occasion. His third production, for Tokyo (2014), placed a trio of silent Buddhist monks on stage, gradually drawn into the action and acting as spiritual advisers to Parsifal as he achieves enlightenment. His Rosenkavalier for Salzburg in the same year was representative in its deftness of social observation and ravishingly executed, with scenography by his long-term designer Hans Schavernoch. New works he premiered included Udo Zimmermann\u2019s Levins M\u00fchle (Dresden, 1973), Penderecki\u2019s Die Schwarze Maske (Salzburg, 1986) \u2013 for which he collaborated with the composer on the libretto \u2013 and Aribert Reimann\u2019s Bernarda Albas Haus (Munich, 2000). He continued to work on the international stage until his death, returning to the Komische Oper with an acclaimed production of Handel\u2019s Poro in 2019. His wife, the soprano Marianne Fischer, died in 2008. He is survived by their daughter, Kristiane. \u2022 Harry Alfred Robert Kupfer, opera director, born 12 August 1935; died 30 December 2019",

Local Government, which described it as a town on two occasions.</p> <p>Nineteen years ago Wolverhampton was one of three towns named as a Millennium 2000 City after a decade-long campaign by local MPs and councillors, fighting off competition from 36 other places.</p> <p>The disclosure in the Guardian was particularly embarrassing for Jenrick, who was born and educated in Wolverhampton, which became a city when he was 18. Civic figures have claimed it is proof that the Tories are paying lip service to the UK\u2019s struggling towns.</p> <p>In an interview with Sky News on Thursday, Jenrick claimed that his department did not get it wrong and denied that he did not know that Wolverhampton was a city. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We didn\u2019t launch this competition in Wolverhampton.</p> <p>Having been born and bred in Wolverhampton I don\u2019t need the Guardian to tell me that it was a town and is now a city.

It reads: \u201cCommunities secretary announces new Town of the Year competition to celebrate thriving towns.\u201d It goes on to say Jenrick would be in Wolverhampton and quotes him as saying: \u201cTo celebrate the achievements of our towns, we are launching a national Town of the Year competition.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Andrew Gwynne</strong>, the shadow communities secretary, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This whole announcement has been a farce, but the real tragedy is whether in towns or cities our communities are struggling after a decade of cuts.</p> <p>Instead of pitting towns or cities against each other in a beauty contest - the government should be properly funding our vital public services.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6e2d5d00de41a5abcb35d14dd43dfaa6d5adf22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6e2d5d00de41a5abcb35d14dd43dfaa6d5adf22/0_15_2254_1352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Jenrick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Jenrick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T16:35:14.796Z\">at 4.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1750468f085eda5c11510d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T16:10:42.768Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Justin Madders </strong>says he has nominated Lisa Nandy for leader, and Angela Rayner for deputy leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/justinmadders/status/1215277783036940289\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pleased to have nominated <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisanandy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@lisanandy</a> for the position of Labour Leader- lots of the candidates have great qualities, all have something to offer , but Lisa has been talking about many of the same issues I have been concerned about and they need to be aired during the contest <a href=\"https://t.co/2FGIVJdz44\">pic.twitter.com/2FGIVJdz44</a></p>&mdash; Justin Madders MP (@justinmadders) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinmadders/status/1215277783036940289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/justinmadders/status/1215282167305195525\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am backing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelaRayner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AngelaRayner</a> for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party- it will be a critical role in the years ahead and I am confident Angie can play a big part in getting us back into Government <a href=\"https://t.co/KoXzBZMgQi\">pic.twitter.com/KoXzBZMgQi</a></p>&mdash; Justin Madders MP (@justinmadders) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinmadders/status/1215282167305195525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e174f7b8f087e8308e6b73a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T16:06:32.035Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From my colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1215301602518716421\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In a busy day of a phone calls Boris Johnson has also spoken to President Zelensky of Ukraine, saying he wants to see a \u201cfull, credible and transparent investigation\u201d into the crash of the Ukrainian airliner in Iran.</p>&mdash; Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1215301602518716421?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e174e9e8f085eda5c115100\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T16:04:35.705Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rosena Allin-Khan,</strong> the Labour MP for Tooting who is standing for the deputy leadership, has drafted a code of conduct for leader and deputy leadership candidates to sign.

It has been a relatively pedestrian affair \u2013 it is hard to say anything new about Brexit at this point, ministers are not revealing much about their strategy for the trade talks, and the government majority means opposition MPs can do almost nothing to change the bill \u2013 but there are some quotes anyway, from the Press Association wire.</p> <p><strong>Paul Blomfield,</strong> the shadow Brexit minister, said the government should not assume that its election victory was a mandate for a very hard Brexit. He told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Leaving the EU doesn\u2019t mean that we will have got Brexit done. We\u2019ll have completed the first step, departure, but the difficult stage is yet to come.</p> <p>I would though, urge the government, as we move into this next stage, not to over-interpret its mandate in the general election ...</p> <p>The decision of the general election isn\u2019t a mandate to bulldoze through a particular version at any cost on all the people of the United Kingdom, and the next few months need to be approached with sensitivity and with caution if we are to stay together as a United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fleur Anderson</strong>, the new Labour MP for Putney, said the bill could encourage racism. In her maiden speech she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are high risks that racism and discrimination will be given permission by this bill. I\u2019ve seen it happen, it happened straight after the referendum and it\u2019s happened since. So it\u2019s very important to say here in this place that we may be leaving the EU but we\u2019re proud of our place in Europe and the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the SNP\u2019s <strong>Pete Wishart </strong>said the government was losing Scotland. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The government] may have won their hard Brexit, but they have most definitely lost Scotland ...</p> <p>It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. Scotland will be an independent country. The sooner this house recognises it the better.</p> <p>The battle for us to have Brexit is over, they\u2019ve won.

The interim Conservative leader, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Jackson Carlaw</strong>\u2019s attack on <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Nicola Sturgeon</strong>\u2019s education record probably has to be seen in the context of his current bid for party leadership to replace Ruth Davidson, as he promised that 2020 would be the year of holding the SNP government to account.</p> <p>Likewise, the Scottish Labour leader, <strong>Richard Leonard</strong>, mounted a dissection of social care services, arguing that the failing integration of health and social care services alongside council funding cuts were the direct responsibility of the Scottish government. </p> <p>As usual, Westminster was not far away: Sturgeon responded that her government was working to protect heath and social care within a very constrained overall budget, the ultimate result of Westminster austerity. Similarly, she rebuffed attempts to criticise the SNP\u2019s record by repeating that the public had given their verdict in last month\u2019s election. One might argue this is not necessarily a direct conclusion of the SNP\u2019s general election success, given that a Westminster campaign does not scrutinise their performance in Holyrood.</p> <p>But when Brexit was mentioned directly, with a question about Wednesday\u2019s decisive Holyrood vote to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, Sturgeon repeated what is now an entirely familiar call for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide its own future. While yesterday\u2019s vote was entirely symbolic \u2013 Holyrood can\u2019t bind the Westminster parliament in this way \u2013 it does add to the growing narrative of Scotland as entirely divergent politically from the rest of the UK. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c4d19725247413dc8205365660b268e5efd8485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c4d19725247413dc8205365660b268e5efd8485/0_185_5326_3196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon at first minister\u2019s questions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon at first minister\u2019s questions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T14:17:31.159Z\">at 2.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1731b88f08c397226478c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T14:01:15.335Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the New Statesman\u2019s <strong>Stephen Bush </strong>on Barry Gardiner\u2019s possible run for the Labour leadership.

I would like to talk through with you how we can improve employment rights in this country, how we can have safer standards at work, and all the things that we are about ...

The text of his speech is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_20_13\">here</a>, and there is video of the meeting<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EUkommissionen/\"> on the Facebook page for the European commission in Sweden.</a> Most of what he said was quite familiar, but there were some lines worth flagging up.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Barnier said that the EU would continue to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020.</strong> That was because there was a possibility that the UK and the EU might fail to reach an agreement this year, which would lead to no-deal because the UK government is ruling out an extension of the post-Brexit transition. He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Prime Minister Johnson does not want an extension of the transition period beyond the end of the year \u2013 and yesterday when we met him with Ursula von der Leyen, he told us very clearly that he does not want such an extension \u2013 we will have less than 11 months to conclude a deal.</p> <p>If we fail, the transition period will end on 1 January 2021 without any arrangements for a new future relationship in place.</p> <p>This would not affect the issues covered in the withdrawal agreement ...</p> <p>But it would mean the return of tariffs and quotas: a total anachronism for interconnected economies like ours.</p> <p>Of course, this is not what the EU wants.</p> <p>But it is nonetheless a scenario that everyone must continue to prepare for \u2013 at EU level, but also at national level, and here in Sweden.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Barnier restated the EU\u2019s belief that it would be impossible to conclude a comprehensive agreement with the UK this year.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will strive for a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope: covering everything from services and fisheries, to climate action, energy, transport, space, security and defence.</p> <p>But that is a huge agenda. And we simply cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of this new partnership in under a year ...</p> <p>If we want to agree on each and every point of this political declaration \u2013 which would lead to an unprecedented relationship \u2013 it will take more than 11 months.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, <a href=\"http://Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, made the same point when she was in London with Barnier yesterday to meet Johnson.\">made the same point </a>when she was in London with Barnier yesterday to meet Johnson.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Barnier said the EU would insist on fishing being included as part of an overall trade deal.</strong> In the Q&amp;A he was asked how the trade negotiations would be conducted, and whether the EU would insist on the principle that \u201cnothing is agreed until everything is agreed\u201d that applied during the first stage of the negotiations. Barnier said this time the negotiations would be carried out in a different way. But he went on:<br></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But there are some sectors where the point will remain linked. If I have to be more precise, speaking about economy and trade, there will be no agreement without global agreement on trade for goods, the level playing field and fisheries. I think I\u2019m clear.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barnier said there would be a parallel negotiation covering security and defence. But he said he wanted to be \u201cvery clear\u201d about the need for trade, level playing field rules and fishing to be considered together. This may turn out to be a flashpoint in the talks because the fishing industry is not happy about the idea that EU access to British waters may get given away in the hope of securing concessions in other parts of the trade talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fd2d9d22c744b274613f8171c6faa4c1365cd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fd2d9d22c744b274613f8171c6faa4c1365cd9/0_86_4233_2540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, speaking in Stockholm this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, speaking in Stockholm this morning.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1701728f085eda5c114d41\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T10:46:39.636Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a question from a reader below the line (BTL) that I should have addressed in the post on the private members\u2019 bills ballot.

She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a number of people who have pledged to support me.

Diane Abbott was the beneficiary in 2010, and of course Jeremy Corbyn made it onto the ballot through this route in 2015. But the decision to nominate Corbyn did not work out quite in the way many people expected, and this time around there is no evidence that any MPs are planning to nominate a candidate they don\u2019t really support just in the hope of widening the debate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f5db135f201a1ea49c24b34d9597cae26cb45a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f5db135f201a1ea49c24b34d9597cae26cb45a5/0_67_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Thornberry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Thornberry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e16e5e28f087e8308e6b2f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T09:18:00.503Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clive Lewis backs federalism, and says Scottish Labour should be fully independent</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning. So far the Labour leadership contest has not generated much of a debate about the constitution, and the future of the UK, but this morning <strong>Clive Lewis</strong> has pitched in with<a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18146934.clive-lewis-says-labour-must-not-oppose-indyref2/\"> an article for the National</a>, the pro-independence paper in Scotland, saying the Scottish Labour party should be totally independent of the party in England, and that it should be free to back Scottish independence. Lewis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nor should any English party dictate to the Scottish. Scottish Labour, like Welsh Labour, should have full autonomy from the English \u2013 free to decide their views on fundamental questions like support for independence, acting as a Labour party for Scotland, not only a Labour party in Scotland. I believe the SNP\u2019s record in the Scottish government demands a strong, socialist, Scottish Labour opposition, as does their pro-austerity growth commission vision for independence. </p> </blockquote> <p>Lewis says he thinks a second independence referendum is inevitable.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For decades, Scotland suffered under Conservative governments elected primarily with English votes, whilst the experience of austerity, imposed by Westminster governments that Scotland did not elect, has simply reinforced the problem. It is little surprise then, that many Scots see themselves not as partners in a union of equal nations, but as a country shackled instead to a dysfunctional political system that is costing them dearly.</p> <p>Given the option to exit the UK, it is little wonder that so many now support independence and given the prospect of at least five years of Tory rule imposing a Brexit that Scotland did not vote for, the question of independence and a second referendum is unavoidable.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he says his preference is for the UK to adopt a federal model. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not for me, as an English MP for an English constituency, to dictate to Scotland what that form of government should be, and there should be no question of Labour opposing a second independence referendum if there is a mandate to hold one. It remains my conviction, nonetheless, that radical federalism, with the maximum possible autonomy for Scotland would provide the best solution for all the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. This is because my politics is driven by a belief in building alliances and whether in the UK or in Europe, I believe we are stronger when we work together. But I want to be part of a union where everyone feels heard and their needs are accounted for. We have to be honest and admit that this simply isn\u2019t the case at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lewis is a rank outsider in the Labour leadership contest, and it is very possible that he will be out of the contest by Monday afternoon next week, when nominations from MPs close. He needs 22, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CLPNominations/status/1215008271590993920\">currently he just has two.</a> However, he is doing more than other candidates to open up a debate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/clive-lewis-to-beat-tories-labour-has-to-work-with-other-progressives\">on pluralism and on political reform.</a> In some respect his campaign is similar to Rory Stewart\u2019s in the Tory leadership contest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ScotNational/status/1215178140256997376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today&#39;s front page: Labour leadership hopeful says Scotland should have the right to chose its future ...

      "bodyText": "The Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry has given Jeremy Corbyn \u201c0 out of 10\u201d for his performance during the general election. Record numbers of patients are being forced to stay with ambulance crews for an hour or more this winter because overwhelmed A&amp;E units are too busy to admit them. MPs have been debating the third reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, and they will vote on its shortly. The shadow Brexit minister, Thangam Debbonaire, said that Labour would be voting against, but that that did not mean the party was voting against Brexit. The government is certain to win, and the bill will then go to the Lords. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the EU is continuing to plan for the prospect of \u201cno-deal\u201d at the end of 2020, when the UK could leave the post-Brexit transition without a trade deal in place. (See 11.28am.) Scottish Labour is considering backing a second independence referendum in a dramatic reversal of policy by the party leader, Richard Leonard. Clive Lewis, the Labour leadership candidate, has said that \u201cradical federalism\u201d would be the best constitutional settlement for the UK. (See 9.18am.) Barry Gardiner has said that Labour colleagues are urging him to stand in the leadership election because they see him as someone who could win a general election. (See 1.26pm.) Khalid Mahmood has announced that he is withdrawing from the contest to be Labour\u2019s deputy leader, the BBC\u2019s Kathryn Stanczyszyn reports. The troubled Northern rail franchise faces financial collapse within months, the transport secretary has said, as the government set out a timetable to tackle the \u201cunacceptable services\u201d for rail passengers in the north. A Cabinet Office investigation into how much the former Wales secretary Alun Cairns knew about the role of an ex-aide in the collapse of a rape trial has been branded a \u201csham\u201d by the female victim in the case. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A government minister facing criticism after announcing a \u2018Town of The Year\u2019 competition in a city has claimed that it was not the official launch which will take place later this year. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, defended statements about the city of Wolverhampton from the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government, which described it as a town on two occasions. Nineteen years ago Wolverhampton was one of three towns named as a Millennium 2000 City after a decade-long campaign by local MPs and councillors, fighting off competition from 36 other places. The disclosure in the Guardian was particularly embarrassing for Jenrick, who was born and educated in Wolverhampton, which became a city when he was 18. Civic figures have claimed it is proof that the Tories are paying lip service to the UK\u2019s struggling towns. In an interview with Sky News on Thursday, Jenrick claimed that his department did not get it wrong and denied that he did not know that Wolverhampton was a city. He said: We didn\u2019t launch this competition in Wolverhampton. Having been born and bred in Wolverhampton I don\u2019t need the Guardian to tell me that it was a town and is now a city. I was living in the town when it became a city. Jenrick\u2019s claims that the competition has not yet been launched appear to be contradicted by his own departmental press release which was sent to the media on Wednesday. It reads: \u201cCommunities secretary announces new Town of the Year competition to celebrate thriving towns.\u201d It goes on to say Jenrick would be in Wolverhampton and quotes him as saying: \u201cTo celebrate the achievements of our towns, we are launching a national Town of the Year competition.\u201d Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, said: This whole announcement has been a farce, but the real tragedy is whether in towns or cities our communities are struggling after a decade of cuts. Instead of pitting towns or cities against each other in a beauty contest - the government should be properly funding our vital public services. The Labour MP Justin Madders says he has nominated Lisa Nandy for leader, and Angela Rayner for deputy leader. From my colleague Peter Walker Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting who is standing for the deputy leadership, has drafted a code of conduct for leader and deputy leadership candidates to sign. She says Jess Phillips (here) and Emily Thornberry have backed it. MPs have been debating the third reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. It has been a relatively pedestrian affair \u2013 it is hard to say anything new about Brexit at this point, ministers are not revealing much about their strategy for the trade talks, and the government majority means opposition MPs can do almost nothing to change the bill \u2013 but there are some quotes anyway, from the Press Association wire. Paul Blomfield, the shadow Brexit minister, said the government should not assume that its election victory was a mandate for a very hard Brexit. He told MPs: Leaving the EU doesn\u2019t mean that we will have got Brexit done. We\u2019ll have completed the first step, departure, but the difficult stage is yet to come. I would though, urge the government, as we move into this next stage, not to over-interpret its mandate in the general election ... The decision of the general election isn\u2019t a mandate to bulldoze through a particular version at any cost on all the people of the United Kingdom, and the next few months need to be approached with sensitivity and with caution if we are to stay together as a United Kingdom. Fleur Anderson, the new Labour MP for Putney, said the bill could encourage racism. In her maiden speech she said: There are high risks that racism and discrimination will be given permission by this bill. I\u2019ve seen it happen, it happened straight after the referendum and it\u2019s happened since. So it\u2019s very important to say here in this place that we may be leaving the EU but we\u2019re proud of our place in Europe and the world. And the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart said the government was losing Scotland. He said: [The government] may have won their hard Brexit, but they have most definitely lost Scotland ... It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. Scotland will be an independent country. The sooner this house recognises it the better. The battle for us to have Brexit is over, they\u2019ve won. The battle for Scottish independence has just begun. The troubled Northern rail franchise faces financial collapse within months, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said, as the government set out a timetable to tackle the \u201cunacceptable services\u201d for rail passengers in the north. My colleague Gwyn Topham has the full story here. Nadia Whittome, the new Labour MP for Nottingham East, also says she is going to nominate Clive Lewis for Labour leader without necessarily planning to vote for him because she wants his ideas to be part of the debate. Lloyd Russell-Moyle is in this position too. (See 1.55pm.) In Edinburgh, first minister\u2019s questions \u2013 briefly interrupted by Extinction Rebellion climate protesters \u2013 were dominated by a domestic agenda today, but not without the usual thread of constitutional matters. The interim Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw\u2019s attack on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s education record probably has to be seen in the context of his current bid for party leadership to replace Ruth Davidson, as he promised that 2020 would be the year of holding the SNP government to account. Likewise, the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, mounted a dissection of social care services, arguing that the failing integration of health and social care services alongside council funding cuts were the direct responsibility of the Scottish government. As usual, Westminster was not far away: Sturgeon responded that her government was working to protect heath and social care within a very constrained overall budget, the ultimate result of Westminster austerity. Similarly, she rebuffed attempts to criticise the SNP\u2019s record by repeating that the public had given their verdict in last month\u2019s election. One might argue this is not necessarily a direct conclusion of the SNP\u2019s general election success, given that a Westminster campaign does not scrutinise their performance in Holyrood. But when Brexit was mentioned directly, with a question about Wednesday\u2019s decisive Holyrood vote to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, Sturgeon repeated what is now an entirely familiar call for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide its own future. While yesterday\u2019s vote was entirely symbolic \u2013 Holyrood can\u2019t bind the Westminster parliament in this way \u2013 it does add to the growing narrative of Scotland as entirely divergent politically from the rest of the UK. Here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on Barry Gardiner\u2019s possible run for the Labour leadership. (See 1.26pm.) Emily Thornberry has picked up another nomination. This is from the Labour MP and former minister Gareth Thomas. Earlier I said that there was no evidence in this contest of Labour MPs nominating someone for the leadership even though they did not want them to become leader. (See 9.38am.) Some MPs nominated Jeremy Corbyn on this basis in 2015, and were horrified when he actually won. Not for the first time, I spoke to soon. On the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics Lloyd Russell-Moyle said that, although he was backing Rebecca Long Bailey for the leadership, he was considering nominating Clive Lewis because he thought that Lewis\u2019s ideas for constitutional reform should be included in the debate. Hannah Bardell, an SNP MP who was who was called \u201cqueer\u201d by a peer after she raised his \u201cabusive\u201d behaviour towards parliamentary staff, is set to report him to the police for an alleged hate crime, HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh reports. Bardell was speaking in the Commons during business questions this morning. Here is an extract from Singh\u2019s story. Lord Ken Maginnis was accused of \u2018one of the worst cases of abuse of security staff I have seen\u2019 by SNP MP Hannah Bardell. The Northern Irish Ulster Unionist peer launched a tirade at staff, calling them \u201ccrooked\u201d after he forgot his pass to enter parliament and they would not allow him in, Bardell told the Commons on Wednesday. Responding to HuffPost UK, Maginnis did not deny the allegations, instead choosing to attack Bardell by accusing her of attempting to to \u201csettle a score\u201d because she is \u201cqueer\u201d and he is opposed to gay marriage. Bardell will now ask the police to look into both the incident at the Palace of Westminster\u2019s underground entrance, and his subsequent comments attacking her ... Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said Maginnis\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on Bardell was \u201cunutterably disgraceful\u201d. He told MPs Bardell was \u201cclearly owed an apology\u201d from the peer. Journalists last night were taken aback by the news that Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, was considering entering the Labour leadership contest because it sounded most improbable. Gardiner has not been campaigning, candidates only have until 2.30pm on Monday to get the 22 nominations they need from MPs or MEPs to stay in the contest, around half of MPs have already nominated someone, and Gardiner himself is in Abu Dhabi at a climate crisis event, which is not the best place to be if you need to win over almost two dozen MPs. But he is considering standing, as he told my colleague Kate Proctor. Here is her story. This morning Gardiner gave another interview about his possible candidature to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire. He was speaking from Abu Dhabi, apparently via Skype. Here are the main points. Gardiner said if he could get the backing of 22 MPs he definitely would stand. Asked if he would be a candidate, he replied: If I know that I can secure the 22 votes necessary in order to go forward to the next stage, then I will stand. But until I have that assurance from my colleagues then I\u2019m not going to go further than considering it just at the moment. He said if he did stand it would be to \u201cenergise\u201d the campaign and to get \u201cdynamism\u201d into the debate. He confirmed that Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, had not asked him to stand. And he said no one had urged him to stand on McCluskey\u2019s behalf. But he would welcome McCluskey\u2019s support, he said. He told Derbyshire: Len, if you are watching, I would be very pleased to get a phone call from you. I would like to talk through with you how we can improve employment rights in this country, how we can have safer standards at work, and all the things that we are about ... And I would, of course, love to have your support. This is odd because, according to McCluskey, Gardiner did get a call from the Unite leader last night. Gardiner said Labour colleagues were urging him to stand because they saw him as an election winner. Asked what qualities he had that other candidates didn\u2019t, he replied: I can win a general election. Asked if he was saying the other candidates could not, he went on: I\u2019m setting out what I believe is the key reason why colleagues, many of whom have spoken to me and encouraged me to stand, have said to me. They believe I have the ability to communicate, to bring that dynamism of debate, that is necessary in order to go out to the country. McCluskey says he has not urged Gardiner to run, but Skwawkbox, a pro-Corbyn website supported by Unite and seen by some as a mouthpiece for the union, has over the last two days run articles promoting Gardiner as a candidate. Skwawkbox also ran various articles pushing Ian Lavery as a leadership candidate until he announced that he would not be standing. These blogposts fuelled the theory that some Corbynites were either unhappy with Rebecca Long Bailey as a candidate, or doubtful about whether she could win, and were looking around for someone else to champion Corbynism in the contest. Jack McConnell, the former Labour Scottish first minister, is backing Lisa Nandy for Labour leader, the Scotsman\u2019s Paris Gourtsoyannis reports. The Labour leadership candidate Jess Phillips has posted this response on Twitter to Clive Lewis\u2019s article in the Nation saying Scottish Labour should be free to back independence. (See 9.18am.) The Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry has been speaking to Sky News and she has been giving her own marks for Jeremy Corbyn on a scale from 0 to 10. Rebecca Long Bailey, of course, said on Tuesday that Corbyn deserves 10 out of 10 as a leader. Thornberry\u2019s assessment is less generous. She told Sky: I remain convinced that Jeremy is not antisemitic. But I think that clearly we completely failed when it came to dealing with antisemitism in the party, and that was a failure of leadership. And Jeremy knows my views on this. And I\u2019m afraid I would not give him more than 2 out of 10 in relation to that. But when it comes to principle, bringing people into the party, firing up the party, bringing us back to speaking from our hearts, I would give him 10 out of 10. Losing an election is probably the most important thing by which you would measure a leader, and obviously we lost very, very badly. And on that basis, I would give him on that nought out of 10. What else could I do? This is from Sky\u2019s Mollie Malone. Downing Street has now issued a fuller read-out of the PM\u2019s conversation with the Iranian president. A spokesman said: The prime minister spoke to President Rouhani of Iran this morning. They discussed the situation in the region following the death of Qassem Suleimani and the prime minister called for an end to hostilities. The prime minister underlined the UK\u2019s continued commitment to the JCPOA and to ongoing dialogue to avoid nuclear proliferation and reduce tensions. He raised the continued detention and mistreatment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals in Iran and called for their immediate release. Boris Johnson has spoken to the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and called for \u201can end to hostilities\u201d in the Gulf, No 10 has said. I will post more from the No 10 briefing when I get it. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, delivered a speech in Sweden this morning, and then held a lengthy Q&amp;A afterwards. The text of his speech is here, and there is video of the meeting on the Facebook page for the European commission in Sweden. Most of what he said was quite familiar, but there were some lines worth flagging up. Barnier said that the EU would continue to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020. That was because there was a possibility that the UK and the EU might fail to reach an agreement this year, which would lead to no-deal because the UK government is ruling out an extension of the post-Brexit transition. He explained: If Prime Minister Johnson does not want an extension of the transition period beyond the end of the year \u2013 and yesterday when we met him with Ursula von der Leyen, he told us very clearly that he does not want such an extension \u2013 we will have less than 11 months to conclude a deal. If we fail, the transition period will end on 1 January 2021 without any arrangements for a new future relationship in place. This would not affect the issues covered in the withdrawal agreement ... But it would mean the return of tariffs and quotas: a total anachronism for interconnected economies like ours. Of course, this is not what the EU wants. But it is nonetheless a scenario that everyone must continue to prepare for \u2013 at EU level, but also at national level, and here in Sweden. Barnier restated the EU\u2019s belief that it would be impossible to conclude a comprehensive agreement with the UK this year. He said: We will strive for a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope: covering everything from services and fisheries, to climate action, energy, transport, space, security and defence. But that is a huge agenda. And we simply cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of this new partnership in under a year ... If we want to agree on each and every point of this political declaration \u2013 which would lead to an unprecedented relationship \u2013 it will take more than 11 months. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, made the same point when she was in London with Barnier yesterday to meet Johnson. Barnier said the EU would insist on fishing being included as part of an overall trade deal. In the Q&amp;A he was asked how the trade negotiations would be conducted, and whether the EU would insist on the principle that \u201cnothing is agreed until everything is agreed\u201d that applied during the first stage of the negotiations. Barnier said this time the negotiations would be carried out in a different way. But he went on: But there are some sectors where the point will remain linked. If I have to be more precise, speaking about economy and trade, there will be no agreement without global agreement on trade for goods, the level playing field and fisheries. I think I\u2019m clear. Barnier said there would be a parallel negotiation covering security and defence. But he said he wanted to be \u201cvery clear\u201d about the need for trade, level playing field rules and fishing to be considered together. This may turn out to be a flashpoint in the talks because the fishing industry is not happy about the idea that EU access to British waters may get given away in the hope of securing concessions in other parts of the trade talks. Here is a question from a reader below the line (BTL) that I should have addressed in the post on the private members\u2019 bills ballot. (See 10.16am.) When MPs enter the ballot they don\u2019t have to say what bill they would put forward and most of them don\u2019t give it much thought at this stage because the chances of doing well in the ballot are relatively small. Some of them may have some ideas. But generally they wait a bit before making an announcement, partly to see what the options are available (MPs who do well in the ballot tend to get lobbied by campaigning organisations promoting off-the-shelf bills), and partly to see what the government might back. If you want a private member\u2019s bill that will actually pass, the safest option is to choose a quasi-government bill. Most departments have small bits of legislation that they want to pass that they haven\u2019t been able to get into the Queen\u2019s speech. In the Commons Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has just made his first intervention in Brexit questions. He also raised the government\u2019s decision to remove the child refugee protections from the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. It was a \u201cdisgraceful decision\u201d, Starmer said, and he told Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, that he must know the government had got it wrong. He said a legal obligation had been removed, and replaced with \u201creliance on the prime minister\u2019s word\u201d, and that Barclay should be able to see why that was unacceptable. Starmer said Labour would continue to fight this. We may not win many votes in parliament just now, but we can win the moral argument. In response, Barclay repeated his claim that the UK had a good record when it came to taking unaccompanied child refugees. (See 9.48am.) He said the Home Office had given a commitment to negotiate with the EU on this issue. And he said the Tory manifesto even included a commitment on this, on page 23. He was referring to this line in the manifesto. We will continue to grant asylum and support to refugees fleeing persecution, with the ultimate aim of helping them to return home if it is safe to do so. The results of the ballot for private members\u2019 bills have been announced. Twenty MPs have been selected, which means they will be given a chance to introduce a private member\u2019s bill, but it is only the MPs at the top of the ballot \u2013 Mike Amesbury, Darren Jones, Anna McMorrin, Laura Trott, Chris Loder, Paula Barker \u2013 who can be confident that they have a decent chance of getting their bill through because they should get a full Friday for it to be debated. To pass a private member\u2019s bill, an MP needs to choose legislation that will secure government backing. In the 2017-19 session of parliament nine of these bills became law. This is from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard commenting on the Clive Lewis article. (See 9.18am.) Scottish government representatives will tell their UK counterparts that Scotland had \u201cthe right to choose an alternative future\u201d at a meeting of the joint ministerial committee EU negotiations in London today. The first meeting of the committee this year comes the day after the Scottish parliament voted decisively to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal bill. On Wednesday evening, 92 MSPs backed the Scottish government\u2019s memorandum withholding legislative consent from the latest withdrawal agreement, while only 29 voted against it. Both the Scottish and Welsh parliaments have voted against giving legislative consent to the withdrawal agreement previously although, because they cannot prevent any UK legislation from becoming law, this has been a largely symbolic exercise. Ahead of the meeting, the Scottish government\u2019s Brexit secretary Michael Russell said: The current hard deal Brexit proposed by the UK government will impose significant damage on the people and economy of Scotland hitting employment and living standards. Despite our repeated efforts to discuss alternatives our proposals have been ignored. The UK government has repeatedly promised it would involve the devolved administrations, but has completely failed to do so. In the Commons on Wednesday afternoon MPs rejected an amendment to the withdrawal agreement bill tabled by Plaid Cymru that sought to give the Welsh and Scottish parliaments, as well as the Northern Ireland assembly, the right to approve the UK government\u2019s negotiating objectives when it came to the future relationship between the EU and UK. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster Leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said that Wales had been \u201cat best an afterthought\u201d in the negotiations so far, and that it was \u201cimperative\u201d that Wales\u2019s voice be heard in the phase two discussions. In the Commons Nick Thomas-Symonds, a shadow Home Office minister, has just challenged Barclay to commit to ensuring that the EU would never have stronger employment rights than the UK after Brexit. Barclay refused to give that commitment, but he said the government would stick to the promise in the Conservative manifesto to maintain high standards. He said in many respects, like maternity rights, UK standards were already much higher than the EU minimum. In the Commons Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just said that the UK has a \u201cproud record\u201d of taking unaccompanied child refugees. Speaking during Brexit questions, and responding to a question about the government\u2019s decision to remove child refugee protections from the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, he said the UK took 15% of the EU total of unaccompanied child refugees. He said MPs should not be talking down the UK\u2019s record. According to the well-regarded @CLPNominations Twitter feed, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is doing almost as badly as Clive Lewis when it comes to collecting nominations from MPs. Like Lewis, she too might be out of the contest by Monday afternoon. On the Today programme this morning, in an interview mostly about Iran, Thornberry said she had not given up hope of getting the 22 nominations that she needs. But she didn\u2019t sound confident, and she was reduced to making the argument that someone with her foreign policy background should be \u201cin the mix\u201d in the contest to add to the debate. She said: I have a number of people who have pledged to support me. I am out there making the argument, let\u2019s see what happens. Current events and the fires in Australia do tend to show how the job of the leader of the Labour party - and indeed the job of Labour prime minister - is likely to be framed. We need somebody who has experience, as I have had over the last three or four years, of looking in detail at the security of Britain and our relationships with the rest of the world. It would be good to have someone with that experience on the stage in the mix in a debate about who should be leader of the Labour party. In 2010 and again in 2015 some MPs nominated candidates they did not want as Labour leader just to ensure a wider debate. Diane Abbott was the beneficiary in 2010, and of course Jeremy Corbyn made it onto the ballot through this route in 2015. But the decision to nominate Corbyn did not work out quite in the way many people expected, and this time around there is no evidence that any MPs are planning to nominate a candidate they don\u2019t really support just in the hope of widening the debate. Good morning. So far the Labour leadership contest has not generated much of a debate about the constitution, and the future of the UK, but this morning Clive Lewis has pitched in with an article for the National, the pro-independence paper in Scotland, saying the Scottish Labour party should be totally independent of the party in England, and that it should be free to back Scottish independence. Lewis says: Nor should any English party dictate to the Scottish. Scottish Labour, like Welsh Labour, should have full autonomy from the English \u2013 free to decide their views on fundamental questions like support for independence, acting as a Labour party for Scotland, not only a Labour party in Scotland. I believe the SNP\u2019s record in the Scottish government demands a strong, socialist, Scottish Labour opposition, as does their pro-austerity growth commission vision for independence. Lewis says he thinks a second independence referendum is inevitable. For decades, Scotland suffered under Conservative governments elected primarily with English votes, whilst the experience of austerity, imposed by Westminster governments that Scotland did not elect, has simply reinforced the problem. It is little surprise then, that many Scots see themselves not as partners in a union of equal nations, but as a country shackled instead to a dysfunctional political system that is costing them dearly. Given the option to exit the UK, it is little wonder that so many now support independence and given the prospect of at least five years of Tory rule imposing a Brexit that Scotland did not vote for, the question of independence and a second referendum is unavoidable. But he says his preference is for the UK to adopt a federal model. It is not for me, as an English MP for an English constituency, to dictate to Scotland what that form of government should be, and there should be no question of Labour opposing a second independence referendum if there is a mandate to hold one. It remains my conviction, nonetheless, that radical federalism, with the maximum possible autonomy for Scotland would provide the best solution for all the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. This is because my politics is driven by a belief in building alliances and whether in the UK or in Europe, I believe we are stronger when we work together. But I want to be part of a union where everyone feels heard and their needs are accounted for. We have to be honest and admit that this simply isn\u2019t the case at the moment. Lewis is a rank outsider in the Labour leadership contest, and it is very possible that he will be out of the contest by Monday afternoon next week, when nominations from MPs close. He needs 22, but currently he just has two. However, he is doing more than other candidates to open up a debate on pluralism and on political reform. In some respect his campaign is similar to Rory Stewart\u2019s in the Tory leadership contest. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: A ballot is held in the Commons for MPs who want to get a slot to table a private member\u2019s bill. 9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement on forthcoming business in the Commons. After 11.30am: Heather Wheeler, a Foreign Office minister, makes a statement in the Commons about the Australian bushfires. After 12.30am: MPs debate the third reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

This advice was fiercely echoed in 1956 by Dwight D Eisenhower, appalled at Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\" title=\"\">invasion of Suez</a>.</p> \n<p>Iraqi politicians this week joined the anti-imperial cause by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/anti-isis-coalition-suspends-operations-as-iraqi-mps-vote-to-expel-us-troops\" title=\"\">demanding</a> that American forces be withdrawn from their soil. All Trump could do was refuse, despite having previously pledged to do just that. Even in its hour of insecurity, 17 years of American occupation had left Iraq just desperate for it to end.

The US president is a man of emotional and unpredictable responses. He could indeed pull out of Iraq, leaving it to separate from Kurdistan and do a deal with Tehran. He could leave Syria to its fate, and leave Afghanistan to the tender mercies of Islamabad. As for Britain, at last it could have nothing whatsoever to do with this mess.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

John Foster Dulles, who was later US secretary of state, said in 1945 that his was \u201cthe first colony to have won independence\u201d from Britain, and it expected others to follow. This advice was fiercely echoed in 1956 by Dwight D Eisenhower, appalled at Britain\u2019s invasion of Suez. Iraqi politicians this week joined the anti-imperial cause by demanding that American forces be withdrawn from their soil. All Trump could do was refuse, despite having previously pledged to do just that. Even in its hour of insecurity, 17 years of American occupation had left Iraq just desperate for it to end. It knows it must live at peace with its powerful neighbour, Iran, and this requires it to be no longer to be a tool of American presidential machismo. Likewise Afghanistan must find its own accommodation with the Taliban and with its neighbour, Pakistan. As for Britain, its 20-year creep under Washington\u2019s coat-tails, by Blair, David Cameron and now Boris Johnson, is humiliating and expensive. It should be offering the advice of an old and honest friend, whose history has so paralleled the US\u2019s predicament. Instead, it offers only the cringe of a lackey awaiting a reward, in this case an implausible post-Brexit trade deal. As empires crumble, stuff happens. It could yet be that Trump\u2019s killing of Qassem Suleimani jolts every participant in this game to realise that it is just not working. The US president is a man of emotional and unpredictable responses. He could indeed pull out of Iraq, leaving it to separate from Kurdistan and do a deal with Tehran. He could leave Syria to its fate, and leave Afghanistan to the tender mercies of Islamabad. As for Britain, at last it could have nothing whatsoever to do with this mess. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

The Farewell star Awkwafina, who won a Golden Globe on Sunday, was included but only in the EE Rising Star category, which is voted for by the public. Jennifer Lopez was ignored for Hustlers, as was Cynthia Erivo for Harriet and Lupita Nyong\u2019o for Us, while there was no nod for Eddie Murphy for his role in Netflix\u2019s blaxploitation-era drama, Dolemite Is My Name. There was criticism of the fact Scarlett Johansson and Margot Robbie were both nominated twice, with Robbie being nominated two times in the best supporting actress category for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Bombshell. There has been speculation that a new voting system could move to an alternative hybrid of jury, full membership and chapter votes. Nwonka said the row about the awards was not about diversity in the industry as a whole but the way female-focused and BAME films are valued during awards season. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question about diversity, it\u2019s about how we value black talent,\u201d said Nwonka. \u201cWe\u2019ve had diversity for 20 years, through various schemes at BFI, BBC and Channel 4 Film and we still have a situation when this happens.\u201d Nwonka suggested there should be a legal framework installed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that holds institutions to account on diversity and equality. He also called for a review into how diversity works within British film, with institutions no longer opting for inclusion targets but instead focusing on how work by BAME talent is valued. \u201cAt the moment people can be included but it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf value is determined by who wins awards, then this suggests that in 2019 there were no good black films, which is simply not true\u201d.",

It said: \u201cThe law governing human rights is highly relevant to valuation reform\u201d, noting that the European convention on human rights \u201cprovides for the peaceful enjoyment of property\u201d. The commission instead set out three options for reform \u2013 one of which broadly maintains the status quo, while the other two eliminate what is known as \u201cmarriage value\u201d and \u201chope value\u201d. It gave a worked example of someone with a \u00a3250,000 property with only 76 years left on the lease and a current ground rent of \u00a350 rising to \u00a3200 a year. It said under existing calculations, the leaseholder would have to pay \u00a316,453 to buy out the lease. Under its proposals, the cost would fall to \u00a310,615 if \u201chope\u201d value is reformed, and drop to \u00a39,155 if there is no \u201cmarriage value\u201d. The property law commissioner, professor Nick Hopkins, said: \u201cWe were asked to provide options for reform that save leaseholders money when buying their freehold or extending their lease, while ensuring that sufficient compensation is paid to landlords. This is what we\u2019ve done. We are ready to help the government in implementing whichever options for reform they choose.\u201d Welcoming the report, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said he will consider the proposals and set out the government\u2019s response. \u201cWe have already committed to addressing the abuses of leasehold seen in recent years, by reducing ground rents to a peppercorn level and limiting new leasehold to apartments, save in the most exceptional circumstances. The Competition and Markets Authority is examining the alleged mis-selling of leasehold properties and I will also await their findings with interest.\u201d However, campaigners said they were deeply disappointed by the Law Commission proposals. Sebastian O\u2019Kelly of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership said: \u201cIt is very difficult to be too enthusiastic about options to government which give the \u00a32.5bn annual leasehold enfranchisement sector plenty of scope to dilute any meaningful reform. \u201cA process which began with the aim of making the enfranchisement process more open and cheaper now has heavy emphasis on the \u2018human rights\u2019 of property owners \u2013 even when anonymous ground-rent speculators in the British Virgin Islands.\u201d",

A Liberal Democrat-backed amendment to the withdrawal agreement bill, requiring the government to seek continued participation in Erasmus+, was defeated by Conservative MPs, raising fears that the UK could abruptly withdraw from the programme. Supporters of the Erasmus exchange, which each year involves around 16,000 British students travelling to more than 30 countries, including non-EU members such as Norway and Serbia, defended it on social media. Tanja Bueltmann, a professor of migration and diaspora history, tweeted: \u201cErasmus made me who I am.

The Liberal Democrat amendment would have inserted a clause in the withdrawal agreement bill requiring the government to seek continued participation in Erasmus+ on existing terms after Brexit, and to report on the progress of negotiations to parliament. But on Wednesday MPs voted down a second reading of the amendment, by 344 to 254. The Erasmus result followed a similar defeat for an amendment that sought to keep protections for unaccompanied child refugees in the withdrawal agreement by guaranteeing their right to be reunited with family members in the UK after Brexit. DfE officials have been asked by Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, to consider plans for a replacement exchange programme in the event of the UK failing to remain in Erasmus+.

The Association of Colleges, representing further education and sixth-form colleges, estimates that 100 colleges have been awarded about \u20ac77m (\u00a366m) to fund more than 30,000 placements between 2014 and 2020.

      "bodyText": "Scottish Labour is considering backing a second independence referendum in a dramatic reversal of policy by the party leader, Richard Leonard. Party sources have told the Guardian that Leonard will raise that possibility at Labour\u2019s Scottish executive committee on Saturday, where it could also discuss demands for it to split formally from the UK Labour party. Leonard told his shadow cabinet on Monday he wanted to hold a special conference in May to decide Scottish Labour\u2019s position on a fresh independence referendum, where he would present proposals for Labour to back a federal UK. Sources close to Leonard said he would consider asking for a pro-federal option to be included in a multi-option referendum on independence. \u201cLabour would be more willing to consider supporting a second referendum if it was multi-option,\u201d one source said. That proposal could be embraced by Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and Scottish National party leader; she told the Daily Record newspaper before December\u2019s election she would discuss that with Labour. \u201cIf they bring forward a credible proposition, then of course there has to be a discussion, but it\u2019s not going to change my mind on independence,\u201d she said. The dramatic proposals follow a torrent of complaints from former Scottish Labour MPs who lost their seats in the December general election, where the party suffered its worst defeat of the modern era, polling just 18.6% of the vote. Their complaints echoed calls for a rethink by Monica Lennon, a Labour MSP who sits on the Scottish executive and shadow cabinet, and Grahame Smith, the outgoing general secretary of the Scottish TUC. On Thursday, Clive Lewis, who is running to replace Jeremy Corbyn as UK leader, told the pro-independence National newspaper that Scottish Labour should back a referendum, although he supported \u201cradical federalism\u201d rather than independence. Supporters of these policy changes insist Labour has to respond to successive election defeats by emphasising its independence and accept Sturgeon\u2019s claim she has a mandate to stage a fresh referendum. Labour lost six Westminster seats to the SNP in December, again leaving it with one Scottish MP, as voters rebelled against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit and his leadership. Scottish Labour also lost both its European parliament seats in last May\u2019s European election \u2013 the first time Labour as never had a Scottish MEP. Leonard told his party\u2019s shadow cabinet on Monday he wanted to hold a special conference in May to finally decide on whether to back staging a second independence vote, without any conditions. It is understood Leonard still opposes holding a second referendum and proposals for Scottish Labour to split from the UK party, but the issue will dominate the political agenda in Scotland after the SNP won 48 of the country\u2019s 59 Westminster seats last month. Sturgeon is hoping for a constitutional battle with Boris Johnson over his refusal to give Holyrood the legal powers for a referendum, using that refusal to build public support for one. Scottish Labour was bounced into backing a second referendum when John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, suddenly announced this was party policy during the Edinburgh festival last year and implied it was backed by Corbyn. Buckling to intense pressure for a rethink from Leonard and other senior party figures, Corbyn refined the policy to make it more conditional. He said Labour would only support an independence vote after two years or more of a Labour government in London. Leonard\u2019s decision has been furiously criticised by his Holyrood colleagues, and will be opposed by Ian Murray, Scottish Labour\u2019s sole surviving MP, who is campaigning to become the UK party\u2019s deputy leader on an anti-independence ticket. Lennon and Neil Findlay, a Labour MSP who chaired Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign in Scotland, argue the scale of Labour\u2019s defeat means it has to accept public backing for Sturgeon\u2019s stance \u2013 a position echoed by Ged Killen and Paul Sweeney, former MPs who lost their seats in Glasgow in December\u2019s election.

      "bodyText": "African grey parrots help their peers complete tasks despite no immediate benefit to themselves, researchers have found, in the first study to show that birds display such apparently \u201cselfless\u201d behaviour. While other prosocial behaviours have been seen in birds, the team say helping peers to achieve a goal, so-called \u201cinstrumental helping\u201d, has only previously been shown outside of humans in orangutans and bonobos. Dr D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Brucks, a co-author of the paper from Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, said it was an obvious choice to try an experiment with parrots. \u201cParrots and corvids, crows and ravens, are really known for being the brightest birds around, they are often referred to as \u2018feathered apes\u2019 and they have been tested in many studies on problem solving or word learning,\u201d she said. However the bonhomie does not extend to all birds, or even all parrots: a previous study has shown that ravens do not help their peers complete a task, while the new research shows blue-headed macaws are also rather selfish. The team say their findings suggest the helpful behaviour cropped up multiple times over the course of evolution. \u201cIt seems that potentially similar social and ecological pressures on mammals and also birds lead to the development of similar behaviours,\u201d said Brucks. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Brucks and colleagues report how they tested two parrot species in a task that involved the birds passing a token, in the form of a metal ring, through a hole in their compartment to a neighbouring bird of the same species. This token could then be passed by the second bird to a human, via another hole, who would exchange it for a piece of walnut. In total eight African grey parrots and six blue-headed macaws were involved in the experiments. All were trained individually to exchange the tokens for food when a human held out their hand. The team found African grey parrots helped their neighbours by passing tokens to their neighbour when a human held out their hand, allowing the second bird to drop it through the hole and receive a tasty treat. The same behaviour was seen when the roles of the birds were reversed. The more tokens a bird had previously given, the more they received in return. However, the team stress the birds did not know at the outset that their favour would be reciprocated, suggesting it is something of a \u201cselfless\u201d act. Far fewer tokens were passed between birds when there was no human signal and no hole for them to exchange the token \u2013 suggesting the parrots did not simply pass tokens for fun. The parrots also passed fewer tokens to the second compartment when there was no neighbour present. When the experiments were repeated with blue-headed macaws, the birds rarely passed tokens to their neighbour. The upshot, the team say, is that the African grey parrots were helping peers to achieve their task, adding the behaviour is more complex than simply sharing food with a neighbour since it involves understanding the needs of another bird for the latter to achieve their goal. The team say the differences between the species may be down to African grey parrots gathering in huge flocks at night but splitting into smaller groups during the day to forage. Brucks said such behaviour is thought to require strong social cognitive abilities, adding that being helpful might help the birds gain a good reputation with their peers, making it more likely they would team up for foraging and other tasks.

Forsyth\u2019s voice marries Peggy Lee\u2019s bluesy vibrato with Nico\u2019s thunderous terror, and delivers lyrics that invert nature, as a way of exploring despair. Large oaks descend and grow roots. Salt hills move. Madness unfurls.</p> <p>Add to the mix Forsyth\u2019s image in her videos and artwork (Virginia Woolf as directed by Bertolt Brecht), and spacious, stark arrangements by the composers <a href=\"http://www.theleaflabel.com/en/artists/view/51/\" title=\"\">Matthew Bourne</a> and Sam Hobbs (Forsyth emailed Bourne the songs she had recorded on her laptop, without a microphone, after hearing him on Radio 3\u2019s Late Junction; he loved them). The results are bleakly beautiful.</p> <p>Forsyth is easy to spot when she collects me at Harrogate station. She moved here in 2016, after 20 years living in London. Three-and-a-half hours ensue, discussing art, despair, kids and creativity over oat-milk lattes and soup; her joy in her new work is contagious. \u201cI feel alive when I\u2019m doing this,\u201d she says, smiling (she smiles often). \u201cMy work isn\u2019t meant to be painful. All I\u2019ve wanted to do is open up and connect with people.\u201d</p> <p>Forsyth was born in 1979 in Oldham, the eldest of five children, although she was brought up by her grandmother (her parents were \u201cvery young\u201d when they had her, she explains). Her gran, a psychiatric nurse who worked night shifts, was a comforting presence, surrounding Forsyth with songs from musicals and singers such as Doris Day. Forsyth acted from the age of eight in Oldham Theatre Workshop. So did her younger half-brother, the Emmerdale actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/16/the-best-of-strictly-come-dancing-2019-kelvin-hips-anton-fake-teeth\" title=\"\">Kelvin Fletcher</a>, who won Strictly Coming Dancing in December (of whom she\u2019s \u201creally, really proud\u201d).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B4-I03LTcs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8B4-I03LTcs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe youth theatre wasn\u2019t fun,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt was work, but I loved that. The way that performing involved fear, excitement \u2026 then relief. It was a shock getting back to real life after that.\u201d</p> <p>At 16, Forsyth got a regular role on the BBC kids\u2019 drama <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273332/\" title=\"\">The Biz</a>, after which she \u201cfell into\u201d TV acting (The Bill, Peak Practice and Heartbeat all feature on her CV). But her heart was often elsewhere. She had trained as a dancer (the German choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/pinabausch\" title=\"\">Pina Bausch</a> is her major creative inspiration), had lessons with a local opera singer and auditioned without success for West End musicals. \u201cI considered doing Stars in Their Eyes once, as Karen Carpenter,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut I never wanted to just be a fan of the music. I wanted to be part of it.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, she met the performance artists <a href=\"http://www.boyleandshaw.co.uk/\">Matthew Boyle and Adrian Shaw</a>, who gave her the creative freedom she craved. With them, she created a character for performance called The Scuttler, \u201cthis woman who lived in the hills in a trenchcoat, who didn\u2019t speak, just used her voice in strange ways\u201d. The lyrical protagonist on Debris holds her shadows, she admits.</p> <p>Soon after, Forsyth had her two daughters, now 10 and seven. She split from their father, who sees them often, but she is their sole parent at home. After becoming a mother, her musical expression felt more urgent, especially around the chaos and frequent disappointments of acting life. \u201cHaving the girls \u2013 giving birth to them \u2013 also made me think more about the sounds that come from our bodies,\u201d she says. \u201cIt made me go deeper into myself physically in that way.\u201d</p> <p>A few years later, Forsyth\u2019s friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/17/maxine-peake-hope-corbyn-people-power-peterloo-radical-legacy\" title=\"\">Maxine Peake</a> introduced her to the musicians Adrian Flanagan and Dean Honer; they were then performing as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheEccentronicResearchCouncil/\" title=\"\">the Eccentronic Research Council</a>. Honer lent Forsyth his harmonium, and they worked on early versions of her songs. Forsyth\u2019s acting CV was also getting fancier. As well as more experimental films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/12/edge-review\" title=\"\">Carol Morley\u2019s Edge</a>, she was in a Marvel blockbuster, Guardians of the Galaxy, where she spent four weeks in heavy makeup playing \u201cMottled Prisoner\u201d. Then came big-budget TV.</p> <p>Her roles in those shows were almost always traumatised figures on the edges of life. Did that affect her? \u201cYes.\u201d Forsyth is at pains to say she is not being judgmental about ordinary people in similar positions, but feels she was typecasting herself. She would head home to look after two children alone. \u201cI was exhausting myself, using my emotions to stimulate worse emotions. It wasn\u2019t a healthy way for me to live.\u201d She also felt she was on the wrong path. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Then I just couldn\u2019t do it any more.\u201d</p> <p>Forsyth \u201chit a wall\u201d psychologically and physically in 2017; she was so ill, she spent a month not being able to move her tongue. This sense of abstract terror soaks through Debris. Its title track begins with a pulse and a breath, a fox twisting, someone being begged not to leave, someone else insisting they \u201cain\u2019t going\u201d. Elsewhere, a black bull cries; the sea pushes someone away; someone longs to be the space around a raven\u2019s wings. Look to Yourself is specifically about Forsyth trying to settle her children to sleep, but many of these songs have personal inspirations, although they stand separately from them, too, Forsyth explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f50e81e74316141d49f35c3759cef51d3e2a38f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50e81e74316141d49f35c3759cef51d3e2a38f3/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keeley Forsyth 2020 press publicity portrait.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Then there is Lost, which even Forsyth finds a hard listen. It begins with her murmuring: \u201cIs this what madness feels like?\u201d, then describing how it feels: \u201cThe smooth space after all boundaries have been dissolved / Where there is wind, high wind / But no tall trees for it to grapple with / No buckets for it to shove around the yard.\u201d</p> <p>It was the track Forsyth was most scared to have on the album, but also to <em>not</em> have on the album. Why? \u201cBecause it is too much. But then again, when I was coming out of all of that, I had this realisation that, yes, I\u2019ve gone through these things, but I don\u2019t have to be them.\u201d At the same time, she was playing a mother possessed by a cult in the 2018 film <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/the-devil-outside-review-1202859980/\" title=\"\">The Devil Outside</a> (directed by Andrew Hulme, with whom she is now making videos). \u201cI made sure I stepped outside of that role on set. I gained a stronger sense of self to observe my work.\u201d And Forsyth has noticed that when she is talking about Debris, she calls the woman singing the lyrics \u201cshe\u201d. \u201cAnd \u2018she\u2019 has to be a character. I have my own life to live.\u201d</p> <p>Forsyth nevertheless hopes to take \u201cshe\u201d out on tour this year. A live performance is being developed with the film-makers Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, who made Nick Cave\u2019s 20,000 Days on Earth. Her next album has also been sketched out, and Bourne has even bought her a microphone. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on top of my microwave, of course.\u201d She is also excited about exploring electronic sounds as on Start Again, the latest single from the album and Debris\u2019 final track.</p> <p>The song\u2019s protagonist is waiting for lightning to strike her as angels laugh at her, then turn their backs. But Forsyth knows what happens next. \u201cThe lightning struck me. And I kept going.\u201d</p> <p><em>Debris is released on Friday 17 January on the Leaf Label</em></p>",

She had trained as a dancer (the German choreographer Pina Bausch is her major creative inspiration), had lessons with a local opera singer and auditioned without success for West End musicals. \u201cI considered doing Stars in Their Eyes once, as Karen Carpenter,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut I never wanted to just be a fan of the music. I wanted to be part of it.\u201d In 2009, she met the performance artists Matthew Boyle and Adrian Shaw, who gave her the creative freedom she craved. With them, she created a character for performance called The Scuttler, \u201cthis woman who lived in the hills in a trenchcoat, who didn\u2019t speak, just used her voice in strange ways\u201d. The lyrical protagonist on Debris holds her shadows, she admits. Soon after, Forsyth had her two daughters, now 10 and seven. She split from their father, who sees them often, but she is their sole parent at home. After becoming a mother, her musical expression felt more urgent, especially around the chaos and frequent disappointments of acting life. \u201cHaving the girls \u2013 giving birth to them \u2013 also made me think more about the sounds that come from our bodies,\u201d she says. \u201cIt made me go deeper into myself physically in that way.\u201d A few years later, Forsyth\u2019s friend Maxine Peake introduced her to the musicians Adrian Flanagan and Dean Honer; they were then performing as the Eccentronic Research Council. Honer lent Forsyth his harmonium, and they worked on early versions of her songs. Forsyth\u2019s acting CV was also getting fancier. As well as more experimental films such as Carol Morley\u2019s Edge, she was in a Marvel blockbuster, Guardians of the Galaxy, where she spent four weeks in heavy makeup playing \u201cMottled Prisoner\u201d. Then came big-budget TV. Her roles in those shows were almost always traumatised figures on the edges of life. Did that affect her? \u201cYes.\u201d Forsyth is at pains to say she is not being judgmental about ordinary people in similar positions, but feels she was typecasting herself. She would head home to look after two children alone. \u201cI was exhausting myself, using my emotions to stimulate worse emotions. It wasn\u2019t a healthy way for me to live.\u201d She also felt she was on the wrong path. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Then I just couldn\u2019t do it any more.\u201d Forsyth \u201chit a wall\u201d psychologically and physically in 2017; she was so ill, she spent a month not being able to move her tongue. This sense of abstract terror soaks through Debris. Its title track begins with a pulse and a breath, a fox twisting, someone being begged not to leave, someone else insisting they \u201cain\u2019t going\u201d. Elsewhere, a black bull cries; the sea pushes someone away; someone longs to be the space around a raven\u2019s wings. Look to Yourself is specifically about Forsyth trying to settle her children to sleep, but many of these songs have personal inspirations, although they stand separately from them, too, Forsyth explains. Then there is Lost, which even Forsyth finds a hard listen. It begins with her murmuring: \u201cIs this what madness feels like?\u201d, then describing how it feels: \u201cThe smooth space after all boundaries have been dissolved / Where there is wind, high wind / But no tall trees for it to grapple with / No buckets for it to shove around the yard.\u201d It was the track Forsyth was most scared to have on the album, but also to not have on the album. Why? \u201cBecause it is too much. But then again, when I was coming out of all of that, I had this realisation that, yes, I\u2019ve gone through these things, but I don\u2019t have to be them.\u201d At the same time, she was playing a mother possessed by a cult in the 2018 film The Devil Outside (directed by Andrew Hulme, with whom she is now making videos). \u201cI made sure I stepped outside of that role on set. I gained a stronger sense of self to observe my work.\u201d And Forsyth has noticed that when she is talking about Debris, she calls the woman singing the lyrics \u201cshe\u201d. \u201cAnd \u2018she\u2019 has to be a character. I have my own life to live.\u201d Forsyth nevertheless hopes to take \u201cshe\u201d out on tour this year. A live performance is being developed with the film-makers Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, who made Nick Cave\u2019s 20,000 Days on Earth. Her next album has also been sketched out, and Bourne has even bought her a microphone. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on top of my microwave, of course.\u201d She is also excited about exploring electronic sounds as on Start Again, the latest single from the album and Debris\u2019 final track. The song\u2019s protagonist is waiting for lightning to strike her as angels laugh at her, then turn their backs. But Forsyth knows what happens next. \u201cThe lightning struck me. And I kept going.\u201d Debris is released on Friday 17 January on the Leaf Label",

But it did at least draw attention again to the gap between good intentions and daily practice in the entertainment industry. Film and TV production has a hefty ecological footprint: a landmark <a href=\"https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/mpisreport.pdf\" title=\"\">2006 University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) study</a> estimated that the industry produced 15m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> a year. That might seem piddling next to the several billion tonnes emitted by the US economy that year, but in its principal sites of operation, such as Los Angeles, Hollywood was a big polluter \u2013 more so than the aerospace, clothing, hotel and semiconductor industries.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The average film is estimated to produce 500 tonnes of CO2 emissions \u2013 as much as running 108 cars for a year</p> </blockquote> <p>With the cast and crew of top-end studio projects now running into thousands of people \u2013 from set-builders to sparks, masseurs and makeup artists, to high-end caterers and server-hungry special effects farms \u2013 there is no reason to think Hollywood is any less resource-hungry these days. The average film is estimated to produce 500 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (equivalent to running 108 cars for a year), but this scales up with its budget; a $50m film can produce 4,000 tonnes. Who knows what something like Avengers: Infinity War racks up in production and beyond? If everyone\u2019s favourite mauve Malthusian, Thanos, had really wanted to do his part for the environment, then finger-snapping half the people on the film\u2019s jet-setting international press tour would have been a good start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b02deaa8621f3edf517ccf368226974901360a15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b02deaa8621f3edf517ccf368226974901360a15/0_0_3508_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been hailed for its recycling on set, but product placement for Sony was less eco-friendly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been hailed for its recycling on set, but product placement for Sony was less eco-friendly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, Hollywood, a left-leaning eco-friendly constituency by nature, wants to do its part. From Phoenix to Leonardo DiCaprio, long a spokesman for environmental causes, it is not hard to find film stars and studio personnel who talk the talk and at least partially walk the walk, all the way down to their Prius. The Disney co-chair <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_F._Horn\" title=\"\">Alan Horn</a> is the chair of the trustees of the environmental lobbying group <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/\" title=\"\">Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)</a> and in 1989 helped found the <a href=\"https://www.green4ema.org/\" title=\"\">Environmental Media Association (EMA)</a>, which doles out <a href=\"https://www.green4ema.org/ema-green-seal-production\" title=\"\">Green Seal certification</a> for movies that make efforts towards sustainable production.</p> <p>Most major film studios now have sustainability drives to encourage the use of clean energy on set and the recycling of production materials. Independent consultancies exist, such as <a href=\"https://www.earthangel.nyc/\" title=\"\">Earth Angel</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.greensparkgroup.com/\" title=\"\">Green Spark Group</a>, to make this happen; the <a href=\"https://www.greenproductionguide.com/\" title=\"\">Green Production Guide</a> \u2013 developed by all the major studios in the wake of the US pulling out of the Paris climate agreement \u2013 helps with finding such companies and calculating carbon footprints. Carbon-neutral productions, achieved through emissions offsetting, are now relatively common. Certain films make a point of pride, or at least of marketing, of their green credentials: Jason Bateman\u2019s 2013 directorial debut <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Words_(film)\" title=\"\">Bad Words</a> was the first fully solar-powered production.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it remains virtually impossible to meaningfully audit Hollywood\u2019s eco-credentials because of a lack of overarching information. Only two of the big six traditional studios made their emissions totals freely available online in 2018: Disney (<a href=\"https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2018-CSR-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">1.93m tonnes</a>) and Sony-Columbia (<a href=\"https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr_report/environment/site/ghg.html\" title=\"\">1.34m</a>). Along with those two, the others make varying corporation-wide pledges, but they remain as airily aspirational as a J Lo romcom: Universal, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/values/report/2019/sustainability/drive-to-zero-emissions\" title=\"\">touts</a> its fuel-efficient transportation fleet as leading its zero-emissions drive, but will not put a date on zero-hour. Before its buyout by Disney, 21st Century Fox announced it was carbon-neutral in 2011, but the term then disappeared from later reports on the subject.</p> <p>The UCLA study, 14 years old and predating the recent sustainability boom, is still the only major overview available. But its authors admit that it is an approximate, anecdotal work, drawn from 43, mostly anonymised, interviews with people working in the industry. When it comes to understanding ecological footprints on a film-by-film basis, Hollywood\u2019s famously gnomic accounting practices get in the way. Few productions release specific emissions information. The benchmark remains Roland Emmerich\u2019s 2004 super-storm thriller The Day After Tomorrow, which because of its environmental theme, came clean about its carbon footprint: 10,000 tonnes, as estimated by Future Forests ($200,000 of a $125m budget was paid to offset this). So establishing general metrics for the ecological imprint of film productions that might help the industry as a whole whittle down emissions and wastage faster is still a far-off hope.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2607526b219c043ed180bbbfb213a09f34d919ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2607526b219c043ed180bbbfb213a09f34d919ae/0_0_3431_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was touted for its sustainable shoot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was touted for its sustainable shoot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>T</strong>he lack of both a clear roadmap and rigorous application leaves Hollywood open to the charge that its eco efforts, despite the growing momentum, are mere greenwashing. Disney\u2019s emissions reductions (aiming at a 50% cut from 2012 levels by 2020) look good on paper until you realise that a high percentage are from its cruise-ship line \u2013 and it has just signed on for <a href=\"https://www.lngworldnews.com/disney-cruise-line-reveals-more-details-on-its-lng-powered-trio/\" title=\"\">three more vessels</a> (albeit powered by less-polluting liquefied natural gas). To go back to the Golden Globes, does it matter that this year\u2019s guests were eating vegan in the overall scheme of an event with the kind of footprint that includes a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/01/04/inside-the-nearly-10000-golden-globes-gift-bag/#3ba6bf581b99\" title=\"\">$10,000 (\u00a37,630) gift bag</a> for VIPs?</p> <p>In the absence of true industry-wide practice, Hollywood eco initiatives remain piecemeal, and are usually opt-in or imposed by powerful stars with a conscience. It has been <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/joaquin-phoenix-golden-globes-vegan-1203457761/\" title=\"\">reported</a>, for example, that it was Phoenix who persuaded the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to serve a vegan menu at the Globes. (The effect of his good work was rather undone when Stella McCartney <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StellaMcCartney/status/1214123180408918016\" title=\"\">commended</a> him for his \u201cbravery\u201d in wearing a single tuxedo \u2013 hers \u2013 throughout awards season.) Maybe even the minimum gesture, carbon offsetting, is a form of cheap expiation that stops root-and-branch overhaul of how film productions are run.</p> <p>In the meantime, the disconnect between publicly declared environmentalism and daily practice in Hollywood continues. Not only is blockbuster film-making a resource-intensive activity, but it is part of a bigger superstructure of capitalist enterprise that is inherently ecologically costly.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have to remember that entertainment is market-driven. Audiences don\u2019t want to hear about climate change</p> </blockquote> <p>To take two examples, 2018\u2019s <a href=\"http://lab.cccb.org/en/eco-friendly-practices-in-the-film-industry/\" title=\"\">Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</a> was touted for its sustainable shoot, distributing reusable water bottles to cast and crew, employing hybrid vehicles and using 75% LED lighting. It also contained product placement or commercial partnerships with Amazon, Jeep Wrangler, Dr Pepper, Dairy Queen and Doritos, among others; putting aside what this great network of commerce represents, the latter brand\u2019s use of palm oil should have been reason enough to think twice.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBhziscGnRs\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a>, from 2014, has been brandished as a best-practice example, earning the EMA\u2019s Green Seal for recycling practices that stopped 52% of the waste it generated from ending up in landfill. But how significant is this when the film comes slathered in placement for production company Sony\u2019s laptops and mobile phones \u2013 built with components using rare-Earth elements, the extraction of which has a heavy impact?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d3ee9448a207175581c64daea25585b05013083\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3ee9448a207175581c64daea25585b05013083/0_112_3360_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Gervais did not mince his words as he hosted the Golden Globes 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricky Gervais did not mince his words as he hosted the Golden Globes 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hollywood is not alone in struggling with these contradictions. The value of small actions weighed against the bigger picture, whether these efforts are meaningful or self-deluding, is the great middle-class dilemma of the 21st century. But Hollywood is alone in its capacity to draw attention to these quandaries, through the subject matter it chooses to film. Here, again, its record is questionable \u2013 apart from documentaries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/15/climatechange.documentary\" title=\"\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>. Environmental themes have never been catnip to Hollywood executives, despite the efforts of the likes of the NRDC to steer film-makers in this direction. Traditionally, they have crept into the context of certain top-tier films, such as Waterworld, AI or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/18/animation\" title=\"\">WALL-E</a>, but less than a handful of mainstream directors, such as Emmerich, seem willing to engage with the issue directly.</p> <p>Maybe, as the global situation has darkened, there has been movement on this front. From Avatar to Mad Max: Fury Road to Interstellar to Blade Runner 2049 to Avengers: Infinity War to Aquaman, it does feel as if ecological collapse is now more fully normalised in the mainstream. But none of these films dared be explicitly political, whether out of fear of alienating the climate-sceptic middle-American audience, or just of tearing off the veil of Hollywood\u2019s breezy escapism. The Asian mainstream \u2013 from Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s longstanding ecological commitment to Stephen Chow\u2019s recent eco-comedy The Mermaid and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Snowpiercer and Okja \u2013 does more heavy lifting.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing you have to remember is that entertainment is market-driven. Frankly, [audiences] don\u2019t want to hear about climate change,\u201d the director James Cameron \u2013 who is planning to make his Avatar sequels solar-powered and vegan-catered \u2013 recently <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/features/climate-crisis-hollywood-environment-movies-tv-1203329390/\" title=\"\">told</a> Variety. He remains doubtful about the impact of ecologically themed films: \u201cI think you can insinuate these ideas into your storytelling. I\u2019ve certainly done that with Avatar, but, frankly, Avatar came out 10 years ago. And in that time our population has grown by almost a billion people, and the effects of that alone on our environment and climate change are devastating. Does [storytelling] do that much good?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the problem is the kind of storytelling. Maybe ecologically progressive thinking is too challenging to the capitalist paradigm of which Hollywood remains a central part. It is easier to put everyone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM-DoO84Sf4\" title=\"\">planetary worst thoughts</a> into the mouths of villains such as Thanos or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctbqyw8GcIw\" title=\"\">Aquaman\u2019s King Orm</a>, or to let us wallow in postlapsarian dystopias than to write stories that envisage solutions, or even dig into the complexities. There is no magic gauntlet or golden sea-trident to wish away the climate crisis. But if Hollywood\u2019s recent spate of ecologically conscious blockbusters is itself another form of greenwashing, then \u2013 as Cameron points out \u2013 we as paying viewers are ultimately responsible.</p> <p>Nothing illustrates this link between the entertainment industry and its consumers more directly than the rise of Netflix. Now, as cinema attendance continues to fall, we are ditching the collective viewing in favour of individual comfort that keeps the energy tab rolling every time we let the autoplay scroll through. It is the audiovisual equivalent of ditching public transport for private vehicles. The impact of this is huge: in 2018, video-related internet \u2013 34% of which was accounted for by video-on-demand services \u2013 produced 300m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>; roughly the same as Spain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3pdeTv-8GI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i3pdeTv-8GI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>By 2022, Cisco estimates that 80% of internet traffic will be video-related in a field that is heating up as Disney+ and Apple TV+ chase down Netflix and Amazon. In his Globes speech, Gervais skewered the blind spot at the centre of Hollywood\u2019s current tech obsession: \u201cIf Isis started a streaming service, you\u2019d call your agent, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d It seems like a matter of time before we are served up a Silicon Valley tech billionaire as blockbuster baddie, but that lets us off too easily. If we are demanding that Hollywood be honest about its ecological ledger, that means taking a long look in the black mirror, too.</p>",

From Phoenix to Leonardo DiCaprio, long a spokesman for environmental causes, it is not hard to find film stars and studio personnel who talk the talk and at least partially walk the walk, all the way down to their Prius. The Disney co-chair Alan Horn is the chair of the trustees of the environmental lobbying group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and in 1989 helped found the Environmental Media Association (EMA), which doles out Green Seal certification for movies that make efforts towards sustainable production. Most major film studios now have sustainability drives to encourage the use of clean energy on set and the recycling of production materials. Independent consultancies exist, such as Earth Angel and the Green Spark Group, to make this happen; the Green Production Guide \u2013 developed by all the major studios in the wake of the US pulling out of the Paris climate agreement \u2013 helps with finding such companies and calculating carbon footprints. Carbon-neutral productions, achieved through emissions offsetting, are now relatively common. Certain films make a point of pride, or at least of marketing, of their green credentials: Jason Bateman\u2019s 2013 directorial debut Bad Words was the first fully solar-powered production. Unfortunately, it remains virtually impossible to meaningfully audit Hollywood\u2019s eco-credentials because of a lack of overarching information. Only two of the big six traditional studios made their emissions totals freely available online in 2018: Disney (1.93m tonnes) and Sony-Columbia (1.34m). Along with those two, the others make varying corporation-wide pledges, but they remain as airily aspirational as a J Lo romcom: Universal, for example, touts its fuel-efficient transportation fleet as leading its zero-emissions drive, but will not put a date on zero-hour. Before its buyout by Disney, 21st Century Fox announced it was carbon-neutral in 2011, but the term then disappeared from later reports on the subject. The UCLA study, 14 years old and predating the recent sustainability boom, is still the only major overview available. But its authors admit that it is an approximate, anecdotal work, drawn from 43, mostly anonymised, interviews with people working in the industry. When it comes to understanding ecological footprints on a film-by-film basis, Hollywood\u2019s famously gnomic accounting practices get in the way. Few productions release specific emissions information. The benchmark remains Roland Emmerich\u2019s 2004 super-storm thriller The Day After Tomorrow, which because of its environmental theme, came clean about its carbon footprint: 10,000 tonnes, as estimated by Future Forests ($200,000 of a $125m budget was paid to offset this). So establishing general metrics for the ecological imprint of film productions that might help the industry as a whole whittle down emissions and wastage faster is still a far-off hope. The lack of both a clear roadmap and rigorous application leaves Hollywood open to the charge that its eco efforts, despite the growing momentum, are mere greenwashing. Disney\u2019s emissions reductions (aiming at a 50% cut from 2012 levels by 2020) look good on paper until you realise that a high percentage are from its cruise-ship line \u2013 and it has just signed on for three more vessels (albeit powered by less-polluting liquefied natural gas). To go back to the Golden Globes, does it matter that this year\u2019s guests were eating vegan in the overall scheme of an event with the kind of footprint that includes a $10,000 (\u00a37,630) gift bag for VIPs? In the absence of true industry-wide practice, Hollywood eco initiatives remain piecemeal, and are usually opt-in or imposed by powerful stars with a conscience. It has been reported, for example, that it was Phoenix who persuaded the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to serve a vegan menu at the Globes. (The effect of his good work was rather undone when Stella McCartney commended him for his \u201cbravery\u201d in wearing a single tuxedo \u2013 hers \u2013 throughout awards season.) Maybe even the minimum gesture, carbon offsetting, is a form of cheap expiation that stops root-and-branch overhaul of how film productions are run. In the meantime, the disconnect between publicly declared environmentalism and daily practice in Hollywood continues. Not only is blockbuster film-making a resource-intensive activity, but it is part of a bigger superstructure of capitalist enterprise that is inherently ecologically costly. You have to remember that entertainment is market-driven. Audiences don\u2019t want to hear about climate change To take two examples, 2018\u2019s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was touted for its sustainable shoot, distributing reusable water bottles to cast and crew, employing hybrid vehicles and using 75% LED lighting. It also contained product placement or commercial partnerships with Amazon, Jeep Wrangler, Dr Pepper, Dairy Queen and Doritos, among others; putting aside what this great network of commerce represents, the latter brand\u2019s use of palm oil should have been reason enough to think twice. The Amazing Spider-Man 2, from 2014, has been brandished as a best-practice example, earning the EMA\u2019s Green Seal for recycling practices that stopped 52% of the waste it generated from ending up in landfill. But how significant is this when the film comes slathered in placement for production company Sony\u2019s laptops and mobile phones \u2013 built with components using rare-Earth elements, the extraction of which has a heavy impact? Hollywood is not alone in struggling with these contradictions. The value of small actions weighed against the bigger picture, whether these efforts are meaningful or self-deluding, is the great middle-class dilemma of the 21st century. But Hollywood is alone in its capacity to draw attention to these quandaries, through the subject matter it chooses to film. Here, again, its record is questionable \u2013 apart from documentaries such as An Inconvenient Truth. Environmental themes have never been catnip to Hollywood executives, despite the efforts of the likes of the NRDC to steer film-makers in this direction. Traditionally, they have crept into the context of certain top-tier films, such as Waterworld, AI or WALL-E, but less than a handful of mainstream directors, such as Emmerich, seem willing to engage with the issue directly. Maybe, as the global situation has darkened, there has been movement on this front. From Avatar to Mad Max: Fury Road to Interstellar to Blade Runner 2049 to Avengers: Infinity War to Aquaman, it does feel as if ecological collapse is now more fully normalised in the mainstream. But none of these films dared be explicitly political, whether out of fear of alienating the climate-sceptic middle-American audience, or just of tearing off the veil of Hollywood\u2019s breezy escapism. The Asian mainstream \u2013 from Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s longstanding ecological commitment to Stephen Chow\u2019s recent eco-comedy The Mermaid and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Snowpiercer and Okja \u2013 does more heavy lifting. \u201cThe thing you have to remember is that entertainment is market-driven. Frankly, [audiences] don\u2019t want to hear about climate change,\u201d the director James Cameron \u2013 who is planning to make his Avatar sequels solar-powered and vegan-catered \u2013 recently told Variety. He remains doubtful about the impact of ecologically themed films: \u201cI think you can insinuate these ideas into your storytelling. I\u2019ve certainly done that with Avatar, but, frankly, Avatar came out 10 years ago. And in that time our population has grown by almost a billion people, and the effects of that alone on our environment and climate change are devastating. Does [storytelling] do that much good?\u201d Perhaps the problem is the kind of storytelling. Maybe ecologically progressive thinking is too challenging to the capitalist paradigm of which Hollywood remains a central part. It is easier to put everyone\u2019s planetary worst thoughts into the mouths of villains such as Thanos or Aquaman\u2019s King Orm, or to let us wallow in postlapsarian dystopias than to write stories that envisage solutions, or even dig into the complexities. There is no magic gauntlet or golden sea-trident to wish away the climate crisis. But if Hollywood\u2019s recent spate of ecologically conscious blockbusters is itself another form of greenwashing, then \u2013 as Cameron points out \u2013 we as paying viewers are ultimately responsible. Nothing illustrates this link between the entertainment industry and its consumers more directly than the rise of Netflix. Now, as cinema attendance continues to fall, we are ditching the collective viewing in favour of individual comfort that keeps the energy tab rolling every time we let the autoplay scroll through. It is the audiovisual equivalent of ditching public transport for private vehicles. The impact of this is huge: in 2018, video-related internet \u2013 34% of which was accounted for by video-on-demand services \u2013 produced 300m tonnes of CO2; roughly the same as Spain. By 2022, Cisco estimates that 80% of internet traffic will be video-related in a field that is heating up as Disney+ and Apple TV+ chase down Netflix and Amazon. In his Globes speech, Gervais skewered the blind spot at the centre of Hollywood\u2019s current tech obsession: \u201cIf Isis started a streaming service, you\u2019d call your agent, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d It seems like a matter of time before we are served up a Silicon Valley tech billionaire as blockbuster baddie, but that lets us off too easily. If we are demanding that Hollywood be honest about its ecological ledger, that means taking a long look in the black mirror, too.",

      "bodyText": "Rare 28,000-year-old archaeological finds excavated from rapidly thawing ground in Siberia are to go on display for the first time at the British Museum as part of an exhibition on the history of the Arctic and its people. Sewing needles and jewellery made from walrus ivory as well as carved mammoth ivory decorative objects are being lent by the Russian Academy of Science for a show that will be the biggest of its kind. Jago Cooper, the head of the Americas collections at the museum, said the archeological site in north-east Siberia was a remarkable treasure trove, but it is also a tragedy because the objects are only now emerging due to the climate emergency. \u201cAs the Arctic is melting, the permafrost, the frozen ground, is melting as well. The things that people were living with in that landscape, which are incredibly well-preserved in that frozen ground, are coming out as the ground is melting. \u201cIt\u2019s like the library of Alexandria being on fire ... You\u2019re plucking out these books which are coming out \u2026 it\u2019s a remarkable window into life, all coming out of the ground in one go.\u201d The loans will be part of an exhibition exploring the history of the region where 4 million people still live, including 400,000 indigenous people. It will be told through the lens of weather and the climate crisis, with scientists predicting that the Arctic will be ice-free in 80 years. Objects from the Yana Rhinoceros Horn archaeological site in Siberia, 300 miles (480km) north of the Arctic circle, are particular highlights. It was there, 30,000 years ago, that Palaeolithic people hunted woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, bison and giant horses. They also developed the first Arctic art. Amber Lincoln, a co-curator of the show, said the needles were an important example of Arctic innovation and would have been threaded and used to create tailored garments. \u201cThink about that, these small needles 28,000 years ago \u2026 it kind of just gives me the chills, frankly.\u201d Part of the exhibition will explore the social, economic and political changes Arctic people have faced as a result of European and Russian exploration of the region, including the quest for the Northwest Passage and the global fur trade. A key object will be an Inughuit (Greenlandic) sled made from narwhal and caribou bone and driftwood. It was traded to the British polar explorer Sir John Ross in his 1818 expedition, the first known encounter between Inughuit and Europeans. Curators said there would also be a number of new artworks commissioned as well as contemporary photography by the likes of Kiliii Yuyan among others. Staging a show so heavily freighted with issues around the climate emergency has inevitably raised questions around the British Museum\u2019s relationship with one of its biggest sponsors, BP. The Arctic show\u2019s main sponsor will be Citibank. Chris Garrard, the co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, accused the museum of \u201ccynically\u201d keeping BP\u2019s logo away from the exhibition. \u201cThe museum clearly accepts that BP has a dire record on climate change but will go on giving its backing to the oil firm, which remains 97% invested in fossil fuels.\u201d Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, denied a charge of hypocrisy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s contradictory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all exposed to the challenges and have to think together, how to find the right solution, to mitigate the effects of these changes.

      "body": "<p>The end of the decade prompted, for me, a brief reactivation of Facebook in order to remind myself what I\u2019d been up to 10 years ago. Getting drunk with a load of Europeans, it turned out. The pictures show us on a succession of sweaty nights out, grinning after too many <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/long-island-iced-tea\" title=\"\">Long Island iced teas</a> (chosen because you got the maximum bang for your buck), our sense of affectionate comradeship clear from the arms we have thrown around one another, our faces smushed together. I had been studying in Italy, living in a hall of residence with a mix of Italians and foreign exchange students, as part of the Erasmus programme \u2013 an EU student foreign exchange scheme founded in 1987, now known as <a href=\"https://www.erasmusplus.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Erasmus+</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, as part of Brexit legislation, MPs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HouseofCommons/status/1214996118322532353\" title=\"\">voted down</a> an amendment that would have required the government to negotiate continued membership of Erasmus+. A Department for Education spokesman later said: \u201cThe government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/09/uk-committed-to-maintaining-erasmus-exchange-scheme\" title=\"\">committed to continuing</a> \u2026 the next Erasmus+ programme,\u201d but added the ominous caveat, \u201cif it is in our interests to do so.\u201d But its lack of real interest in this important scheme makes me truly sad. Contrary to the story told by the photographs, Erasmus meant so much more to me than a year of partying. It opened the world to me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those of us who took part will mourn for the future generations who\u2019ll be missing out if this does turn out to be the end of the programme</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019d travelled very little and, having spent the bulk of my childhood in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/04/11-reasons-why-love-wales-choirs-cheese-on-toast-scenery\" title=\"\">Welsh</a> village, had not met many people from other countries. As soon as I turned 18 I moved to Paris: a gap year that sounds posher than it was (I was a waitress and a nanny). It taught me the value of living abroad and a new language. Studying modern languages was an obvious next step, and with that came Erasmus.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to express all that this programme gave me, without becoming emotional. I didn\u2019t have the kind of resources that made travel an option. I could never have afforded to move to Italy without the grant the EU gave me. I would never have learned Italian, a language I love, or discovered the same passion I have for the country\u2019s literature, cinema and art. I would never have developed the confidence you gain from having to navigate the complex bureaucracy of another country, or from being cross-examined in front of a packed lecture theatre in a foreign language about the paintings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/21/mona-lisa-leonard-da-vinci-louvre-exhibition\" title=\"\">Leonardo da Vinci</a>.

Our extended friendship group encompassed the UK, Italy, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Germany. Years later, a gratifying number came to my wedding, despite having scattered on an international scale in the time since. There were four of us Welshies; one now lives in Berlin, another in Copenhagen. I have friends in Athens and Stockholm, Australia, the United States and, of course, Italy, a country with which I fell passionately in love, though at times \u2013 as when I was catcalled by two men driving a hearse (they shouted \u201c<em>che figa</em>\u201d, loose translation: \u201cwhat a hot pussy\u201d) \u2013 that love was not returned in quite the fashion I expected.</p> <p>Such moments of transnational discovery were often hilarious, as you\u2019d expect with so many cultures rubbing up against one another, often literally. I\u2019ll never forget one friend announcing that he had spent the weekend with his genitals when he meant to say parents, nor the time I asked for pineapple on my pizza in order to troll my date, and the chef shouted from the back that he thought he had a can somewhere, but I\u2019d have to add it myself as he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. There were weird incidents, too: paying protection money to park the car; getting lost in Venice for so long that the sun began to rise; a \u20ac500 wheel of parmesan handed over as compensation for a place wrecked after a party, pretending our dads were in Depeche Mode while hitchhiking because we thought it would prevent us being kidnapped. One classmate moved into a crumbling old mansion with a record producer in the cellar, an old man in the west wing, several sex workers and an entire room full of fur coats. Another found herself waitressing at an orgy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/07/next-phase-brexit-messy\">Brace yourself: the next phase of Brexit is going to get messy | Mujtaba Rahman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suppose it all sounds a bit debauched, and probably not what the Erasmus press office might have in mind (nor, I imagine, was the classic film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/09/artsfeatures7\" title=\"\">L\u2019Auberge Espagnole</a>, though a better tribute to Erasmus cannot be found), but when you\u2019re living abroad and young you tend to end up in situations that you couldn\u2019t have predicted, not to mention relationships. </p> <p>I treasure all of it and will carry it with me for the rest of my days. It\u2019s all part of the life experience of living in another country, and that is a gift. No doubt some Brexiters will frame Erasmus as a cushy holiday for a privileged few: let them. Those of us who took part know the doors that it opened, and will mourn for the future generations who\u2019ll be missing out if this does turn out to be the end of the programme.</p> <p>My world was small and it grew big, thanks to my experiences in Europe.

      "bodyText": "The end of the decade prompted, for me, a brief reactivation of Facebook in order to remind myself what I\u2019d been up to 10 years ago. Getting drunk with a load of Europeans, it turned out. The pictures show us on a succession of sweaty nights out, grinning after too many Long Island iced teas (chosen because you got the maximum bang for your buck), our sense of affectionate comradeship clear from the arms we have thrown around one another, our faces smushed together. I had been studying in Italy, living in a hall of residence with a mix of Italians and foreign exchange students, as part of the Erasmus programme \u2013 an EU student foreign exchange scheme founded in 1987, now known as Erasmus+. On Wednesday night, as part of Brexit legislation, MPs voted down an amendment that would have required the government to negotiate continued membership of Erasmus+. A Department for Education spokesman later said: \u201cThe government is committed to continuing \u2026 the next Erasmus+ programme,\u201d but added the ominous caveat, \u201cif it is in our interests to do so.\u201d But its lack of real interest in this important scheme makes me truly sad. Contrary to the story told by the photographs, Erasmus meant so much more to me than a year of partying. It opened the world to me. I\u2019d travelled very little and, having spent the bulk of my childhood in a Welsh village, had not met many people from other countries. As soon as I turned 18 I moved to Paris: a gap year that sounds posher than it was (I was a waitress and a nanny). It taught me the value of living abroad and a new language. Studying modern languages was an obvious next step, and with that came Erasmus. It\u2019s hard to express all that this programme gave me, without becoming emotional. I didn\u2019t have the kind of resources that made travel an option. I could never have afforded to move to Italy without the grant the EU gave me. I would never have learned Italian, a language I love, or discovered the same passion I have for the country\u2019s literature, cinema and art. I would never have developed the confidence you gain from having to navigate the complex bureaucracy of another country, or from being cross-examined in front of a packed lecture theatre in a foreign language about the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci. I would not have seen Sicily, or Venice, or Sardinia in the company of so many new friends. I met people from all over the world. Our extended friendship group encompassed the UK, Italy, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Germany. Years later, a gratifying number came to my wedding, despite having scattered on an international scale in the time since. There were four of us Welshies; one now lives in Berlin, another in Copenhagen. I have friends in Athens and Stockholm, Australia, the United States and, of course, Italy, a country with which I fell passionately in love, though at times \u2013 as when I was catcalled by two men driving a hearse (they shouted \u201cche figa\u201d, loose translation: \u201cwhat a hot pussy\u201d) \u2013 that love was not returned in quite the fashion I expected. Such moments of transnational discovery were often hilarious, as you\u2019d expect with so many cultures rubbing up against one another, often literally. I\u2019ll never forget one friend announcing that he had spent the weekend with his genitals when he meant to say parents, nor the time I asked for pineapple on my pizza in order to troll my date, and the chef shouted from the back that he thought he had a can somewhere, but I\u2019d have to add it myself as he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. There were weird incidents, too: paying protection money to park the car; getting lost in Venice for so long that the sun began to rise; a \u20ac500 wheel of parmesan handed over as compensation for a place wrecked after a party, pretending our dads were in Depeche Mode while hitchhiking because we thought it would prevent us being kidnapped. One classmate moved into a crumbling old mansion with a record producer in the cellar, an old man in the west wing, several sex workers and an entire room full of fur coats. Another found herself waitressing at an orgy. I suppose it all sounds a bit debauched, and probably not what the Erasmus press office might have in mind (nor, I imagine, was the classic film L\u2019Auberge Espagnole, though a better tribute to Erasmus cannot be found), but when you\u2019re living abroad and young you tend to end up in situations that you couldn\u2019t have predicted, not to mention relationships. I treasure all of it and will carry it with me for the rest of my days. It\u2019s all part of the life experience of living in another country, and that is a gift. No doubt some Brexiters will frame Erasmus as a cushy holiday for a privileged few: let them. Those of us who took part know the doors that it opened, and will mourn for the future generations who\u2019ll be missing out if this does turn out to be the end of the programme. My world was small and it grew big, thanks to my experiences in Europe. On 31 January, I\u2019ll think first of all the people I had the pleasure of meeting, and maybe look again at a few of those cheesy photographs, our idiotic, naive, hopeful faces. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to mix with other cultures, especially when you\u2019re young. It didn\u2019t have to end here. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",

Lance Wissinger wants to be part of the solution. Wissinger wanted to be the first person to register to vote at the Lee county election office the day Amendment 4 went into effect. But by the time he got there, around 9am, someone had already beat him. Wissinger has never voted. He was convicted of DUI manslaughter and served four and a half years in prison in the mid-2000s. When he was released, Wissinger said he wanted to get more involved in his community. Last year he started as a policy fellow with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, where, like Meade, he has been trying to inform as many people as possible about their right to vote. \u201cI\u2019ve gone out and knocked on doors and I tell people: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m just seeing if you want to register to vote.\u2019 And they\u2019re like \u2018I can\u2019t, I\u2019m a felon.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018You can now,\u2019\u201d he said. It can be difficult for people to figure out if their sentences are fully completed. The law Republicans passed last year allows courts to change sentences, and replace fines and fees with community service hours. But so far just four counties in the state, all Democratic-leaning, are utilizing the provision. Meanwhile, Wissinger hopes to change the general perception of what felons look like, and who benefits from Amendment 4. \u201cPeople will be like: \u2018Well, you had a chance and you screwed that up.\u2019 Not knowing and not understanding is a lot of why I go and speak and tell my story,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how big of a deal it was until it personally affected me.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A fresh attempt to sue Libya for supplying the IRA with the plastic explosive Semtex during the Troubles is being launched by victims and the bereaved in Northern Ireland. Claims have been lodged with the high court in Belfast on Thursday on behalf of two men who are seeking compensation respectively for the 1993 Shankill Road bombing and a blast on the Falls Road, west Belfast, in 1988. Victims of other atrocities are to lodge claims next week, including those affected by the 1987 Enniskillen Remembrance Day bombing and the so-called \u201cGood Samaritan Bomb\u201d in Derry the following year. The Provisional IRA received extensive, secret shipments of Libyan weapons during Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s time in power. The most devastating material deployed in the republican terrorist campaign was Semtex. Previous efforts to secure redress from Libya have foundered in British and US courts despite the fact that Libyan assets have been frozen in the UK. A parliamentary report last year criticised the UK government for failing to secure compensation. The latest legal initiative comes from the Belfast solicitor Kevin Winters, who specialises in Troubles-related litigation. One of his colleagues from KRW Law, Chris Stanley, has also unearthed Foreign Office documents from the 1980s that revealed more about the government\u2019s knowledge of the smuggling. This is the first time claims have been pursued through the Northern Ireland courts. The lawyers will have to overcome formidable legal obstacles such as time restrictions on bringing cases, state immunity limitations and questions about whether the issues can be decided by judges. Winters points to exemptions under the State Immunity Act 1978 whereby foreign states are not immune to proceedings if they involve \u201cdeath or personal injury or damage to or loss of property caused by an act or omission in the United Kingdom\u201d. His two lead cases involve Seamus Sullivan, who was injured in the 1988 bombing that targeted British army foot patrols on the Falls Road, and George Brown, who was injured in the 1993 Shankill Road bombing that targeted the Ulster Defence Association and killed 10 people, including the bomber. The legal action aims to provide access to billions of dollars of funds in the UK seized by the British government after the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in 2011. At present the claims are against Libya, but it is possible they may be extended to include the Foreign Office for allegedly failing to obtain compensation for victims. In 2017, the Northern Ireland affairs committee concluded that between the 1970s and 1990s Libya provided the IRA with \u201cmany tonnes of arms and ammunition, millions of dollars in finances, military training, and explosives. \u201cIn particular, through a series of shipments, which took place in the mid-1980s, the regime supplied somewhere between 2.75 and 10 tonnes of Semtex \u2013 a highly powerful, malleable and virtually undetectable plastic explosive.\u201d Semtex was used in the Enniskillen attack. Documents extracted from the Foreign Office through freedom of information requests show exchanges between diplomats in Tripoli, Paris and London after the MV Eksund was intercepted in the Bay of Biscay by the French navy in November 1987 with 120 tonnes of weapons onboard. In one comment, an FCO desk officer states: \u201cIf a minister is challenged to prove Qadhafi\u2019s [alternative spelling] connection with PIRA \u2013 as it seems he will be \u2013 we had better not duck it.\u201d In another note, an official at the British embassy in Dublin wrote: \u201cLibyan support for the IRA, though clearly generous when the relationship is close, has never seemed to be based on much interest or understanding of Irish republicanism.\u201d The legal claims, drawn up with the help of the barrister Nick Scott, argue that: \u201cIt is entirely implausible to think that Libya did not foresee the risk of harm ... caused by the Provisional IRA detonating bombs when Libya was providing PIRA with Semtex.

Peter Harrison, chief commercial officer of Quorn Foods, said: \u201cThis is about giving people the information needed to make informed decisions about the food they eat and the effect it has on our planet\u2019s climate \u2013 in the same way that nutrition information is clearly labelled to help inform decisions on health.\u201d Manufacturers are stepping up efforts to give consumers more information about the environmental impact of their products, despite previous attempts ending in failure. The UK\u2019s largest retailer Tesco, for example, dropped its plan to label all its products with their carbon footprint, after promising \u201ca revolution in green consumption\u201d, blaming the work involved and other supermarkets for failing to follow its lead. Carbon Trust research in 2019 found that two-thirds of consumers support the idea of a recognisable carbon label to demonstrate that products have been made with a commitment to measuring and reducing their carbon footprint.",

Still, events there will be a key reference point as the SPFL\u2019s clubs finally get round to a VAR decision which has been even more protracted than offside calls for goals in the Premier League. The odds remain against Scotland taking fresh technology on board. You get the distinct impression the SPFL is not at all perturbed by that.</p>",

The level of vitriol and conspiracy chucked at Scottish referees, and especially when the Old Firm are in close competition, renders it perfectly correct for them to seek assistance. So much of Scotland\u2019s football decision making, even for clubs at the upper echelon, revolves around finance. It remains a stretch to suggest Hamilton, Livingston or even Motherwell will gladly remove tens of thousands of pounds from their annual bottom line for VAR. For context, even \u00a350,000 could instead be invested in a first-team player at that level. A new and enhanced television deal with Sky Sports, which kicks in next season, provides upcoming commercial leeway but there is little indication of clubs having an appetite to divert money towards a system routinely derided in England. There would be infrastructure challenges, again finance-linked. Screens would need to be erected at umpteen Premiership grounds if the in-game experience is to be properly modified for VAR. Although bases exist for a potential Stockley Park equivalent, provision of suitable connectivity \u2013 Scotland\u2019s Premiership is played in places as remote as Dingwall \u2013 would be a challenge. VAR can be implemented from as few as four live broadcast cameras per match, the number deployed at smaller Premiership games in Scotland, but should a lack of angles lead to ambiguity, would this \u201ccheap\u201d form of VAR be lambasted? There is a growing acceptance that England\u2019s application of VAR, rather than the concept, has proved problematic. Still, events there will be a key reference point as the SPFL\u2019s clubs finally get round to a VAR decision which has been even more protracted than offside calls for goals in the Premier League. The odds remain against Scotland taking fresh technology on board. You get the distinct impression the SPFL is not at all perturbed by that.",

After the news broke on Wednesday night, Morgan launched a Twitter tirade against Meghan and Harry that has continued on Thursday. He said the death of his mother Diana did not give Harry \u201clicence to treat the Queen so appallingly\u201d. The Daily Mail devotes its first 17 pages to \u201cthe Rogue Royals\u201d. Its columnist Sarah Vine, who has always been suspicious of Meghan Markle, wrote this: It\u2019s almost as though nothing matters to this couple apart from their own immediate happiness and gratification, as though they are incapable of seeing beyond their own little bubble of privilege. It has often been speculated as to whether they might end up walking away from Britain.

As Vine suggests the Mail was much more indulgent towards Harry in the days when pictures emerged of him dressed in a Nazi uniform at a fancy dress party. Now it has crowned him the Prince of Woke: He was once the fun-loving young royal famously caught with his trousers down playing strip billiards in a Las Vegas hotel suite with his mates. But Prince Harry has since swapped partying for posturing on a range of \u2018woke\u2019 issues with his wife Meghan Markle. From preaching about environmentalism to carving emotional messages in cupcake icing sugar, Harry\u2019s hobbies have markedly shifted over the years. His cheeky grin was once a staple at Royal events, and his overseas trips would showcase a charismatic young man who would always try to have a laugh. In the Daily Express, meanwhile, columnist Virginia Blackburn addressed the couple more in sorrow than in anger, asking: \u201cIs it Meghan\u2019s fault?\u201d It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that having grown up in a country that considers the Kennedys to be aristocracy, Meghan didn\u2019t understand that being a Windsor is not like being a celebrity \u2026 it was about getting on with the job.

Hammersmith\u2019s Kings Mall, which opened in 1980 and has 40 shops including H&amp;M, Primark, Sainsbury\u2019s and Wilko, is the Swedish furniture chain\u2019s first shopping centre in the UK and the first it has taken over. The chain is investing \u00a3170m in the mall including the purchase and redevelopment. Ikea owns 44 malls worldwide but has built these itself, rather than buying up existing centres. In October, Ikea said it had bumped up its property team in the UK with the aim of capitalising on the decreased valuations of many shopping centres prompted by numerous closures of high street chain stores. The company is thought to be looking at further shopping sites across the UK as a way to get its hands on sites for its smaller, more accessible stores in city centre locations. It is unlikely to face much competition for targets from institutional investors, which are shying away from the retail sector in the face of the rapidly changing market and declining values. The group\u2019s shopping centre arm, Ingka Centres, owns a portfolio of 44 centres in 14 markets around the world, including Russia and China, all of which are anchored by an Ikea store. Gerard Groener, the managing director of Ingka Centres, said: \u201cOur urban projects are all about getting closer to more people.

Extensive interviews with more than 100 British residents in France as part of the 18-month BrExpats programme at Goldsmiths, University of London, have revealed widely differing individual outcomes, Michaela Benson, the project lead, said. With the UK now sure to leave the EU on 31 January, France requires all British residents to have applied for a carte de s\u00e9jour, or residence permit, by July 2021. However, Brexit uncertainty has until very recently caused major confusion. Responsibility for migration governance has been devolved to local government level in France, and central government communication has not always been effective, leading to British residents receiving very different treatment. \u201cNot only have British nationals been confused, but on many occasions, they have been faced with French officials who have also been confused,\u201d Benson said. Many local government officers in France were reluctant to process British citizens until relatively recently, dissuading people from even applying until 12 months ago, and Britons are encountering a range of administrative problems even now, she said. One woman considering a civil partnership with her Irish partner was described by an official in the local mayor\u2019s office as \u201cforeign\u201d, depriving her of rights that, in law, her EU citizenship still permitted. Such problems are deepening inequalities among British citizens in France, which has the second largest population of UK nationals in Europe after Spain, causing greater uncertainty, insecurity and instability for those who are less well off and for women and people in poor health, the research reveals. \u201cIn a context of declining resources and chronic health conditions, these problems can be just one thing too much,\u201d Benson said. \u201cBrexit is revealing faultlines within the British population irrespective of their legal status.\u201d Continued access to healthcare was paramount for several interviewees, particularly those managing chronic conditions. Benson described the case of a 70-year-old widow living on a UK state pension, working to make ends meet and with no capital to fall back on. \u201cHer house was run-down, she could not afford to go back to Britain to visit her family, and she would have no quality of life in Britain if she returned,\u201d she said. \u201cShe does not have the luxury of dwelling on the possible routes she might take to secure her future; she is focused on living from one day to the next.\u201d Some residents are so fearful of being told to leave, particularly because they worry they might not meet a post-Brexit income threshold, that they are avoiding contact with the French authorities altogether, she said. \u201cOnly time will tell who falls between the gaps,\u201d Benson said. \u201cBut what is clear is that some, with the right level of resources and the confidence to question things, will be fine.

      "body": "<p>More foreign travel restrictions should be imposed on known British sex offenders and more suspects prosecuted in the UK for crimes committed overseas, the government has been told.</p> <p>In a 73-page report on protecting children in other countries from exploitation, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) has called for legislation formalising use of international child protection certificates for those working and volunteering abroad.</p> <p>The review, chaired by Prof Alexis Jay, is one of the multiple strands of IICSA\u2019s investigation into child sexual abuse. It found that 361 UK nationals requested consular assistance abroad between 2013 and 2017 after being arrested for child sex offences. That figure, the study suggests, is likely to represent only a fraction of the overall number of British offenders.</p> <p>In a public hearing last February, the inquiry was given evidence of abuse by British travellers in Kenya, Uganda, Malaysia, India, the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar. Children are particularly vulnerable in states with high levels of poverty and corruption.</p> <p>The global child sexual exploitation industry is estimated to be worth about \u00a327.7bn, the report says, and as many as 2 million children are affected by it in south-east Asia. In the Philippines alone, at least 100,000 children may be exploited in the sex \u201cindustry\u201d.</p> <p>Abusers often target disadvantaged families where family members are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/31/live-streaming-child-sex-abuse-family-business-philippines\">willing to act as facilitators</a>, the inquiry warns. In such cases, the disparity between the financial position of the abuser, and that of the victim and their family is a key factor.</p> <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates that about 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat online to children both in Britain and abroad. \u200b</p> <p>High\u2010profile cases such as that of Paul Gadd, better known as the singer Gary Glitter, have raised awareness of the problem. In 2002, he was expelled from Cambodia over unspecified allegations and in 2006 convicted of sexually abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, in Vietnam. On his return to the UK, he was placed on the sex offender register for life. He was subsequently tried for further offences against young girls and sentenced to 16 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>The report highlights gaps in the UK\u2019s legal system that enable known offenders to abuse children abroad. \u201cThe number of orders restricting the foreign travel of sex offenders made under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 appears low every year,\u201d it says. \u201cOf the 5,550 sexual harm prevention orders imposed in England and Wales in 2017-18, foreign travel restrictions were imposed in just 11 cases \u2026 There is ample scope for greater use of foreign travel restriction orders.\u201d</p> <p>Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which allows individuals to be prosecuted in the UK for offences overseas, is also relatively rarely used, the report says. Only seven prosecutions were carried out under section 72 in England and Wales between 1997 and 2018 \u2013 a rate of one prosecution every three years.</p> <p>Policy guidance that such prosecutions should only be pursued in the UK as a last resort is misleading, the report says. \u201cSection 72 prosecutions should be initiated in appropriate cases, particularly where the quality of local justice [overseas] may be suspect.\u201d</p> <p>The report finds that the disclosure and barring system, including the international child protection certificate which overseas institutions can request when recruiting British nationals, is \u201cconfusing, inconsistent and in need of reform\u201d.</p> <p>Disaster areas can also pose a particular risk of sexual abuse for children. Oxfam staff were accused of sexually exploiting children in Haiti following an earthquake in 2010.</p> <p>Some abusers operate in sophisticated networks that share tips and strategies to avoid detection. Richard Huckle, frequently described as \u201cBritain\u2019s worst paedophile\u201d after being convicted of 71 counts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/06/richard-huckle-given-23-life-sentences-for-abusing-malaysian-children\">serious sexual assault</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/06/richard-huckle-given-23-life-sentences-for-abusing-malaysian-children\"> while working in Malaysia</a>, developed a clandestine group to further his activities.</p> <p>Jay said: \u201cThe sexual abuse of children overseas by UK nationals is an urgent problem we cannot hide from.

      "bodyText": "More foreign travel restrictions should be imposed on known British sex offenders and more suspects prosecuted in the UK for crimes committed overseas, the government has been told. In a 73-page report on protecting children in other countries from exploitation, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) has called for legislation formalising use of international child protection certificates for those working and volunteering abroad. The review, chaired by Prof Alexis Jay, is one of the multiple strands of IICSA\u2019s investigation into child sexual abuse. It found that 361 UK nationals requested consular assistance abroad between 2013 and 2017 after being arrested for child sex offences. That figure, the study suggests, is likely to represent only a fraction of the overall number of British offenders. In a public hearing last February, the inquiry was given evidence of abuse by British travellers in Kenya, Uganda, Malaysia, India, the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar. Children are particularly vulnerable in states with high levels of poverty and corruption. The global child sexual exploitation industry is estimated to be worth about \u00a327.7bn, the report says, and as many as 2 million children are affected by it in south-east Asia. In the Philippines alone, at least 100,000 children may be exploited in the sex \u201cindustry\u201d. Abusers often target disadvantaged families where family members are willing to act as facilitators, the inquiry warns. In such cases, the disparity between the financial position of the abuser, and that of the victim and their family is a key factor. The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates that about 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat online to children both in Britain and abroad. High\u2010profile cases such as that of Paul Gadd, better known as the singer Gary Glitter, have raised awareness of the problem. In 2002, he was expelled from Cambodia over unspecified allegations and in 2006 convicted of sexually abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, in Vietnam. On his return to the UK, he was placed on the sex offender register for life. He was subsequently tried for further offences against young girls and sentenced to 16 years\u2019 imprisonment. The report highlights gaps in the UK\u2019s legal system that enable known offenders to abuse children abroad. \u201cThe number of orders restricting the foreign travel of sex offenders made under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 appears low every year,\u201d it says. \u201cOf the 5,550 sexual harm prevention orders imposed in England and Wales in 2017-18, foreign travel restrictions were imposed in just 11 cases \u2026 There is ample scope for greater use of foreign travel restriction orders.\u201d Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which allows individuals to be prosecuted in the UK for offences overseas, is also relatively rarely used, the report says. Only seven prosecutions were carried out under section 72 in England and Wales between 1997 and 2018 \u2013 a rate of one prosecution every three years. Policy guidance that such prosecutions should only be pursued in the UK as a last resort is misleading, the report says. \u201cSection 72 prosecutions should be initiated in appropriate cases, particularly where the quality of local justice [overseas] may be suspect.\u201d The report finds that the disclosure and barring system, including the international child protection certificate which overseas institutions can request when recruiting British nationals, is \u201cconfusing, inconsistent and in need of reform\u201d. Disaster areas can also pose a particular risk of sexual abuse for children. Oxfam staff were accused of sexually exploiting children in Haiti following an earthquake in 2010. Some abusers operate in sophisticated networks that share tips and strategies to avoid detection. Richard Huckle, frequently described as \u201cBritain\u2019s worst paedophile\u201d after being convicted of 71 counts of serious sexual assault while working in Malaysia, developed a clandestine group to further his activities. Jay said: \u201cThe sexual abuse of children overseas by UK nationals is an urgent problem we cannot hide from. Current gaps in our legal system are allowing known offenders to travel abroad to target vulnerable children in less developed countries, and this is simply not acceptable. \u201c[We] hope this report and its recommendations will lead the authorities to tighten their grip on abusers who seek to exploit some of the most vulnerable children in the world.\u201d Kim Harrison, a solicitor at the law firm Slater and Gordon who has represented victims of child abuse abroad, said: \u201cThese findings are a damning indictment on the system\u2019s attitude to child abuse. To punish paedophiles in this country but then allow them to travel abroad with unrestricted access to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable children is completely unacceptable. \u201cWe have a moral duty to safeguard vulnerable youngsters from abuse anywhere, not just in the UK, and what is happening now is a dereliction of that duty which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u201d Responding to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere can be no safe space for paedophiles to operate either here or abroad and we will do all we can to keep children safe.

IMG bought the FA Cup media rights in early 2017 then sold to the seven gambling firms the deals under which they could exclusively live-stream on their websites matches that did not kick off at 3pm on a Saturday and were not picked for live broadcast by the BBC or BT Sport. The FA decided in May 2017 that it would cancel its then partnership with Ladbrokes and not accept any sponsorships from betting sites, but the rights deals for the FA Cup with the betting companies had already been concluded by IMG, from 2018 to 2024.

The FA had pointed out that this also means that from the fourth round on, there are very few matches available to betting companies, because almost all non-3pm Saturday matches are shown on television. The discussion in parliament saw widespread support from all parties for reform of the Gambling Act passed in 2005 under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government, which liberalised regulation of the betting industry and has led to the explosion in advertising by gambling companies, and proliferation of offers and marketing. The Conservative election manifesto committed the government to a review of the act, which it called \u201canalogue legislation in a digital age\u201d and Labour has also called for the act to be replaced.

      "body": "<p>There is a school of thought that believes Edward VIII chose Mrs Simpson precisely because of his aversion to doing the top job. Subconsciously, some think, the king chose a partner who could not be reconciled with the monarchy, in order that he might create a way out of it for himself. Perhaps in time people will be imposing that remote diagnosis on the Duke of Sussex. At some level, was Harry drawn to a woman whose nature would ultimately necessitate their joint escape from the institution?</p> \n<p>Either way, a mere 83 years after the experiment was first tried, it is clearly much too soon to say whether marrying American divorcees generally works out well for the House of Windsor. I\u2019m joking, of course. You need at least three instances of anything for it to officially become a trend.</p> \n<p>As things stand, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be dividing their time between the UK and North America, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family\" title=\"\">have issued a statement</a> announcing they will \u201cstep back as \u2018senior\u2019 members of the royal family\u201d. This feels very middle-management speak. I\u2019m not sure it is for oneselves to describe oneselves as \u201csenior\u201d members of the royal family in print. Either way, the pair omitted to inform their line manager (the Queen), whose close aides have duly let it be known Her Majesty is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d. We can only speculate, but the move does look like the action of two people who know that if you consult others on things, they only try to stop you. Or, as an affectlessly seething Buckingham Palace statement ran: \u201cDiscussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work though.\u201d Maybe they can Skype the Sussexes in Canada?</p> \n<p>Anyway, it is all quite the drama. Shocked royal commentators have likened it to the 1936 abdication crisis, while supportive celebrity friends of the couple appear to imagine it\u2019ll be very similar to when the Beckhams went to Los Angeles.

Buckingham Palace often advertises vacancies for butlers and so on at below the London living wage. Of course, unlike Meghan and Harry, successful applicants do not have to do their butlering in the full remorseless glare of media attention, and we can\u2019t know one way or the other how their work affects their mental health.

The hysterical disapproval particularly so. While there was much more tolerance of the Mrs Simpson situation among the general populace in 1936 than some accounts would have you believe, many of the absolute worst people lost their shit about it. The prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, who made great personal hay out of the entire thing, attempted to frighten Edward into giving up his romance, telling him the press could no longer be restrained from attacking him if he did not.</p> \n<p>Then, as now, it was a boom time for hypocrites and opportunists in public life.

      "bodyText": "There is a school of thought that believes Edward VIII chose Mrs Simpson precisely because of his aversion to doing the top job. Subconsciously, some think, the king chose a partner who could not be reconciled with the monarchy, in order that he might create a way out of it for himself. Perhaps in time people will be imposing that remote diagnosis on the Duke of Sussex. At some level, was Harry drawn to a woman whose nature would ultimately necessitate their joint escape from the institution? Either way, a mere 83 years after the experiment was first tried, it is clearly much too soon to say whether marrying American divorcees generally works out well for the House of Windsor. I\u2019m joking, of course. You need at least three instances of anything for it to officially become a trend. As things stand, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be dividing their time between the UK and North America, and have issued a statement announcing they will \u201cstep back as \u2018senior\u2019 members of the royal family\u201d. This feels very middle-management speak. I\u2019m not sure it is for oneselves to describe oneselves as \u201csenior\u201d members of the royal family in print. Either way, the pair omitted to inform their line manager (the Queen), whose close aides have duly let it be known Her Majesty is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d. We can only speculate, but the move does look like the action of two people who know that if you consult others on things, they only try to stop you. Or, as an affectlessly seething Buckingham Palace statement ran: \u201cDiscussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work though.\u201d Maybe they can Skype the Sussexes in Canada? Anyway, it is all quite the drama. Shocked royal commentators have likened it to the 1936 abdication crisis, while supportive celebrity friends of the couple appear to imagine it\u2019ll be very similar to when the Beckhams went to Los Angeles. The Sussexes themselves possibly visualise their next phase as having a touch of the post-White House Obamas to it. I\u2019m sure they could at least get a production deal with Netflix. The one thing we can say with absolute certainty is that people talk the most frightful bollocks about the royal family.

It comes amid forecasts that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/02/uk-economy-stagnation-end-2019-survey-shows\">GDP growth in the final three months of the year stalled</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/09/john-lewis-staff-bonus-tesco-marks-and-spencer-business-live\">Pound slides as Bank of England's Mark Carney drops rate cut hint - business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk-management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On the other hand, he said there were tentative signs of stabilisation in the world economy after a slowdown last year, while there had been some signs of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/06/uk-services-sector-brexit-hotels-restaurants-transport-city\">drop in uncertainty</a> in Britain since Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory.</p> <p>Carney said the MPC would closely monitor the strength of the economy in the run-up to its regular meeting to set interest rates at the end of the month.</p> <p>Carney\u2019s comments sent the pound to a near two-week low against the US dollar on the international money markets, reflecting a growing expectation among investors for a rate cut from 0.75% to 0.5%. Sterling fell by about 0.5% against the dollar to trade close to $1.30 and was also down against the euro by a similar amount.</p> <p>Speaking to mark the launch of a workshop at the Bank into the future of inflation targeting, Carney sounded the alarm that Threadneedle Street\u2019s capacity to boost the economy had been increasingly constrained by structural shifts in the world economy.</p> <p>Interest rates remain close to the lowest levels on record more than a decade on from the 2008 financial crisis, when central banks around the world were forced to reduce borrowing costs and unleash quantitative easing, aiming to boost demand to prevent the last recession from turning into another great depression.</p> <p>Carney said the level of interest rates required to keep inflation steady would probably need to remain low for a prolonged period, as changes such as rapid advances in technology and demographic shifts held back growth in prices.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like winter is coming,\u201d he said, adding that central banks faced the risk of a world economy \u201ctrapped in a vicious cycle\u201d of low real interest rates and a reduced capacity to stimulate economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cDeep structural changes in economies are creating disinflationary pressures at a time when conventional monetary policy space is already limited,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among options to stimulate the economy in a low interest rate environment, Carney said the Bank could ramp up its use of unconventional policy tools. He said the Bank could double the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">\u00a360bn package of quantitative easing</a> \u2013 buying government bonds from commercial banks \u2013 used to pump money into the economy immediately after the Brexit vote in 2016.</p> <p>He also said the government could alter the rules governing the Bank\u2019s operations to force it to keep interest rates low for longer if required. Carney dismissed calls for the inflation target to be increased above 2%, as well as demands for the Bank to use its bond-buying abilities to fund socially desirable outcomes, such as greater spending on social or green projects \u2013 known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-qe-the-economy-needs-more-than-a-magic-money-tree\">people\u2019s QE </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/12/printing-money-fund-green-investments\">green QE</a>.</p> <p>He said: \u201cCalls for the Bank to solve broader challenges ignore the Bank\u2019s carefully defined objectives.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has dropped a hint that interest rates could be cut soon to boost the British economy, while warning that the Bank of England is running low on ways to combat recessions. In one of his final speeches before he departs Threadneedle Street in March, Carney said the economy had been sluggish in recent months and that inflation was below the Bank\u2019s 2% target set by the government. The Bank\u2019s governor, who will be replaced by Andrew Bailey, the head of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, indicated that its rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) could move to support jobs and growth. It comes amid forecasts that GDP growth in the final three months of the year stalled. \u201cIf evidence builds that the weakness in activity could persist, risk-management considerations would favour a relatively prompt response,\u201d he said. On the other hand, he said there were tentative signs of stabilisation in the world economy after a slowdown last year, while there had been some signs of a drop in uncertainty in Britain since Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory. Carney said the MPC would closely monitor the strength of the economy in the run-up to its regular meeting to set interest rates at the end of the month. Carney\u2019s comments sent the pound to a near two-week low against the US dollar on the international money markets, reflecting a growing expectation among investors for a rate cut from 0.75% to 0.5%. Sterling fell by about 0.5% against the dollar to trade close to $1.30 and was also down against the euro by a similar amount. Speaking to mark the launch of a workshop at the Bank into the future of inflation targeting, Carney sounded the alarm that Threadneedle Street\u2019s capacity to boost the economy had been increasingly constrained by structural shifts in the world economy. Interest rates remain close to the lowest levels on record more than a decade on from the 2008 financial crisis, when central banks around the world were forced to reduce borrowing costs and unleash quantitative easing, aiming to boost demand to prevent the last recession from turning into another great depression. Carney said the level of interest rates required to keep inflation steady would probably need to remain low for a prolonged period, as changes such as rapid advances in technology and demographic shifts held back growth in prices. \u201cIt feels like winter is coming,\u201d he said, adding that central banks faced the risk of a world economy \u201ctrapped in a vicious cycle\u201d of low real interest rates and a reduced capacity to stimulate economic growth. \u201cDeep structural changes in economies are creating disinflationary pressures at a time when conventional monetary policy space is already limited,\u201d he said. Among options to stimulate the economy in a low interest rate environment, Carney said the Bank could ramp up its use of unconventional policy tools. He said the Bank could double the \u00a360bn package of quantitative easing \u2013 buying government bonds from commercial banks \u2013 used to pump money into the economy immediately after the Brexit vote in 2016. He also said the government could alter the rules governing the Bank\u2019s operations to force it to keep interest rates low for longer if required. Carney dismissed calls for the inflation target to be increased above 2%, as well as demands for the Bank to use its bond-buying abilities to fund socially desirable outcomes, such as greater spending on social or green projects \u2013 known as people\u2019s QE and green QE. He said: \u201cCalls for the Bank to solve broader challenges ignore the Bank\u2019s carefully defined objectives. And they often confuse independence with omnipotence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The recent conviction of Reynhard Sinaga, described by the media as the most prolific rapist in British history, has brought into public consciousness what for many had previously been invisible or inconceivable: the rape and sexual abuse of men. When I was raped as an 18-year-old Manchester University student in circumstances uncannily similar to those in the Sinaga case, all the socialisation I\u2019d been subjected to throughout my life told me that rape wasn\u2019t something which happened to men. There was a part of me that knew that I had been the victim of sexual assault \u2013 yet it didn\u2019t even occur to me to seek support or report it to the police. Even then, if I had sought help I suspect I would have struggled to find it considering local charities such as Survivors Manchester simply didn\u2019t exist. Rape myths, including the notion that rape is something that only happens to women, are prevalent in our society and \u2013 despite the genuine ongoing efforts of the Crown Prosecution Service, the Ministry of Justice and the police \u2013 permeate every level of our criminal justice system. These myths work to silence rape survivors irrespective of their circumstances or gender identity and reduce the likelihood that justice will be served. That is why the estimated one in five women and one in six men in the UK who have experienced sexual violence, and the organisations supporting them, are less surprised than the wider public and the media that Reynhard Sinaga was able to get away with his crimes for so long. It is true that most of the victims didn\u2019t recall being raped because of the drugs he had given them; but it would not be surprising if others might have recalled the incident but felt unable to go to the authorities. The vast majority of incidents of rape and sexual violence still go unreported because of the shame and stigma that is attached to being a victim of sexual assault. Sinaga was able to exploit this fear to act with impunity. When it comes to men\u2019s silence, the numbers are stark. Research suggests that it takes an average of 20 to 30 years for men and boys to disclose rape and sexual abuse and, according to sampling by the Male Survivors Partnership, 21% took over 31 years. SurvivorsUK client data, based on over 600 records, found that less than 4% of men who had experienced sexual violence as adults reported their abuse to the police.

Overall reports of rape have tripled in the past decade and data collected by the Ministry of Justice shows that there was a 200% increase in the number of men and boys accessing support services between 2014 and 2018. However, savage cuts to the police and the criminal justice system has meant that the proportion of rape cases that are charged, prosecuted and result in conviction is the lowest in a decade. Justice is hard to come by. Why do so many people think women are the sole victims of rape and sexual assault?

Underlining the gulf between Britain and Iran over Suleimani\u2019s role, Rouhani told Johnson that he had worked with Suleimani for 40 years, and the picture portrayed of him in the west bore no relationship to reality. He also said the Iranian attack on coalition bases in Iraq in response to the assassination of Suleimani was proportionate and legitimate under article 5 of the UN charter, the same basis on which the US justified its initial attack. He also told Johnson that if the US repeated its attack, America would receive a very dangerous response, claiming the White House simply had no understanding of the region. The head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, said in a press conference on Thursday that the missile strikes were not designed to kill US troops but had instead targeted \u201cAmerica\u2019s military machine\u201d. \u201cWe were not after killing anyone, although tens of US troops have likely been killed and wounded, and carried with C-130 planes to Baghdad, Israel and Jordan hospitals,\u201d Hajizadeh said, according to the state-run Fars news agency. \u201cIf we were looking to kill, we could have designed the operation in a way such that 500 [US personnel] would be killed in the first step, and if they had responded, a further 4,000 to 5,000 would be killed in the next steps within 48 hours.\u201d The UK ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, has been summoned this week by the Iranian foreign ministry to hear protests over the way in which UK cabinet members have said they do not lament the killing of Suleimani. Macaire was warned that the UK could be seen as an accomplice in the assassination if it continued to adopt this line. Rouhani also told Johnson that Iran remained committed to cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the body that is responsible for overseeing compliance with the nuclear deal. Trump is a vehement opponent of the deal, which aims to limit and control the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities. Speaking at the UN general assembly in September, Johnson appeared to side with the US president, saying he agreed with Trump that it was \u201ca bad deal\u201d and that a better one should be devised. During a visit to Washington, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the JCPOA had \u201creached a point where non-compliance has been so acute in the most recent steps taken by Iran that obviously we\u2019re going to be looking very hard at what should happen next\u201d. Asked whether Johnson was now rowing back from such positions, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said there was no contradiction: \u201cOur position is that the JCPOA is the best arrangement currently available to deliver on our goal of stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon.\u201d Another source of long-time tension between Iran and the UK has been the detention for more than three years in Tehran of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed on charges of spying, which she and her family deny. When Johnson was foreign secretary he was accused of making her position worse by wrongly telling a parliamentary committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to teach journalism when she was arrested. Asked what the PM had told Rouhani about the case, the spokesman said: \u201cHis message on that was very, very clear, that we want to see Nazanin and other dual-national cases resolved and for them to be released immediately.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Safi in Amman",

      "body": "<p>Now 90 and still a vigorously engaged public figure, the midnight-movie magus, comic-book artist and tarot enthusiast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alejandro-jodorowsky\">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a> has become the touchstone for a certain kind of untamed cinema, the last survivor-practitioner of underground freaky radicalism, standing up to corporate blandness with his countercultural film-making. A remarkable late-flowering of creativity recently brought us his highly personal films <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/20/the-dance-of-reality-review-my-father-the-hero\">The Dance of Reality</a> (2013) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/05/endless-poetry-review-jodorowskys-shocking-thrill-ride-into-his-past\">Endless Poetry</a> (2016). Now we can see his 1970 breakthrough, El Topo (The Mole), which is on rerelease.</p> <p>Influenced by Sergio Leone, Tod Browning, Luis Bu\u00f1uel and (worryingly) Charles Manson, it\u2019s a bizarre head-trip festival of occult psychedelia, heatstroke visuals, Age-of-Aquarius nude dancing and violence through poster-paint fake blood splattered about the place. After seeing El Topo in 1970, Jodorowsky superfan John Lennon famously promoted and yet also stymied this film-maker\u2019s career, encouraging his manager Allen Klein to invest in Jodorowsky\u2019s future productions, an involvement that bogged the director down in legal and commercial wrangling and did much to cause the effective disappearance, which fed into his mythic reputation.</p> <p>Jodorowsky stars as the black-clad horseman, riding through a stark western desert with a small, naked boy riding behind him: his son, played by his actual son, Brontis, who was to make an appearance in much of the great man\u2019s subsequent work and whose presence here underlines the film\u2019s Freudian theme of self-actualisation through parricide. The rider and his boy have a horrifying encounter with the aftermath of a cult slaying, and then, through his sexual experience with a mysterious woman, the rider embarks on a mission in the wilderness like Jesus or Moses, vowing to travel through the desert, taking on four bandit gunmen.

      "bodyText": "Now 90 and still a vigorously engaged public figure, the midnight-movie magus, comic-book artist and tarot enthusiast Alejandro Jodorowsky has become the touchstone for a certain kind of untamed cinema, the last survivor-practitioner of underground freaky radicalism, standing up to corporate blandness with his countercultural film-making. A remarkable late-flowering of creativity recently brought us his highly personal films The Dance of Reality (2013) and Endless Poetry (2016). Now we can see his 1970 breakthrough, El Topo (The Mole), which is on rerelease. Influenced by Sergio Leone, Tod Browning, Luis Bu\u00f1uel and (worryingly) Charles Manson, it\u2019s a bizarre head-trip festival of occult psychedelia, heatstroke visuals, Age-of-Aquarius nude dancing and violence through poster-paint fake blood splattered about the place. After seeing El Topo in 1970, Jodorowsky superfan John Lennon famously promoted and yet also stymied this film-maker\u2019s career, encouraging his manager Allen Klein to invest in Jodorowsky\u2019s future productions, an involvement that bogged the director down in legal and commercial wrangling and did much to cause the effective disappearance, which fed into his mythic reputation. Jodorowsky stars as the black-clad horseman, riding through a stark western desert with a small, naked boy riding behind him: his son, played by his actual son, Brontis, who was to make an appearance in much of the great man\u2019s subsequent work and whose presence here underlines the film\u2019s Freudian theme of self-actualisation through parricide. The rider and his boy have a horrifying encounter with the aftermath of a cult slaying, and then, through his sexual experience with a mysterious woman, the rider embarks on a mission in the wilderness like Jesus or Moses, vowing to travel through the desert, taking on four bandit gunmen. He then abandons his boy to Franciscan monks and, after renouncing violence, is carried off by mutants to a cave from which he must, mole-like, tunnel out, finally to face his now-grownup son. After 50 years, El Topo does not stand up quite as well to its original legendary status. It is perhaps a little too infatuated with violence and grotesquerie, and, unlike Leone, Jodorowsky sometimes gives the impression that he doesn\u2019t really believe in the ideas of good or bad or ugly, and these ideas \u2013 as well as any character in El Topo \u2013 are just tarot cards to be reshuffled and dealt in any order, although there is a fascination in the very opaque quality of that symbolism. His evocation of the desert is fascinating, as a blank canvas to showcase bizarre dreamlike figures of the mind: Ciro Guerra\u2019s Birds of Passage is, I think, indebted to El Topo.

Henry, whose previous experience had included co-creating the hit TV spy spoof Get Smart and appearing on chat shows posing as a campaigner fighting to keep animals clothed (\u201cA nude horse is a rude horse\u201d), was brought on to The Graduate by the director, Mike Nichols, himself an accomplished comic improviser from his double-act with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/05/elaine-may-to-make-directing-comeback-at-87\">Elaine May</a>.

Products of a very different system, emphasis is now placed on statistics and technology, to the detriment of players and the game itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/03/body-fat-recordings-mood-scores-technology-rugby-union\" title=\"\">according to a new study by Andrew Manley and Shaun Williams of the University of Bath</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/07/ricky-gervais-rugby-union-honesty\">Call Ricky Gervais \u2013 rugby needs a fresh injection of honesty and transparency | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They interviewed 10 players, a coach and an analyst from a Premiership club for their paper, finding that the approach from the top was data-driven, with players gaining or losing a new contract through key performance indicators, and a work efficiency index based on an individual\u2019s contribution in games.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a reflection of where life is,\u201d says Dr Williams, a teaching fellow at the university\u2019s department of health and a rugby coach himself. \u201cWe live in the big data society in which everything is broken down into numbers. The club we researched was an extreme example of that and one conclusion was that a lot of the data lacked relevance.</p> <p>\u201cI recently read an interview with George Ford [the England and Leicester fly-half]. He said that when he goes home from training he watches reality television, needing to switch off from the pressures of rugby. Players do need space away from rugby, as clubs like Saracens appreciate with their emphasis on dual careers and more of that is needed. Too much data is limiting players with pressure to perform to the stats and the anxiety around that having a detrimental cost in terms of enjoyment and performance.\u201d</p> <p>Williams, like the England head coach, Eddie Jones, is concerned the professional system, starting with academies, is producing players who lack dimension, used to being told what to do and regimented, making them more comfortable executing a gameplan rather than reacting when a game is slipping away.</p> <p>\u201cThe data approach takes away core human qualities, such as intelligence, creativity and emotional connection,\u201d says Dr Williams. \u201cLife for players is mechanistic and restrictive with coaches concerned that if they do not keep up with technology they will become out of touch. Data has potential per se, but it creates an aura of the truth while taking away the instinctive feeling and emotion of coaches.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there is another issue. Who owns the data? The players? The club? It is a grey area which lawyers are trying to tidy up, but if a player loses his contract and another club wants to check on his statistics before offering him a deal, should they have access? Football sides use data to develop algorithms that show what a player is worth in the European market, but an agent will feed the same stats into a different algorithm and come up with a different sum.</p> <p>\u201cBut there are qualities you cannot measure. The captain of the club in our study was not the greatest player in the team, but he was a really good leader, emotionally charging people and bringing players together. I was told the example recently of a top player who was the worst tackler in his side but the best defender because of his ability to organise others. It shows that less data needs to be given to players and it needs to be made more meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Williams has read Jones\u2019s recently published autobiography and believes the Australian\u2019s considerable life experience inside and outside rugby makes him an ideal leader of players. \u201cHis observations are interesting and his book shows that life experiences for coaches coming through now are vastly different, far less rounded for a start.</p> <p>\u201cCoaching should be educational for players, not controlling.

      "bodyText": "The coaches of the eight quarter-finalists in last year\u2019s World Cup had at least one thing in common: they started playing before the game had turned professional, a time when observation and gut feeling influenced decisions rather than data. Head coaches and directors of rugby breaking into top division clubs are now of an age when they have known only professionalism. Products of a very different system, emphasis is now placed on statistics and technology, to the detriment of players and the game itself according to a new study by Andrew Manley and Shaun Williams of the University of Bath. They interviewed 10 players, a coach and an analyst from a Premiership club for their paper, finding that the approach from the top was data-driven, with players gaining or losing a new contract through key performance indicators, and a work efficiency index based on an individual\u2019s contribution in games. \u201cIt is a reflection of where life is,\u201d says Dr Williams, a teaching fellow at the university\u2019s department of health and a rugby coach himself. \u201cWe live in the big data society in which everything is broken down into numbers. The club we researched was an extreme example of that and one conclusion was that a lot of the data lacked relevance. \u201cI recently read an interview with George Ford [the England and Leicester fly-half]. He said that when he goes home from training he watches reality television, needing to switch off from the pressures of rugby. Players do need space away from rugby, as clubs like Saracens appreciate with their emphasis on dual careers and more of that is needed. Too much data is limiting players with pressure to perform to the stats and the anxiety around that having a detrimental cost in terms of enjoyment and performance.\u201d Williams, like the England head coach, Eddie Jones, is concerned the professional system, starting with academies, is producing players who lack dimension, used to being told what to do and regimented, making them more comfortable executing a gameplan rather than reacting when a game is slipping away. \u201cThe data approach takes away core human qualities, such as intelligence, creativity and emotional connection,\u201d says Dr Williams. \u201cLife for players is mechanistic and restrictive with coaches concerned that if they do not keep up with technology they will become out of touch. Data has potential per se, but it creates an aura of the truth while taking away the instinctive feeling and emotion of coaches. \u201cAnd there is another issue. Who owns the data? The players? The club? It is a grey area which lawyers are trying to tidy up, but if a player loses his contract and another club wants to check on his statistics before offering him a deal, should they have access? Football sides use data to develop algorithms that show what a player is worth in the European market, but an agent will feed the same stats into a different algorithm and come up with a different sum. \u201cBut there are qualities you cannot measure. The captain of the club in our study was not the greatest player in the team, but he was a really good leader, emotionally charging people and bringing players together. I was told the example recently of a top player who was the worst tackler in his side but the best defender because of his ability to organise others. It shows that less data needs to be given to players and it needs to be made more meaningful.\u201d Dr Williams has read Jones\u2019s recently published autobiography and believes the Australian\u2019s considerable life experience inside and outside rugby makes him an ideal leader of players. \u201cHis observations are interesting and his book shows that life experiences for coaches coming through now are vastly different, far less rounded for a start. \u201cCoaching should be educational for players, not controlling. The knowledge coaches have now tends to be procedural, how to go from A to B based on technical expertise. They are mimicking the cultures they have been part of and there is a cost to players in terms of happiness because data causes fear and resentment and leads to a psychological grind. And so the game becomes more predictable and formulaic and less entertaining. \u201cJapan were a pleasure to watch in the World Cup because the scrum-half got the ball away quickly and they were always looking for five on fours and three on twos, but the game in England is highly structured and regimented. Where will the unstructured coaches come from and will the game look outside rather than go for former players all the time? Why are there no coaching mentors? \u201cProfessionalism has meant there is far more time to fill compared to the old way of two evening training sessions a week.

      "bodyText": "The troubled Northern rail franchise faces financial collapse within months, the transport secretary has said, as the government set out a timetable to tackle the \u201cunacceptable services\u201d for rail passengers in the north. Grant Shapps told the Commons that he would choose between a fresh short-term contract for the operating company Arriva, or temporary renationalisation before the end of January. \u201cIt has now been confirmed to me from the most recent available financial information that the franchise will only be able to continue for a number of months,\u201d the minister said. In a written statement, Shapps said the longer-term future of Northern rail services would be shaped by the Williams review, an inquiry that has recommended overhauling the entire rail franchising system. He said he would choose how to proceed based on \u201cwhich option returns most money to the taxpayer, the risks attached to each, and the value of any improvements in passenger services\u201d. The state-run \u201coperator of last resort\u201d has already stepped in to take over the East Coast franchise, now LNER, when the Stagecoach-run Virgin Trains ran out of money in June 2018. Another franchise, South Western Railway, could go bust within the year, according to company accounts published on Tuesday. Confirmation of imminent action on Northern comes as Shapps said passengers in the north had had to put up with unacceptable services for too long. Arriva said many of the problems were outside the control of whoever may run the service. Chris Burchell, Arriva\u2019s managing director of UK Trains, said: \u201cWe accept services on the Northern network are not yet good enough and we sincerely apologise to our customers for our role in that.\u201d He added: \u201cMany of the issues affecting the franchise, however, are outside the direct control of Northern.

This, along with unprecedented levels of strike action, has had a significant impact in terms of service and financial performance. These challenges will continue to affect services irrespective of who is running them.\u201d Neighbouring franchise TransPennine Express (TPE) has also had mass cancellations, which have worsened since December when it admitted it could not implement a new timetable owing to staff shortages and problems introducing new trains. Shapps\u2019 Commons statement comes a day after both train operators came under intense criticism from political leaders in the north, at a public meeting in Leeds.

      "body": "<p>Since Tuesday Austria has been ruled, for the first time in its history, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/resurgent-austrian-greens-in-coalition-deal-with-centre-right-party\" title=\"\">a coalition government</a> between the conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) and the Greens. It is an unlikely partnership, not least because the \u00d6VP is one of the most rightwing of Europe\u2019s conservative parties. Since taking control of the party in 2017, Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, has transformed it into a hard-right, anti-immigrant outfit, successfully cannibalising the voter base of the populist far-right Freedom party (FP\u00d6), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/austria-shifts-to-the-right-as-new-coalition-deal-is-struck\" title=\"\">his coalition partner from 2017</a> until May last year.

During the recent election campaign, when asked how likely it was that his party would join a coalition government with the \u00d6VP, Green party leader <a href=\"https://www.dasbiber.at/content/herr-kogler-wie-oft-gendern-sie-taeglich?fbclid=IwAR2fKp1GWup26upcDajfbNGL0wTrdzUUm-1U4P2zqVJMrvyfnuF_vpoTnyo\" title=\"\">Werner Kogler answered</a> swiftly: \u201cZero per cent.\u201d Last week, he stood next to Kurz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/02/austrias-new-coalition-agrees-to-extend-school-headscarf-ban\" title=\"\">presenting their common coalition programme</a> \u2013 in which a proposal to make Austria carbon-neutral by 2040 sits alongside plans to ban the Islamic veil for schoolchildren up to the age of 14 and introduce highly controversial preventive detention measures for asylum seekers.</p> <p>There are two ways of looking at this seemingly awkward partnership. One is to see it as a makeshift arrangement born of necessity, the freak outcome of a political crisis triggered by the far right\u2019s corruption scandal. The other is to look at it as a model for political realignments internationally, a sign of a new political conjuncture to come. Both perspectives have some truth to them \u2013 and both are wrong in significant respects.</p> <p>It is true that the election result made it difficult to imagine any other coalition. Kurz was the jubilant winner, with the Freedom party sunk in a corruption quagmire and the Social Democrats in deep crisis after failing to profit from the far right\u2019s demise: they came second with 21% of the vote, the lowest share in their history. The Greens, having re-entered parliament on the back of a wave of climate protests with an unprecedented 14% of the vote, found themselves in an uneasy position. They would either have to govern with Kurz \u2013 or give him the pretext to continue the far-right coalition.</p> <p>The Green party faced enormous pressure, not least from its own voter base and allies. For women\u2019s, LGBTQ and migrants\u2019 organisations, preventing the FP\u00d6 from re-entering the government was and remains a vital concern. Even more pressingly, environmental NGOs and the Fridays for Future student movement urged the Greens to deliver on their climate promises. Many members and supporters felt like they had no choice but to enter negotiations with the Conservatives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Kurz plans to prop up domestic support by vilifying Muslims and further fortifying the nation-state against migration movements</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, this is more than just a marriage of convenience. It represents both a reaction to the growing popular awareness of the climate crisis, and an attempt to dissolve the climate movement\u2019s demands in a greenwashed rightwing project. For all the ambition of the 2040 target, which goes far beyond anything any previous Austrian government has dared to do, only a few concrete measures, such as subsidies for public transportation and the phasing out of gas, oil and coal for heating have been proposed. There will, encouragingly, be a new, powerful ministry of the environment, energy and infrastructure, presided over by Leonore Gewessler, former head of one of Austria\u2019s largest environmental NGOs \u2013 but the \u00d6VP-controlled treasury will probably put the brakes on more ambitious projects.</p> <p>The Green party, whose members take great pride in its anti-racist identity, is willing to pay a high price for all this. None of the economic reforms introduced by the previous, staunchly pro-capital government \u2013 such as the expansion of the legal working day to 12 hours and the working week to 60 hours \u2013 will be up for revision. The new coalition programme includes tax reductions for big corporations and a commitment to neoliberal trade agreements. And Kurz will not even have to adjust his image as an anti-immigrant hardliner. In his own carefully crafted words, the new government aims to \u201cprotect both the climate and the borders\u201d.</p> <p>Some international commentators have welcomed the unusual pairing as a <a href=\"https://www.eurotopics.net/en/232790/new-government-in-austria-a-model-for-europe\" title=\"\">new middle ground</a>, offering stability and a way out of Europe\u2019s political stalemate. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaroRackete/status/1213484637424623616\" title=\"\">Others</a> look at it anxiously as a potential route for rightwing parties to reinvent themselves as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaroRackete/status/1214619270333775878\" title=\"\">\u201ceco-fascists\u201d</a>. In fact, it signals an acceptance from parts of the conservative and liberal elites \u2013 forced on them by global social movements \u2013 that the climate crisis is a real and pressing issue and an attempt to act without harming the interests of big business.</p> <p>Here, Kurz and his new Green vice-chancellor Kogler are in agreement: they see climate change as an opportunity for innovation and investment in the private sector, with no intention of taking on the vested interests of the fossil, steel and automotive industries. Where they differ is in their vision for dealing with the already unavoidable global consequences of the climate crisis. The Greens say that they remain committed to international human rights. But in the reality of a coalition government their words will have few practical consequences, as Kurz has made it very clear from the beginning that he will not change his tough anti-immigrant stance.</p> <p>Kurz plans to prop up domestic support by vilifying Muslims and further fortifying both the EU and the nation-state against current and future migration movements. If other countries follow his example, it is a strategy for what the UN special rapporteur Philip Alston calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/25/climate-apartheid-united-nations-expert-says-human-rights-may-not-survive-crisis\" title=\"\">\u201cclimate apartheid\u201d</a>. Far from representing a new middle ground, Kurz belongs to the global breed of politicians building walls. That is not the model Europe needs.</p> <p>\u2022 Benjamin Opratko is a political scientist at the University of Vienna, and an editor of the monthly magazine <a href=\"https://tagebuch.at/\" title=\"\">Das Tagebuch</a> and of <a href=\"https://mosaik-blog.at/\" title=\"\">mosaik-blog.at</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Since Tuesday Austria has been ruled, for the first time in its history, by a coalition government between the conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) and the Greens. It is an unlikely partnership, not least because the \u00d6VP is one of the most rightwing of Europe\u2019s conservative parties. Since taking control of the party in 2017, Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, has transformed it into a hard-right, anti-immigrant outfit, successfully cannibalising the voter base of the populist far-right Freedom party (FP\u00d6), his coalition partner from 2017 until May last year. The previous government ended with a bang, when then-FP\u00d6 leader and vice-chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache had to resign over a corruption scandal. The Greens have spent the last two years vigorously attacking Kurz as a \u201cStrache in disguise\u201d, for lending a respectable face to inhumane policies against migrants, asylum seekers and minorities. During the recent election campaign, when asked how likely it was that his party would join a coalition government with the \u00d6VP, Green party leader Werner Kogler answered swiftly: \u201cZero per cent.\u201d Last week, he stood next to Kurz, presenting their common coalition programme \u2013 in which a proposal to make Austria carbon-neutral by 2040 sits alongside plans to ban the Islamic veil for schoolchildren up to the age of 14 and introduce highly controversial preventive detention measures for asylum seekers. There are two ways of looking at this seemingly awkward partnership. One is to see it as a makeshift arrangement born of necessity, the freak outcome of a political crisis triggered by the far right\u2019s corruption scandal. The other is to look at it as a model for political realignments internationally, a sign of a new political conjuncture to come. Both perspectives have some truth to them \u2013 and both are wrong in significant respects. It is true that the election result made it difficult to imagine any other coalition. Kurz was the jubilant winner, with the Freedom party sunk in a corruption quagmire and the Social Democrats in deep crisis after failing to profit from the far right\u2019s demise: they came second with 21% of the vote, the lowest share in their history. The Greens, having re-entered parliament on the back of a wave of climate protests with an unprecedented 14% of the vote, found themselves in an uneasy position. They would either have to govern with Kurz \u2013 or give him the pretext to continue the far-right coalition. The Green party faced enormous pressure, not least from its own voter base and allies. For women\u2019s, LGBTQ and migrants\u2019 organisations, preventing the FP\u00d6 from re-entering the government was and remains a vital concern. Even more pressingly, environmental NGOs and the Fridays for Future student movement urged the Greens to deliver on their climate promises. Many members and supporters felt like they had no choice but to enter negotiations with the Conservatives. At the same time, this is more than just a marriage of convenience. It represents both a reaction to the growing popular awareness of the climate crisis, and an attempt to dissolve the climate movement\u2019s demands in a greenwashed rightwing project. For all the ambition of the 2040 target, which goes far beyond anything any previous Austrian government has dared to do, only a few concrete measures, such as subsidies for public transportation and the phasing out of gas, oil and coal for heating have been proposed. There will, encouragingly, be a new, powerful ministry of the environment, energy and infrastructure, presided over by Leonore Gewessler, former head of one of Austria\u2019s largest environmental NGOs \u2013 but the \u00d6VP-controlled treasury will probably put the brakes on more ambitious projects. The Green party, whose members take great pride in its anti-racist identity, is willing to pay a high price for all this. None of the economic reforms introduced by the previous, staunchly pro-capital government \u2013 such as the expansion of the legal working day to 12 hours and the working week to 60 hours \u2013 will be up for revision. The new coalition programme includes tax reductions for big corporations and a commitment to neoliberal trade agreements. And Kurz will not even have to adjust his image as an anti-immigrant hardliner. In his own carefully crafted words, the new government aims to \u201cprotect both the climate and the borders\u201d. Some international commentators have welcomed the unusual pairing as a new middle ground, offering stability and a way out of Europe\u2019s political stalemate. Others look at it anxiously as a potential route for rightwing parties to reinvent themselves as \u201ceco-fascists\u201d. In fact, it signals an acceptance from parts of the conservative and liberal elites \u2013 forced on them by global social movements \u2013 that the climate crisis is a real and pressing issue and an attempt to act without harming the interests of big business. Here, Kurz and his new Green vice-chancellor Kogler are in agreement: they see climate change as an opportunity for innovation and investment in the private sector, with no intention of taking on the vested interests of the fossil, steel and automotive industries. Where they differ is in their vision for dealing with the already unavoidable global consequences of the climate crisis. The Greens say that they remain committed to international human rights. But in the reality of a coalition government their words will have few practical consequences, as Kurz has made it very clear from the beginning that he will not change his tough anti-immigrant stance. Kurz plans to prop up domestic support by vilifying Muslims and further fortifying both the EU and the nation-state against current and future migration movements. If other countries follow his example, it is a strategy for what the UN special rapporteur Philip Alston calls \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d. Far from representing a new middle ground, Kurz belongs to the global breed of politicians building walls. That is not the model Europe needs. \u2022 Benjamin Opratko is a political scientist at the University of Vienna, and an editor of the monthly magazine Das Tagebuch and of mosaik-blog.at",

      "body": "<p>Kristin Kimball was a freelance writer living in New York when, at the age of 31, she went to interview an idealistic young organic farmer in Pennsylvania, \u201ca lanky, loquacious, sharply intelligent and ridiculously energetic man\u201d. They \u201cclicked together like a pair of magnets\u201d and took on a run-down farm nestling between mountains and a lake in the majestic landscape of Adirondack Park, on the rural north-eastern edge of New York State.</p> <p>United by an \u201catavistic love for working the land\u201d, their business model at Essex Farm is radical in every sense. Rather than growing one or two crops, they sell \u201cmemberships\u201d so that local people can eat the way farmers used to two generations ago: \u201ca whole diet, year-round, unprocessed, in rhythm with the seasons, from a specific piece of land, with a sense of both reverence and abundance\u201d. For an annual fee, they supply their 200 or so members with beef, pork, chicken, eggs, vegetables, fruits, dairy, grains and flours, as well as extras such as sauerkraut, jam, maple syrup and soap. Sustainability is at the core of their approach: \u201cfeed people, be nice, don\u2019t wreck the land\u201d. They even use horses for farm work. As an arts graduate who had never grown a thing in her life, Kimball admits that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow enough about farming to be afraid of it\u201d. But as her beautifully written book shows, farming is not for the faint hearted.</p> <p>The basic idea of a farm is quite simple: \u201ccatch the sunlight, hold it \u2026 and use it to meet human need\u201d. But translating sunlight into edible cabbages and corn requires immense skill and hard work at the best of times. Kimball describes what happens when everything starts to fall apart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She began to question whether she wanted her children to grow up sharing 'this crazy, dirty, brutal life'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some seven years into their farming life they faced both extreme weather (the wettest spring for a century) and injury: Mark, her \u201ctall oak of a husband\u201d, did his back in. Without warning, the responsibility for managing their 500-acre farm was hers alone. As well as looking after her husband, there was also a baby and a three-year-old daughter to care for. The arrival of an unexpected (and unpayable) tax bill suddenly revealed to Kimball the fragility of all they had worked so hard to achieve.

      "bodyText": "Kristin Kimball was a freelance writer living in New York when, at the age of 31, she went to interview an idealistic young organic farmer in Pennsylvania, \u201ca lanky, loquacious, sharply intelligent and ridiculously energetic man\u201d. They \u201cclicked together like a pair of magnets\u201d and took on a run-down farm nestling between mountains and a lake in the majestic landscape of Adirondack Park, on the rural north-eastern edge of New York State. United by an \u201catavistic love for working the land\u201d, their business model at Essex Farm is radical in every sense. Rather than growing one or two crops, they sell \u201cmemberships\u201d so that local people can eat the way farmers used to two generations ago: \u201ca whole diet, year-round, unprocessed, in rhythm with the seasons, from a specific piece of land, with a sense of both reverence and abundance\u201d. For an annual fee, they supply their 200 or so members with beef, pork, chicken, eggs, vegetables, fruits, dairy, grains and flours, as well as extras such as sauerkraut, jam, maple syrup and soap. Sustainability is at the core of their approach: \u201cfeed people, be nice, don\u2019t wreck the land\u201d. They even use horses for farm work. As an arts graduate who had never grown a thing in her life, Kimball admits that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow enough about farming to be afraid of it\u201d. But as her beautifully written book shows, farming is not for the faint hearted. The basic idea of a farm is quite simple: \u201ccatch the sunlight, hold it \u2026 and use it to meet human need\u201d. But translating sunlight into edible cabbages and corn requires immense skill and hard work at the best of times. Kimball describes what happens when everything starts to fall apart. Some seven years into their farming life they faced both extreme weather (the wettest spring for a century) and injury: Mark, her \u201ctall oak of a husband\u201d, did his back in. Without warning, the responsibility for managing their 500-acre farm was hers alone. As well as looking after her husband, there was also a baby and a three-year-old daughter to care for. The arrival of an unexpected (and unpayable) tax bill suddenly revealed to Kimball the fragility of all they had worked so hard to achieve. Kimball began to question whether she wanted her children to grow up sharing \u201cthis crazy, dirty, brutal life\u201d. And as she and Mark grow older, can they even cope with 16-hour days, rising before dawn to milk the cows and clearing snow off the greenhouse roof in the middle of winter nights? When he recovered, her husband brusquely dismissed her anxieties: \u201cWorry is your choice. I\u2019m always going to be like this.\u201d As the farm (and her children) grew, she slowly rediscovered her passion for farming, won over by Mark\u2019s optimism, the \u201csheer deliciousness of our food even in the worst year we could have imagined\u201d, and by an almost Amish sense of work as a form of worship. With considerable understatement, Kimball reckons \u201ca farm will give you grit and perseverance\u201d. Their achievement at Essex Farm is heroic, and this book is a vivid and inspiring account of alternative agriculture, filled with a visceral feeling for the earth and a love of seasonal, organic food. But Kimball doesn\u2019t gloss over the back-breaking labour and heartache that is needed to turn sunlight into delicious natural produce, without ruining the earth for future generations.

      "body": "<h2>40. 1977 (1977)</h2> <p>A historical artefact, not for the proto-punk music, but because the lyrics epitomise the new wave\u2019s perceived threat to the old guard. \u201cNo Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones / In 1977,\u201d sang Joe Strummer, hardly about to let <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jul/01/featuresreview.review2\" title=\"\">his love of such pop greats</a> get in the way of punk\u2019s declaration of year zero.</p> <h2>39. White Riot (1977)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/21/mick-jones-clash-writing-in-joe-strummer-squat\" title=\"\">Guitarist Mick Jones</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/23/the-clash-mick-jones-paul-simonon\" title=\"\"> </a>now dislikes the first Clash single, its lyrics written by Strummer after the band were caught up in the 1976 Notting Hill riots and he concluded white people needed \u201ca riot of our own\u201d. The sentiment hasn\u2019t aged well, but the song exemplifies the amphetamine-fuelled punk the band would leave behind.</p> <h2>38. What\u2019s My Name (1977)</h2> <p>A Clash curio in that it\u2019s the only one of the group\u2019s songs to bear a writing credit for Keith Levene, the band\u2019s original guitarist. Levene showers melodic gold dust all over this otherwise shouty punk stomper, but is better known for his work with John Lydon in Public Image Ltd.</p> <h2>37. Know Your Rights (1982)</h2> <p>From Combat Rock, the final album by the classic quartet of Strummer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/23/the-clash-mick-jones-paul-simonon\" title=\"\">Jones, bassist Paul Simonon</a> and drummer Topper Headon. The tank was getting emptied, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/dec/29/artsfeatures.popandrock1\" title=\"\">Strummer\u2019s black humour brims</a> through lines such as \u201cYou have the right to free speech / As long as you\u2019re not dumb enough to actually try it.\u201d</p> <h2>36. I\u2019m So Bored With the USA (1977)</h2> <p>This hugely anthemic track on debut album The Clash began life as I\u2019m So Bored With You, a song about Jones\u2019s girlfriend, before Strummer\u2019s ad-libbed \u201c\u2026 SA\u201d took it in a new direction. The blistering critique of US imperialism and exported culture (\u201cYankee detectives are always on the TV\u201d) didn\u2019t stop the Clash\u2019s love of American iconography, cars and clothes.</p> <h2>35. Janie Jones (1977)</h2> <p>Original Clash drummer Terry Chimes \u2013 uncharitably credited as Tory Crimes on The Clash \u2013 propels the debut\u2019s storming opener, a eulogy to <a href=\"https://dangerousminds.net/comments/in_love_with_janie_jones_the_clash_and_the_bad_girl_who_inspired_one_o\" title=\"\">a</a> <a href=\"https://dangerousminds.net/comments/in_love_with_janie_jones_the_clash_and_the_bad_girl_who_inspired_one_o\" title=\"\">60s pop celebrity and libertine</a> who had been jailed for vice offences in 1973. On release, the convicted madam returned Strummer\u2019s affections in the song Letter to Joe.</p> <h2>34. Charlie Don\u2019t Surf (1980)</h2> <p>By the epic three-disc fourth album, Sandinista!, the Clash arguably had too many ideas for their own good, but within the 36-song sprawl are undoubted treasures. Titled after a Lt Col Kilgore quip in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/09/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-is-not-an-anti-war-film\" title=\"\">Apocalypse Now</a>, there\u2019s an element of the doo-wop era to this sweet song about, well, cultural imperialism.</p> <h2>33. Brand New Cadillac (1979)</h2> <p>This bracing cover of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56XgO4MKIjI\" title=\"\">a 1959 Vince Taylor and the Playboys track</a> refers to the early Brit rockers\u2019 glamorous dream car (when most of them probably had to make do with a humble Ford Anglia). From the double album London Calling, the Clash\u2019s creative zenith.</p> <h2>32. The Guns of Brixton (1979)</h2> <p>Brixton boy Simonon wanted some songwriting cash and so penned this memorable song about police harassment and discontent in his London neighbourhood, two years before the district exploded into rioting. In 1990, Simonon received an unexpected windfall when Norman Cook (later Fatboy Slim) sampled the groove for Beats International\u2019s hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MnELifX3sQ\" title=\"\">Dub Be Good to Me</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e204ec0116fb8916111a1a8f3bf41052dcbbb1c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e204ec0116fb8916111a1a8f3bf41052dcbbb1c4/0_0_4638_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 1978 ...

(from left) Joe Strummer, Topper Headon, Paul Simonon and Mick Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheila Rock/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>31. Clash City Rockers (1978)</h2> <p>Year zero meant many punks hurriedly buried their pasts in pub rock bands with long hair, but this 1978 single reworks a song from Strummer\u2019s old pub rock band, the 101\u2019ers, around trademark Clash self-mythology. The shift from aggressive guitars (surely copied from the Who\u2019s I Can\u2019t Explain) to something more mournful suggest musical adventure to come.</p> <h2>30. Rudie Can\u2019t Fail (1979)</h2> <p>According to long-time Clash associate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/22/don-letts-this-much-know\" title=\"\">Don Letts</a>, this London Calling gem is the fruit of a long hot summer that the Clash spent smoking herb and going to reggae clubs. It\u2019s a horns-drenched homage to Caribbean culture, \u201cdrinking brew for breakfast\u201d and the \u201cchicken skin suit\u201d.</p> <h2>29. Tommy Gun (1978)</h2> <p>A great single from the not universally adored second album, Give \u2019Em Enough Rope. Strummer is scathing about the idea that terrorists see their cause as glamorous, yelling: \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead when your war is won\u201d, while Headon\u2019s snare drum rolls resemble gunfire. This didn\u2019t stop the singer posing for photos in a T-shirt honouring Italian-based violent leftist organisation <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Brigades\" title=\"\">Briga</a><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Brigades\" title=\"\">te Rosse</a> (the Red Brigades).</p> <h2>28. Police and Thieves (1977)</h2> <p>This cover of the Lee Scratch Perry-produced Junior Murvin hit stands out a mile on The Clash. It\u2019s their first attempt at reggae, played punkier, with a new, Jones-penned intro. That summer, Bob Marley (working with Perry) acknowledged the burgeoning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/19/clash-bob-marley-joe-strummer-punky-reggae-party\" title=\"\">punk/Jamaican music love-in with </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZFho44a9nU\" title=\"\">Punky Reggae Party</a>.</p> <h2>27. London\u2019s Burning (1977)</h2> <p>Also from the debut album, this most captures those punk rock summers of 1976 and 1977, with its bone-crunching verse and rabble-rousing chorus. The imagery is a comprehensive list of the band and movement\u2019s inspirations, from high-rise living above the Westway (where Jones lived with his gran) to a capital city \u201cburning with boredom now\u201d.</p> <h2>26. Somebody Got Murdered (1980)</h2> <p>According to Pat Gilbert\u2019s superb book <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/passion-is-a-fashion-the-real-story-of-the-clash/author/pat-gilbert/\" title=\"\">Passion Is a Fashion</a>, the Clash were approached by producer-arranger <a href=\"http://www.spectropop.com/JackNitzsche/\" title=\"\">Jack Nitzsche</a> to provide a song for the William Friedkin movie <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/william-friedkin-cruising-commentary/\" title=\"\">Cruising</a>, but he never called again. Thus, the song lit up Sandinista! with its effervescent tune and film noir-ish imagery about a random killing.</p> <h2>25. Career Opportunities (1977)</h2> <p>The limited youth employment of the 70s is timelessly skewered (\u201cCareer opportunities, the ones that never knock\u201d) in this gem from the debut. The line \u201cI won\u2019t open letter bombs for you\u201d refers to an actual job once held by Jones, checking government mail for explosive devices.</p> <h2>24. Pressure Drop (1979)</h2> <p>The B-side of the slightly hackneyed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQ_8xMa3u8\" title=\"\">English Civil War</a> and one of the Clash\u2019s great covers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/06/toots-and-the-maytals-how-we-made-pressure-drop\" title=\"\">of Toots and the Maytals\u2019 1970 reggae/ska classic</a> (as heard in the 1972 film <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/126-the-harder-they-come\" title=\"\">The Harder They Come</a>). Later, Strummer was at pains to point out that they recorded it in 1977, hence it pre-dates 2-Tone.</p> <h2>23. This Is England (1985)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/i-forgive-you-the-clashs-drummer-topper-headon-makes-peace-with-the-man-who-sacked-him-1717627.html\" title=\"\">Headon and Jones had been sacked by now</a> (for heroin abuse and behavioural issues, respectively) as a remodelled, five-piece Clash made a sixth album. The otherwise unloved Cut the Crap did herald this final terrific single. Keyboards and guitars drive Strummer\u2019s withering take on our national strife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c36f5a97191d7d65f617c8a18140f319c2cd108e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c36f5a97191d7d65f617c8a18140f319c2cd108e/0_0_3532_5571/634.jpg\" alt=\"In Leicester Square, 1978 ...

(from left) Strummer, Jones, Simonon and Headon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virginia Turbett/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>22. Gates of the West (1979)</h2> <p>The Clash had been singing about the US since I\u2019m So Bored With the USA. Based on Rusted Chrome, an early Jones composition, this stormer from the Cost of Living EP describes their New York experiences, the characters, imagery and anthemic tune all reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen.</p> <h2>21. Hitsville UK (1980)</h2> <p>From Sandinista!, this eulogy to pop is a bubblegum delight that namechecks the UK\u2019s emerging independent labels and argues that a great \u201ctwo minutes 59\u201d single can triumph over industry sharp practice. With its Motown (the original \u201cHitsville\u201d) groove and sugar-coated duet between Jones and his girlfriend, Ellen Foley, the Clash\u2019s remaining hardcore punk fans hated it.</p> <h2>20. Police on My Back (1980)</h2> <p>Another terrific example of the Clash\u2019s ability to cover a song (the original was by Eddy Grant\u2019s old band, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E5aF_rdX9Q\" title=\"\">the Equals</a>) and make it sound as if they had written it. Jones\u2019s guitar wails like a siren, and the song has all the adrenalin rush of a police chase.</p> <h2>19. Lost in the Supermarket (1979)</h2> <p>In the tradition of the Rolling Stones\u2019 (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction and the X-Ray Spex back catalogue, this is a great Strummer-penned/Jones-sung song about the dehumanising effects of advertising and the consumer society. (\u201cI came in here for that special offer / A guaranteed personality.\u201d)</p> <h2>18. I Fought the Law (1979)</h2> <p>The band reputedly heard the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgtQj8O92eI\" title=\"\">Bobby Fuller Four</a> original on the studio jukebox in San Francisco while recording Give \u2019Em Enough Rope. Writing credits aside, this is a trademark Clash smash, full of outlaw rebel posturing and laden with Headon\u2019s six-shooter drum cracks.</p> <h2>17. Death or Glory (1979)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/1999/sep/24/artsfeatures.popandrock\" title=\"\">Strummer\u2019s ferocious blast at ageing</a>, sellout rock stars builds to a hurtling climax on a lyrical twist as he fears a similar fate himself. Presumably it was ruled out as a single because of the infamous, hilarious line: \u201cBut I believe in this and it\u2019s been tested by research / He who fucks nuns will later join the church.\u201d</p> <h2>16. Safe European Home (1978)</h2> <p>Strutting around Kingston, Jamaica, in full punk regalia (in theory to stir the creative juices for Give \u2019Em Enough Rope) proved a rude awakening, but did produce this untypical example of Clash self-mockery. \u201cI went to the place where every white face / Is an invitation to robbery / And sitting here in my safe European home / Don\u2019t want to go back there again.\u201d</p> <h2>15. Clampdown (1979)</h2> <p>Strummer\u2019s view that capitalism was endangering people and the planet was sharpened by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, which inspired this London Calling highlight. The Clash were exploding with musical ideas by now, and packed rock, funk and disco into this fiery, timeless anthem.</p> <h2>14. Garageland (1977)</h2> <p>The rock critic <a href=\"http://charlesshaarmurray.com/\" title=\"\">Charles Shaar Murray</a>\u2019s dismissal of the Clash as a \u201cgarage band\u201d in an early live review prompted this defiant riposte, which also reflects the band\u2019s fretting that signing to a major label would be selling out. It\u2019s a furious but somehow melancholy anthem: \u201cPeople ringing up making offers for my life / But I just wanna stay in the garage all night.\u201d</p> <h2>13. The Card Cheat (1979)</h2> <p>Surely channeling Jones\u2019s love of Mott the Hoople, this is the sort of thing that presumably inspired the Libertines. Horns, drum rudiments, a sublime piano hook and vivid imagery (\u201cTo the opium dens and the bar room gin ... The gambler\u2019s face cracks into a grin\u201d) combine in a song about a card sharp who is shot for cheating.</p> <h2>12. Spanish Bombs (1979)</h2> <p>A favourite of the late INXS singer, Michael Hutchence. The melody is glorious and Strummer\u2019s lyrics contrast the freedom fighters of the Spanish civil war with modern tourists. The singer partly sings it in what he called \u201cClash Spanish\u201d. Ol\u00e9!</p> <h2>11. Rock the Casbah (1982)</h2> <p>Headon wrote and played most of the music on Combat Rock\u2019s club/chart smash, which innovatively combines rock, funk and a slightly eastern feel. Strummer\u2019s lyrics are inspired by Iran\u2019s post-Islamic revolution ban on pop music, the singer\u2019s idea being that the people would rise up and \u201crock the casbah\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7babb505769b87ecd85e6b4b66a671c8d7c02dfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7babb505769b87ecd85e6b4b66a671c8d7c02dfe/0_0_4319_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In New York, September 1978 ...

Train in Vain (1979)</h2> <p>After a planned NME flexidisc fell through, this sublime Jones unrequited love song was added to London Calling too late for listing on the initial sleeves. Pete Townshend\u2019s favourite Clash tune, this is the band at their unashamedly poppiest. Headon\u2019s killer drum intro fires one of the rhythm section\u2019s funkiest grooves.</p> <h2>9.

Lyrically, a disappointingly lightweight reggae gig (in the Hammersmith Palais) triggers Strummer\u2019s blistering state of the nation address, in which he considers everything from music (\u201cTurning rebellion into money\u201d) to racism and rising nationalism (\u201cIf Adolf Hitler flew in today, they\u2019d send a limousine anyway\u201d). Forty-two years on, it remains a tour de force and as relevant as ever.</p> <p><em>Various 40th anniversary super deluxe editions of London Calling are out now on Sony.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "40. 1977 (1977) A historical artefact, not for the proto-punk music, but because the lyrics epitomise the new wave\u2019s perceived threat to the old guard. \u201cNo Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones / In 1977,\u201d sang Joe Strummer, hardly about to let his love of such pop greats get in the way of punk\u2019s declaration of year zero. 39. White Riot (1977) Guitarist Mick Jones now dislikes the first Clash single, its lyrics written by Strummer after the band were caught up in the 1976 Notting Hill riots and he concluded white people needed \u201ca riot of our own\u201d. The sentiment hasn\u2019t aged well, but the song exemplifies the amphetamine-fuelled punk the band would leave behind. 38. What\u2019s My Name (1977) A Clash curio in that it\u2019s the only one of the group\u2019s songs to bear a writing credit for Keith Levene, the band\u2019s original guitarist. Levene showers melodic gold dust all over this otherwise shouty punk stomper, but is better known for his work with John Lydon in Public Image Ltd. 37. Know Your Rights (1982) From Combat Rock, the final album by the classic quartet of Strummer, Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon. The tank was getting emptied, but Strummer\u2019s black humour brims through lines such as \u201cYou have the right to free speech / As long as you\u2019re not dumb enough to actually try it.\u201d 36. I\u2019m So Bored With the USA (1977) This hugely anthemic track on debut album The Clash began life as I\u2019m So Bored With You, a song about Jones\u2019s girlfriend, before Strummer\u2019s ad-libbed \u201c\u2026 SA\u201d took it in a new direction. The blistering critique of US imperialism and exported culture (\u201cYankee detectives are always on the TV\u201d) didn\u2019t stop the Clash\u2019s love of American iconography, cars and clothes. 35. Janie Jones (1977) Original Clash drummer Terry Chimes \u2013 uncharitably credited as Tory Crimes on The Clash \u2013 propels the debut\u2019s storming opener, a eulogy to a 60s pop celebrity and libertine who had been jailed for vice offences in 1973. On release, the convicted madam returned Strummer\u2019s affections in the song Letter to Joe. 34. Charlie Don\u2019t Surf (1980) By the epic three-disc fourth album, Sandinista!, the Clash arguably had too many ideas for their own good, but within the 36-song sprawl are undoubted treasures. Titled after a Lt Col Kilgore quip in Apocalypse Now, there\u2019s an element of the doo-wop era to this sweet song about, well, cultural imperialism. 33. Brand New Cadillac (1979) This bracing cover of a 1959 Vince Taylor and the Playboys track refers to the early Brit rockers\u2019 glamorous dream car (when most of them probably had to make do with a humble Ford Anglia). From the double album London Calling, the Clash\u2019s creative zenith. 32. The Guns of Brixton (1979) Brixton boy Simonon wanted some songwriting cash and so penned this memorable song about police harassment and discontent in his London neighbourhood, two years before the district exploded into rioting. In 1990, Simonon received an unexpected windfall when Norman Cook (later Fatboy Slim) sampled the groove for Beats International\u2019s hit Dub Be Good to Me. 31. Clash City Rockers (1978) Year zero meant many punks hurriedly buried their pasts in pub rock bands with long hair, but this 1978 single reworks a song from Strummer\u2019s old pub rock band, the 101\u2019ers, around trademark Clash self-mythology. The shift from aggressive guitars (surely copied from the Who\u2019s I Can\u2019t Explain) to something more mournful suggest musical adventure to come. 30. Rudie Can\u2019t Fail (1979) According to long-time Clash associate Don Letts, this London Calling gem is the fruit of a long hot summer that the Clash spent smoking herb and going to reggae clubs. It\u2019s a horns-drenched homage to Caribbean culture, \u201cdrinking brew for breakfast\u201d and the \u201cchicken skin suit\u201d. 29. Tommy Gun (1978) A great single from the not universally adored second album, Give \u2019Em Enough Rope. Strummer is scathing about the idea that terrorists see their cause as glamorous, yelling: \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead when your war is won\u201d, while Headon\u2019s snare drum rolls resemble gunfire. This didn\u2019t stop the singer posing for photos in a T-shirt honouring Italian-based violent leftist organisation Brigate Rosse (the Red Brigades). 28. Police and Thieves (1977) This cover of the Lee Scratch Perry-produced Junior Murvin hit stands out a mile on The Clash. It\u2019s their first attempt at reggae, played punkier, with a new, Jones-penned intro. That summer, Bob Marley (working with Perry) acknowledged the burgeoning punk/Jamaican music love-in with Punky Reggae Party. 27. London\u2019s Burning (1977) Also from the debut album, this most captures those punk rock summers of 1976 and 1977, with its bone-crunching verse and rabble-rousing chorus. The imagery is a comprehensive list of the band and movement\u2019s inspirations, from high-rise living above the Westway (where Jones lived with his gran) to a capital city \u201cburning with boredom now\u201d. 26. Somebody Got Murdered (1980) According to Pat Gilbert\u2019s superb book Passion Is a Fashion, the Clash were approached by producer-arranger Jack Nitzsche to provide a song for the William Friedkin movie Cruising, but he never called again. Thus, the song lit up Sandinista! with its effervescent tune and film noir-ish imagery about a random killing. 25. Career Opportunities (1977) The limited youth employment of the 70s is timelessly skewered (\u201cCareer opportunities, the ones that never knock\u201d) in this gem from the debut. The line \u201cI won\u2019t open letter bombs for you\u201d refers to an actual job once held by Jones, checking government mail for explosive devices. 24. Pressure Drop (1979) The B-side of the slightly hackneyed English Civil War and one of the Clash\u2019s great covers, of Toots and the Maytals\u2019 1970 reggae/ska classic (as heard in the 1972 film The Harder They Come). Later, Strummer was at pains to point out that they recorded it in 1977, hence it pre-dates 2-Tone. 23. This Is England (1985) Headon and Jones had been sacked by now (for heroin abuse and behavioural issues, respectively) as a remodelled, five-piece Clash made a sixth album. The otherwise unloved Cut the Crap did herald this final terrific single. Keyboards and guitars drive Strummer\u2019s withering take on our national strife. 22. Gates of the West (1979) The Clash had been singing about the US since I\u2019m So Bored With the USA. Based on Rusted Chrome, an early Jones composition, this stormer from the Cost of Living EP describes their New York experiences, the characters, imagery and anthemic tune all reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen. 21. Hitsville UK (1980) From Sandinista!, this eulogy to pop is a bubblegum delight that namechecks the UK\u2019s emerging independent labels and argues that a great \u201ctwo minutes 59\u201d single can triumph over industry sharp practice. With its Motown (the original \u201cHitsville\u201d) groove and sugar-coated duet between Jones and his girlfriend, Ellen Foley, the Clash\u2019s remaining hardcore punk fans hated it. 20. Police on My Back (1980) Another terrific example of the Clash\u2019s ability to cover a song (the original was by Eddy Grant\u2019s old band, the Equals) and make it sound as if they had written it. Jones\u2019s guitar wails like a siren, and the song has all the adrenalin rush of a police chase. 19. Lost in the Supermarket (1979) In the tradition of the Rolling Stones\u2019 (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction and the X-Ray Spex back catalogue, this is a great Strummer-penned/Jones-sung song about the dehumanising effects of advertising and the consumer society. (\u201cI came in here for that special offer / A guaranteed personality.\u201d) 18. I Fought the Law (1979) The band reputedly heard the Bobby Fuller Four original on the studio jukebox in San Francisco while recording Give \u2019Em Enough Rope. Writing credits aside, this is a trademark Clash smash, full of outlaw rebel posturing and laden with Headon\u2019s six-shooter drum cracks. 17. Death or Glory (1979) Strummer\u2019s ferocious blast at ageing, sellout rock stars builds to a hurtling climax on a lyrical twist as he fears a similar fate himself. Presumably it was ruled out as a single because of the infamous, hilarious line: \u201cBut I believe in this and it\u2019s been tested by research / He who fucks nuns will later join the church.\u201d 16. Safe European Home (1978) Strutting around Kingston, Jamaica, in full punk regalia (in theory to stir the creative juices for Give \u2019Em Enough Rope) proved a rude awakening, but did produce this untypical example of Clash self-mockery. \u201cI went to the place where every white face / Is an invitation to robbery / And sitting here in my safe European home / Don\u2019t want to go back there again.\u201d 15. Clampdown (1979) Strummer\u2019s view that capitalism was endangering people and the planet was sharpened by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, which inspired this London Calling highlight. The Clash were exploding with musical ideas by now, and packed rock, funk and disco into this fiery, timeless anthem. 14. Garageland (1977) The rock critic Charles Shaar Murray\u2019s dismissal of the Clash as a \u201cgarage band\u201d in an early live review prompted this defiant riposte, which also reflects the band\u2019s fretting that signing to a major label would be selling out. It\u2019s a furious but somehow melancholy anthem: \u201cPeople ringing up making offers for my life / But I just wanna stay in the garage all night.\u201d 13. The Card Cheat (1979) Surely channeling Jones\u2019s love of Mott the Hoople, this is the sort of thing that presumably inspired the Libertines. Horns, drum rudiments, a sublime piano hook and vivid imagery (\u201cTo the opium dens and the bar room gin ... The gambler\u2019s face cracks into a grin\u201d) combine in a song about a card sharp who is shot for cheating. 12. Spanish Bombs (1979) A favourite of the late INXS singer, Michael Hutchence. The melody is glorious and Strummer\u2019s lyrics contrast the freedom fighters of the Spanish civil war with modern tourists. The singer partly sings it in what he called \u201cClash Spanish\u201d. Ol\u00e9! 11. Rock the Casbah (1982) Headon wrote and played most of the music on Combat Rock\u2019s club/chart smash, which innovatively combines rock, funk and a slightly eastern feel. Strummer\u2019s lyrics are inspired by Iran\u2019s post-Islamic revolution ban on pop music, the singer\u2019s idea being that the people would rise up and \u201crock the casbah\u201d. 10. Train in Vain (1979) After a planned NME flexidisc fell through, this sublime Jones unrequited love song was added to London Calling too late for listing on the initial sleeves. Pete Townshend\u2019s favourite Clash tune, this is the band at their unashamedly poppiest. Headon\u2019s killer drum intro fires one of the rhythm section\u2019s funkiest grooves. 9. Stay Free (1978) Jones\u2019s sublime, heartfelt eulogy to his old Strand school friend Robin Crocker, who became known as Robin Banks after a sting of heists landed him a stretch inside. Some fans were delighted to discover that Banks subsequently punched the song\u2019s producer, Sandy Pearlman, who had previously worked with Blue \u00d6yster Cult and is largely blamed for Give \u2019Em Enough Rope\u2019s not exactly punky gloss. 8. The Magnificent Seven (1980) Having rattled through punk, reggae, ska, dub and rockabilly inside five years, our boys assimilate the emerging hip-hop sounds they heard while in New York, and Strummer turns white rap pioneer. A terrific groove forms the platform for daft-but-inspired wordplay: \u201cItalian mobster shoots a lobster.\u201d 7. The Call Up (1980) Following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, as the US geared up to reintroduce the draft, the Clash spearheaded the resistance with this fantastic Sandinista! single. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you not to heed the call up / I don\u2019t wanna die ... I don\u2019t wanna kill,\u201d cries Strummer, over a magnificently eerie reggae-ish backdrop. 6. Bankrobber (1980) So many great songs poured out of the Clash that this Mikey Dread-produced gem was almost thrown away as an import-only 45, which didn\u2019t stop it making it No 12 in the UK charts. It\u2019s dub music with folk storytelling \u2013 Strummer\u2019s \u201cdaddy\u201d wasn\u2019t really a bank robber, but a diplomat. 5. London Calling (1979) The Clash\u2019s highest-charting UK single, until Combat Rock\u2019s rather banal Should I Stay Or Should I Go reached No 1 in 1991 after being used in a Levi\u2019s ad. Years before the climate crisis and flooding sparked public concern, Strummer fears an imminent biblical apocalypse, hence \u201cLondon is drowning and I live by the river\u201d. 4. Armagideon Time (1979) The flip of the London Calling single, this superb reworking of Willie Williams\u2019 social justice anthem is the definitive example of the Clash playing reggae. Strummer\u2019s \u201cOK, OK, don\u2019t push us when we\u2019re hot\u201d is his shouted rebuff to then-manager Kosmo Vinyl, urging him to scrap the allotted three-minute length and keep the tapes rolling. 3. Complete Control (1977) After CBS infuriated the Clash by releasing Remote Control as a single against their wishes, the band responded with their punk-era high watermark. Lee Perry produces, and Strummer\u2019s yelled \u201cYou\u2019re my guitar hero!\u201d during Jones\u2019s blistering guitar solo is one of many goosebump moments. 2. Straight to Hell (1982) Headon\u2019s bossa nova rhythm and a haunting hook (later sampled by MIA for 2007\u2019s Paper Planes) power Combat Rock\u2019s finest. The band\u2019s unity was already fracturing, but Strummer rightly called this vengeful tirade against imperialism and American soldiers in Vietnam who left local women pregnant (\u201cGo straight to hell, boys\u201d) \u201cone of our absolute masterpieces\u201d. 1. (White Man in) Hammersmith Palais (1978) Any of the Clash\u2019s best songs could grace the top spot without too much argument, but this edges it. The collision of reggae (verse) and rock (chorus) epitomise what the critic Lester Bangs described as the Clash\u2019s fusion of \u201cblack music and white noise\u201d. Lyrically, a disappointingly lightweight reggae gig (in the Hammersmith Palais) triggers Strummer\u2019s blistering state of the nation address, in which he considers everything from music (\u201cTurning rebellion into money\u201d) to racism and rising nationalism (\u201cIf Adolf Hitler flew in today, they\u2019d send a limousine anyway\u201d). Forty-two years on, it remains a tour de force and as relevant as ever. Various 40th anniversary super deluxe editions of London Calling are out now on Sony.",

      "bodyText": "Police have issued a warning after a number of social media posts purportedly identified victims of the serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga. Greater Manchester police (GMP) said social media users would be committing criminal offences and potentially jeopardising a live investigation by identifying those who may have been sexually assaulted by the PhD student. The force said: \u201cWe are aware of a number of social media posts circulating which may identify potential victims of sexual offences in connection with the live investigation into Reynhard Sinaga.\u201d Sinaga, 36, was jailed for a minimum of 30 years on Monday after being convicted of 159 counts of rape or sexual assault against 48 men between January 2016 and June 2017. The student, originally from Indonesia, is suspected to have abused at least 195 men and police confirmed that more potential victims came forward this week. GMP issued a statement on its social media channels on Thursday after a number of posts about the case. It said: \u201cWe would like to stress that under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, victims of sexual offices have a lifelong right to anonymity and therefore any post which identifies victims of sexual offences constitutes a criminal offence. Additionally these posts risk jeopardising an ongoing investigation into serious crime. Please be mindful when sharing any social media posts.\u201d Detectives have opened a major incident hotline since the sentencing in the anticipation that further victims of Sinaga will come forward. On Tuesday the force said it had received multiple calls in the 24 hours after he was sentenced and that an undisclosed number were from potential additional victims. Although police declined to disclose specific numbers, the force said its incident room had received a \u201cvery positive response\u201d. Police believe he attacked at least 195 victims, including the 48 whose cases were brought to court, judging by the number of \u201ctrophies\u201d the rapist kept after his assaults, including video footage, wallets, watches, mobile phones and ID cards. All but four of the 48 victims he assaulted were raped. Jailing Sinaga on Monday, the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, described him as a \u201cdangerous, deeply disturbed and perverted individual\u201d who would never be safe to be released. GMP said anyone with information relating to Sinaga could call 0800 092 0410 from within the UK or 020 7158 0124 for international callers, or make a report online. Anyone affected by the case and needing support from specialist agencies can call 0800 056 0154 from within the UK or 020 7158 0011 for international callers.",

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of 2017, Bentinho Massaro, a 29-year-old self-styled spiritual teacher with a considerable online following, chose the town of Sedona, Arizona, as the location for a 12-day-long spiritual bootcamp. Among the red sandstone cliffs that rise like temples from the desert floor, the blond-haired, blue-eyed Dutchman offered to guide his most dedicated adherents towards communion with a higher life force, or in his words, \u201cthe <a href=\"https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-sedona-experiment-2/register\">absolute</a> truth of the one infinite creator\u201d.</p> <p>For those who could afford the $1,199 ticket, this would be achieved through group meditation, self-inquiry and grape juice cleanse fasting. For those who couldn\u2019t, enlightenment would be available for a reduced price online via <a href=\"https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-sedona-experiment-2/register\">livestream</a>.</p> <p>Over the preceding seven years, Bentinho had built a near half-million-strong following on the internet. On YouTube (86,000 subscribers), he uploaded lengthy \u201cthird eye power\u201d meditations to help followers \u201cactivate their pineal gland\u201d. On Facebook (300,000 followers), he offered advice on how to maintain intimate and empowering relationships. His Instagram feed (32,000 followers) rendered a \u201csuper accelerated\u201d lifestyle of adventure sports, international travel and cigar smoking.</p> <p>The Sedona Experiment II, as the retreat was called, was set to be an intense distillation of Bentinho\u2019s most profound teachings. But a few days before the retreat started, an independent journalist named Be Scofield <a href=\"https://gurumag.com/tech-bro-guru-inside-the-sedona-cult-of-bentinho-massaro/\">self-published</a> an article on Medium claiming that Bentinho was using his social media nous to foster a cult-like following. His content, she alleged, encouraged devotees to abandon critical thinking and embrace Bentinho as a God-like figure.</p> <p>This was not the first time Bentinho had come under scrutiny. Some detractors <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guruphiliac/posts/1261637670535100\">occasionally</a> accused him of using his platforms to hook vulnerable seekers into endless engagement and blind support. And he did peddle some fringe ideas, like his plan to build a <a href=\"https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/biography\">fully enlightened society by 2035</a>, or his belief that he <a href=\"https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/read/from-traditional-spirituality-to-a-truly-free-existence\">vibrated</a> at a higher frequency than <a href=\"https://youtu.be/38cgLOgeW_Q\">other humans</a>. But for the most part, his followers consumed his content with relish. Though most had never met Bentinho in person, he became a daily, intimate presence in their lives. He was their spiritual influencer and they were his devotional fandom.</p> <p>The 12-day Sedona retreat started on 4 December 2017. Around halfway through, tragedy struck. A longtime devotee was <a href=\"https://www.richmond.com/obituaries/wilkins-brent/article_c47cccab-377d-532d-a81f-cd73ee7234a2.html\">found in a river</a> at the bottom of a ravine, a few miles from where the retreat was taking place. A suicide note was found in his Toyota, parked 225ft above, beside an overhanging bridge.</p> <p>As news spread, Bentinho\u2019s well-crafted online image began to unravel. Was it possible, some of his most loyal followers began to ask, that Bentinho was the digital incarnation of the manipulative guru, his powers amplified by the vortex-like suck of social media?</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>Bentinho\u2019s ascent as an online spiritual teacher began in 2010. The fresh-faced 21-year-old had recently returned to his native Holland after a half-year \u201cspiritual voyage\u201d in India. There, in an abandoned ashram on the outskirts of Rishikesh, he <a href=\"https://bentinho.waarbenjij.nu/reisverslag/2327047/delhi-rishikesh-en-ik\">experienced</a> what he would later refer to as an \u201cawakening\u201d, a spiritual experience where the duality between the self and the universe dissolves into cosmic oneness.</p> <p>Convinced he could <a href=\"https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/biography\">guide others</a> towards this euphoria, Bentinho was overcome by an evangelical impulse. From his parents\u2019 house in a middle-class suburb outside Amsterdam, he began recording spiritual sermons and uploading them to YouTube. In one of these early videos, entitled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVROUxwWkeA\">What is Bliss?</a>\u201d, Bentinho films himself walking down a country road, flanked by green pastures and farmyard cottages. For the first eight seconds he stares into the camera, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the mind starts to realize that its very nature is freedom itself,\u201d he says, voice quavering as if he is about to start laughing or crying, it\u2019s hard to tell, \u201cthen the inevitable response of the mind, or you could say of the body, is bliss.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"illo 2\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/12/16/G_guru_spot3.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Along with YouTube videos, Bentinho launched a website and a Facebook page to connect with a community of seekers, many of whom belonged to an earlier generation of New Age spirituality. For them, Bentinho\u2019s youthful energy was rousing \u2013 he was a \u201cdigitally native\u201d spiritual teacher who could use social media to spread wisdom to new frontiers.</p> <p>Bentinho was by no means the first spiritual teacher to use the internet as a pulpit. In the early 1990s, the internet was already democratizing and pluralizing spirituality. As well as offering established religious authorities new platforms to spread their message, it gave highly local or more obscure movements, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/01/weekinreview/the-world-out-of-control-the-internet-changes-dictatorship-s-rules.html\">Falun Gong</a> or transhumanism, new opportunities to recruit and grow. But this was also met with some alarm, triggering fears that the internet would become a powerful recruiting apparatus for a profane and cult-ish underground.</p> <p>These anxieties were amplified in 1997, after 39 members of the UFO-cult, Heaven\u2019s Gate, committed mass suicide on the direction of their guru, Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr. At least one among the deceased had been recruited via Heaven\u2019s Gate\u2019s distinctly Geocities-esque <a href=\"http://www.heavensgate.com/\">website</a>, where the leader left a goodbye message the day before the tragedy unfolded. In the aftermath, some media reports suggested that the disaster signaled the unacknowledged indoctrinating power of the web \u2013 \u201can object lesson in the evils of the Internet, that Black Lagoon of mind-control cults and conspiracy theories\u201d, as one New York Times journalist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/magazine/technology-makes-us-escapist-the-cult-of-the-mind.html\">put</a> it.</p> <p>The panic subsided. In the cultural imagination of the 1990s, a cult leader still needed a physical location \u2013 a remote farm, a secluded commune \u2013 to isolate adherents and pull their cognitive and emotional selves to pieces. As journalist Joshua Quittner wrote in Time magazine: \u201cA Web page that has the power to suck people \u2013 against their will \u2013 into a suicide cult?\u2026 give me a break.\u201d</p> <p>But the rise of social media in the decades since has led to a gradual convergence of the virtual and the real, making the notion of being \u201csucked in\u201d by a website palpable. The internet is where most of us access culture, community and, increasingly, spiritual nourishment. This has, in turn, given rise to a new generation of astrologers, self-help gurus, wellness experts, and mindfulness guides who use their networks to provide answers to life\u2019s most confounding questions, while building personal brands.</p> <p>Often, these spiritual influencers offer solace and higher purpose at a time when confidence in traditional religious authority in the west is rapidly waning. But occasionally, they can be destructive. As always, there are grifters who extort impressionable followers for clout and money. More disturbing are the conspiracy theorists, religious extremists and ideologues who draw in vulnerable users searching for something to believe in.</p> <p>From the perspective of the algorithms, there is little difference between the genuine and pernicious guru: they are simply high-octane users who excel at creating engaging content for their followers. Unhampered by geographical constraints, their entire business model, or spiritual mission, is built on recruiting eager followers.</p> <p>Although his earliest followers didn\u2019t know it, Bentinho Massaro\u2019s rise as an online spiritual teacher would go to the heart of this dynamic, testing the boundaries between the spiritual influencer and the charismatic manipulator. From the beginning, he had a preternatural talent for making his followers fall in love not only with his teachings, but with his online persona.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Bentinho,\u201d an early student <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFSV0AOKHk\">remarked</a> on a YouTube video. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of life and joy, jeez its infatuating :)\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"illo 4\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/12/16/G_guru_spot2.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>Lynn Parry discovered Bentinho in 2012, just as his online profile was rising.</p> <p>Thirty and living with her sisters in London, she had recently gotten rejected by a PhD program in educational psychology and was spending a lot of time watching spiritual lectures on YouTube. The platform\u2019s recommendation algorithm registered this fixation, and one day, queued Bentinho\u2019s videos.</p> <p>Immediately, Parry was drawn in \u2013 \u201cI genuinely felt he had a light,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>By this stage, Bentinho\u2019s teachings had come to focus on two key ideas. The first was that achieving a state of enlightenment was possible without meditation or intense self-reflection. You simply had to become \u201caware of your awareness\u201d. The second was a re-articulation of the law of attraction made famous by Rhonda Byrne in her 2010 bestseller <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)\">The Secret</a>, which posited that thoughts have a magnetic pull that physically attract similar energies from the universe.</p> <p>Parry found the teachings engaging, but she was more interested in the community around them. Throughout her 20s, she had visited several spiritual communities \u2013 in South Africa (where she is originally from), in India, in Scotland. Bentinho\u2019s Facebook page was the first virtual community that she actively engaged in.</p> <p>Bentinho would come out with a new video most weeks. He would be sitting cross-legged on a chair in front of a small crowd, musing on topics like \u201cHow to Change Your Past\u201d or \u201cAbsolute Freedom\u201d. Virtual followers would watch and discuss. \u201cIt was a place where things made sense,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere we all shared the same language.\u201d</p> <p>After two years, Parry travelled to one of Bentinho\u2019s retreats in the US. She was as taken in person as she was online, and soon was spending long periods of time in Boulder, Colorado, where Bentinho and a core group of followers had set up an office on the main street. Wedged between yoga studios and coffee shops, they were building a movement called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bentinhomassaro/photos/a.205428999523099/797552173644109/?type=3\">Trinfinity</a>, whose core mission was to instigate a global spiritual revolution.</p> <p>Trinfinity proposed that the solution to life\u2019s most intractable problems were found through personal improvement and spiritual transcendence. If you were struggling with life, it was not because of the social, political or economic systems that govern it but because of a deficient or \u201cmisaligned\u201d perception of reality. Lasting change could only be achieved if an individual was able to \u201cwake up\u201d to their \u201ctruest self\u201d, to look past the distortions of the material world and exist in a higher plane of consciousness.</p> <p>Bentinho was the prodigious shepherd leading the community towards this enlightened state of being. He commanded respect because of his genuine knowledge of alternative spirituality. His mother, an elementary school teacher, and father, an energy company worker, were <a href=\"https://www.playboy.com/read/spirituality-goes-viral\">enthusiastic</a> adopters of New Age practices. When Bentinho was just a boy, they <a href=\"http://www.vrolijkverlicht.nl/46-verhalen-over-ontwaken/awakenings/96-awakening-benito-massaro\">enrolled</a> him in a self-help and meditation program developed by an American electrician in the 1940s called the <a href=\"https://www.silvamethodct.com/about-silva/\">Silva Mind Control method</a>, which was supposed to increase IQ and instruct in clairvoyance.</p> <p>This triggered in the already <a href=\"https://goldenageofgaia.com/2014/07/02/biography-of-bentinho-massaro/\">intense</a> child a lifelong desire to find alternative pathways to making sense of reality. As a teenager, Bentinho <a href=\"http://www.vrolijkverlicht.nl/46-verhalen-over-ontwaken/awakenings/96-awakening-benito-massaro\">enrolled</a> in pseudoscientific human optimization courses like Neuro-Linguistic Programming and the Emotional Freedom Technique. He also took up yoga, meditation and Reiki. These interests set him <a href=\"https://goldenageofgaia.com/2014/07/02/biography-of-bentinho-massaro/\">apart</a> at school, and he would later <a href=\"https://goldenageofgaia.com/2014/07/02/biography-of-bentinho-massaro/\">define</a> this period of his life as a \u201cdesperate quest, filled with effort, judgment, self-torture and constant striving\u201d.</p> <p>But in Trinfinity, he found a like-minded community of fellow seekers. When he spoke, they listened.</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>Initially the core community of around a dozen team members in Boulder were free to spread Bentinho\u2019s teachings however they wanted. Parry established a children\u2019s meditation camp. \u201cAt the beginning it was just a bunch of friends who came together with a true intention of real spiritual connection,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we just wanted to share that and go deeper into that.\u201d</p> <p>By the middle of 2015, though, Parry felt the focus begin to shift. Bentinho was spending a lot of time engaging online followers and was diverting more of the company\u2019s resources towards growing and monetizing his following. According to Parry, Trinfinity was spending up to $10,000 a month on Facebook advertising and releasing content in hierarchical tiers. Much of the online material remained free, but if a follower wanted access to \u201cexclusive\u201d courses, a subscription was required. A Skype chat cost <a href=\"http://itisnotreal.blogspot.com/2014/01/bentino-massaro-amended-129.html\">$600</a> an hour. Retreats were <a href=\"https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/events/lionsgate\">held</a> at luxury international resorts, setting followers back thousands of dollars.</p> <p>Bentinho\u2019s image was also changing from guileless spiritual seeker to a tan, buff health bro, a transformation intimately detailed on his increasingly popular Instagram account. The stream of images \u2013 Bentinho free-diving in Bali, posing in lotus position meters underwater; Bentinho <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/3HvF3NIkXZ/\">scaling</a> a sheer boulder-face, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/29_Yw8okdZ/\">topless</a>; Bentinho sharing a cocktail with a girlfriend \u2013 served as living proof that his teachings really worked. This \u201cepic life\u201d would be available to his followers, too, the Trinfinity teachings implied, if they just subscribed to the next lesson, watched the next video, or bought his <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33137592-super-accelerated-living\">book</a>.</p> <p>The re-branding proved lucrative and by 2016, Trinfinity was bringing in \u201ca lot of money\u201d, Parry said. Still in his mid-20s, Bentinho relished the success. He bought himself a new car and took lavish holidays with models he met online. He also picked up a habit of smoking expensive cigars which, he claimed, could be \u201cbeneficial if you know how to attune your consciousness to the consciousness/spirit/information of the plant\u201d.</p> <p>Bentinho\u2019s success attracted newcomers to Trinfinity, too, who were more devotional and ambitious. One woman, who is still close to Bentinho, wrote a blogpost claiming that he was a \u201cspiritual prodigy\u201d whose \u201cvision surpassed Elon Musk\u2019s easily\u201d.</p> <p>On social media, community members depicted their life as a harmonious, carefree example of a fully conscious existence. But according to Parry, there were ever-present tensions and conflicts, particularly around money and online clout. She said Bentinho paid his core team a salary of $1,000 a month, occasionally handing out bonuses for extra work. \u201cHe could be very kind and giving, but he had this hierarchical way of paying salaries, which also felt controlling,\u201d she said. \u201cHe decided who got paid more and who got to have more prominent positions. It was supposed to be this equal community, but it didn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of 2016, a few team leaders held a weekend workshop to plan how they could scale Trinfinity beyond Bentinho\u2019s cult of online personality. Feeling betrayed, the young guru left Boulder for a silent meditation retreat in Thailand, after which he emerged with a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bentinhomassaro/posts/just-got-off-the-phone-with-anurag-gupta-as-you-guys-may-know-by-now-and-after-r/1364656323600355/\">grand new plan</a> for Trinfinity\u2019s future. They would relocate to Sedona, Arizona, and work towards buying a plot of land where they would lead the planet towards global enlightenment by the year 2035.</p> <p>\u201cBen was saying, you know, you need to see me as your guru if you\u2019re going to be part of this,\u201d Parry said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to have naysayers around.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>While reporting this story, I spent dozens of hours sitting in my bedroom, laptop resting on a pillow, working my way through the vast archive of content that Bentinho has left online since 2010. I found much of the spiritual material inaccessible, requiring a repertoire for abstract concepts like \u201cinfinity\u201d and \u201cvibrations\u201d that I simply don\u2019t have. Some of his theories concerning <a href=\"https://www.bentinhomassaro.com/read/the-metaphysical-evolution-of-our-species-and-planet\">extraterrestrial consciousness</a> and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.trinfinity.us/\">interstellar absorption</a>\u201d were preposterous, though admittedly entertaining.</p> <p>But in some of his lectures, Bentinho reminded me distinctly of Tony Robbins, the 6ft 7in motivational speaker who has built a $500m empire by prescribing the secrets to a successful life.</p> <p>Like Robbins, Bentinho commands attention by cultivating a hyper-masculine persona, presenting an archetypal image of total control. The key difference, though, is that Robbins, who began coaching in the 1980s, came up through the seminar circuit, spreading his message in venues that have the energy of mega-churches.</p> <p>Through this direct interaction with attendees Robbins has, over the years, come to understand that his seminars attract a vulnerable demographic. Now, as a precautionary measure, Robbins\u2019 staff do thorough <a href=\"https://theknockturnal.com/tony-robbins-im-not-guru-film-premier/\">background checks</a> on attendees, compiling \u201cred flag\u201d lists of people to watch over carefully throughout the seminar. (Robbins was recently <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/tony-robbins-accused-sexual-assault-teenager-supercamp\">accused</a> of abuse by some former students, a claim that he denies.)</p> <p>Bentinho, on the other hand, has gathered his flock on social media, meaning that most followers experience his \u201clife transforming\u201d teachings as I did: all alone in their room, with no background checks.</p> <p>Lukas Jansen (a pseudonym) stumbled upon Bentinho\u2019s YouTube videos when he was 25, living at his parents\u2019 house recovering from a period of heavy drinking, obsessive gaming and panic attacks. He had already explored the writings of other self-help gurus, like Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti, but he found Bentinho more immediately relatable.</p> <p>In particular, Jansen was drawn to Bentinho\u2019s message of self-empowerment, the idea that suffering could disappear through force of positive imagination alone. \u201cHe told us that we are all the best and have infinite potential, and at those moments, I felt like I was in a bubble. I felt super happy, super energetic. I felt on top of the world,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cLike a child can go into his imagination and forget the whole world, that\u2019s pretty much what I did when I watched the videos. I could distance myself from this suffering Lukas with a very mediocre life.\u201d</p> <p>But the moment Jansen stopped engaging, the high would wear off and he\u2019d once again be faced with the reality that he was a man in his 20s living with his parents, rarely leaving his room due to crippling anxiety. To avoid the comedown, Jansen retreated further into Bentinho\u2019s teachings, sometimes watching up to 10 hours a day.</p> <p>Having waded my way through Bentinho\u2019s content, this level of dedication was perplexing. But Jansen explained that what really held him was this sense of manufactured intimacy that Bentinho cultivated. In some videos, Bentinho would spend minutes simply gazing into the camera, smiling, occasionally whispering \u201cI love you.\u201d Jansen felt seen. He would respond beneath Bentinho posts with comments like, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re the most beautiful spiritual teacher ever I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>I spoke to several other Bentinho followers, a diverse demographic, who described a similar feeling. In moments of extreme vulnerability \u2013 after being fired, during a divorce, coming off prescription drugs \u2013 they had gone online looking for spiritual solace, and were guided by the invisible hand of YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms to Bentinho. He told them that all they needed to improve their lives was to believe that their lives were good, and in front of the screen, with his unceasing affirmation, they could momentarily believe it was so.</p> <p>Though they never met Bentinho, these followers were the silent engine behind his spiritual movement. They shared his content, commented on every one of his posts, and were often responsible for moderating his Facebook page. They were repaid with new spiritual content from the guru. But the joy they derived from the videos was hallucinatory, dissociative, fleeting. When they looked away from the screen, they were once again faced with the reality of their lives. So they went back online.</p> <p>One woman told me that Bentinho\u2019s teachings gave her a dopamine rush: \u201cIt made me feel manically better. It was definitely like a drug.\u201d Another said that the videos allowed her to disconnect from her emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s all about pretending you are in a life in which you really aren\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>In 2017, Parry moved to Sedona to stay close to the Trinfinity community, who had become like family, but she stopped associating with Bentinho, unwilling to abide what she felt was \u201cincreasingly authoritarian behavior\u201d. But others, including her close friend, Brent Wilkins, remained loyal adherents.</p> <p>Parry met Wilkins several years earlier, at her first Bentinho retreat. A former tennis pro, Wilkins was tall, square-jawed and handsome. But he was plagued, Parry felt, by anxiety and low self-confidence. After the retreat, Wilkins, who had already tried sobriety, Christianity and Eckhart Tolle in his quest for inner peace, bought into Bentinho\u2019s teachings and online persona. He began consuming his content in large volumes and attending retreats. Eventually, he was spending long stints living with the Trinfinity community in Boulder.</p> <p>His friends outside the community felt that the more committed Wilkins became, the more anxious and dissociated he grew. At one point, his parents <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-best-reads/2018/05/09/bentinho-massaro-sedona-experiment-how-search-enlightenment-led-digital-cult/487923002/\">convinced</a> him to move home and seek psychological help. But no matter where Wilkins lived, his teacher was just one click away.</p> <p>Towards the end of 2017, Wilkins moved into a spare room in Parry\u2019s house, preparing for the Sedona Experiment II. Parry had completely disengaged from Bentinho\u2019s teachings, which she felt were \u201cfull of shit\u201d. But she avoided discussing this with Wilkins. \u201cHe had Ben on a pedestal and he really believed the perfect image that he put out there,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to confuse him by shattering the illusion.\u201d</p> <p>On 4 December, Wilkins began the 12-day program. At some point during the sixth day, he quietly left the group and drove his Toyota to a nearby bridge that passed over a river some 225ft below. He parked, walked over to the ledge, and jumped, plummeting between the red sandstone cliffs to his death.</p> <p>As news of Wilkins\u2019 death spread online, it prompted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/sedonabulletinboard/permalink/1655629307831748/?hc_location=ufi\">debate</a> about whether Bentinho\u2019s influence played some part. This was compounded by the fact that three days before the retreat began Be Scofield, who frequently reported on cases of abuse in spiritual communities, had published an expos\u00e9 entitled,<a href=\"https://gurumag.com/tech-bro-guru-inside-the-sedona-cult-of-bentinho-massaro/\"> Tech Bro Guru: Inside the Sedona Cult of Bentinho Massaro</a>.</p> <p>Scofield had moved to Sedona a few months earlier, attracted by its New Age history. By chance, in her first week in town she was invited to a Full Moon gathering where she met a number of core members of Bentinho\u2019s community. When they told her that their young teacher would be leading them towards \u201cThe Absolute\u201d her \u201cguru-radar\u201d was triggered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"illo 1\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/12/16/G_guru_spot4.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Over the next month, under the alias \u201cShakti Hunter\u201d, Scofield spent more time with Bentinho\u2019s community, carefully observing how it all worked. She liked the people she met at the various group meditations and ecstatic dance sessions \u2013 they were young, welcoming, free-spirited. But they also appeared to suspend their better judgment when it came to their teacher. One acolyte unselfconsciously told Scofield that they believed Bentinho could change the weather.</p> <p>As well as spending time with the community, Scofield trawled through Bentinho\u2019s online archive. Having encountered people that she considered to be manipulative gurus in the past, she came to the conclusion that Bentinho was using social media to build a cult-like following. She wrote a Medium post outlining her concerns, and on 1 December, posted it to Facebook and then left Sedona for Texas.</p> <p>In her article, which was shared hundreds of thousands of times, she levelled serious accusations against Bentinho: that he was verbally abusive to students; that he pushed some people away from family and close friends; that he traded freely in bizarre conspiracies. She also dug up archival footage of Bentinho saying that he had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujRPx4GDZU\">tortured</a> a cat as a young child. For Scofield, this was textbook behavior for the manipulative guru, supercharged by the affordances of online platforms. \u201cTech bro Guru has arrived,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe OS has been upgraded. Cult 2.0 is upon us.\u201d</p> <p>Most concerning for Scofield was how Bentinho\u2019s teachings seemed to \u201cnormalize\u201d death. In one video <a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e76db79361f71eb6c5e21cdec6c4eb5?postId=a56314f830ef&amp;wvideo=9p190002qd\">referenced</a> in her article, Bentinho says that because we all eventually die, life is about \u201cgiving up everything you have for the sake of the vision, to become the vision\u201d. In another, he <a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e76db79361f71eb6c5e21cdec6c4eb5?postId=a56314f830ef&amp;wvideo=9p190002qd\">tells</a> followers not to fear death, but to be excited by it. (Scofield\u2019s article, according to her, was eventually taken down by Medium for violating company policy by uploading recordings of Bentinho and his staff without their consent.)</p> <p>Scofield was not alone in her concerns. According to <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-best-reads/2018/05/09/bentinho-massaro-sedona-experiment-how-search-enlightenment-led-digital-cult/487923002/\">reporting</a> in the Arizona Republic, the police chief in Sedona had been notified about Bentinho\u2019s group. After Wilkins\u2019 death, he sent two detectives to pay Bentinho a visit at his house, questioning him about a video they found online in which he says, \u201cwake up to something important. Otherwise, kill yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Bentinho was not a suspect in Wilkins\u2019 death, which was treated as a suicide. No criminal or civil charges were ever brought against Bentinho or Trinfinity.</p> <p>Two days after Wilkins\u2019 death, Bentinho posted on Facebook expressing his condolences to the family. \u201cI am sad to never see your physical smile again, my handsome, radiant friend,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I feel your essence and its light within me, and I sense your newfound freedom.\u201d</p> <p>But according to Parry, Bentinho developed a stigma in Sedona. \u201cA lot of people were really hurting,\u201d says Parry. \u201cSomebody even shouted at Ben in Whole Foods, \u2018You\u2019re no longer welcome here!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>After Wilkins\u2019 death, Bentinho\u2019s name became associated with the label, \u201ccult\u201d. For some he was still a \u201cspiritual rockstar\u201d making enlightenment accessible for a new generation via social media. But he was also accused of being an \u201cInstagram douche meets cult leader\u201d and \u201cSteve Jobs meets Jim Jones\u201d.</p> <p>In April 2018, Bentinho responded to Scofield\u2019s article on Facebook, not <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/bentinhomassaro/posts/?ref=page_internal\">addressing</a> any of the specific accusations, but instead accusing Scofield of being a cult leader herself, \u201cappealing to all the dormant fears in those around the world who are part of one of the biggest cults on our planet today: The Average American Cult \u2013 indoctrinated by media, scared of just about anything outside of their own family home, and ready to pull a gun out on anyone they do not understand\u201d.</p> <p>Two documentaries soon followed, which explicitly explored the cult accusations. One, produced by the UK-based YouTube channel, Barcroft TV, splices together audio recordings of Bentinho shouting at followers \u2013\u201cYou are scared little toddlers \u2026 Fuck you\u201d \u2013 while playing footage of a woman breaking down on stage at one of his seminars.</p> <p>In the other, produced by Vice, Bentinho tries to convince a skeptical journalist that he can make it stop raining telekinetically. \u201cOnce someone in the media has labeled you a cult it\u2019s really hard to ditch that label. How do you feel about that?\u201d the journalist asks. \u201cWe are a cult,\u201d Bentinho responds, smirking. \u201cWe are a Curious, Understanding, Loving, Tribe.\u201d</p> <p>When I asked Parry and Jansen whether they felt that Bentinho\u2019s community was cult-like, they expressed ambivalence. Both acknowledged there were elements of authoritarianism and manipulation, but also had an aversion to the label.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"illo 3\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/12/16/G_guru_spot1.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But for others, particularly family members of people who had become part of Bentinho\u2019s community, the term \u201ccult\u201d was preferred. Trish Wilkins, Brent\u2019s mother, was quoted in the Arizona Republic saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a member of a cult! He joined a cult there. We call it a cult.\u201d</p> <p>Another mother, Janet Smith (a pseudonym), whose daughter is still intimately involved with Bentinho\u2019s community, was also adamant that \u201ccult\u201d was the right term.</p> <p>\u201cSince she went on one of Bentinho\u2019s retreats she has not been the same,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cWhen I call her she gives weird answers and meditates all the time. She talks about 2035 being the time when the whole world will live in peace. I ask her what the hell she is talking about. She tells me: You have no idea! You are trapped in your limited prejudices about humanity. I managed to free myself from that. I have the overview.\u201d</p> <p>A number of former followers published articles online about Bentinho\u2019s behavior, including a one-time lover. She alleges that Bentinho would often subject her and other followers to \u201cdistortion readings\u201d, a kind of intense, unregulated therapy, where he would \u201cdissect\u201d their egos, tell them where they were \u201cout of alignment\u201d.</p> <p>This process was supposed to lead adherents towards an understanding of their \u201ctruer self\u201d, but the former girlfriend, who has since left the community, says that it left her emotionally shattered. \u201cAnytime I would express my own opinion, I was told it was my \u201cego\u2019s\u201d defense mechanism to try to survive. That the best thing I could do was to surrender to the death of my ego,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was 10 months of complete obliteration of everything I knew myself to be.\u201d</p> <p>Rick Ross, a noted cult deprogrammer and founder of the Cult Education Institute, an online resource that provides information about contemporary cult-like groups, told me that this feeling of being led away from yourself is a symptom of cult dynamics.</p> <p>Ross\u2019s definition of cult dynamics are based off the work of Robert Jay Lifton, a psychiatrist and historian who rose to prominence after studying the techniques used by the Chinese military to brainwash captured American servicemen during the Korean war. Lifton called this process \u201cthought reform\u201d, and Ross, who has followed Bentinho\u2019s online ascent, believes that his teachings act out elements of this process.</p> <p>He uses language that makes little sense to those outside the group but becomes \u201cloaded\u201d with connotations and meaning for those on the inside. He offers up his own \u201csacred science\u201d, a set of dogmatic principles that claim to embody the truth about human behavior and psychology. And he assumes the position of an omniscient leader with a \u201cGod\u2019s-eye view\u201d whose insight can, alone, guide others to an otherwise inaccessible truth.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not he is meaning to do it, these techniques are designed to break down individual autonomy,\u201d Ross told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re exposed to it for long enough, suddenly everything else stops making any sense.\u201d</p> <p>What makes this most troubling, for Ross, is that the impact of Bentinho\u2019s teachings are not limited to those directly in his physical orbit. Any vulnerable person who might stumble on, or be recommended, his content online can fall under the spell. He compared it to fishing with a line versus trawling with a net. \u201cThere is just so much more scope now to catch new followers,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>Over the past five years, we have heard stories about dejected adults being fed conspiracy theories, isolated youth radicalized by white nationalists, children incited to inflict violence by nefarious virtual characters.</p> <p>Within these narratives, social media are depicted as a vortex that algorithmically siphon us into homogeneous echo chambers controlled by ideological extremists and malignant narcissists. The internet, in other words, is a cult machine under whose influence we have all lost our collective minds.</p> <p>But Tara Isabella Burton, an academic theologian turned religion reporter whose forthcoming book, Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World, examines contemporary religious and spiritual expression, says that the history of cults offers more nuanced insight into contemporary life online.</p> <p>In the 1960s and 70s, she explained, traditional religious institutions began eroding in the west while the desire for spiritual nourishment remained steadfast. This led to what has since been called the Fourth Great Awakening, the first three referring to a series of fervent Christian revivals that swept through New England throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.</p> <p>Unlike these earlier revivals, which were evangelical in spirit, the fourth awakening was characterized by an individual search for metaphysical truth that looked towards the east and the occult for inspiration. Conservative institutions and Christian groups reacted with fear and demonization, which intensified after the highly publicized case of the Manson family. But according to Burton, most of these new movements were not dangerous. \u201cThey provided a sense of meaning, a sense of community and ritual,\u201d she said, \u201ca way of participating in the grand metaphysical architecture of the world for those who otherwise felt left out of such an experience.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past decade or so, Burton added, the internet has broadened and intensified this dynamic. Online spiritual communities offer a safe and exploratory experience for those who feel marginalized, alienated or exiled from traditional religions. As in the 20th century, these new spiritual movements are often met with condescension and fear. But while the low-barrier-to-entry of spirituality online means that vulnerable seekers are at risk of being exploited by a larger pool of ideologues, narcissists, and charlatans, Burton emphasized that spiritual communities on social media are mostly just filling a void.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have the same spiritual needs and spiritual hunger for meaning and purpose and community and ritual that we\u2019ve always had,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the panoply of spiritual options online means that there are never-ending alternatives for almost everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Bentinho\u2019s online presence satiates this hunger for tens of thousands of seekers online. For some, he comes to engulf their lives. For most, he is just one of many characters in the feed, popping up between astrology memes, witchcraft wellness advice and political news, offering a moment of insight or some temporary solace,</p> <p>For Burton, the malleable constellations of spiritual experience we can curate signify a new era of pluralism. Gurus are selected not only because of their insight, but because their content is highly engaging. Long-term commitment to a single teacher or doctrine is no longer a requirement, and adherence can be as easy as \u201cfollowing\u201d and \u201cunfollowing\u201d.</p> <p>To be sure, Bentinho is just one minor act within this broader online awakening. Although he is no prophet, his rise does foretell something: the next great religious leader, when they arrive, will deliver their sermon not from the mount, but from the smartphone. They will find their flock online.</p> <h2><strong>* * * *</strong></h2> <p>For Lukas Jansen, Bentinho\u2019s influence started to recede when he learnt of Wilkins\u2019 suicide. On the advice of a friend, he began reading articles about narcissism, and over the course of a few weeks, he came to believe that Bentinho\u2019s spiritual movement existed only to satisfy his own fathomless need for admiration.</p> <p>In 2018, he quietly disengaged from the community and joined the Bentinho Massaro Recovery Group on Facebook, made up of around two dozen others who had come to see their former guru as a spiritual fraud.</p> <p>To begin, Jansen felt intense anger towards his former spiritual teacher, but as he regained a stronger purchase on his own identity, he saw things differently. If he once needed Bentinho, he now realized that the guru needed his followers even more. Jansen could leave, unfollow, start again. Bentinho was stuck in an echo chamber he had created. \u201cHe can\u2019t live without the reassurance of his followers now,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a cult, it\u2019s a cult of attention.\u201d</p> <p>Parry, who no longer blames Bentinho for Wilkins\u2019 death, has arrived at a similar conclusion. Bentinho, she felt, started out as a genuine spiritual seeker who became intoxicated by positive feedback online.</p> <p>\u201cBut I guess this is what a lot of people do on the internet,\u201d Parry said. \u201cThey put out a perfect persona and image without putting out, you know, all the hard stuff and how they\u2019re struggling. Without meaning to, they make other people feel like they\u2019re not good enough, that there\u2019s this gap between where they are and where they should be. And for people like Brent, for many of us really, it\u2019s just too much for the spirit to handle.\u201d</p> <p>Parry still lives in Sedona and is, in spite of everything, committed to spiritual self-actualization. She guides meditation classes among the red cliffs that rise from the desert floor around the town, where the Earth\u2019s spiritual vortices are believed to converge, amplifying the energy of whoever sits in their presence.</p> <p>Bentinho, on the other hand, has gone the opposite route. After Wilkins\u2019 death, he left Sedona citing an influx of \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@livinglight12345/397eeaedb053\">ominous</a>\u201d energy. Then, after one final retreat in Holland in 2018, he shifted to an entirely online model of spiritual leadership. All of his teachings, all of his communications, all access to his person were, for the time being, fully mediated through the platforms. He became a guru in the cloud.</p> <p>I tried on numerous occasions to reach him for comment. I hit up his Instagram, his Facebook, his YouTube, a handful of email addresses. I called old acquaintances and got phone numbers that had all been disconnected. I even reached out to his mother, who responded that she would try to get in touch with him, but then ignored my follow-ups.</p> <p>Then, by the end of summer, I received an update from Bentinho on Facebook. It was a link to his \u201cnewest offering\u201d, a 25-week course called <a href=\"https://www.civilizationupgraders.com/thenextlevel\">The Next Level</a>. The website featured an image of an astronaut being sucked through a funnel of moonrock towards the light, as if falling into an endless abyss.</p> <p>Those who took the plunge and hit subscribe, Bentinho pledged, would experience a \u201cShift in Identity From Which You Can\u2019t Recover\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 9 January 2020 to correct Lynn Parry\u2019s living circumstances when she first discovered Bentinho\u2019s videos.</p></li> <li><p>This article was amended on 16 January 2020 to fix an incorrect link.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of 2017, Bentinho Massaro, a 29-year-old self-styled spiritual teacher with a considerable online following, chose the town of Sedona, Arizona, as the location for a 12-day-long spiritual bootcamp. Among the red sandstone cliffs that rise like temples from the desert floor, the blond-haired, blue-eyed Dutchman offered to guide his most dedicated adherents towards communion with a higher life force, or in his words, \u201cthe absolute truth of the one infinite creator\u201d. For those who could afford the $1,199 ticket, this would be achieved through group meditation, self-inquiry and grape juice cleanse fasting. For those who couldn\u2019t, enlightenment would be available for a reduced price online via livestream. Over the preceding seven years, Bentinho had built a near half-million-strong following on the internet. On YouTube (86,000 subscribers), he uploaded lengthy \u201cthird eye power\u201d meditations to help followers \u201cactivate their pineal gland\u201d. On Facebook (300,000 followers), he offered advice on how to maintain intimate and empowering relationships. His Instagram feed (32,000 followers) rendered a \u201csuper accelerated\u201d lifestyle of adventure sports, international travel and cigar smoking. The Sedona Experiment II, as the retreat was called, was set to be an intense distillation of Bentinho\u2019s most profound teachings. But a few days before the retreat started, an independent journalist named Be Scofield self-published an article on Medium claiming that Bentinho was using his social media nous to foster a cult-like following. His content, she alleged, encouraged devotees to abandon critical thinking and embrace Bentinho as a God-like figure. This was not the first time Bentinho had come under scrutiny. Some detractors occasionally accused him of using his platforms to hook vulnerable seekers into endless engagement and blind support. And he did peddle some fringe ideas, like his plan to build a fully enlightened society by 2035, or his belief that he vibrated at a higher frequency than other humans. But for the most part, his followers consumed his content with relish. Though most had never met Bentinho in person, he became a daily, intimate presence in their lives. He was their spiritual influencer and they were his devotional fandom. The 12-day Sedona retreat started on 4 December 2017. Around halfway through, tragedy struck. A longtime devotee was found in a river at the bottom of a ravine, a few miles from where the retreat was taking place. A suicide note was found in his Toyota, parked 225ft above, beside an overhanging bridge. As news spread, Bentinho\u2019s well-crafted online image began to unravel. Was it possible, some of his most loyal followers began to ask, that Bentinho was the digital incarnation of the manipulative guru, his powers amplified by the vortex-like suck of social media? * * * * Bentinho\u2019s ascent as an online spiritual teacher began in 2010. The fresh-faced 21-year-old had recently returned to his native Holland after a half-year \u201cspiritual voyage\u201d in India. There, in an abandoned ashram on the outskirts of Rishikesh, he experienced what he would later refer to as an \u201cawakening\u201d, a spiritual experience where the duality between the self and the universe dissolves into cosmic oneness. Convinced he could guide others towards this euphoria, Bentinho was overcome by an evangelical impulse. From his parents\u2019 house in a middle-class suburb outside Amsterdam, he began recording spiritual sermons and uploading them to YouTube. In one of these early videos, entitled \u201cWhat is Bliss?\u201d, Bentinho films himself walking down a country road, flanked by green pastures and farmyard cottages. For the first eight seconds he stares into the camera, smiling. \u201cWhen the mind starts to realize that its very nature is freedom itself,\u201d he says, voice quavering as if he is about to start laughing or crying, it\u2019s hard to tell, \u201cthen the inevitable response of the mind, or you could say of the body, is bliss.\u201d Along with YouTube videos, Bentinho launched a website and a Facebook page to connect with a community of seekers, many of whom belonged to an earlier generation of New Age spirituality. For them, Bentinho\u2019s youthful energy was rousing \u2013 he was a \u201cdigitally native\u201d spiritual teacher who could use social media to spread wisdom to new frontiers. Bentinho was by no means the first spiritual teacher to use the internet as a pulpit. In the early 1990s, the internet was already democratizing and pluralizing spirituality. As well as offering established religious authorities new platforms to spread their message, it gave highly local or more obscure movements, like Falun Gong or transhumanism, new opportunities to recruit and grow. But this was also met with some alarm, triggering fears that the internet would become a powerful recruiting apparatus for a profane and cult-ish underground. These anxieties were amplified in 1997, after 39 members of the UFO-cult, Heaven\u2019s Gate, committed mass suicide on the direction of their guru, Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr. At least one among the deceased had been recruited via Heaven\u2019s Gate\u2019s distinctly Geocities-esque website, where the leader left a goodbye message the day before the tragedy unfolded. In the aftermath, some media reports suggested that the disaster signaled the unacknowledged indoctrinating power of the web \u2013 \u201can object lesson in the evils of the Internet, that Black Lagoon of mind-control cults and conspiracy theories\u201d, as one New York Times journalist put it. The panic subsided. In the cultural imagination of the 1990s, a cult leader still needed a physical location \u2013 a remote farm, a secluded commune \u2013 to isolate adherents and pull their cognitive and emotional selves to pieces. As journalist Joshua Quittner wrote in Time magazine: \u201cA Web page that has the power to suck people \u2013 against their will \u2013 into a suicide cult?\u2026 give me a break.\u201d But the rise of social media in the decades since has led to a gradual convergence of the virtual and the real, making the notion of being \u201csucked in\u201d by a website palpable. The internet is where most of us access culture, community and, increasingly, spiritual nourishment. This has, in turn, given rise to a new generation of astrologers, self-help gurus, wellness experts, and mindfulness guides who use their networks to provide answers to life\u2019s most confounding questions, while building personal brands. Often, these spiritual influencers offer solace and higher purpose at a time when confidence in traditional religious authority in the west is rapidly waning. But occasionally, they can be destructive. As always, there are grifters who extort impressionable followers for clout and money. More disturbing are the conspiracy theorists, religious extremists and ideologues who draw in vulnerable users searching for something to believe in. From the perspective of the algorithms, there is little difference between the genuine and pernicious guru: they are simply high-octane users who excel at creating engaging content for their followers. Unhampered by geographical constraints, their entire business model, or spiritual mission, is built on recruiting eager followers. Although his earliest followers didn\u2019t know it, Bentinho Massaro\u2019s rise as an online spiritual teacher would go to the heart of this dynamic, testing the boundaries between the spiritual influencer and the charismatic manipulator. From the beginning, he had a preternatural talent for making his followers fall in love not only with his teachings, but with his online persona. \u201cThanks, Bentinho,\u201d an early student remarked on a YouTube video. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of life and joy, jeez its infatuating :)\u201d * * * * Lynn Parry discovered Bentinho in 2012, just as his online profile was rising. Thirty and living with her sisters in London, she had recently gotten rejected by a PhD program in educational psychology and was spending a lot of time watching spiritual lectures on YouTube. The platform\u2019s recommendation algorithm registered this fixation, and one day, queued Bentinho\u2019s videos. Immediately, Parry was drawn in \u2013 \u201cI genuinely felt he had a light,\u201d she told me. By this stage, Bentinho\u2019s teachings had come to focus on two key ideas. The first was that achieving a state of enlightenment was possible without meditation or intense self-reflection. You simply had to become \u201caware of your awareness\u201d. The second was a re-articulation of the law of attraction made famous by Rhonda Byrne in her 2010 bestseller The Secret, which posited that thoughts have a magnetic pull that physically attract similar energies from the universe. Parry found the teachings engaging, but she was more interested in the community around them. Throughout her 20s, she had visited several spiritual communities \u2013 in South Africa (where she is originally from), in India, in Scotland. Bentinho\u2019s Facebook page was the first virtual community that she actively engaged in. Bentinho would come out with a new video most weeks. He would be sitting cross-legged on a chair in front of a small crowd, musing on topics like \u201cHow to Change Your Past\u201d or \u201cAbsolute Freedom\u201d. Virtual followers would watch and discuss. \u201cIt was a place where things made sense,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere we all shared the same language.\u201d After two years, Parry travelled to one of Bentinho\u2019s retreats in the US. She was as taken in person as she was online, and soon was spending long periods of time in Boulder, Colorado, where Bentinho and a core group of followers had set up an office on the main street. Wedged between yoga studios and coffee shops, they were building a movement called Trinfinity, whose core mission was to instigate a global spiritual revolution. Trinfinity proposed that the solution to life\u2019s most intractable problems were found through personal improvement and spiritual transcendence. If you were struggling with life, it was not because of the social, political or economic systems that govern it but because of a deficient or \u201cmisaligned\u201d perception of reality. Lasting change could only be achieved if an individual was able to \u201cwake up\u201d to their \u201ctruest self\u201d, to look past the distortions of the material world and exist in a higher plane of consciousness. Bentinho was the prodigious shepherd leading the community towards this enlightened state of being. He commanded respect because of his genuine knowledge of alternative spirituality. His mother, an elementary school teacher, and father, an energy company worker, were enthusiastic adopters of New Age practices. When Bentinho was just a boy, they enrolled him in a self-help and meditation program developed by an American electrician in the 1940s called the Silva Mind Control method, which was supposed to increase IQ and instruct in clairvoyance. This triggered in the already intense child a lifelong desire to find alternative pathways to making sense of reality. As a teenager, Bentinho enrolled in pseudoscientific human optimization courses like Neuro-Linguistic Programming and the Emotional Freedom Technique. He also took up yoga, meditation and Reiki. These interests set him apart at school, and he would later define this period of his life as a \u201cdesperate quest, filled with effort, judgment, self-torture and constant striving\u201d. But in Trinfinity, he found a like-minded community of fellow seekers. When he spoke, they listened. * * * * Initially the core community of around a dozen team members in Boulder were free to spread Bentinho\u2019s teachings however they wanted. Parry established a children\u2019s meditation camp. \u201cAt the beginning it was just a bunch of friends who came together with a true intention of real spiritual connection,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we just wanted to share that and go deeper into that.\u201d By the middle of 2015, though, Parry felt the focus begin to shift. Bentinho was spending a lot of time engaging online followers and was diverting more of the company\u2019s resources towards growing and monetizing his following. According to Parry, Trinfinity was spending up to $10,000 a month on Facebook advertising and releasing content in hierarchical tiers. Much of the online material remained free, but if a follower wanted access to \u201cexclusive\u201d courses, a subscription was required. A Skype chat cost $600 an hour. Retreats were held at luxury international resorts, setting followers back thousands of dollars. Bentinho\u2019s image was also changing from guileless spiritual seeker to a tan, buff health bro, a transformation intimately detailed on his increasingly popular Instagram account. The stream of images \u2013 Bentinho free-diving in Bali, posing in lotus position meters underwater; Bentinho scaling a sheer boulder-face, topless; Bentinho sharing a cocktail with a girlfriend \u2013 served as living proof that his teachings really worked. This \u201cepic life\u201d would be available to his followers, too, the Trinfinity teachings implied, if they just subscribed to the next lesson, watched the next video, or bought his book. The re-branding proved lucrative and by 2016, Trinfinity was bringing in \u201ca lot of money\u201d, Parry said. Still in his mid-20s, Bentinho relished the success. He bought himself a new car and took lavish holidays with models he met online. He also picked up a habit of smoking expensive cigars which, he claimed, could be \u201cbeneficial if you know how to attune your consciousness to the consciousness/spirit/information of the plant\u201d. Bentinho\u2019s success attracted newcomers to Trinfinity, too, who were more devotional and ambitious. One woman, who is still close to Bentinho, wrote a blogpost claiming that he was a \u201cspiritual prodigy\u201d whose \u201cvision surpassed Elon Musk\u2019s easily\u201d. On social media, community members depicted their life as a harmonious, carefree example of a fully conscious existence. But according to Parry, there were ever-present tensions and conflicts, particularly around money and online clout. She said Bentinho paid his core team a salary of $1,000 a month, occasionally handing out bonuses for extra work. \u201cHe could be very kind and giving, but he had this hierarchical way of paying salaries, which also felt controlling,\u201d she said. \u201cHe decided who got paid more and who got to have more prominent positions. It was supposed to be this equal community, but it didn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d Towards the end of 2016, a few team leaders held a weekend workshop to plan how they could scale Trinfinity beyond Bentinho\u2019s cult of online personality. Feeling betrayed, the young guru left Boulder for a silent meditation retreat in Thailand, after which he emerged with a grand new plan for Trinfinity\u2019s future. They would relocate to Sedona, Arizona, and work towards buying a plot of land where they would lead the planet towards global enlightenment by the year 2035. \u201cBen was saying, you know, you need to see me as your guru if you\u2019re going to be part of this,\u201d Parry said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to have naysayers around.\u201d * * * * While reporting this story, I spent dozens of hours sitting in my bedroom, laptop resting on a pillow, working my way through the vast archive of content that Bentinho has left online since 2010. I found much of the spiritual material inaccessible, requiring a repertoire for abstract concepts like \u201cinfinity\u201d and \u201cvibrations\u201d that I simply don\u2019t have. Some of his theories concerning extraterrestrial consciousness and \u201cinterstellar absorption\u201d were preposterous, though admittedly entertaining. But in some of his lectures, Bentinho reminded me distinctly of Tony Robbins, the 6ft 7in motivational speaker who has built a $500m empire by prescribing the secrets to a successful life. Like Robbins, Bentinho commands attention by cultivating a hyper-masculine persona, presenting an archetypal image of total control. The key difference, though, is that Robbins, who began coaching in the 1980s, came up through the seminar circuit, spreading his message in venues that have the energy of mega-churches. Through this direct interaction with attendees Robbins has, over the years, come to understand that his seminars attract a vulnerable demographic. Now, as a precautionary measure, Robbins\u2019 staff do thorough background checks on attendees, compiling \u201cred flag\u201d lists of people to watch over carefully throughout the seminar. (Robbins was recently accused of abuse by some former students, a claim that he denies.) Bentinho, on the other hand, has gathered his flock on social media, meaning that most followers experience his \u201clife transforming\u201d teachings as I did: all alone in their room, with no background checks. Lukas Jansen (a pseudonym) stumbled upon Bentinho\u2019s YouTube videos when he was 25, living at his parents\u2019 house recovering from a period of heavy drinking, obsessive gaming and panic attacks. He had already explored the writings of other self-help gurus, like Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti, but he found Bentinho more immediately relatable. In particular, Jansen was drawn to Bentinho\u2019s message of self-empowerment, the idea that suffering could disappear through force of positive imagination alone. \u201cHe told us that we are all the best and have infinite potential, and at those moments, I felt like I was in a bubble. I felt super happy, super energetic. I felt on top of the world,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cLike a child can go into his imagination and forget the whole world, that\u2019s pretty much what I did when I watched the videos. I could distance myself from this suffering Lukas with a very mediocre life.\u201d But the moment Jansen stopped engaging, the high would wear off and he\u2019d once again be faced with the reality that he was a man in his 20s living with his parents, rarely leaving his room due to crippling anxiety. To avoid the comedown, Jansen retreated further into Bentinho\u2019s teachings, sometimes watching up to 10 hours a day. Having waded my way through Bentinho\u2019s content, this level of dedication was perplexing. But Jansen explained that what really held him was this sense of manufactured intimacy that Bentinho cultivated. In some videos, Bentinho would spend minutes simply gazing into the camera, smiling, occasionally whispering \u201cI love you.\u201d Jansen felt seen. He would respond beneath Bentinho posts with comments like, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re the most beautiful spiritual teacher ever I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d I spoke to several other Bentinho followers, a diverse demographic, who described a similar feeling. In moments of extreme vulnerability \u2013 after being fired, during a divorce, coming off prescription drugs \u2013 they had gone online looking for spiritual solace, and were guided by the invisible hand of YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms to Bentinho. He told them that all they needed to improve their lives was to believe that their lives were good, and in front of the screen, with his unceasing affirmation, they could momentarily believe it was so. Though they never met Bentinho, these followers were the silent engine behind his spiritual movement. They shared his content, commented on every one of his posts, and were often responsible for moderating his Facebook page. They were repaid with new spiritual content from the guru. But the joy they derived from the videos was hallucinatory, dissociative, fleeting. When they looked away from the screen, they were once again faced with the reality of their lives. So they went back online. One woman told me that Bentinho\u2019s teachings gave her a dopamine rush: \u201cIt made me feel manically better. It was definitely like a drug.\u201d Another said that the videos allowed her to disconnect from her emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s all about pretending you are in a life in which you really aren\u2019t,\u201d she said. * * * * In 2017, Parry moved to Sedona to stay close to the Trinfinity community, who had become like family, but she stopped associating with Bentinho, unwilling to abide what she felt was \u201cincreasingly authoritarian behavior\u201d. But others, including her close friend, Brent Wilkins, remained loyal adherents. Parry met Wilkins several years earlier, at her first Bentinho retreat. A former tennis pro, Wilkins was tall, square-jawed and handsome. But he was plagued, Parry felt, by anxiety and low self-confidence. After the retreat, Wilkins, who had already tried sobriety, Christianity and Eckhart Tolle in his quest for inner peace, bought into Bentinho\u2019s teachings and online persona. He began consuming his content in large volumes and attending retreats. Eventually, he was spending long stints living with the Trinfinity community in Boulder. His friends outside the community felt that the more committed Wilkins became, the more anxious and dissociated he grew. At one point, his parents convinced him to move home and seek psychological help. But no matter where Wilkins lived, his teacher was just one click away. Towards the end of 2017, Wilkins moved into a spare room in Parry\u2019s house, preparing for the Sedona Experiment II. Parry had completely disengaged from Bentinho\u2019s teachings, which she felt were \u201cfull of shit\u201d. But she avoided discussing this with Wilkins. \u201cHe had Ben on a pedestal and he really believed the perfect image that he put out there,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to confuse him by shattering the illusion.\u201d On 4 December, Wilkins began the 12-day program. At some point during the sixth day, he quietly left the group and drove his Toyota to a nearby bridge that passed over a river some 225ft below. He parked, walked over to the ledge, and jumped, plummeting between the red sandstone cliffs to his death. As news of Wilkins\u2019 death spread online, it prompted a debate about whether Bentinho\u2019s influence played some part. This was compounded by the fact that three days before the retreat began Be Scofield, who frequently reported on cases of abuse in spiritual communities, had published an expos\u00e9 entitled, Tech Bro Guru: Inside the Sedona Cult of Bentinho Massaro. Scofield had moved to Sedona a few months earlier, attracted by its New Age history. By chance, in her first week in town she was invited to a Full Moon gathering where she met a number of core members of Bentinho\u2019s community. When they told her that their young teacher would be leading them towards \u201cThe Absolute\u201d her \u201cguru-radar\u201d was triggered. Over the next month, under the alias \u201cShakti Hunter\u201d, Scofield spent more time with Bentinho\u2019s community, carefully observing how it all worked. She liked the people she met at the various group meditations and ecstatic dance sessions \u2013 they were young, welcoming, free-spirited. But they also appeared to suspend their better judgment when it came to their teacher. One acolyte unselfconsciously told Scofield that they believed Bentinho could change the weather. As well as spending time with the community, Scofield trawled through Bentinho\u2019s online archive. Having encountered people that she considered to be manipulative gurus in the past, she came to the conclusion that Bentinho was using social media to build a cult-like following. She wrote a Medium post outlining her concerns, and on 1 December, posted it to Facebook and then left Sedona for Texas. In her article, which was shared hundreds of thousands of times, she levelled serious accusations against Bentinho: that he was verbally abusive to students; that he pushed some people away from family and close friends; that he traded freely in bizarre conspiracies. She also dug up archival footage of Bentinho saying that he had tortured a cat as a young child. For Scofield, this was textbook behavior for the manipulative guru, supercharged by the affordances of online platforms. \u201cTech bro Guru has arrived,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe OS has been upgraded. Cult 2.0 is upon us.\u201d Most concerning for Scofield was how Bentinho\u2019s teachings seemed to \u201cnormalize\u201d death. In one video referenced in her article, Bentinho says that because we all eventually die, life is about \u201cgiving up everything you have for the sake of the vision, to become the vision\u201d. In another, he tells followers not to fear death, but to be excited by it. (Scofield\u2019s article, according to her, was eventually taken down by Medium for violating company policy by uploading recordings of Bentinho and his staff without their consent.) Scofield was not alone in her concerns. According to reporting in the Arizona Republic, the police chief in Sedona had been notified about Bentinho\u2019s group. After Wilkins\u2019 death, he sent two detectives to pay Bentinho a visit at his house, questioning him about a video they found online in which he says, \u201cwake up to something important. Otherwise, kill yourself.\u201d Ultimately, Bentinho was not a suspect in Wilkins\u2019 death, which was treated as a suicide. No criminal or civil charges were ever brought against Bentinho or Trinfinity. Two days after Wilkins\u2019 death, Bentinho posted on Facebook expressing his condolences to the family. \u201cI am sad to never see your physical smile again, my handsome, radiant friend,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I feel your essence and its light within me, and I sense your newfound freedom.\u201d But according to Parry, Bentinho developed a stigma in Sedona. \u201cA lot of people were really hurting,\u201d says Parry. \u201cSomebody even shouted at Ben in Whole Foods, \u2018You\u2019re no longer welcome here!\u2019\u201d * * * * After Wilkins\u2019 death, Bentinho\u2019s name became associated with the label, \u201ccult\u201d. For some he was still a \u201cspiritual rockstar\u201d making enlightenment accessible for a new generation via social media. But he was also accused of being an \u201cInstagram douche meets cult leader\u201d and \u201cSteve Jobs meets Jim Jones\u201d. In April 2018, Bentinho responded to Scofield\u2019s article on Facebook, not addressing any of the specific accusations, but instead accusing Scofield of being a cult leader herself, \u201cappealing to all the dormant fears in those around the world who are part of one of the biggest cults on our planet today: The Average American Cult \u2013 indoctrinated by media, scared of just about anything outside of their own family home, and ready to pull a gun out on anyone they do not understand\u201d. Two documentaries soon followed, which explicitly explored the cult accusations. One, produced by the UK-based YouTube channel, Barcroft TV, splices together audio recordings of Bentinho shouting at followers \u2013\u201cYou are scared little toddlers \u2026 Fuck you\u201d \u2013 while playing footage of a woman breaking down on stage at one of his seminars. In the other, produced by Vice, Bentinho tries to convince a skeptical journalist that he can make it stop raining telekinetically. \u201cOnce someone in the media has labeled you a cult it\u2019s really hard to ditch that label. How do you feel about that?\u201d the journalist asks. \u201cWe are a cult,\u201d Bentinho responds, smirking. \u201cWe are a Curious, Understanding, Loving, Tribe.\u201d When I asked Parry and Jansen whether they felt that Bentinho\u2019s community was cult-like, they expressed ambivalence. Both acknowledged there were elements of authoritarianism and manipulation, but also had an aversion to the label. But for others, particularly family members of people who had become part of Bentinho\u2019s community, the term \u201ccult\u201d was preferred. Trish Wilkins, Brent\u2019s mother, was quoted in the Arizona Republic saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a member of a cult! He joined a cult there. We call it a cult.\u201d Another mother, Janet Smith (a pseudonym), whose daughter is still intimately involved with Bentinho\u2019s community, was also adamant that \u201ccult\u201d was the right term. \u201cSince she went on one of Bentinho\u2019s retreats she has not been the same,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cWhen I call her she gives weird answers and meditates all the time. She talks about 2035 being the time when the whole world will live in peace. I ask her what the hell she is talking about. She tells me: You have no idea! You are trapped in your limited prejudices about humanity. I managed to free myself from that. I have the overview.\u201d A number of former followers published articles online about Bentinho\u2019s behavior, including a one-time lover. She alleges that Bentinho would often subject her and other followers to \u201cdistortion readings\u201d, a kind of intense, unregulated therapy, where he would \u201cdissect\u201d their egos, tell them where they were \u201cout of alignment\u201d. This process was supposed to lead adherents towards an understanding of their \u201ctruer self\u201d, but the former girlfriend, who has since left the community, says that it left her emotionally shattered. \u201cAnytime I would express my own opinion, I was told it was my \u201cego\u2019s\u201d defense mechanism to try to survive. That the best thing I could do was to surrender to the death of my ego,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was 10 months of complete obliteration of everything I knew myself to be.\u201d Rick Ross, a noted cult deprogrammer and founder of the Cult Education Institute, an online resource that provides information about contemporary cult-like groups, told me that this feeling of being led away from yourself is a symptom of cult dynamics. Ross\u2019s definition of cult dynamics are based off the work of Robert Jay Lifton, a psychiatrist and historian who rose to prominence after studying the techniques used by the Chinese military to brainwash captured American servicemen during the Korean war. Lifton called this process \u201cthought reform\u201d, and Ross, who has followed Bentinho\u2019s online ascent, believes that his teachings act out elements of this process. He uses language that makes little sense to those outside the group but becomes \u201cloaded\u201d with connotations and meaning for those on the inside. He offers up his own \u201csacred science\u201d, a set of dogmatic principles that claim to embody the truth about human behavior and psychology. And he assumes the position of an omniscient leader with a \u201cGod\u2019s-eye view\u201d whose insight can, alone, guide others to an otherwise inaccessible truth. \u201cWhether or not he is meaning to do it, these techniques are designed to break down individual autonomy,\u201d Ross told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re exposed to it for long enough, suddenly everything else stops making any sense.\u201d What makes this most troubling, for Ross, is that the impact of Bentinho\u2019s teachings are not limited to those directly in his physical orbit. Any vulnerable person who might stumble on, or be recommended, his content online can fall under the spell. He compared it to fishing with a line versus trawling with a net. \u201cThere is just so much more scope now to catch new followers,\u201d he said. * * * * Over the past five years, we have heard stories about dejected adults being fed conspiracy theories, isolated youth radicalized by white nationalists, children incited to inflict violence by nefarious virtual characters. Within these narratives, social media are depicted as a vortex that algorithmically siphon us into homogeneous echo chambers controlled by ideological extremists and malignant narcissists. The internet, in other words, is a cult machine under whose influence we have all lost our collective minds. But Tara Isabella Burton, an academic theologian turned religion reporter whose forthcoming book, Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World, examines contemporary religious and spiritual expression, says that the history of cults offers more nuanced insight into contemporary life online. In the 1960s and 70s, she explained, traditional religious institutions began eroding in the west while the desire for spiritual nourishment remained steadfast. This led to what has since been called the Fourth Great Awakening, the first three referring to a series of fervent Christian revivals that swept through New England throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Unlike these earlier revivals, which were evangelical in spirit, the fourth awakening was characterized by an individual search for metaphysical truth that looked towards the east and the occult for inspiration. Conservative institutions and Christian groups reacted with fear and demonization, which intensified after the highly publicized case of the Manson family. But according to Burton, most of these new movements were not dangerous. \u201cThey provided a sense of meaning, a sense of community and ritual,\u201d she said, \u201ca way of participating in the grand metaphysical architecture of the world for those who otherwise felt left out of such an experience.\u201d Over the past decade or so, Burton added, the internet has broadened and intensified this dynamic. Online spiritual communities offer a safe and exploratory experience for those who feel marginalized, alienated or exiled from traditional religions. As in the 20th century, these new spiritual movements are often met with condescension and fear. But while the low-barrier-to-entry of spirituality online means that vulnerable seekers are at risk of being exploited by a larger pool of ideologues, narcissists, and charlatans, Burton emphasized that spiritual communities on social media are mostly just filling a void. \u201cWe still have the same spiritual needs and spiritual hunger for meaning and purpose and community and ritual that we\u2019ve always had,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the panoply of spiritual options online means that there are never-ending alternatives for almost everyone.\u201d Bentinho\u2019s online presence satiates this hunger for tens of thousands of seekers online. For some, he comes to engulf their lives. For most, he is just one of many characters in the feed, popping up between astrology memes, witchcraft wellness advice and political news, offering a moment of insight or some temporary solace, For Burton, the malleable constellations of spiritual experience we can curate signify a new era of pluralism. Gurus are selected not only because of their insight, but because their content is highly engaging. Long-term commitment to a single teacher or doctrine is no longer a requirement, and adherence can be as easy as \u201cfollowing\u201d and \u201cunfollowing\u201d. To be sure, Bentinho is just one minor act within this broader online awakening. Although he is no prophet, his rise does foretell something: the next great religious leader, when they arrive, will deliver their sermon not from the mount, but from the smartphone. They will find their flock online. * * * * For Lukas Jansen, Bentinho\u2019s influence started to recede when he learnt of Wilkins\u2019 suicide. On the advice of a friend, he began reading articles about narcissism, and over the course of a few weeks, he came to believe that Bentinho\u2019s spiritual movement existed only to satisfy his own fathomless need for admiration. In 2018, he quietly disengaged from the community and joined the Bentinho Massaro Recovery Group on Facebook, made up of around two dozen others who had come to see their former guru as a spiritual fraud. To begin, Jansen felt intense anger towards his former spiritual teacher, but as he regained a stronger purchase on his own identity, he saw things differently. If he once needed Bentinho, he now realized that the guru needed his followers even more. Jansen could leave, unfollow, start again. Bentinho was stuck in an echo chamber he had created. \u201cHe can\u2019t live without the reassurance of his followers now,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a cult, it\u2019s a cult of attention.\u201d Parry, who no longer blames Bentinho for Wilkins\u2019 death, has arrived at a similar conclusion. Bentinho, she felt, started out as a genuine spiritual seeker who became intoxicated by positive feedback online. \u201cBut I guess this is what a lot of people do on the internet,\u201d Parry said. \u201cThey put out a perfect persona and image without putting out, you know, all the hard stuff and how they\u2019re struggling. Without meaning to, they make other people feel like they\u2019re not good enough, that there\u2019s this gap between where they are and where they should be. And for people like Brent, for many of us really, it\u2019s just too much for the spirit to handle.\u201d Parry still lives in Sedona and is, in spite of everything, committed to spiritual self-actualization. She guides meditation classes among the red cliffs that rise from the desert floor around the town, where the Earth\u2019s spiritual vortices are believed to converge, amplifying the energy of whoever sits in their presence. Bentinho, on the other hand, has gone the opposite route. After Wilkins\u2019 death, he left Sedona citing an influx of \u201cominous\u201d energy. Then, after one final retreat in Holland in 2018, he shifted to an entirely online model of spiritual leadership. All of his teachings, all of his communications, all access to his person were, for the time being, fully mediated through the platforms. He became a guru in the cloud. I tried on numerous occasions to reach him for comment. I hit up his Instagram, his Facebook, his YouTube, a handful of email addresses. I called old acquaintances and got phone numbers that had all been disconnected. I even reached out to his mother, who responded that she would try to get in touch with him, but then ignored my follow-ups. Then, by the end of summer, I received an update from Bentinho on Facebook. It was a link to his \u201cnewest offering\u201d, a 25-week course called The Next Level. The website featured an image of an astronaut being sucked through a funnel of moonrock towards the light, as if falling into an endless abyss. Those who took the plunge and hit subscribe, Bentinho pledged, would experience a \u201cShift in Identity From Which You Can\u2019t Recover\u201d. This article was amended on 9 January 2020 to correct Lynn Parry\u2019s living circumstances when she first discovered Bentinho\u2019s videos. This article was amended on 16 January 2020 to fix an incorrect link.",

Lightly grease a 12-hole mini-loaf tin (a muffin tin will also work). Gently simmer the dates and prune juice for three minutes. Blend with the rapeseed oil until smooth. Add the honey, malt extract, orange oil and cinnamon, and pulse until smooth. Toast the sunflower and pumpkin seeds in a dry frying pan, then mix together in a bowl with the oats, almonds, apricots and candied peel. Pour in the date mixture and stir until combined. Divide between the holes in the prepared tin and decorate with seeds if you want them to look fancy. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn out once cooled.",

She has endured bouts of dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing from applying potent chemical straighteners, and regularly deals with distraught clients suffering alopecia and painful blisters after using dyes and lotions specifically marketed to African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI try to find out online what\u2019s in the products, but the government should be doing more to keep us safe and keep dangerous chemicals out of cosmetics,\u201d said Graves, 34, at a salon in Harlem. \u201cThere should be clear warnings on the labels, we need more information.\u201d</p> <p>The risks are very real. A new landmark study that tracked almost 47,000 American women over eight years has found that using permanent hair dye increases a black woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer by 45%, compared to an increased risk of 7% in white women.</p> <p>The more frequently women colored their hair, the greater the risk, rising to 60% for black women who used permanent dyes at least every five to eight weeks. Prior studies on the link between hair dye use and cancer had been inconsistent.</p> <p>It\u2019s not certain why, but several <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2018/05/toxic-chemicals-black-hair-products\">studies suggest</a> that cosmetic products specifically designed for use by black women and children contain more chemicals that disrupt the endocrine or hormonal system than products aimed at white women. Disrupting the endocrine system \u2013 which regulates reproduction, metabolism, sleep, tissue function and growth and development \u2013 can <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm\">cause</a> cancerous tumors, birth defects, reproductive problems, developmental and neurological disorders.

Manufacturers are not federally required to list ingredients on professional salon products.</p> <p>In the EU, at least 1,300 chemicals are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/22/chemicals-in-cosmetics-us-restricted-eu\">banned or restricted in cosmetics</a> such as shampoos, soaps, dyes and nail polish, while the US has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/phthalates-everyday-products-toxics-guide\">outlawed or curbed</a> only 11.</p> <p>The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, is the first to analyze the link between chemical hair straighteners and breast cancer since the introduction of so-called Brazilian keratin treatments, which contain up to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/brazilian-blowout-dangers\">11.5% formaldehyde</a>, to the global market in the 2000s.</p> <p>The researchers found that regardless of race, using hair straighteners at least every five to eight weeks increased the risk of breast cancer by 31%. About 74% of black women reported using chemical straighteners compared to only 3% of white women.</p> <p>\u201cBlack women straighten their hair to assimilate,\u201d said Amelia Govan, 31, a sales rep who as a teenager straightened her hair every month. \u201cWe have to fit in \u2013 you never see black women with braids working in corporate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s popular with African American women, who still associate curly hair with being ugly,\u201d said Graves, whose current salon does not use Brazilian keratin treatments on safety grounds. \u201cThat stuff makes you sick, it made my eyes and throat burn. It should be banned.\u201d</p> <p>Graves\u2019 mother has used chemical straighteners all her life and is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer; several other relatives have had the disease. \u201cI need to know what\u2019s in the products, as I\u2019m already high-risk,\u201d she said. \u201cMy clients are increasingly worried about the dangers.\u201d</p> <p>Breast cancer is an unequal disease. Almost one in three African American women diagnosed with breast cancer dies \u2013 a 40% higher mortality rate than white women, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/research/articles/breast_cancer_rates_women.htm\">according</a> to the Centers for Disease Control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d02ebd93ba86f5417cf4f364c22327e43f8df81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d02ebd93ba86f5417cf4f364c22327e43f8df81/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priscilla Graves at the Aicha\u2019s African braiding salon in Harlem, Manhattan, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priscilla Graves at the Aicha\u2019s African braiding salon in Harlem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Demetrius Freeman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reasons for the disparities are not fully understood, but black women are more likely to be diagnosed later, and with aggressive tumors. African Americans are also disproportionately exposed to high rates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/cancer-town\">carcinogens</a> and other dangerous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/our-unequal-earth\">chemicals</a> from polluting fossil fuel plants and factories \u2013 and toxic cosmetics. </p> <p>The global beauty industry is huge: in 2017, the cosmetics products market was worth <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/cosmetics-products-market-2019-global-industry-trends-share-size-demand-growth-opportunities-industry-revenue-future-and-business-analysis-by-forecast-2023-2019-07-11\">$532bn</a> and is expected to grow 50% by 2023.

      "bodyText": "Priscilla Graves is a hairstylist with 15 years\u2019 experience straightening and coloring black women\u2019s hair. She has endured bouts of dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing from applying potent chemical straighteners, and regularly deals with distraught clients suffering alopecia and painful blisters after using dyes and lotions specifically marketed to African Americans. \u201cI try to find out online what\u2019s in the products, but the government should be doing more to keep us safe and keep dangerous chemicals out of cosmetics,\u201d said Graves, 34, at a salon in Harlem. \u201cThere should be clear warnings on the labels, we need more information.\u201d The risks are very real. A new landmark study that tracked almost 47,000 American women over eight years has found that using permanent hair dye increases a black woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer by 45%, compared to an increased risk of 7% in white women. The more frequently women colored their hair, the greater the risk, rising to 60% for black women who used permanent dyes at least every five to eight weeks. Prior studies on the link between hair dye use and cancer had been inconsistent. It\u2019s not certain why, but several studies suggest that cosmetic products specifically designed for use by black women and children contain more chemicals that disrupt the endocrine or hormonal system than products aimed at white women. Disrupting the endocrine system \u2013 which regulates reproduction, metabolism, sleep, tissue function and growth and development \u2013 can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, reproductive problems, developmental and neurological disorders. The way dye is applied and differences in hair texture and absorption could also play a role. Hair products sold in the US contain more than 5,000 chemicals, including aromatic amines in dyes that can cause DNA mutations, parabens in hair lotions that are linked to reproductive and hormonal problems and known carcinogens such as formaldehyde, which are used in embalming fluids and some popular hair smoothing or straightening products. But information about toxic chemicals is not easy to find. Manufacturers are not federally required to list ingredients on professional salon products. In the EU, at least 1,300 chemicals are banned or restricted in cosmetics such as shampoos, soaps, dyes and nail polish, while the US has outlawed or curbed only 11. The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, is the first to analyze the link between chemical hair straighteners and breast cancer since the introduction of so-called Brazilian keratin treatments, which contain up to 11.5% formaldehyde, to the global market in the 2000s. The researchers found that regardless of race, using hair straighteners at least every five to eight weeks increased the risk of breast cancer by 31%. About 74% of black women reported using chemical straighteners compared to only 3% of white women. \u201cBlack women straighten their hair to assimilate,\u201d said Amelia Govan, 31, a sales rep who as a teenager straightened her hair every month. \u201cWe have to fit in \u2013 you never see black women with braids working in corporate.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s popular with African American women, who still associate curly hair with being ugly,\u201d said Graves, whose current salon does not use Brazilian keratin treatments on safety grounds. \u201cThat stuff makes you sick, it made my eyes and throat burn. It should be banned.\u201d Graves\u2019 mother has used chemical straighteners all her life and is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer; several other relatives have had the disease. \u201cI need to know what\u2019s in the products, as I\u2019m already high-risk,\u201d she said. \u201cMy clients are increasingly worried about the dangers.\u201d Breast cancer is an unequal disease. Almost one in three African American women diagnosed with breast cancer dies \u2013 a 40% higher mortality rate than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The reasons for the disparities are not fully understood, but black women are more likely to be diagnosed later, and with aggressive tumors. African Americans are also disproportionately exposed to high rates of carcinogens and other dangerous chemicals from polluting fossil fuel plants and factories \u2013 and toxic cosmetics. The global beauty industry is huge: in 2017, the cosmetics products market was worth $532bn and is expected to grow 50% by 2023. Last year in the US, consumers could choose from 2,727,847 lines of cosmetic imports from 177 countries. African Americans spent $473m on haircare in 2017, accounting for almost 9% of sales. But standards and regulations vary hugely across the world. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not required to approve or review the safety of cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives. In fact, participation in many FDA regulatory mechanisms, such as product registration and recall, is completely voluntary for manufacturers. In 2018, for instance, the FDA issued a warning about hair smoothing products containing formaldehyde, but was powerless to recall or ban them. The beauty industry says the onus should be on consumers, not manufacturers. \u201cPeople have been told that these straighteners are not a good idea, industry should not be held responsible if they choose not to pay attention to recommendations,\u201d said Ken Marenus, president of the industry group Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD). He insists that most US manufacturers already follow international standards, but agrees that regulations needs to be updated. \u201cThe current standards are ineffective and inadequate, and it\u2019s especially bad for black women because products marketed to them are the most toxic,\u201d said Janet Nudelman, director of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners\u2019 campaign for safe cosmetics, which wants American consumers to be protected like those in Europe. The congressional energy and commerce committee is currently considering legislation which would overhaul cosmetics regulation and could vastly expand FDA powers. The most ambitious bill on the table is proposed by the Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, and includes provisions designed to protect \u201chighly exposed and vulnerable populations\u201d including salon workers and women of color. The bill would immediately ban 12 toxic ingredients such as formaldehyde, parabens, lead compounds and coal tar dye, and includes federal money for research into chemicals linked to adverse health effects among women and girls of color and the marketing of those products, as well as support research to develop safer alternative ingredients. . In Harlem, consumers and stylists want more information, and better protection from toxins. Hairstylist Astou Sow, 40, who is originally from Senegal but lived in France before moving to the US, said: \u201cIn Europe they care much more about quality, safety and good health. Here it\u2019s mostly about business and money.\u201d",

If it is safe to get out, and if you receive an instruction \u2013 a text message \u2013 then you must get out. That is the only way to guarantee your safety.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s the immediate fire situation. </p> <p>In <strong>South Australia</strong>, there are two emergency warnings on Kangaroo Island. A fire is currently on the outskirts of the township of Parndana in the centre of the island, where evacuations are taking place. <br></p> <p>An emergency warning area is covering a large section of the centre of the island, with Parndana in the middle. An emergency warning also covers the township of Vivonne Bay. Fires are moving quickly on the island. Another dangerous fire day is expected tomorrow.</p> <p>In <strong>Victoria</strong>, people are being told to evacuate now in Bennies, Cheshunt South, Markous, Rose River, Top Crossing, Wabonga, Upper Rose River, Buffalo River, Dandongadale, Merriang South, Mount Buffalo and Nug Nug. </p> <p>The are also 13 watch and act warnings in place. Tomorrow will see fire risks raised across most areas, with total fire bans covering most of the north and east of the state. <br></p> <p>In <strong>NSW</strong>, there are still lots of fires burning, but none are posing immediate risks. The NSW RFS has issued 11 regional total fire bans for tomorrow as conditions are expected to worsen. </p> <p>In <strong>Western Australia</strong>, an emergency warning is in place south of Perth for parts of Baldivis, western parts of Mardella, and northern parts of Hopeland in the city of Rockingham and Serpentine-Jarrahdale shire.<br></p> <p>Australia\u2019s bushfires have claimed 27 lives and burned through more than 10m hectares (that\u2019s almost 25m acres). </p> <p>Take care and be kind to each other.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T08:14:51.582Z\">at 8.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e16d2328f085eda5c114c65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T07:17:43.732Z\">7.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Australian Academy of Science has released a video summarising some of the devastating, complex and widespread impacts of the bushfire crisis on Australia\u2019s native wildlife.</p> <p>Prof Chris Dickman, of the University of Sydney and an academy fellow, says: \u201cFor a lot of species with small populations or small geographical distributions, if the fire affects the entire habitat where they occur then they are at risk of imminent extinction.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx1WnWjo-yQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dx1WnWjo-yQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Australian Academy of Science has released a video on the ecological impacts of Australia\u2019s bushfires.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Have a look at my story from a few days ago for more on this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/04/ecologists-warn-silent-death-australia-bushfires-endangered-species-extinction\">'Silent death': Australia's bushfires push countless species to extinction</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T07:23:05.184Z\">at 7.23am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e16cd7f8f08c39722647610\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T07:03:17.017Z\">7.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest has been <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/mine-magnate-andrew-twiggy-forrest-blames-arson-for-bushfires-as-he-announces-70-million-recovery-donation\">talking to reporters</a> about the $70m donation from his Minderoo Foundation. </p> <p>And... oh dear. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/mine-magnate-andrew-twiggy-forrest-blames-arson-for-bushfires-as-he-announces-70-million-recovery-donation\">SBS reports that Forrest</a> said \u201ca large proportion of these fires have been lit by arsonists\u201d.

But he is worried that people who heeded warnings to evacuate last weekend will be less likely to follow those warnings again, even though calls to leave the area have been made on the basis of good information.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to be displaced,\u201d he says. \u201cI fear if they have left once and they have come back, it will be harder to move them [a second time].\u201d</p> <p>Spot fires from that fire have prompted emergency warnings throughout the day for the localities of Carboor, Whorouly South, Cheshunt, Edi, Edi Upper, the King Valley and surrounds. They are in an area south of Myrtleford where state forest becomes private farming land. </p> <p>About 92% of the Alpine shire is national park or state forests, and there are also plenty of pine plantations around Myrtleford and Bright.</p> <p>The worst-case scenario from the severe fire weather tomorrow is that a strong south-westerly wind will turn the long flank of the Abbeyard fire into a new fire front, and drive it north-east toward the townships of Porepunkah and Bright. They\u2019re about 20km as the crow flies through national park to Abbeyard.</p> <p>Roper says it is possible those towns could come under threat tomorrow, but his immediate concern was focused on Carboor and Whorouly South. Residents in those areas have been advised to leave, and tourists have been advised to stay away from Bright and the Alpine national park as part of the extended state of disaster declaration. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T03:57:05.456Z\">at 3.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e16a27c8f08c39722647563\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/luke-henriques-gomes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T03:48:41.222Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the issue of funding, the Australian Council of Social Service has called on the government to increase the disaster recovery payments people affected by the fires can claim through Centrelink. <br></p> <p>Acoss says the payments \u2013 currently $1,000 person plus $400 per child \u2013 should be boosted to $3,000, with an additional $1,000 per child.<br></p> <p>The peak lobby group notes that the rate of these payments has not risen since 2006.

So before we start, anyone in fire-prone areas should stay across their local warnings, follow instructions, and stay safe. As the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said earlier today: \u201cIf you receive instructions to leave, then you must leave. If it is safe to get out, and if you receive an instruction \u2013 a text message \u2013 then you must get out. That is the only way to guarantee your safety.\u201d Here\u2019s the immediate fire situation. In South Australia, there are two emergency warnings on Kangaroo Island. A fire is currently on the outskirts of the township of Parndana in the centre of the island, where evacuations are taking place. An emergency warning area is covering a large section of the centre of the island, with Parndana in the middle. An emergency warning also covers the township of Vivonne Bay. Fires are moving quickly on the island. Another dangerous fire day is expected tomorrow. In Victoria, people are being told to evacuate now in Bennies, Cheshunt South, Markous, Rose River, Top Crossing, Wabonga, Upper Rose River, Buffalo River, Dandongadale, Merriang South, Mount Buffalo and Nug Nug. The are also 13 watch and act warnings in place. Tomorrow will see fire risks raised across most areas, with total fire bans covering most of the north and east of the state. In NSW, there are still lots of fires burning, but none are posing immediate risks. The NSW RFS has issued 11 regional total fire bans for tomorrow as conditions are expected to worsen. In Western Australia, an emergency warning is in place south of Perth for parts of Baldivis, western parts of Mardella, and northern parts of Hopeland in the city of Rockingham and Serpentine-Jarrahdale shire. Australia\u2019s bushfires have claimed 27 lives and burned through more than 10m hectares (that\u2019s almost 25m acres). Take care and be kind to each other. The Australian Academy of Science has released a video summarising some of the devastating, complex and widespread impacts of the bushfire crisis on Australia\u2019s native wildlife. Prof Chris Dickman, of the University of Sydney and an academy fellow, says: \u201cFor a lot of species with small populations or small geographical distributions, if the fire affects the entire habitat where they occur then they are at risk of imminent extinction. Have a look at my story from a few days ago for more on this. The mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest has been talking to reporters about the $70m donation from his Minderoo Foundation. And... oh dear. SBS reports that Forrest said \u201ca large proportion of these fires have been lit by arsonists\u201d. Our reporter Christopher Knaus has checked the facts on that. The short version is that Forrest is wrong. The BBC has also been covering a misinformation campaign that has been spreading around the false claim that the bushfire crisis is the fault of arsonists. Conditions in the township of Parndana in the centre of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, look dangerous right now. People are told to leave if they can find a safe route out, or seek shelter immediately. There\u2019s a large emergency warning area centred on the township. More on the dramatic helicopter crash near Eden, NSW. A NSW Ambulance spokesman has told AAP that the pilot of the helicopter that ditched into Ben Boyd Reservoir at Edrom has no serious injuries. Three ambulance crews and an ambulance helicopter were called to the scene. A water bombing helicopter has ditched into a dam near the Bega Valley shire in NSW. The RFS has confirmed the pilot has escaped and an ambulance is on the way. More from the South Australian CFS media conference. The fire service says that 156,000 hectares have now been burnt on Kangaroo Island. And on Monday \u201c650,000 litres of product were dropped on the fire ground from 182 bomber drops\u201d. Some 200 firefighters are at work on the island, and 50 non-firefighter personnel. One reporter asks if firefighters have enough water. \u201cThey have lots of water on the island, there is seawater all around,\u201d authorities say. \u201cThe helicrane has been loading with saltwater from the sea. There is water there. \u201cWater is not the problem, it is the intensity of the fires. Large bushfires travelling quickly don\u2019t get extinguished by water. It is too intense. Much of the water just evaporates before they affect the fire.\u201d Good afternoon. Graham Readfearn here taking over our live blog on the ongoing Australian bushfire crisis. Thanks to Amy Remeikis, and to Naaman Zhou who kept things going. Here\u2019s a quick summary on the three emergency warnings currently on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Vivonne Bay township is under threat with residents being asked to follow the emergency warning and leave now or seek shelter if they can\u2019t get out. Playford Highway, west of the Parndana township near the aquaculture ponds on McHughs Road. Anyone there is also asked to leave if they can. Anyone near the Cygnet River catchment area, adjoining, and east of the Parndana Conservation Park near Parndana should leave if they can or seek shelter. South Australian fire authorities also say that tomorrow will be a dangerous day for fires. Rain is set to fall over Kangaroo Island this evening, but \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that fires will be extinguished by the rain and they will continue to burn\u201d. \u201cFirefighting operations will continue for some days on the island. All areas in the vicinity of the fire zones on Kangaroo Island are considered to be dangerous to people and we urge them to keep out of harm\u2019s way and heed the warnings. \u201cIt takes a huge amount of rain to put out bushfires of this intensity and of this scale. That\u2019s not forecasted.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s weather will bring slightly higher humidity, but still strong winds. \u201cWe anticipate difficult firefighting conditions throughout the day tomorrow as well.\u201d I am going to hand you over to Graham Readfearn for the next little bit. Please follow all advice in your area. Tomorrow is looking horrendous. Take care of you. Authorities moved to evacuate Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island yesterday, as a pre-emptive step. The CFS says the fires are \u201ctravelling quickly\u201d and \u201cwhat was safe this morning may not be safe this evening\u201d and for anyone in the fire zone to consider leaving. I hope everyone can see it\u2019s a very significant incident which we have resourced up to try and deal with. However, the conditions are such that it is continuing to present a significant risk to the firefighters who are working hard to control the fires, and to anyone else in the vicinity. I am pleased we took the step to evacuate Vivonne Bay. Regrettably, the fire\u2019s now threatening Vivonne Bay. That is an issue. But the firefighters are on the ground and they are protecting property as much as they can. I urge everyone to heed warnings, follow advice, and to head to the east part of the island, which is deemed safe at this point. Emergency warnings remain in place for Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island, Baladivis, south of Perth, and parts of East Gippsland. Tomorrow\u2019s fire conditions are expected to be dangerous \u2013 high temperatures and winds. Victorian authorities are urging residents in fire zones to leave now, ahead of the predicted fires. Via AAP: An emergency warning has been issued for a bushfire that is threatening lives and homes in Baldivis, about 40km south of Perth. Affected residents should leave immediately if there is a clear path, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services says. The blaze is moving fast in a north-easterly direction and the Karnup Road exit of Kwinana Freeway has been closed. The closure of the Eyre Highway \u2013 which has been in place since just after Christmas \u2013 is causing some food and product shortages in Western Australia. The Eyre Highway is the main road freight route into the west from the eastern states but has been closed due to a bushfire near Norseman. The highway is closed between Norseman and the Caiguna Roadhouse, and the roads between Coolgardie and Norseman, and Norseman and Esperance, are also closed. We asked both Coles and Woolworths about how this was affecting the shelves of their supermarkets in WA. Here\u2019s Coles: A number of trucks carrying fresh produce for our suppliers to Coles\u2019 Perth distribution centre have been delayed by road closures as a result of bushfire. We are diverting supplier shipments to rail where possible however availability of a small number of fresh fruit and vegetable lines have been impacted this week. We apologise to customers for the inconvenience and our team is working hard to ensure we can have all lines fully stocked as soon as possible. And here\u2019s Woolworths: We\u2019re continuing to supply our Western Australian stores with goods from the east coast despite road closures across the Nullarbor. We have been using alternate transport options to bring in products from eastern states, including rail, air and road routes through northern Australia. While stock is getting through via these alternate means, there are some impacts to the supply of fruit and vegetable lines in WA. A large amount of our fresh fruit and vegetable range sold in our Western Australian stores is sourced within the state. We thank customers for their patience as we work around these disruptions to the road network. You can track the road closures here. The United States State Department has issued a travel caution for any of their citizens headed to Australia: Exercise increased caution in Australia due to natural disaster/bushfires. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Exercise increased caution: The current bushfire season is one of the worst in Australia\u2019s recorded history. Authorities are issuing regular updates on affected areas. Bushfires may continue through March or April 2020. Tourists should consider postponing their trip to affected areas until the danger of natural disaster has passed. Authorities may issue evacuation orders to certain areas as conditions warrant. Even in areas not directly affected by bushfires, smoke is causing poor air quality. Smoke can affect people\u2019s health and it is important for everyone to reduce exposure. Check the air quality for your destinations and take precautions as needed. Consider postponing your travel plans to areas where air quality is significantly affected by bushfire conditions. State and territory emergency services in Australia provide up-to-date information on bushfires and advice on precautionary measures that can help minimize fire-related risks. US citizens visiting or living in Australia should monitor local television and radio stations, as media reporting may be the best source for breaking news on fire conditions.

Among the supplies headed to Mallacoota (via AAP): A pub with no beer is the last thing people need in the bushfire-stricken Victorian town of Mallacoota. Locals have made thirsty work of securing more of the amber fluid amid fears the town\u2019s drinking hole would run dry in a week\u2019s time. Mallacoota Hotel Motel arranged a last-minute delivery of 3,000 litres of beer with Carlton &amp; United Breweries, to be delivered on HMAS Choules. Twenty kegs of Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught, three pallets of VB stubbies, 36 slabs of Strongbow and Great Northern was loaded on Thursday. AAP has an update on NSW south coast communities still without power after the bushfires last week: Endeavour Energy plans to have power restored to all its fire-affected NSW south coast and southern highlands customers. The distributor expects to restore power on Thursday evening by either repairing damaged powerlines, or installing generators for customers where repairs may take longer. Endeavour said in a statement it was contacting 300 customers in isolated areas without power to offer generators where it was safe and feasible, or to ensure they had their own. \u201cThe final recovery of the south coast electricity network is a challenging effort that needs to be undertaken safely and methodically in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is also a massive job ahead to remove burned and dangerous trees in close proximity to the network. Thermal imaging cameras are being used to help keep workers safe.\u201d Not a lot of surprises from the Coalition MP phone hook-up this afternoon. Scott Morrison, Michael McCormack and David Littleproud provided an update on the government\u2019s response. They didn\u2019t rule out establishing a royal commission once the fire emergency comes to an end (expected to be some time from now) and updated the MPs on what the government has been doing this week, including the financial commitments. South Australian fire authorities are giving an update on the Kangaroo Island fire: That fire ran south towards Parndana this morning. That fire has been impacted by the westerly wind change and that is running to the east towards Cygnet River and along there towards Kingscote. We are hoping that we will be able to control that fire when the weather conditions abate. For the remainder of that, there has been a significant amount of work to control the eastern flank, and for the ground crews and the work they have done to stop that fire from breaking out in any other portions along that line has been an amazing piece of work and we need to be thankful for the work they have done. With a perimeter of 360km, it is extremely difficult to be able to hold fire when the wind changes. QUEENSLAND Livingstone Noosa Scenic Rim Southern Downs Sunshine Coast SOUTH AUSTRALIA Adelaide Hills Kangaroo Island VICTORIA East Gippsland Towong This is an initial investment \u2013 more councils could be added, depending on where the rest of the fire season heads. The councils which will receive the funds are: NSW Armidale Ballina Bega Valley Bellingen Blue Mountains Byron Central Coast Cessnock Clarence Valley Eurobodalla Glenn Innes Severn Hawkesbury Inverell Kempsey Kyogle Lismore Lithgow Mid-Coast Mid-Western Nambucca Port Macquarie-Hastings Queanbeyan-Palerang Richmond Valley Shoalhaven Singleton Snowy Monaro Snowy Valleys Tenterfield Tweed Walcha Wingecarribee Wollondilly On today\u2019s announcement of $60m to fire-impacted local governments, we have a bit more information: All funds will be drawn from the $2bn allocated to the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and this is in addition to funding that is automatically available to councils through other disaster recovery arrangements. The lump-sum payments will be delivered by the commonwealth by the close of business tomorrow to state governments who administer payments to councils. The only condition placed on councils is that they develop a program of works within three months and report back to the commonwealth in 12 months\u2019 time. Councils will be able to spend their $1m payments on projects and activities that they deem essential for the recovery and renewal of their communities, including: Rebuilding damaged or destroyed council assets such as key local roads, bridges, and community facilities; Employing additional local staff to take on specialist recovery or planning roles to help coordinate and plan the rebuilding effort; Hosting new public activities and events to bring communities together and attract visitors back to affected regions; and Immediate maintenance and repairs to relief and evacuation centres. Scott Morrison will be the guest on 7.30 tonight. Essentially, Victorian authorities are telling those in the fire zone to get out now, so if conditions do go the way they fear tomorrow, at least they won\u2019t have to worry about emergency evacuations. Think of Mallacoota, where it became about protecting lives, with 4,000 people sheltering on the beach because the fire became so big, so suddenly. So if you have received a text message, or any form of message, in that area, the advice is you leave, if it is still safe to do so. Andrew Crisp says the entire state is very, very dry \u2013 so anyone in Victoria is warned to stay vigilant as Friday\u2019s weather leads to dangerous fire conditions. Daniel Andrews on why the messaging has been so blunt: If I reflect on all the public messaging we have done over the fire seasons I have been part of, in lots of different roles, this is by far and away the clearest messaging. That\u2019s exactly what the Black Saturday royal commission told us we should do. The state of disaster \u2013 it\u2019s never been used before, it is unprecedented \u2013 but so too are the fires we face. We\u2019ve never had a fire ground or a fire edge as big as this. We have never had 1.2-plus million hectares burnt out in the first week of January. Never. So, you know, there have been fire seasons where there\u2019s been more land burnt out. But not this early in the fire season. So this is unprecedented. Therefore, we are using unprecedented language. And unprecedented powers to keep people safe. After all, that\u2019s the only thing that matters \u2013 keeping people safe. And then getting in, supporting communities through the relief effort, and then the rebuild and recovery. We will be there every single step of the way. Plan International Australia has put together a guide on how to speak to children about these fires: The How to talk to your kids about out-of-control fires guide, co-authored by child psychologist Karen Young, offers parents simple and practical tips on how to support children who may be distressed by fires, sirens and emergency personnel nearby or news reports on television about fires in Australia. Research from the Australian Catholic University has shown that between 7% and 45% of children suffer depression, anxiety or distress after experiencing a natural disaster. Since bushfire season began unusually early in August, children have watched on as more than 10 million hectares have burned and more than a billion precious wildlife have perished. To the people who want to stay and defend their properties, Daniel Andrews says this: People have a right to stay and defend their property. But the only way to do that is to have a proper plan. Part of any proper plan is that if conditions get so extreme then you abandon any hope of trying to defend your property and you leave. This is a difficult balancing act. People have the right to protect their own property. But they also, in putting that plan into place, they also have to, I would respectfully submit, have to make a judgment about, if this fire\u2019s so severe, if it\u2019s creating its own weather, for instance, if you have convection columns that are almost molten tornado, that is a different \u2013 that might be something that is well beyond the planning that you have done. Look, we can rebuild houses. We can rebuild sheds. But we can\u2019t be undoing the tragedy that can befall you if you find yourself in the middle of one of these fire zones. It\u2019s an absolute inferno. The intensity of which, the ferocity of which has been startling, shocking people who \u2013 even those who are veterans, have been around fire, in particular landscapes and communities for a very long time. The final point I make to you is this: people have the right to stay. But all the feedback I keep getting across the board \u2013 there are a whole bunch of people who stayed in East Gippsland, who stayed. When I sat and talked \u2013 there was a lot of tears shed, it was very emotional. They put it to me they wish they had left. This fire is of such an intensity it\u2019s, yeah. It is really challenging. Andrew Crisp, Victoria\u2019s emergency commissioner, has the same message. On the [weather] change, there is every chance we will see dry lightning. You could leave it too late because the road could be blocked. If you are waiting to see the smoke, see the flames, I\u2019d suggest you have left it to late. If you have the chance to get out, then get out. Daniel Andrews has a fairly blunt \u2013 but necessary \u2013 message for those people in the Victorian fire zone. If you receive instructions to leave, then you must leave. If it is safe to get out, and if you receive an instruction \u2013 a text message \u2013 then you must get out. That is the only way to guarantee your safety. I know that\u2019s a very binary message. It\u2019s blunt. It\u2019s not meant to impress anyone. It\u2019s meant to be the cold facts. And that is it is dangerous to be in some of these communities. We cannot guarantee your safety. You might be putting other people into harm\u2019s way. If you receive that message, follow the instructions you are given. Get out of those communities. Come to a relief centre. You will be well and truly taken care of. It is inconvenient, yes. But it\u2019s much better than the alternative, which is tragedy. We\u2019ve seen two people die, plus a Forest Fire Management staff member. Three deaths in the most recent period. We don\u2019t want to see any more people die. We don\u2019t want to be going to any more funerals. Follow the advice you are given. As inconvenient as it might be, it might just save your life and potentially the lives of others. Australia\u2019s prescription drug authority has announced asthma puffers may be sold without a prescription, if necessary, because of the poor air quality in many parts of the east coast at the moment: Salbutamol is an important medicine for the relief of respiratory symptoms associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases. Salbutamol in the form of metered dose aerosols (puffers) or dry powders for inhalation is available from pharmacies in Australia with or without prescription. However, salbutamol cannot ordinarily be advertised to the public, even the products that can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) from pharmacies without prescription. Smoke and increased air pollution from bushfires, which are currently being experienced in many areas of Australia, can trigger respiratory symptoms. However, pharmacies in bushfire affected areas may experience irregular stock deliveries and people evacuated from their houses may have lost their salbutamol medication or prescription for salbutamol. In this difficult time, it is important that people can be alerted to the availability of OTC salbutamol. Until 30 April 2020, the TGA has granted permission for pharmacies to advertise that: people with asthma or COPD can obtain salbutamol puffers or dry powder inhalers from a particular pharmacy; and people with asthma or COPD can obtain salbutamol puffers or dry powder inhalers from pharmacies with or without prescription if necessary. The permission also extends to salbutamol advertising activities conducted or facilitated by evacuation centres and other places dealing with displaced people. It also permits advertising that reminds people with asthma or COPD to, in the event of an evacuation, remember to take the following with them: any salbutamol medicines that they have, and any scripts they have for salbutamol. Issued for Vivonne Bay township near South Coast Road This fire may pose a threat to lives directly in its path. Act now. Leave, if the path is clear to a safer place, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive. If you cannot leave, identify where you will seek shelter from the bushfire. Heat from the fire will kill you. Do not enter this area as conditions are dangerous. The PLAYFORD HWY/WEST END HWY, RAVINE fire is uncontrolled. This scrub fire is burning in a southerly direction towards Vivonne Bay township, Harriet Road, South Coast Road and Knofel Drive. Conditions are continually changing. The BBC is also having to debunk the \u2018arson is a major cause of the bushfires\u2019 myths being passed around on social media, helped along by some ridiculous headlines and in some cases poor media reporting: For context, reports that arson is the major cause has made it as far as some Italian news outlets. We just heard from the CFA incident controller, Brett Mitchell, who once again, said the fires in Victoria are mostly the result of lightning strikes. The Australian Conservation Foundation has urged federal MPs to find a solution to Australia\u2019s climate policy paralysis which rises above politics. From Paul Sheridan: \u201cWhen nations have faced similar threats or when at war, leaders have risen above political differences to ensure the country remains resilient and united. That is what is needed now. \u201cPeople, all over, have responded, have come together, and demonstrated the true character of Australia. Now is the chance and moment for our political leaders to rise above and beyond politics to address the root causes of this bushfire crisis, not simply the symptoms.\u201d One of the big issues with the Victorian fires tomorrow is the very real threat that the wind, which will be coming from different directions, will cause two of the biggest blazes, in Corryong and East Gippsland, to join up. The CFA incident controller Brett Mitchell: That is a real possibility, absolutely. Particularly with the north-westerly winds and elevation, some of the fires could link up tomorrow afternoon. [continued from previous post] The Alpine mayor, Peter Roper, who runs his family cattle farm at Tawonga, near Mount Beauty, says he will stay and defend his property because \u201cmy livestock are my friends and I want to make sure they are OK.\u201d But he said that everyone advised to leave should do so, and families should take care not to pressure those who wish to leave into staying. \u201cIf we do come under ember attack, the sky goes black, you can\u2019t hear very well, you can\u2019t see very well, you are under ember attack so there are fires all around you. It\u2019s truly frightening,\u201d he says. \u201cIt looks like a sci-fi movie gone wrong. The damn thing creates its own energy and before you know it you have lost it. It\u2019s just amazing how quickly things can escalate and go from being something that looks relatively placid to something that is really difficult to describe, apart from being frightening and destructive. The Alpine shire has experienced a lot of severe bushfires \u2013 the 2002/2003 bushfires, 2006/2007 bushfires, and 2009 Mudgegonga fire that started on Black Saturday all burned through there. In each case, the fire burned deep into the national park and could not be put out until the autumn rains, which usually caused a flood. Roper said locals were in for a stressful few months. \u201cYou go to bed at night worrying where the damn thing is,\u201d he says. I\u2019ve been talking to Peter Roper, the mayor of the Alpine shire in Victoria. It includes Bright, Myrtleford and the Ovens Valley. Roper says his community is preparing to defend against the Abbeyard fire, a 60,000-hectare (150,000-acre) blaze that is burning in the Alpine national park and state forests between Mt Hotham and Mt Bulla. But he is worried that people who heeded warnings to evacuate last weekend will be less likely to follow those warnings again, even though calls to leave the area have been made on the basis of good information. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to be displaced,\u201d he says. \u201cI fear if they have left once and they have come back, it will be harder to move them [a second time].\u201d Spot fires from that fire have prompted emergency warnings throughout the day for the localities of Carboor, Whorouly South, Cheshunt, Edi, Edi Upper, the King Valley and surrounds. They are in an area south of Myrtleford where state forest becomes private farming land. About 92% of the Alpine shire is national park or state forests, and there are also plenty of pine plantations around Myrtleford and Bright. The worst-case scenario from the severe fire weather tomorrow is that a strong south-westerly wind will turn the long flank of the Abbeyard fire into a new fire front, and drive it north-east toward the townships of Porepunkah and Bright. They\u2019re about 20km as the crow flies through national park to Abbeyard. Roper says it is possible those towns could come under threat tomorrow, but his immediate concern was focused on Carboor and Whorouly South. Residents in those areas have been advised to leave, and tourists have been advised to stay away from Bright and the Alpine national park as part of the extended state of disaster declaration. On the issue of funding, the Australian Council of Social Service has called on the government to increase the disaster recovery payments people affected by the fires can claim through Centrelink. Acoss says the payments \u2013 currently $1,000 person plus $400 per child \u2013 should be boosted to $3,000, with an additional $1,000 per child. The peak lobby group notes that the rate of these payments has not risen since 2006. It would also like an $30m allocated to food relief community sector organisations to cover the increased demand over the coming months. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that the government plays its role providing adequate support to the thousands of people so badly affected,\u201d the Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said. Victoria police have just clarified their previous clarification on \u2018arson\u2019 numbers: We\u2019d also like to clarify some figures that have been quoted by various media outlets. This includes: 183 people have had legal action taken against them this bushfire season in regards to fire-related offences \u2013 this relates to NSW, not Victoria. 43 offences were recorded in 2019 for causing bushfires. Of these, 21 offences resulted in an arrest/summons (charge). This relates to offences in Victoria in the 12 month period ending September 2019. 12 people were arrested/summonsed (charged) in 2019 for causing bushfires. This relates to offences in Victoria in the 12 month period ending September 2019. (If you are looking for the difference, they have added in some extra information with the numbers) This emergency warning is being issued for Carboor, Carboor East, Carboor Upper, Cheshunt, Cheshunt South, Claremont, Dandongadale, Edi, Edi Upper, Hyem, Jarrott, King Valley, Markous, Myrrhee, Pieper, Rose River, Whitfield, Whitlands, Whorouly South. There is a bushfire at 8km east-south-east of Abbeyard that is out of control. The bushfire has crossed the Mount Emu track and is moving in a north-westerly direction. Leaving now is the safest option, before conditions become too dangerous. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. What you should do: Leave from Carboor using the Carboor-Everton Road through Bobinawarrah. Whorouly residents should leave via the Snow Road to Wangaratta. King Valley residents should leave via the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road. Travel to the home of family or friends that is away from the warning area. When you leave remember to take your pets, mobile phone and medications. Scott Morrison finishes his press conference, with this: It\u2019s a busy time. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. Tomorrow is gonna be a difficult day on the eastern states. Once again, I express my sincere condolences and sympathies to the families of all of those who have lost loved ones during the course of this terrible disaster. We will continue to remember them, but also their families in particular in what they need, in supporting them. But I would encourage all Australians to continue to follow the advice of authorities, to keep being kind to each other as the way you are. Thank you for your generosity and your support. All levels of government will keep working to ensure that we come through this together, by staying together. The head of the national bushfire response agency, Andrew Colvin, echoed those sentiments: Obviously the last thing we want is for government and my agency to be a block to funds, support getting to the people in need. But clearly we\u2019re working with these organisations, we\u2019re working with these very generous people, who are giving time, money and effort, logistics, products, and we\u2019re trying to direct that to where we think is best going to be utilised. On the ground, there\u2019s great coordination. Sure, there\u2019s lots of people doing really good work, but that\u2019s good coordination, that\u2019s a local thing. The message we have is let\u2019s make sure what we give is tailored to the community who needs it. As I said before, the fire-affected parts of Australia, there are vastly different community needs. So we\u2019re going to tailor this to the local areas. On the fundraising efforts \u2013 which have raised millions and millions of dollars \u2013 Scott Morrison says there is a need for fundraisers to work with governments to best direct the funds: If you are in a position where you have been raising money for the bushfires, and I thank you for that, first and foremost, and all of those who have supported you, then it is, I think, important to take advice from both the state and federal agencies about where you can best direct that support. Scott Morrison says the government has made some decisions on mental health funding (Labor has been calling for the Medicare 10-visit plan to be made unlimited as the fire crisis continues) but he is not ready to make announcements on that as yet. It will be made \u201cin the coming days\u201d. Councils will not have to tell the government what they plan on spending the money on \u2013 like they did in the north Queensland flood response \u2013 and instead can spend the funds on whatever immediate needs they see fit. Scott Morrison has taken a moment to thank some of the international allies who have stepped up to help Australia during the bushfire emergency \u2013 and singled out our Pacific neighbours for their immediate offers of help: I\u2019ve gotta say it\u2019s been of great comfort as I\u2019ve walked into incident response centres, whether it\u2019s in Mudgee or Albury, where I have been around the country, and you can hear the Canadian, Kiwi, US accent that is there alongside the Aussie accents, just focusing on the tasks. But the one that\u2019s been overwhelming has been the loving response from our Pacific family. The Vanuatu government provided $250,000 Australian, and it might not sound like a lot in terms of the tremendous assistance provided by many other countries, but from them, that was a gift from the heart. And the same has been true from prime minister Marape and Bainimarama. They have all been reaching out to Australia. They know how Australia has been faithful to them in their hours of need, and they just in their own way are trying to extend that in the best way they possibly can. We\u2019re very grateful for it. [continued from previous post] Yesterday Moody\u2019s analysts said the fires increased the chance the Reserve Bank will cut official interest rates, which are already at a historic low of 0.75%, to 0.5%, but Plank said his team was already predicting the move and the blazes did not alter their forecast. Plank\u2019s research found that major natural disasters have not in the past done much damage to Australia\u2019s economy on a national level, even though regional areas have seen their local industries devastated. \u201cDue to the magnitude of the area impacted, the current bushfires will almost certainly have a larger economic impact than previous fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recurrence of catastrophic conditions, the distribution of the smoke haze, the earlier start of the bushfire season and the coincident peak holiday period mean that a historical comparison can only be viewed as the starting point.\u201d He said the $2bn pledged by Morrison would not by itself be enough to stop the federal government achieving the cash budget surplus it has pledged to deliver in the 2019-20 fiscal year. \u201cBut bushfire recovery could provide the Morrison government with the political cover it needs to be more equivocal about the 2019-20 surplus target,\u201d he said. The $5bn surplus the government predicted in the December Mid-Year Economic and Financial Outlook \u201ccould easily be eliminated under changed circumstances\u201d, he said. The bushfire crisis could cut 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points from Australia\u2019s already anaemic economic growth figures, ANZ\u2019s chief economist says. In a new report released today, David Plank and his team said the effect could be felt over the final quarter of 2019 and the first of the new year. Growth in gross domestic product was just 0.4% for the three months to the end of September, the most recent period for which statistics are available. Figures for the December quarter, which includes the start of the bushfire season and a Christmas period that appears to have disappointed retailers, are due to be released at the start of March. \u201cThis is necessarily a best first guess, and it will be refined as more information comes to hand,\u201d Plank said. \u201cThis initial impact will be offset (to at least some extent) in later quarters, as rebuilding gets under way.\u201d He urged the Morrison government to spend more on rebuilding than the $2bn it has so far pledged over two years. \u201cWe think the support for affected communities during and following these tragic events, along with wider economic benefits that could be gained, justifies current and additional fiscal loosening, as required,\u201d he said. David Littleproud: It is important to understand we will work hand in hand with the state governments, as we have done during this whole disaster. There has not been one request that any state government has asked, in the operational management of these fires, that I have not approved. Some I have approved within a matter of minutes. Elgas has issued handling warnings for gas bottles for people in the fire zones, ahead of their evacuations, given reports of exploding cylinders in the blazes: For residences that have 45kg or larger home gas bottles or cylinders, here are five safety tips to undertake before the fire arrives or before evacuating: 1. Turn it off (in clockwise direction) at valve on top of the bottle. 2. Leave the bottle or cylinder where it has been installed. 3. Leave the bottle or cylinder in an upright position. 4. Ensure it is secured to a solid structure and on a solid base to prevent it falling over, with the Pressure Relief Valve vent facing away from building. The vent is the protrusion, usually with a dust cover, that is opposite of where the gas line screws into the valve. 5. Remove any combustible materials surrounding the gas bottles. Please ensure you: 1. Never move an LPG bottle inside a house or structure, as it can be a hazard to firefighters. 2. Never lay it on its side. 3. Never cover it with wet material to it keep cool. These materials may dry out and burn, heating the bottle/cylinder. When you return home: \u2022 Ensure all supply valves and appliances are turned off if safe to do so. \u2022 Do not attempt to start any LPG appliance, or turn supply back on, until the installation is checked by a gasfitter. \u2022 If your cylinders are heat- or fire-damaged Elgas will replace them without cost. \u2022 If cylinders have fallen or are upturned, do not attempt to move them, contact Elgas on 131 161. \u2022 If you can hear or smell LPG turn cylinders off if safe to do so and call Elgas on 131 161 or a licensed gas fitter. Stay well clear of the installation keep any sources of ignition away. Coalition MPs have told us they have been invited to listen in on a phone hook-up with Scott Morrison, Michael McCormack and David Littleproud at 3pm Canberra time. It\u2019s to discuss the government\u2019s national response. And also to assure them that the Morrison government is on top of the situation. The National Security Committee of cabinet will next meet on Tuesday. The government is also providing $60m to councils most affected by the bushfires \u2013 at least $1m will go to all 42 disaster declared local government areas, with the remaining $18m to be distributed to the worst impacted. Scott Morrison: I also want to stress this is initial and urgent. There will be more and that will be assessed but we are going to be disciplined and careful and consultative in the way we make sure that additional support is rendered into these communities. We want to ensure we do that in a proper and coordinated way that enables the support to get to the places that need it most. This will be commencing this afternoon with the government being in contact with all of those 42 councils to be communicating this decision directly to them and obviously to deal with any questions or issues that they would like to raise. Fires are closing in on communities in Kangaroo Island \u2013 there are some who are refusing to leave in a bid to keep doing their work protecting wildlife: Scott Morrison moves on to the bushfire update: Firstly, operationally, there are 27 confirmed fatalities and there have been, on this morning\u2019s reports to us, 2,131 homes lost. I am sure over the course of the day, as further damage assessments have been undertaken, particularly in victims the numbers will continue to sadly change and they will continue to escalate. Fire weather is increasing in the south and east today and it will spike along the east coast tomorrow. Over 1,600 defence reservists are currently assigned to bushfire operations around the country. In New South Wales and ACT, the focus is on re-establishing power to blacked-out communities, and there have been thousands of homes and customers who have been reconnected in recent days but there are still many without power. It is about getting emergency support to impacted areas and tackling the damage and risk to key infrastructure, such as transmission lines, generators and there has been a particular effort through the defence force of supporting what is occurring at the Eden woodchip mill. Naval assets remain off NSW coast to prepare with evacuations and to bring in supplies. With the positioning of these assets, the HMAS Adelaide and the Choules, we are a long way from the end of this crisis and this disaster. Scott Morrison starts his press conference with an update on Australia\u2019s position on Iraq and Iran: Our goal remains a united and stable Iraq and the focus of our efforts is encountering Daesh. And its support network also. This is the mission that we have been part of, as part of a broad coalition, and that remains our mission and we remain tasked to that mission as our people there in the Middle East are pursuing. We remain committed to carrying on this important work. As I said yesterday, our priority right now is the safety and security of Australians and, along with all other coalition personnel, there were no casualties or losses that were suffered there yesterday. The chief of the defence force and the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advise every precaution is being taken to ensure Australian military and diplomatic personnel are safe. As I have said before, Australia wants to see and has encouraged restraint and de-escalation and I welcome President Trump\u2019s statement overnight. We remain in close contact with the United States and our other partners, indeed this morning I was in discussions with the Canadian prime minister, Mr Trudeau, where we discussed this matter. I have been in contact also today with the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and we will speak again later today about these issues. There has been much contact between us and our coalition partners in the United States. It is very clear that our intent remains that the safety and security of our people has been maintained throughout these events and we will continue to monitor these situations very closely and remain as committed to the task that we have in front of us there, as so many, particularly of our defence force personnel and our diplomatic personnel. The greatest of all footballs teams ever (Collingwood forever, don\u2019t @ me) has made its own donation announcement. The club also purchased the 2010 premiership medal Dayne Beams put up for auction, for $27,500, to keep it close to home. David Littleproud spoke to PBS (the US public broadcaster) about the bushfires. He was asked whether Australia had prepared for this season, given the warnings of the impact of climate change: William Brangham: Going forward, climate change models have predicted exactly really what is unfolding: longer droughts, hotter heatwaves. They make the conditions ripe for these kinds of wildfires. Are you all prepared, as some here in the US like in California have been saying, that this could be the new normal for you? That these kinds of wildfires could achieve this level of intensity year after year after year? Are you all ready for that? Littleproud: Yeah well look, what I\u2019m most proud of in terms of our fire commissioners from all our states is the meticulous planning they undertook well before this event. When I became emergency services minister in June last year, the first advice I got was that the season was going to be earlier, it was going to be more severe, it was going be protracted for longer periods. They were right and they prepared and they collaborated with you guys in the northern hemisphere, and that\u2019s one thing that this has become, a global effort, and I think we should be very proud that we\u2019ve been able to work collaboratively. And our research and development has collaborated between the northern and southern hemispheres and our assets are, and the most important asset is our human capital, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I think that\u2019s where our continual R&amp;D in making sure that we\u2019re prepared for these events in the future, whether it be fires or here in Australia cyclones and floods, is world\u2019s best and we\u2019ll continue to work and make sure that we get our best science and the best science from around the world to make sure we keep our people safe. But the big part of it is about building back better. Building the infrastructure to a better standard to withstand bigger events in the future and that\u2019s what the commitment in terms of the federal government, working with our states in recovery will be about, is making sure that we look at it from every aspect, understanding how we adapt to a change in climate and how we do that better into the future in preserving life and property. Victoria police have emailed media outlets over the numbers being used in \u2018arson\u2019 reports. This email is to clarify some reporting that has been made in relation to bushfire arson related offences and charges in Victoria. While we appreciate media are seeking up to date and current statistics about these offences, it is worth noting that: Official crime statistics in Victoria are released every quarter by the Crime Statistics Agency (CSA). Currently, data up until the year ending September 2019 only is available. Data for the year ending December 2019 will be released in March. We\u2019d also like to clarify some figures that have been quoted by various media outlets. This includes: 183 people have had legal action taken against them this bushfire season in regards to fire-related offences \u2013 this relates to NSW, not Victoria. 43 people were charged in 2019 for causing bushfires \u2013 this is accurate, and relates to offences in Victoria in the 12 month period ending September 2019. If you have any questions about crime statistics, please contact the CSA: https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/ Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 1.30 in Canberra. Roughly 100 Papua New Guinean defence force personnel will travel to Australia to join the bushfire response and recovery effort after Scott Morrison accepted an offer of assistance from PNG\u2019s prime minister, James Marape. Over the weekend, Marape issued a statement saying 1,000 soldiers and firefighters from his country were standing by, ready to be deployed if requested by Morrison, with whom Marape said he had been in \u201cconstant contact over the last few weeks\u201d. \u201cAustralia is the closest friend of PNG and is always the first in PNG in our times of adversities and we offer our hearts and our hands to you in this time of fire-induced tragedies,\u201d said Marape. Marape\u2019s offer was one of several from Australia\u2019s Pacific neighbours, despite Pacific and Australian leaders frequently clashing over Australia\u2019s climate policy. Frank Bainimarama, Fiji\u2019s prime minister, wrote an opinion piece for the Guardian earlier this week urging Australia to fully commit to achieving net zero emissions. \u201cAll across the Pacific, our prayers are with Australia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut prayers alone will not turn back the tides of the climate crisis facing the world; for that, we need meaningful action.\u201d The $70m donation from Andrew and Dr Nicola Forrest will be administered through their Minderoo Foundation. The fire fund will see $10m given to immediate bushfire relief, another $10m for mobile specialist volunteers, and $50m for long-term planning for fire resilience. You can find more details here. The government has extended the recovery and restoration grants to the Break O\u2019Day council, for people who lost homes or businesses in the Fingal bushfires. Here\u2019s a little bit more detail on what tomorrow\u2019s fire weather forecast means for Victoria, from Stephen McGibbony at the Bureau of Meteorology. As on other significant fire weather days, the BoM has forecast hot temperatures fanned by northerly/north-westerly winds, with a wind change to a south-westerly later in the day that will be followed by a few hours of very strong, gusty winds. Those gusts could get up to 90km/h in elevated areas. A strong wind warning has been issued for coastal areas tomorrow, including the Gippsland Lakes and East Gippsland coast, and McGibbony said the bureau may issue a damaging winds warning for the Gippsland and East Gippsland coast and alpine regions. The fire danger ratings for Victoria tomorrow are lower than they were on Monday last week, when the East Gippsland fires destroyed dozens of homes and killed two people, and on Saturday, when dozens more homes in the north-east and East Gippsland were destroyed. But McGibbony said that did not mean the risk had subsided. \u201cWe are still seeing severe to extreme fire danger to parts of the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIn East Gippsland the fire danger comes out as very high, because there\u2019s a bit more humidity around. But it\u2019s still a very hot day with very gusty winds. It\u2019s still a significant day in terms of fire weather.\u201d In the last 20 minutes or so the town of Parndana on Kangaroo Island has been told to take shelter, with public alarms blaring, and the ADF reportedly saying they are under threat from flare-ups on the west. We\u2019ve just received a press released that a man whose uninsured house was destroyed in bushfires has won $1m in the lottery. The unidentified man from Redlands in Queensland, was told of his win after the Wednesday night draw. He said it was \u201cunreal\u201d. \u201cMy family just lost their home in the bushfires in northern New South Wales and it wasn\u2019t insured, so thank you very much,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go home and give my wife a big kiss and a cuddle! The entry was marked with her special numbers and now they\u2019ve delivered in a big way.\u201d The house in northern NSW was destroyed in during the ongoing bushfire crisis. \u201cAll that was left of the home was a few charred teacups,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we would ever be able to rebuild but now we definitely can!\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, has some suggestions on what should happen with mental health services during the bushfire crisis: In line with the advice of 28 of Australia\u2019s leading health groups who have called for this crisis to be treated as a public health emergency, Labor calls on government to develop a national response to ensure Australians impacted by the fires have access to health and mental health services. It should: Ensure access to medical care in bushfire-affected areas by: Increasing support for GPs and primary care; Allowing access to Medicare tele-health items in bushfire areas on the same basis already extended to drought-affected areas; and Working with states to increase access to medical specialists, including respiratory specialists. Urgently initiate a public health awareness campaign on the impact of bushfire smoke, as well as fund research into the long-term health consequences associated with more severe bushfire seasons. Improve mental health services in bushfire-affected areas by: Lifting the cap on mental health consultations allowed under Medicare; and Boosting funding for primary health networks and states to deploy trauma counsellors and other mental health providers. Prioritise the mental health needs of children and first responders by: Funding states to provide counsellors and resources to children and families in bushfire-affected areas when school returns; and Working with states to implement the recommendations of a recent Senate inquiry on the mental health of first responders, including volunteers. The National Rural Health Alliance is the latest medical group to call for climate change to be treated as a health issue: The Royal Australian College of GPs also treats climate change as a health issue Zali Steggall is talking about the Climate Act she wants to put forward in the next parliament (Sarah Martin wrote about that here) on the ABC. She wants \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d to cross the floor \u2013 and follow through on their promises. There were a number of members of the Coalition that held on to seats where there is a strong push from their communities for more action on climate change. Those members put forward a platform and made promises to their electorates that they would act on climate change. Now, if all they do is repeat the line that \u201cwe\u2019re doing enough\u201d despite the science telling them that \u201cyou are not\u201d, then you are not being true to your constituents. What I propose is we take the politics, take political parties out of this debate, it\u2019s been so negative in Australia for the last 10 years and put it to a conscience vote. Put it to each MP should represent their electorate. NSW Corrections media has said staff and inmates from the Illawarra reintegration centre have been helping to rebuild the Bargo dingo shelter, which was destroyed by bushfires. The shelter\u2019s gardens, sheds and showroom, which had half a century of memorabilia in it, were completely gutted. Two Corrective Services staff have overseen the 13 minimum security inmates clear the area and fix fences and sewer lines in an attempt to rebuild the shelter. A team of two Corrective Services NSW overseers and 13 minimum-security inmates have cut fallen trees, cleared debris and fixed fences and a sewer line as part of the project. From the statement: Dingo sanctuary president and founding director Luci Ellem said they greatly appreciated the group\u2019s efforts at the facility, south-west of Sydney. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the resources so it\u2019s been fantastic to have extra hands to help with the clean-up,\u201d Ellem said. \u201cThe correctional staff and inmates have worked really hard and I can\u2019t thank them enough. \u201cDingoes have a special aura about them and I feel they\u2019ve provided comfort to the inmates.\u201d The inmates also set up shade cloth to help the dingoes settle into their new pens. More information from the statement: The sanctuary is run by the Australian Native Dog Conservation Society, which was formed in 1976 by Berenice Walters to promote understanding and knowledge of Australia\u2019s native dog, the dingo, and its official recognition and protection as native fauna. If you would like to donate to the Bargo Dingo Sanctuary or help with the rebuild, visit dingosanctuarybargo.com.au for more information. It is believed that up to 1.000 beehives have been lost in the Kangaroo Island fires (along with hundreds of livestock). One of the bee populations under threat is the Ligurian bee \u2013 the last of the genetically untouched population lives on the island. You can learn more about the fundraising effort to save this endangered bee, here. Kylie Jenner has donated US$1m to Australian firefighters and those impacted by the fires \u2013 the ABC followed up with some of the recipients, which included Queensland, to help them prepare for future seasons. Kylie Jenner has donated $200,000 to the Rural Fire Brigades Association of Queensland, stunning its general manager who knew little about the makeup mogul and questioned if she had made a mistake. Justin Choveaux got the call from Ms Jenner\u2019s New York publicist yesterday morning, with the money being transferred today. \u201cThe first thing I said was, \u2018are you sure it\u2019s us?\u2019\u201d Mr Choveaux said. \u201cI said \u2018we are the Rural Fire Brigades Association, we support brigades and volunteers in Queensland, if you want your money to help people who have lost everything that\u2019s not us, we don\u2019t do that\u2019. \u201cBut the person who represents the Jenners said \u2018we are donating a million dollars, and we want $200,000 to go to rural firefighters in Queensland\u2019. \u201cObviously I said \u2018that\u2019s fantastic\u2019.\u201d There have been a lot of questions around this, particularly since we keep hearing we will \u201cmeet and beat\u201d our Paris target, in the midst of this disaster. Water contamination is still an issue in many of the fire zones and surrounds. Professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of NSW, Stuart Khan, has written on that today, for the Conversation. For those still wondering what a state of disaster means \u2013 it basically gives authorities more compulsion powers. If they tell you to go, you have to go. From VicEmergency: The declaration is made where the premier agrees there is an emergency that constitutes, or is likely to constitute, a significant and widespread danger to life or property. This declaration gives the Victorian government the powers and resources it needs to keep Victorians safe. It is the first time such powers have been used since they were included in the Emergency Management Act 1986 following the 2009 Victorian bushfires. The declaration applies to the local government areas of East Gippsland Shire, Mansfield Shire, Wellington Shire, Wangaratta Rural Shire, Towong Shire, Alpine Shire, and Mount Buller, Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Stirling Alpine Resorts. A state of disaster: may be declared to exist in the whole, or parts, of Victoria exists immediately upon the making of the declaration and remains in force for one month (unless another declaration is made) can be revoked or varied by the premier at any time. People in these areas must follow advice from emergency services. Do not travel to these areas and if you are in any of these areas, leave now if it is safe to do so. The community should monitor advice and warnings at emergency.vic.gov.au (External link) Daniel Andrews says he has not taken the decision to extend the state of disaster easily, but he believes it is necessary to save lives. I think people know that we don\u2019t take steps lightly. I think people know that we issue advice because our experts, the fire modelling, the bureau, conditions on the ground ... This is not a step that is taken lightly. It is a very serious thing to do. It was recommended after the Black Saturday inquiry. That royal commission said we needed this power. This is only the second time we\u2019ve used it. So once a week ago and extending it now. I think that any risk, as you outlined, [declaring a state of disaster even if conditions don\u2019t turn out to be that bad] is one that\u2019s worth taking because this is about keeping people safe, saving lives and making sure that the job of emergency services is just that little bit easier. I think this is exactly the decision to make and that\u2019s why I took that decision the other week and why we are extending the state of disaster for another 48 hours. Andrew Crisp says authorities are still conducting assessments of homes lost in East Gippsland. So far, they have made it to 2,800 property assessments. 244 homes \u201chave been impacted in one way or another\u201d. All up, Crisp says 400 \u201cstructures\u201d have been hit \u2013 that includes sheds and things like that. But there are still areas they haven\u2019t been able to get into because of the smoke and fire risk. The Victorian authorities are really stressing the \u201cleave now\u201d message. Andrew Crisp: We know what we have got in terms of fire and fire grounds, it is what we don\u2019t know. What might be the new fires which starts today. What, with the change tomorrow, if there is dry lightning and a new fire starts. Don\u2019t leave it too late. You might have a plan but because of dry lightning or new fires tomorrow, the roads could be cut. We don\u2019t want any more isolated communities or families, so get completely out of that fire affected area and move to major regional centres. Fifteen million dollars has been donated to the Victorian bushfire appeal so far, Daniel Andrews says. He says every dollar in the state\u2019s appeal will go to families who have been impacted by the fires. Victorian emergency services minister Lisa Neville says fire strike teams are being moved into place, given the predicted conditions for tomorrow: Victorians will again tomorrow face hot, windy, dry conditions, with a significant change that comes through at different times in the day but with significant winds, particularly over the fire grounds later in the day. As we said yesterday, the safest place to be tomorrow is not in those fire-affected areas. If you are unsure, we will be sending out alerts to people via text message and as we did last week and the Sunday before that, you will receive that alert which will indicate to you that the safest place to be is not in those areas and that if you can leave, you should leave. Based on the weather predictions that we have got today, all our agencies, so VicPol and CFA and MFS and they are prepositioning strike teams and assets into those areas where we have the most significant concerns. The Victorian emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, says there are 23 ongoing fires in the state\u2019s north-east region at the moment. It had been 12. They are not new fires, but they have split the fires up (in terms of names) to make it easier for people in the impacted communities to understand which are close to them. Of those 23 fires, 13 have watch and act alerts. More than 1.2m hectares has been burned since 21 November. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says the state of disaster declaration will remain in place for at least another 48 hours, after receiving a briefing on the weather conditions for the next two days. It\u2019s always difficult to predict how challenging the next couple of days will be but with so much fire in the landscape with such a massive fire edge, with hot weather and significant winds, there\u2019s every reason to think we are going to have more fire today and, of course, tomorrow and potentially right into the weekend. This is a really significant challenge for us. We don\u2019t underestimate it. We don\u2019t lightly extend the state of disaster. We have done it because we believe that it will save lives and that, after all, is the most important thing. The Australia Institute has done some polling on what sort of response people want in terms of the climate emergency. \u2013 Two in three Australians (66%) agree that Australia is facing a climate change emergency and should take emergency action. Only one in four Australians (23%) disagree. \u2013 Two in three Australians (63%) agree that governments should mobilise all of society to tackle climate change, like they did during the world wars. \u2013 A majority of Coalition (56%), Labor (74%) and Greens voters (80%) agree that governments should mobilise all of society to tackle climate change. And here was the method, for those wondering: \u201cThe Australia Institute conducted a national survey of 1,424 people between 1 and 15 November 2019, online through Dynata with nationally representative samples by gender, age, state and territory, and household income. The margin of error (95% confidence level) for the national results is 2.6%. Results are shown only for larger states.\u201d The road to Corryong has been reopened \u2013 but only for residents. And it could close at anytime. From VicEmergency: Murray Valley Highway from Bullioh to Corryong For access past the Traffic Management Points, residents must provide photo ID and proof of residency for access to Corryong. The Murray Valley Highway will be open between 7.00am to 8.00pm each day. The road will be closed at 8.00pm each day at Bullioh and Corryong. You will not be able to return after this time. It is unsafe to drive on this road at night. This road is subject to closure at any time based on fire risk or operational activity. Canberra is still suffering from hazardous air quality (it is not so bad now but last night the smoke came rolling through again). The ACT health minister has put out this update: You\u2019ll find that website, here AAP has an update on the Kangaroo Island fire, which has seen authorities preemptively evacuate Vivonne Bay: As a precaution, police and the Country Fire Service evacuated the town of Vivonne Bay on the south coast amid fears homes could not be protected should the fire move quickly into the area. Made up of mostly holiday shacks, it\u2019s thought less than 100 people live there at any given time. Police went door to door, calling on residents to head for Kingscote or Penneshaw, but some still chose to stay. Those who left will not be allowed to return until Friday, but only if it is then deemed safe. We have had a few questions about the Volunteers Fire Fighters Association in recent days, so Chris Knaus has taken a look. This is what he has found: A small volunteer firefighting association that disputes the link between climate change and the current bushfires has close ties to the New South Wales Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party and diverted thousands of dollars from its meagre finances to bankroll a bid by its president to run as an SFF candidate in the NSW election. The Volunteer Fire Fighters Association has been quoted extensively in the media during the bushfire crisis, particularly on Sky News and in the Australian, downplaying the links to climate change, attacking the group of ex-fire and emergency chiefs who have called for climate action, and placing blame for the fires chiefly on a lack of hazard reduction burning and poor land management. The VFFA, which splintered from NSW\u2019s main volunteer firefighting representative body in 2004, has repeatedly refused to say how many members it has, and recently drew the ire of the RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, who called it a \u201chighly politically charged\u201d group with unclear motivations that had failed to reveal \u201cwho they claim to represent, how many they represent, and how they operate\u201d. The Guardian can now reveal the group\u2019s close links to the SFF party, whose leader Robert Borsak frequently disputes that humans are causing climate change and similarly blames the fires on a lack of hazard reduction burning. Zali Steggall is pushing for a climate change act \u2013 and she is targeting \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d to cross the floor to make it a reality. From Sarah Martin: The independent MP Zali Steggall is calling on self-styled \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d to support legislation to establish a new climate change framework, warning them to ignore the views of their constituents \u201cat their peril\u201d. Steggall, who toppled Tony Abbott in the Sydney seat of Warringah at the May 2019 election, largely on a platform of climate change action, is finalising draft legislation for a \u201cnational climate change framework\u201d that sets out a roadmap for Australia to transition to a decarbonised economy. The legislation is modelled on the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act, passed in 2008, and mirrors framework laws in place in New Zealand and Ireland. Germany and Fiji are considering similar draft legislation. Adam Morton has had a look at Australia\u2019s 2019 temperatures. It is not good news. More than three-quarters of the Australian continent experienced the worst fire weather conditions on record last month as 2019 set new benchmarks for heat and dryness across the country. Nearly all of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, most of the Northern Territory, significant parts of Victoria including east Gippsland and populated areas in south-western Western Australia and north-eastern Tasmania set new records for accumulated fire risk for December, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Most of the rest of the country, including southern Victoria and Tasmania, had scores on the forest fire danger index that were \u201cvery much above average\u201d \u2013 in the worst 10% recorded. Firefighting efforts have received an extra $166m since the fire season began. Gladys Berejiklian: We said to the commissioner, to Commissioner Fitzsimmons, do what you need to do and we\u2019ll pay it. We have made sure people have access to the resources needed. In total, this fire season alone, the New South Wales government\u2019s already provided $231m in support, including the extra money to firefighting efforts but also includes our distribution towards the clean-up costs and our contribution towards direct payments to those who\u2019ve lost everything and are directly impacted. Gladys Berejiklian says the government is committing $1bn to rebuilding after the fires, which frees up the money the federal government is providing from its $2bn recovery fund to go in direct payments to those who have been impacted. Scott Morrison is in Canberra today as cabinet\u2019s national security committee meets to discuss Iran and Iraq. The Labor shadow cabinet will be meeting in Adelaide. This short clip from Scott Morrison\u2019s trip to Kangaroo Island yesterday is doing the rounds on social media. To be fair, he had just been informed about the Iraq situation while in the air. Dick Lang and his son Dr Clayton Lang were found in their car on the Playford Highway at Gosse on Saturday, after trying to escape what was described as a \u201cvirtually unstoppable\u201d fire, devastating the Kangaroo Island community. Good morning. We start the day with residents in Victoria\u2019s firezone being told to leave now, as temperatures begin their climb back to dangerous levels. An emergency warning was issued on Thursday morning for Bobinawarrah, Carboor, Kneebones Gap, Whorouly, Whorouly East and Whorouly South. Heavy ember attacks are being reported. We haven\u2019t had an emergency level warning since earlier this week. Tomorrow is still the next really worrying day, with authorities warning all week that Friday\u2019s conditions were going to be dangerous, with high temperatures and unpredictable winds. In South Australia, Vivonne Bay in Kangaroo Island is being evacuated. The weather bureau has officially reported last year was Australia\u2019s hottest on record, with temperatures 1.5 degrees above average. The NSW RFS has also released an update We\u2019ll bring you the day\u2019s events, as they happen.",

An estimated 11,000 firms failed to pay the minimum wage in 2018-19, according to analysis of official figures by the Resolution Foundation thinktank.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of bosses who pay workers less than the minimum wage are getting away with breaking the law, with only one in eight caught by government inspectors, research shows. There has been a sharp rise in the number of low-paid workers cheated of wages. An estimated 11,000 firms failed to pay the minimum wage in 2018-19, according to analysis of official figures by the Resolution Foundation thinktank. However, HM Revenue and Customs inspectors identified only 1,456 of the lawbreakers and there are fears an inflation-busting rise in the minimum rate in April may tempt more employers to break the rules. About one in five workers aged over 24 was paid below the legal minimum in 2016, but that rose to one in four last year with about 365,000 people missing out. People working for small firms such as hair salons and carwashes are most vulnerable to being underpaid, described by unions as \u201cwage theft\u201d, but it is estimated that around 140,000 workers for companies with more than 249 employees were also underpaid in April 2018. Bristol City Football Club, Wyvale Garden Centres, Costa Coffee and Odeon cinemas were among those caught failing to pay workers enough in 2018. Lindsay Judge, a senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said there had been \u201ca worrying rise in minimum wage underpayment\u201d. \u201cAs the government plans to increase the legal wage floor, it is essential to strengthen the incentives for firms to comply,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government can act today by encouraging HMRC to take a tougher line with minimum wage offenders, and being given the power to levy larger financial penalties.\u201d The minimum hourly wage for workers aged over 24 will rise 6.2% to \u00a38.72 per hour in April.

Carter is only the seventh cricketer, and the first Kiwi, to achieve the feat \u2013 others include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5re1bjfGM\">Yuvraj Singh\u2019s brutal dismantling of Stuart Broad</a> at the 2007 T20 World Cup and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8h0uAYRyw\">Hazratullah Zazai picking off Abdullah Mazari</a> in the 2018 Afghanistan Premier League.</p> <p>2) The last great heist of the 2010s \u2013 Ugandan teenager Jacob Kiplimo is breezing to victory and a new course record at the 15km San Silvestre de Sao Paulo road race, but eases off as the line approaches. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSIkedkw7XQ\">Enter Kenya\u2019s Kibiwott Kandie</a> \u2026 There\u2019s plenty in the celebrating too early stakes, such as Ben Payne branding himself No 1 at the Atlanta Peachtree 10k in 2015 \u2013 just as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FmjJgSMBuE&amp;t=21s\">Britain\u2019s Scott Overall was relegating him to second place</a>. </p> <p>Back in 1980, Steve Ovett\u2019s cockiness was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDCYrlN3UeQ&amp;t=2m30s\">rightly punished by John Treacy</a> \u2013 and here\u2019s more complacency punished, as Heather Dorniden falls flat on her face in the 600m Big 10 Indoor Championship <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UF82nysIU\">and still roars back to win</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRa7mQg73Eg\">here\u2019s a 4x400m relay</a> in which some got their tactics hopelessly wrong, and others spot-on: check out how Irish runner Phil Healy times her run to come from nowhere in the final 200m.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UF82nysIU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/70UF82nysIU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>3) More finish-line theft at last month\u2019s Paddy Power Chase at Leopardstown, as Plan of Attack is reeled in by Fitzhenry, before <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RacingTV/status/1210579133396324353\">Roaring Bull enters the picture by the line</a> to test the upper echelons of commentator Jerry Hannon\u2019s vocal range. On two wheels, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2017/may/10/luka-pibernik-celebrates-giro-ditalia-stage-win-6km-early-video\">Luka Pibernik raising his arms a lap too early at the 2017 Giro d\u2019Italia</a> is an all-time classic.</p> <p>4) Another finish line, but drama of a different kind as Croatia\u2019s Filip Zubcic ends a decent giant slalom run at the World Cup in Italy, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurosport_UK/status/1208727297584447500\">narrowly avoids colliding with an official who was meandering across the course</a>.</p> <p>5) Purple reigns! The colourful Peter Wright rose above the world No 1, Michael van Gerwen, to win his first PDC world darts championship last week. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXY0fbS0NxQ\">his stunning final performance in full</a>, and here he is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96ub-LZAGRg\">rocking a very different look</a> in the crowd for the 1995 BDO Winmau World Masters. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOmdv_zwZ9c\">his first taste of the world stage against Richie Burnett</a> the same year, and several <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPlGOqHsgDY\">more hairstyles, hanging with chickens</a> and interesting trinkets can be found in this clip meeting the dartist at home.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOmdv_zwZ9c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AOmdv_zwZ9c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>6) Gennaro Gattuso is 42 today \u2013 here\u2019s Milan\u2019s former midfield general with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT6ezfSsJnE\">a stellar finish and even better celebration</a> against Palermo in 2005.

      "bodyText": "1) Let\u2019s start with a bang, as Leo Carter slams six sixes in an over for Canterbury Kings against Northern Knights in the T20 Super Smash, on his way to an unbeaten 70 from 29 balls. Carter is only the seventh cricketer, and the first Kiwi, to achieve the feat \u2013 others include Yuvraj Singh\u2019s brutal dismantling of Stuart Broad at the 2007 T20 World Cup and Hazratullah Zazai picking off Abdullah Mazari in the 2018 Afghanistan Premier League. 2) The last great heist of the 2010s \u2013 Ugandan teenager Jacob Kiplimo is breezing to victory and a new course record at the 15km San Silvestre de Sao Paulo road race, but eases off as the line approaches. Enter Kenya\u2019s Kibiwott Kandie \u2026 There\u2019s plenty in the celebrating too early stakes, such as Ben Payne branding himself No 1 at the Atlanta Peachtree 10k in 2015 \u2013 just as Britain\u2019s Scott Overall was relegating him to second place. Back in 1980, Steve Ovett\u2019s cockiness was rightly punished by John Treacy \u2013 and here\u2019s more complacency punished, as Heather Dorniden falls flat on her face in the 600m Big 10 Indoor Championship and still roars back to win. And here\u2019s a 4x400m relay in which some got their tactics hopelessly wrong, and others spot-on: check out how Irish runner Phil Healy times her run to come from nowhere in the final 200m. 3) More finish-line theft at last month\u2019s Paddy Power Chase at Leopardstown, as Plan of Attack is reeled in by Fitzhenry, before Roaring Bull enters the picture by the line to test the upper echelons of commentator Jerry Hannon\u2019s vocal range. On two wheels, meanwhile, Luka Pibernik raising his arms a lap too early at the 2017 Giro d\u2019Italia is an all-time classic. 4) Another finish line, but drama of a different kind as Croatia\u2019s Filip Zubcic ends a decent giant slalom run at the World Cup in Italy, and narrowly avoids colliding with an official who was meandering across the course. 5) Purple reigns! The colourful Peter Wright rose above the world No 1, Michael van Gerwen, to win his first PDC world darts championship last week. Here\u2019s his stunning final performance in full, and here he is rocking a very different look in the crowd for the 1995 BDO Winmau World Masters.

Demand for the retailer\u2019s women\u2019s and men\u2019s cashmere jumpers was up 15% and 40%, respectively. \u201cPeople are buying into higher value products and experiential things,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe sold more cashmere than ever before which could be a symbol of people moving away from lower priced goods into something that has got longevity and value.\u201d By comparison, sales in its food halls were up 1.4% as shoppers responded to new ranges and lower prices. Sales rose 4% over the all-important holiday fortnight but the retailer bought too much of seasonal lines such as mince pies, leading to waste \u2013 although the surplus was diverted to local charities, including food banks, through its partnership with the Neighbourly app. The food business\u2019s stock issues affected the retailer\u2019s profit margins, which it said would now be at the bottom end of analysts\u2019 expectations. M&amp;S shares, which were relegated from the FTSE 100 index last year, closed down 11% at 194.4p. The GlobalData analyst Kate Ormrod said it was clear M&amp;S \u201cremains unable to excite shoppers enough to buy\u201d. She added: \u201cCalling out competitor discounting in December as a reason for underperformance is somewhat feeble given how predictable stronger promotional activity was after such a challenging 2019.\u201d There were \u201csilver linings\u201d within the results, she said, highlighting the good performance from food, which helped nudge underlying UK sales for the group into positive territory \u2013 up 0.2% in the three months to 28 December. Clive Black, an analyst at M&amp;S\u2019s house broker Shore Capital, said: \u201cM&amp;S is maybe entering one step forward, one step back territory, which is much better than one step forward, three steps back of old. If so, brighter times could be ahead, particularly if a more certain and confident UK shopper emerges after the election.\u201d",

He was the only signing made while Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier were joint managers., 3:C - \u201cIt was in a Tesco in Sheffield that I reached my lowest point,\u201d said Baardsen in 2008. \u201cI went into Neil Warnock's office to negotiate my wages and he offered me less than what a tube driver earns. I turned it down. I was young and had my life to lead, and that didn't have to be in football.\u201d, 4:A - The Sheffield Wednesday midfielder was in fact the closest player to his teammate when the fateful shove took place., 5:B - The eco-friendly playmaker escaped punishment, though, and was back in the starting lineup for the next game, 6:C - Chelsea's Tor Andre, former Sheffield United striker Jostein, and future Wolves man Havard all made the cut, 7:A - Berg\u2019s 100 caps put him third on the all-time list behind Thorbj\u00f8rn Svenssen and John Arne Riise., 8:D - Hege Fr\u00f8seth was the goalkeeper in the Norwegian handball team that took silver at Barcelona 1992, 9:C - Although a goalkeeping-glove-shaped extension would probably have been more fun. , 10:D - Solskj\u00e6r scored more goals \u2013 23 in 67 internationals \u2013 than the other three but never scored three in a game. Halle did so against San Marino in a 10-0 win in 1992, while Leonhardsen bagged all three in a 3-0 away win over Bermuda in the same year., 11:B - \u201cVidar was here for three months after I arrived and was sub a couple of times but he wanted to go home,\u201d said Luton manager Lennie Lawrence of Riseth\u2019s brief loan spell at Kenilworth Road in 1995-96. \u201cThe players didn\u2019t like him, and he didn\u2019t like them. There was no chance of it working.\u201d, 12:B - \u201cSeriously, I don't know who he is,\u201d added Ronald Zubar of the former Copenhagen and Cologne manager. \u201cThe man is a winner,\u201d cheered Wolves chairman Steve Morgan. Solbakken lasted eight months at the club, his biggest impact at Molineux the hole he punched in a dugout during a game against Brighton., 13:A - Ronny Johnsen, Henning Berg and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r all featured for Egil Olsen\u2019s side. Tottenham and Liverpool both had two, while Leeds, Everton, Southampton and Chelsea had one, 14:A - As an 18-year-old, Flo came second in a youth tournament having jumped 2.06m, a mere 16cm shy of Terje Totland\u2019s national record and a jump that placed him inside the top 30 on the Norwegian all-time list., 15:C - These days Brattbakk is a pilot. \u201cAs achievements go, that was definitely the highlight of my career,\u201d he says. The stakes were so incredibly high and every time I look back on that day, I\u2019m just so happy to have been a part of it. Flying is great, but you can never compete with the kind of joy football gives you on days like that.\u201d</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"16\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Incredible.

Cities are leading the way: Amsterdam has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43113760\" title=\"\">cut child obesity by 12%</a> through city-wide policies to discourage unhealthy eating, and in Copenhagen \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150324-how-to-get-a-city-cycling\" title=\"\">the majority of adults cycle to work</a> and the food culture centres on dishes which are healthy, sustainable and delicious.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson finds hope in data showing that veganism is becoming more popular (increasing by 350% since 2006 in the UK) and, as sales of raw ingredients rise, more people are returning to home cooking. Her book is both an urgent plea to reject ultra-processed products and a heartfelt celebration of the true value of food.

As well as explaining how we came to be in this \u201cfood hell\u201d \u2013 with its calorific fast food and fads, from avocado toast to black charcoal smoothies - Wilson offers valuable suggestions for ways in which individuals can change how they eat (smaller plates, more variety, make time to cook and enjoy food), as well as how governments can help. Cities are leading the way: Amsterdam has cut child obesity by 12% through city-wide policies to discourage unhealthy eating, and in Copenhagen \u201cthe majority of adults cycle to work and the food culture centres on dishes which are healthy, sustainable and delicious.\u201d Wilson finds hope in data showing that veganism is becoming more popular (increasing by 350% since 2006 in the UK) and, as sales of raw ingredients rise, more people are returning to home cooking. Her book is both an urgent plea to reject ultra-processed products and a heartfelt celebration of the true value of food. Cooking is not just good for your health but \u201can antidote to so much of the craziness of modern life\u201d. \u2022 The Way We Eat Now is published by 4th Estate (RRP \u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the British Airways and Iberia owner, International Airlines Group, is to stand down from the post in March. He will be succeeded by Luis Gallego, the Iberia chief executive. IAG said Walsh, 58, would quit as CEO on 26 March and officially retire on 30 June. He announced in late October that he would step down within two years, after 15 years at BA. The parent group, IAG, also owns the Irish airline Aer Lingus and other budget carriers, including Spain\u2019s Vueling. Walsh joined Aer Lingus in 1979 as a cadet pilot and became chief executive in 2001. At the then-government-controlled airline he was known as \u201cSlasher\u201d Walsh for cutting 2,500 jobs and turning the loss-making carrier around. Four years later he was named boss of BA and in 2011 led the merger of the airline with Spain\u2019s Iberia to create IAG. He then became chief executive of the group. Although the merger was initially controversial with shareholders, IAG has become one of the most profitable airline groups around, reporting pre-tax annual profits of \u20ac3.2bn last February and expecting to post similar results for 2019 despite losses from industrial action. Last year BA suffered one of the most damaging industrial disputes in its history, which included two days of strikes by pilots in September and the cancellation of 2,325 flights, which cost the carrier \u00a3121m. Pilots voted to settle the dispute over pay and conditions in mid-December. \u00c1lex Cruz, the boss of BA, had been tipped as a possible successor to Walsh but his chances of taking the top job were likely to have been damaged by the long-running dispute. Instead, Gallego, who started his airline career in 1997 with the Spanish regional carrier Air Nostrum, takes the reins. He has been chief executive of Iberia since 2014, where he steered through mass redundancies amid a controversial restructuring of the Spanish flag carrier. Walsh said Gallego had \u201cbeen a core member of the team and has shown true leadership over the years\u201d. Antonio V\u00e1zquez, the IAG chairman, said: \u201cWillie has led the merger and successful integration of British Airways and Iberia to form IAG. Under Willie\u2019s leadership IAG has become one of the leading global airline groups.\u201d Walsh said: \u201cIt has been a privilege to have been instrumental in the creation and development of IAG.\u201d One of the first jobs in Gallego\u2019s in-tray will be to push through IAG\u2019s \u20ac1bn takeover of Air Europa, another Spanish airline, which has attracted objection on competition grounds.",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices leapt unexpectedly in December, rising by 1.7% from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4%, according to Halifax data. Combined with November\u2019s rise of 1.2% month on month, the Halifax index recorded a 2.9% gain across the last two months of 2019, the strongest result since February 2018. Against the backdrop of a bitterly fought general election campaign and concerns that the outcome may leave the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU uncertain, housebuyers remained confident enough about the property market to bid up prices. A poll of City economists by Reuters had expected the survey to show a 0.2% decline month on month to reflect the more downbeat trend shown by most surveys over the last year. But a combination of high levels of employment, strong wage rises, low inflation, low interest rates and, most significantly, at the end of the year a sharp decline in the number of properties for sale, meant that the demand for homes outstripped supply. Russell Galley, the managing director at Halifax, said the rise compared with an especially weak figure for prices growth in December 2018. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect uncertainty in the economy to ease somewhat in 2020, which should see transaction volumes increase and further price growth made possible by an improvement in households\u2019 real incomes,\u201d he said. The official house price index produced by the Office for National Statistics has yet to reflect a pick-up in prices captured by the Halifax survey. The most recent ONS figure for the year to October showed average prices increased by just 0.7%, the lowest growth since September 2012.

      "body": "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My Samsung S8 has given up the ghost, and the prohibitive cost of repair means I\u2019m in the market for a new mobile phone. I\u2019ve come up with a wishlist of specifications. Are there any phones due in the coming months that offer all of these? I don\u2019t believe anything currently on the market does.<em> </em><strong>Declan</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>There are four obvious problems with having a list of specifications for the device you want to buy, whether it\u2019s a smartphone, tablet, laptop, digital camera or whatever. The first and biggest problem is that it can easily eliminate most of the products on the market or, in your case, all of them. In fact, it\u2019s a problem I share: nobody offers a laptop that meets my most-desired specification, though a few come close.</p> <p>The second problem is that it can be hard work. There are thousands of products with variable specifications, many of them incomplete. The numbers you can find may well be a mixture of inches and centimetres, kilograms and pounds, and binary and decimal bytes. In some cases, I\u2019ve created spreadsheets to compare products, partly to automate the format conversions.</p> <p>The third problem is that choosing purely on specification ignores other important features, such as manufacturing quality, ergonomics, software experience, reliability and support. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to get a \u201chands on\u201d and to read independent reviews, plus the manufacturer\u2019s support forums, if any.</p> <p>There\u2019s always a risk factor, and some technology buyers are more risk-averse than others. Some are happy buying smartphones from little-known suppliers on Chinese websites; others will prefer to buy from a local shop, so they can take it back when they run into a problem.</p> <p>The fourth problem is that most of us have personal preferences. Some people have historical reasons for choosing a particular brand \u2013 they\u2019ve had good or bad experiences with other products from the same company \u2013 or they think it has more social credibility. Maybe they just like the colour or the way it looks. Buyers are often willing to compromise on specifications when less tangible aspects of desirability trigger an emotional response.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying that buying using specifications is wrong: people who ignore them risk buying stupid things. However, specs are not the whole story, and for many buyers, they are not even the main story. Either way, knowing what you value will help you make a more informed choice.</p> <h2><strong>Smartphone specs</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42337a37baeb40b85bfed2c9a220cf443ad27ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42337a37baeb40b85bfed2c9a220cf443ad27ecb/855_714_3414_2049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google\u2019s Pixel 4 XL has a 90Hz screen, but only 6GB of memory and no expandable storage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s Pixel 4 XL has a 90Hz screen, but only 6GB of memory and no expandable storage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From your wishlist of specifications, you want to buy a dual-sim Android 10 smartphone with at least 8GB of memory, 128GB or more storage (expandable), and a 90Hz or better display. This sort of spec should give you a decent range of options. Unfortunately, you also want a headphone jack, wireless charging and water resistance, which reduces the options to none. The last thing on your wishlist is 5G: \u201cnice to have for future proofing; not required\u201d. That\u2019s a nice thought, but \u201cAndroid\u201d and \u201cfuture proofing\u201d are mutually incompatible.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know of any phones that exactly match your wishlist, and I think the long-term trend is the other way. I envisage future smartphones as completely sealed devices with no ports at all. Sims will be \u201cvirtual\u201d <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM\">esims</a> (stored on the device, instead of physically inserted) and everything else will be done wirelessly.</p> <p>Headphones are on the way out, and microSD card slots \u2013 used to add storage \u2013 will probably go the same way.

      "bodyText": "My Samsung S8 has given up the ghost, and the prohibitive cost of repair means I\u2019m in the market for a new mobile phone. I\u2019ve come up with a wishlist of specifications. Are there any phones due in the coming months that offer all of these? I don\u2019t believe anything currently on the market does. Declan There are four obvious problems with having a list of specifications for the device you want to buy, whether it\u2019s a smartphone, tablet, laptop, digital camera or whatever. The first and biggest problem is that it can easily eliminate most of the products on the market or, in your case, all of them. In fact, it\u2019s a problem I share: nobody offers a laptop that meets my most-desired specification, though a few come close. The second problem is that it can be hard work. There are thousands of products with variable specifications, many of them incomplete. The numbers you can find may well be a mixture of inches and centimetres, kilograms and pounds, and binary and decimal bytes. In some cases, I\u2019ve created spreadsheets to compare products, partly to automate the format conversions. The third problem is that choosing purely on specification ignores other important features, such as manufacturing quality, ergonomics, software experience, reliability and support. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to get a \u201chands on\u201d and to read independent reviews, plus the manufacturer\u2019s support forums, if any. There\u2019s always a risk factor, and some technology buyers are more risk-averse than others. Some are happy buying smartphones from little-known suppliers on Chinese websites; others will prefer to buy from a local shop, so they can take it back when they run into a problem. The fourth problem is that most of us have personal preferences. Some people have historical reasons for choosing a particular brand \u2013 they\u2019ve had good or bad experiences with other products from the same company \u2013 or they think it has more social credibility. Maybe they just like the colour or the way it looks. Buyers are often willing to compromise on specifications when less tangible aspects of desirability trigger an emotional response. I\u2019m not saying that buying using specifications is wrong: people who ignore them risk buying stupid things. However, specs are not the whole story, and for many buyers, they are not even the main story. Either way, knowing what you value will help you make a more informed choice. Smartphone specs From your wishlist of specifications, you want to buy a dual-sim Android 10 smartphone with at least 8GB of memory, 128GB or more storage (expandable), and a 90Hz or better display. This sort of spec should give you a decent range of options. Unfortunately, you also want a headphone jack, wireless charging and water resistance, which reduces the options to none. The last thing on your wishlist is 5G: \u201cnice to have for future proofing; not required\u201d. That\u2019s a nice thought, but \u201cAndroid\u201d and \u201cfuture proofing\u201d are mutually incompatible. I don\u2019t know of any phones that exactly match your wishlist, and I think the long-term trend is the other way. I envisage future smartphones as completely sealed devices with no ports at all. Sims will be \u201cvirtual\u201d esims (stored on the device, instead of physically inserted) and everything else will be done wirelessly. Headphones are on the way out, and microSD card slots \u2013 used to add storage \u2013 will probably go the same way. For now, your spec is mostly practical if you can fit a microSD card into a hybrid sim slot, instead of a second sim. Possible options It only took a couple of minutes on GSM Arena\u2019s Phone Finder to come up with what might be your best choice \u2013 the Xiaomi Redmi K30 \u2013 but you could also consider the Lenovo Z6 running Android 9.

In yet another email chain that included Don Jr and Ivanka, the younger generation of Trumps issued the email equivalent of a knowing chuckle, saying that nobody would ever find them out, because only people on the email chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception.</p> <p>\u201cThere was \u2018no doubt\u2019 that the Trump children \u2018approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,\u2019 one person who saw the emails said. \u2018They knew it was wrong.\u2019 \u2018It couldn\u2019t have been more clear they lied about the sales and knew they were lying,\u2019\u201d another person said.</p> <p>\u201cYet another said, \u2018I was shocked by the words Ivanka used.\u2019 Was there any doubt the Trumps knew they were lying and that it was wrong? \u2018Ten thousand percent no.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump and his co-defendants settled the civil case in November 2011, agreeing to refund 90% of $3.16m in deposits while refusing to admit any wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, the buyers agreed to no longer help the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s investigation into whether Trump\u2019s alleged fraud broke any laws.</p> <p>The buyers set out this agreement in a letter that, Bernstein writes, contained language insisted upon by Trump\u2019s lawyers. \u201cIn an interview, the district attorney, <a href=\"https://www.manhattanda.org/about-the-office/meet-cy-vance/\">Cyrus Vance Jr,</a> said that he had never before seen a letter where plaintiffs in a civil case asserted that no crime had been committed. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever received a letter like it,\u2019 Vance said.\u201d</p> <p>The criminal case against Don Jr and Ivanka was eventually wound up because prosecutors feared it would be undermined by the buyers refusing to say they had been the victims of fraud.

In December 2017, the Trump SoHo was rebranded as the Dominick, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-27/trump-soho-hotel-was-struggling-then-it-changed-its-name\">helped turn around its fortunes.</a></p> <p>Bernstein\u2019s American Oligarchs also <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-is-jared-kushner\">chronicles the family history</a> of Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner.</p> <p>Originally from a village in Belarus, many of his ancestors were murdered in the Holocaust. Survivors took refuge in Hungary and Italy and fled to America. The book tells how Jared\u2019s grandfather, Yossel Berkowitz, posed as his father-in-law\u2019s son, putting Kushner as his last name on US immigration paperwork.

In yet another email chain that included Don Jr and Ivanka, the younger generation of Trumps issued the email equivalent of a knowing chuckle, saying that nobody would ever find them out, because only people on the email chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception. \u201cThere was \u2018no doubt\u2019 that the Trump children \u2018approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,\u2019 one person who saw the emails said. \u2018They knew it was wrong.\u2019 \u2018It couldn\u2019t have been more clear they lied about the sales and knew they were lying,\u2019\u201d another person said. \u201cYet another said, \u2018I was shocked by the words Ivanka used.\u2019 Was there any doubt the Trumps knew they were lying and that it was wrong? \u2018Ten thousand percent no.\u2019\u201d Trump and his co-defendants settled the civil case in November 2011, agreeing to refund 90% of $3.16m in deposits while refusing to admit any wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, the buyers agreed to no longer help the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s investigation into whether Trump\u2019s alleged fraud broke any laws. The buyers set out this agreement in a letter that, Bernstein writes, contained language insisted upon by Trump\u2019s lawyers. \u201cIn an interview, the district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, said that he had never before seen a letter where plaintiffs in a civil case asserted that no crime had been committed. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever received a letter like it,\u2019 Vance said.\u201d The criminal case against Don Jr and Ivanka was eventually wound up because prosecutors feared it would be undermined by the buyers refusing to say they had been the victims of fraud. Ivanka is now in the White House as a senior adviser to the president. Don Jr has emerged as one his chief campaign surrogates for re-election. Trump\u2019s hugely divisive presidency has seen some of his properties suffer lost custom as his name becomes a liability. In December 2017, the Trump SoHo was rebranded as the Dominick, which helped turn around its fortunes. Bernstein\u2019s American Oligarchs also chronicles the family history of Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner. Originally from a village in Belarus, many of his ancestors were murdered in the Holocaust. Survivors took refuge in Hungary and Italy and fled to America. The book tells how Jared\u2019s grandfather, Yossel Berkowitz, posed as his father-in-law\u2019s son, putting Kushner as his last name on US immigration paperwork. As a consequence, his grandson is named Jared Kushner rather than Jared Berkowitz.",

      "body": "<p>Oscar Wilde dreamed of a world without work. In <em>The Soul of Man Under Socialism</em> (1891) he imagined a society liberated from drudgery by the machine: \u201cwhile Humanity will be amusing itself, or enjoying cultivated leisure \u2026 or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful things, or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant work.\u201d This aesthete\u2019s Eden prompted one of his most famous observations: \u201cIs this Utopian? A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.\u201d</p> <p>In Wilde\u2019s day the future of work was the first question that every aspiring utopian, from Edward Bellamy to HG Wells, needed to answer. Everything else, from gender relations to crime prevention, flowed from that. But proponents of the more attainable goal of drastically shorter working hours have also included Benjamin Franklin,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/nov/18/bertrand-russell-philosopher-religion-ethics-life\" title=\"\"> Bertrand Russell,</a> AT&amp;T president Walter Gifford and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/05/seven-things-john-maynard-keynes\" title=\"\"> John Maynard Keynes</a>. When the great economist coined the phrase \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d (\u201cunemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour\u201d) in <em>Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren</em> (1931), he focused on the potential benefits a century hence.</p> <p>Written as a sprightly provocation rather than a detailed prophecy, Keynes\u2019s short essay has since become a set text for the diverse thinkers, such as Benjamin Kline Hunnicutt and Nick Srnicek, known as \u201cpost-workists\u201d. The prospect of disappearing jobs has at least created a few new ones for economists and polemicists, some of whom make Keynes look stingy. In his future-drunk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/29/fully-automated-luxury-communism-aaron-bastani-review\" title=\"\"><em>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</em></a>, Aaron Bastani maps out a post-scarcity paradise in which, by way of solar panels, asteroid mining and 3D-printed bacon, \u201cluxury will pervade everything as society based on waged work becomes as much a relic as the feudal peasant and medieval knight\u201d.</p> <p>Running parallel to this bullish tendency has always been the dystopian analysis, in which robots toss workers on to the scrapheap, dooming them to empty lives of poverty and despair. The New York Times ran the ominous headline \u201cA Robot Is After Your Job\u201d in 1980 but it could have done so at almost any point in the last century. The title of Daniel Susskind\u2019s book, therefore, is either a threat or a promise, depending on your point of view.</p> <p>Susskind, an economics scholar and a former government policy adviser, has come up with an explainer rather than a polemic, written in the relentlessly reasonable tone that dominates popular economics: the voice of a clever, sensible man telling you what\u2019s what. He always has a helpful graph to hand and a greatest hits collection of anecdotes about technology and society, from Ned Ludd to Deep Blue via the 1890s horse manure crisis.</p> <p>Susskind guides the reader through a boneyard of discredited assumptions about technological unemployment. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, automation tended to replace human labour in \u201croutine\u201d tasks without destroying entire occupations. Even when certain professions were eliminated, new ones were created. The somewhat technophobic utopian socialist William Morris saw this happening in 1890: \u201cAll their devices for cheapening labour simply resulted in increasing the burden of labour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66fc69a6f2cdc16ba1b72bbf637d068d085bf8cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66fc69a6f2cdc16ba1b72bbf637d068d085bf8cf/0_8_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is a robot really after your job?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is a robot really after your job?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But AI, Susskind argues, has changed everything, starting with the definition of \u201croutine\u201d. Time and time again, it has been assumed that a task required a human being until a machine has come along and proved otherwise, and without needing to mimic human cognition. It used to be argued that workers who lost their low-skilled jobs should retrain for more challenging roles, but what happens when the robots, or drones, or driverless cars, come for those as well? Predictions vary but up to half of jobs are at least partially vulnerable to AI, from truck-driving, retail and warehouse work to medicine, law and accountancy.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the former US treasury secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/24/larry-summers-memo-hobbled-obamas-stimulus\" title=\"\">Larry Summers </a>confessed in 2013 that he used to think \u201cthe Luddites were wrong, and the believers in technology and technological progress were right. I\u2019m not so completely certain now.\u201d That same year, the economist and Keynes biographer Robert Skidelsky wrote that fears of technological unemployment were not so much wrong as premature: \u201cSooner or later, we will run out of jobs.\u201d Yet Skidelsky, like Keynes, saw this as an opportunity. If the doomsayers are to be finally proven right, then why not the utopians, too? Committed to neither camp, Susskind leaves it late in the day to ask fundamental questions. The work ethic, he says, is a modern religion that purports to be the only source of meaning and purpose. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d is for many people the first question they ask when meeting a stranger, and there is no entity more beloved of politicians than the \u201chard-working family\u201d. Yet faced with precarious, unfulfilling jobs and stagnant wages, many are losing faith in the gospel of work. In a 2015 YouGov survey, 37% of UK workers said their jobs made no meaningful contribution. Susskind wonders in the final pages \u201cwhether the academics and commentators who write fearfully about a world with less work are just mistakenly projecting the personal enjoyment they take from their jobs on to the experience of everyone else\u201d.</p> <p>That deserves to be more than an afterthought. The challenge of a world without work isn\u2019t just economic but political and psychological. To paraphrase the children\u2019s author Richard Scarry: what will people do all day? You can only contemplate the world with admiration and delight for so long. Joblessness tends to create loneliness, lethargy and social dysfunction. But is relying on work to provide self-worth and social status an inevitable human truth or the relatively recent product of a puritan work ethic? Keynes regretted that the possibility of an \u201cage of leisure and abundance\u201d was freighted with dread: \u201cFor we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>The state, Susskind concedes with ambivalence, will need to smooth the transition. Moving beyond the \u201cAge of Labour\u201d will require something like a universal basic income (he prefers a more selective conditional basic income), funded by taxes on capital to share the proceeds of technological prosperity. The available work will also need to be more evenly distributed. After decades of a 40-hour week, the recent Labour manifesto, influenced by Skidelsky, promised 32 hours by 2030. And that\u2019s the relatively easy part. Moving society\u2019s centre of gravity away from waged labour will require visionary \u201cleisure policies\u201d on every level, from urban planning to education, and a revolution in thinking. \u201cWe will be forced to consider what it really means to live a meaningful life,\u201d Susskind writes, implying that this is above his pay grade.</p> <p>The virtue of his reluctance to take a firm political position on an inevitably political issue is that it makes pragmatism and idealism seem to point in the same direction. While other writers make a strongly socialist, feminist or environmentalist case for a post-work world, he says simply that the jobs will go and we\u2019ll have to make the best of it. In light of the current state of political leadership, his optimistic sign-off feels more dutiful than persuasive. Still, if AI really does to employment what previous technologies did not, radical change can\u2019t be postponed indefinitely. It may well be utopia or bust.</p> <p>\u2022<em> A World Without Work is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Oscar Wilde dreamed of a world without work. In The Soul of Man Under Socialism (1891) he imagined a society liberated from drudgery by the machine: \u201cwhile Humanity will be amusing itself, or enjoying cultivated leisure \u2026 or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful things, or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant work.\u201d This aesthete\u2019s Eden prompted one of his most famous observations: \u201cIs this Utopian? A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.\u201d In Wilde\u2019s day the future of work was the first question that every aspiring utopian, from Edward Bellamy to HG Wells, needed to answer. Everything else, from gender relations to crime prevention, flowed from that. But proponents of the more attainable goal of drastically shorter working hours have also included Benjamin Franklin, Bertrand Russell, AT&amp;T president Walter Gifford and John Maynard Keynes. When the great economist coined the phrase \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d (\u201cunemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour\u201d) in Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren (1931), he focused on the potential benefits a century hence. Written as a sprightly provocation rather than a detailed prophecy, Keynes\u2019s short essay has since become a set text for the diverse thinkers, such as Benjamin Kline Hunnicutt and Nick Srnicek, known as \u201cpost-workists\u201d. The prospect of disappearing jobs has at least created a few new ones for economists and polemicists, some of whom make Keynes look stingy. In his future-drunk Fully Automated Luxury Communism, Aaron Bastani maps out a post-scarcity paradise in which, by way of solar panels, asteroid mining and 3D-printed bacon, \u201cluxury will pervade everything as society based on waged work becomes as much a relic as the feudal peasant and medieval knight\u201d. Running parallel to this bullish tendency has always been the dystopian analysis, in which robots toss workers on to the scrapheap, dooming them to empty lives of poverty and despair. The New York Times ran the ominous headline \u201cA Robot Is After Your Job\u201d in 1980 but it could have done so at almost any point in the last century. The title of Daniel Susskind\u2019s book, therefore, is either a threat or a promise, depending on your point of view. Susskind, an economics scholar and a former government policy adviser, has come up with an explainer rather than a polemic, written in the relentlessly reasonable tone that dominates popular economics: the voice of a clever, sensible man telling you what\u2019s what. He always has a helpful graph to hand and a greatest hits collection of anecdotes about technology and society, from Ned Ludd to Deep Blue via the 1890s horse manure crisis. Susskind guides the reader through a boneyard of discredited assumptions about technological unemployment. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, automation tended to replace human labour in \u201croutine\u201d tasks without destroying entire occupations. Even when certain professions were eliminated, new ones were created. The somewhat technophobic utopian socialist William Morris saw this happening in 1890: \u201cAll their devices for cheapening labour simply resulted in increasing the burden of labour.\u201d But AI, Susskind argues, has changed everything, starting with the definition of \u201croutine\u201d. Time and time again, it has been assumed that a task required a human being until a machine has come along and proved otherwise, and without needing to mimic human cognition. It used to be argued that workers who lost their low-skilled jobs should retrain for more challenging roles, but what happens when the robots, or drones, or driverless cars, come for those as well? Predictions vary but up to half of jobs are at least partially vulnerable to AI, from truck-driving, retail and warehouse work to medicine, law and accountancy. That\u2019s why the former US treasury secretary Larry Summers confessed in 2013 that he used to think \u201cthe Luddites were wrong, and the believers in technology and technological progress were right. I\u2019m not so completely certain now.\u201d That same year, the economist and Keynes biographer Robert Skidelsky wrote that fears of technological unemployment were not so much wrong as premature: \u201cSooner or later, we will run out of jobs.\u201d Yet Skidelsky, like Keynes, saw this as an opportunity. If the doomsayers are to be finally proven right, then why not the utopians, too? Committed to neither camp, Susskind leaves it late in the day to ask fundamental questions. The work ethic, he says, is a modern religion that purports to be the only source of meaning and purpose. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d is for many people the first question they ask when meeting a stranger, and there is no entity more beloved of politicians than the \u201chard-working family\u201d. Yet faced with precarious, unfulfilling jobs and stagnant wages, many are losing faith in the gospel of work. In a 2015 YouGov survey, 37% of UK workers said their jobs made no meaningful contribution. Susskind wonders in the final pages \u201cwhether the academics and commentators who write fearfully about a world with less work are just mistakenly projecting the personal enjoyment they take from their jobs on to the experience of everyone else\u201d. That deserves to be more than an afterthought. The challenge of a world without work isn\u2019t just economic but political and psychological. To paraphrase the children\u2019s author Richard Scarry: what will people do all day? You can only contemplate the world with admiration and delight for so long. Joblessness tends to create loneliness, lethargy and social dysfunction. But is relying on work to provide self-worth and social status an inevitable human truth or the relatively recent product of a puritan work ethic? Keynes regretted that the possibility of an \u201cage of leisure and abundance\u201d was freighted with dread: \u201cFor we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy.\u201d The state, Susskind concedes with ambivalence, will need to smooth the transition. Moving beyond the \u201cAge of Labour\u201d will require something like a universal basic income (he prefers a more selective conditional basic income), funded by taxes on capital to share the proceeds of technological prosperity. The available work will also need to be more evenly distributed. After decades of a 40-hour week, the recent Labour manifesto, influenced by Skidelsky, promised 32 hours by 2030. And that\u2019s the relatively easy part. Moving society\u2019s centre of gravity away from waged labour will require visionary \u201cleisure policies\u201d on every level, from urban planning to education, and a revolution in thinking. \u201cWe will be forced to consider what it really means to live a meaningful life,\u201d Susskind writes, implying that this is above his pay grade. The virtue of his reluctance to take a firm political position on an inevitably political issue is that it makes pragmatism and idealism seem to point in the same direction. While other writers make a strongly socialist, feminist or environmentalist case for a post-work world, he says simply that the jobs will go and we\u2019ll have to make the best of it. In light of the current state of political leadership, his optimistic sign-off feels more dutiful than persuasive. Still, if AI really does to employment what previous technologies did not, radical change can\u2019t be postponed indefinitely. It may well be utopia or bust. \u2022 A World Without Work is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320). To buy a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.",

Some are just on the fringes, while others are pick-in-the-sky dream picks \u2013 but all of them merit your attention.</p> <h2><strong>Alfre Woodard, Clemency</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd1a6cbd347942ded2288f9e4b9ac05b5187c50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd1a6cbd347942ded2288f9e4b9ac05b5187c50/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Obviously, \u201coverlooked\u201d is a flexible term: Alfre Woodard has been nominated for an Independent Spirit award for her career-crowning role as a morally tortured Death Row warden in Chinonye Chukwu\u2019s searing chamber drama, while she and her co-star Aldis Hodge \u2013 also superb as the condemned man spurring her internal agony \u2013 were both nominated for Gotham awards at the outset of the season. That\u2019s not nothing. But they\u2019ve both been largely frozen out of the Oscar conversation, following a lack of interest from other precursors and critics\u2019 awards. That\u2019s criminal in the case of Woodard in particular, who may give the year\u2019s greatest performance by an American actor: a masterclass in restraint and from-the-inside-out character breakdown, etching every minute stage of her character\u2019s incremental self-reckoning in the twitch of an eyelid or the tremble of a lip. This shouldn\u2019t have been a hard get: Woodard is a respected previous Oscar nominee, long deserving of greater recognition, headlining a film that won Sundance\u2019s top prize, backed by hot distributor Neon, which is currently working campaign wonders with Parasite. Is her work too subtle? Is the film too despairing? Was late December simply too late to release a slow-building indie? All are likely factors in Woodard\u2019s strange lack of traction, but here\u2019s hoping for an eleventh-hour surge.</p> <h2><strong>Franz Rogowski, Transit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dadb2fd9ecd5830cdf09b58105b477769b31ecc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dadb2fd9ecd5830cdf09b58105b477769b31ecc6/0_281_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This could be the year that Joaquin Phoenix finally takes the best actor Oscar for his strident, elastic supervillain in Joker: he wouldn\u2019t be unworthy, but it\u2019s worth noting that the actor often cited as Phoenix\u2019s European doppelganger deserves the prize a little more this year. Truth be told, Rogowski and Phoenix don\u2019t much resemble each other beyond their respective cleft lips; it\u2019s more the rising German star\u2019s quietly concentrated, wound-up intensity that evokes his American elder, and it\u2019s put to exquisitely anxious use in Christian Petzold\u2019s brilliant, audaciously era-mixing refugee drama. As a German Jew seeking to flee a desolate Marseille that is at once Nazi-occupied and entirely contemporary-looking, his darting, internally bruised characterisation can take much of the credit for pulling off the tricky political double consciousness of Petzold\u2019s experiment.</p> <h2><strong>Cho Yeo-jeong, Parasite</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6e2fd27e59830b3e86186696d869272d415751b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6e2fd27e59830b3e86186696d869272d415751b/0_181_2732_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bong Joon-ho\u2019s universally adored Palme d\u2019Or winner (and unexpectedly potent best picture threat) has been widely hailed as a perfectly integrated ensemble piece \u2013 to the point that it even scored a best ensemble nomination from the generally insular Screen Actors\u2019 Guild, only the second non-English-language film ever to do so. A deft and balanced team effort it may be, but that has also prevented many from differentiating its exemplary individual contributors: the Academy traditionally has a blind spot when it comes to Asian actors, and it\u2019d be a shame if that continued this year. Song Kang-ho\u2019s wily, impoverished patriarch won the LA critics\u2019 supporting award and has an outside shot at an Oscar nod, but I\u2019d be even more thrilled (and considerably more surprised) to see recognition for Cho\u2019s canny, drily perceptive turn as a privileged trophy wife whose gentleness and callous cluelessness wrestle for dominance inside her. Rather like her character, it\u2019s a performance that\u2019s easy to dismiss without a closer look: Bong\u2019s film isn\u2019t morally one-sided in its class war, and her oddly sympathetic vacuity is instrumental to that tension.</p> <h2><strong>Jason Clarke, The Aftermath</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39aad466a73d0e10feac79be12fb6daa1f24c540\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39aad466a73d0e10feac79be12fb6daa1f24c540/0_213_2059_1236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Aftermath was released back in the doldrums of March, and has barely been spoken of since. There\u2019s a reason for that: a handsome, lightly swoony post-WWII soap opera set in Allied-occupied Hamburg, James Kent\u2019s film is a pretty rainy-day diversion, but utterly unremarkable outside of its truly luscious silk-and-knitwear wardrobe. Oh, and then there\u2019s Jason Clarke, the reliable Aussie stalwart who may take the year\u2019s prize for Most Memorable Performance In An Unmemorable Movie. As a grief-stoking, stiff-upper-lipped British army colonel paralysed between stoic military duty and emotional obligation to his wife (Keira Knightley) \u2013 at the very moment she falls for their dishy German housemate, dishily played by Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 he\u2019s both perfectly mannered and intensely moving in a role that hearkens back to many a sidelined Other Guy figure from 1940s melodrama: squint a bit, and it\u2019s not too hard to imagine a Trevor Howard in the role, thanks in large part to Clarke\u2019s gracefully repressed delivery.</p> <h2><strong>Fernanda Montenegro, Invisible Life</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91448404e20abe0ac9b901f4ed970b586fc3f32f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91448404e20abe0ac9b901f4ed970b586fc3f32f/2_0_997_598/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fernanda Montenegro in Invisible Life\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fernanda Montenegro in Invisible Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the 1998 race, Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s widely derided best actress win over then-revelation Cate Blanchett rather obscured the unlikely presence of the most deserving nominee: veteran Brazilian stage actress Fernanda Montenegro, improbably nominated for a rare screen lead in the Portuguese-language festival hit Central Station. She seemed like one of the Academy\u2019s occasional international outreach beneficiaries who probably wouldn\u2019t ever be invited to the ball again. That\u2019ll probably remain the case, but she sure as hell deserves another shot for her piercing, film-binding cameo in the ravishing melodrama Invisible Life, Brazil\u2019s unjustly overlooked submission for the foreign-language Oscar. Now 90, the actress turns up as a key character\u2019s elder incarnation in the film\u2019s final stages, bearings deep reserves of accumulated sadness and regret in her creviced expression and clear but fragile line readings. You will weep.</p> <h2><strong>Bill Camp, Dark Waters</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"293ebf8ae0cab311a90ff45d7b5b0fa61188df8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/293ebf8ae0cab311a90ff45d7b5b0fa61188df8d/0_58_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Todd Haynes\u2019 Dark Waters has been more or less invisible all season, despite rock-solid credentials \u2013 Haynes himself, a high-end cast including Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins, a true story about environmental crime and underdog legal warfare that sounds on paper like Oscar Bait 101 \u2013 and approving reviews. Perhaps it never quite recovered from a deceptively dour trailer that had the queer Carol director\u2019s auteurist acolytes wondering why he\u2019d make something so drably procedural-looking. It\u2019s a shame, since the film turned out to be immaculately directed and deeply stirring. Had it landed a bit less quietly, perhaps its secret weapon, Bill Camp, would be the best supporting actor frontrunner he deserves to be. One of America\u2019s most dependable and undersung character actors, he\u2019s lacerating as the film\u2019s wounded soul and gruff conscience: a West Virginia cattle farmer who calls out the literally poisonous influence of the DuPont chemical corporation on his land and community. It\u2019s a role that could be played as a salt-of-the-earth victim, but adopting a thick, brusque regional vernacular and bristling body language, Camp finds of a more striking, disruptive voice for the voiceless.</p> <h2><strong>Constance Wu, Hustlers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd430c9689f36a25c6784fd39aa2502cc0d8a015\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd430c9689f36a25c6784fd39aa2502cc0d8a015/569_0_2503_1502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>From the day it premiered to gleeful acclaim at Toronto, Jennifer Lopez has been the headline attraction of Lorene Scafaria\u2019s richly enjoyable, woman-powered true-crime yarn: her luxuriantly fur-draped diva stripper was declared an Oscar contender from day one, and deservedly so. That\u2019s all well and good, but one can\u2019t help feeling for the film\u2019s actual leading lady, Constance Wu, who\u2019s been largely left out of the discussion. As go-along girl turned fraught conscience of the story\u2019s sordid patriarchy-smashing scam, she\u2019s vital to the film\u2019s fine threading of the needle between raucous comedy and ethically weighted tragedy \u2013 particularly in its framing of latter-day scenes, where her prickly, self-revising account of events doesn\u2019t speak of lessons learned so much as questions never asked. That, and she nails one of the film\u2019s most vivid, appallingly funny feats of physical performance: panicked and oblivious, running her daughter to school in a blood-stained boob tube and precarious go-go boots. J.Lo\u2019s fab, but her dignity is never quite so tested.</p> <h2><strong>Baykali Ganambarr, The Nightingale</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"679d4d176fbd102c2383b15c4dfb65d24b67bccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679d4d176fbd102c2383b15c4dfb65d24b67bccd/18_55_1730_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Venice film festival\u2019s Marcello Mastroianni Award for young actors has christened a few stars in its time, landing upon Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Jennifer Lawrence early in their careers. One can only hope it bring some good fortune to its 2018 recipient, Aboriginal dancer and first-time actor Baykali Ganambarr, who\u2019s unlikely to be winning any other prizes for his captivating performance in Jennifer Kent\u2019s challenging, divisive follow-up to The Babadook. As an indigenous tracker reluctantly roped into a young Irish widow\u2019s revenge mission against the English colonial soldiers who killed her husband and child, he\u2019s often the lifeline of humanity in a film of punishing anger and spiritual corruption \u2013 yet he never plays the role as a straightforward naif or victim, imposing a raw, rueful awareness of difference into proceedings every time it threatens to become a united buddy story.</p> <h2><strong>Elizabeth Debicki, Vita and Virginia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb74f1f4fa19d390478238fbb5859a1f356ad8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb74f1f4fa19d390478238fbb5859a1f356ad8f/0_176_3635_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>An awards plea for a performance as Virginia Woolf? Seventeen years after Nicole Kidman\u2019s fine, duly Oscar-garnished work in The Hours, do we need to go there again? Willowy Australian star Debicki makes a strong case for doing so. A reliably strange and bewitching screen presence ever since her best-in-show turn in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s The Great Gatsby, she\u2019s ideally cast here, capturing both Woolf\u2019s touched, otherworldly quality and a sharp current of sensual desire that entirely distinguishes her performance from Kidman\u2019s more rigid, nervy interpretation. Sadly, it\u2019s gone largely unnoticed. Focused more on Woolf\u2019s lover Vita Sackville-West, gamely but less fascinatingly played by Gemma Arterton, Chanya Button\u2019s distinctively stylised but uneven biopic never quite found its audience back in the summer \u2013 leaving Debicki, who likewise deserved Oscar attention for Widows last year \u2013 once more on the outside looking in.</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Graham, The Irishman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31f9e7e0b2a9aa29bea1db96c8dbecc4345de84d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f9e7e0b2a9aa29bea1db96c8dbecc4345de84d/487_384_2025_1215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Graham in The Irishman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Graham in The Irishman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niko Tavernise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Pesci and Al Pacino\u2019s names were both pretty much written in ink as best supporting actor nominees when Martin Scorsese\u2019s gangster epic started screening, with the real question being whether either man could overcome internal competition to take the gold. Pesci leads in terms of precursor awards, though Pacino\u2019s Jimmy Hoffa is the heftier, more flamboyant (and arguably co-leading) role \u2013 and that veteran rivalry has effective pushed an equally deserving but less widely recognised third contender out of the running. Stephen Graham\u2019s unassuming but punchy power may be well-known to his British compatriots \u2014 and indeed to Scorsese, who cast him in Gangs of New York way back when \u2013 but to many he was a riotous revelation as \u201cTony Pro\u201d Provenzano, the brash, shorts-sporting Teamster who gets Hoffa\u2019s goat in memorable style. Graham aces the film\u2019s most wicked stabs of comedy, at no cost to his character\u2019s seamy undercurrent of danger. It won\u2019t land him an Oscar, but here\u2019s hoping Hollywood casting agents pricked up their ears.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 January 2020 to remove the term harelip in reference to the lip scars of Franz Rogowski and Joaquin Phoenix.</p>",

Franz Rogowski, Transit This could be the year that Joaquin Phoenix finally takes the best actor Oscar for his strident, elastic supervillain in Joker: he wouldn\u2019t be unworthy, but it\u2019s worth noting that the actor often cited as Phoenix\u2019s European doppelganger deserves the prize a little more this year. Truth be told, Rogowski and Phoenix don\u2019t much resemble each other beyond their respective cleft lips; it\u2019s more the rising German star\u2019s quietly concentrated, wound-up intensity that evokes his American elder, and it\u2019s put to exquisitely anxious use in Christian Petzold\u2019s brilliant, audaciously era-mixing refugee drama.

Cho Yeo-jeong, Parasite Bong Joon-ho\u2019s universally adored Palme d\u2019Or winner (and unexpectedly potent best picture threat) has been widely hailed as a perfectly integrated ensemble piece \u2013 to the point that it even scored a best ensemble nomination from the generally insular Screen Actors\u2019 Guild, only the second non-English-language film ever to do so.

It\u2019s a role that could be played as a salt-of-the-earth victim, but adopting a thick, brusque regional vernacular and bristling body language, Camp finds of a more striking, disruptive voice for the voiceless. Constance Wu, Hustlers From the day it premiered to gleeful acclaim at Toronto, Jennifer Lopez has been the headline attraction of Lorene Scafaria\u2019s richly enjoyable, woman-powered true-crime yarn: her luxuriantly fur-draped diva stripper was declared an Oscar contender from day one, and deservedly so.

Focused more on Woolf\u2019s lover Vita Sackville-West, gamely but less fascinatingly played by Gemma Arterton, Chanya Button\u2019s distinctively stylised but uneven biopic never quite found its audience back in the summer \u2013 leaving Debicki, who likewise deserved Oscar attention for Widows last year \u2013 once more on the outside looking in. Stephen Graham, The Irishman Joe Pesci and Al Pacino\u2019s names were both pretty much written in ink as best supporting actor nominees when Martin Scorsese\u2019s gangster epic started screening, with the real question being whether either man could overcome internal competition to take the gold. Pesci leads in terms of precursor awards, though Pacino\u2019s Jimmy Hoffa is the heftier, more flamboyant (and arguably co-leading) role \u2013 and that veteran rivalry has effective pushed an equally deserving but less widely recognised third contender out of the running. Stephen Graham\u2019s unassuming but punchy power may be well-known to his British compatriots \u2014 and indeed to Scorsese, who cast him in Gangs of New York way back when \u2013 but to many he was a riotous revelation as \u201cTony Pro\u201d Provenzano, the brash, shorts-sporting Teamster who gets Hoffa\u2019s goat in memorable style. Graham aces the film\u2019s most wicked stabs of comedy, at no cost to his character\u2019s seamy undercurrent of danger. It won\u2019t land him an Oscar, but here\u2019s hoping Hollywood casting agents pricked up their ears. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 January 2020 to remove the term harelip in reference to the lip scars of Franz Rogowski and Joaquin Phoenix.",

An Evans shot has de Minaur pulls so far out of court he has to put extra on his response to offset the acute angle.

Norrie passes him again after the Australian tried to come in on his second serve. The players then exchange unforced errors but Norrie\u2019s comes after at least engaging Kyrgios in a rally. He does so again next point, and extracts another error to glimpse an opening. Opening closed. What a player. Kyrgios again comes in on his second serve and Norrie hits a smart return right on the Australian\u2019s toes; not to worry, a drop-shot of rare class is his answer, taking the game to deuce. </p> <p>But the tension doesn\u2019t end there. Kyrgios double-faults with an overly aggressive pair of serves, both marginally wide. Norrie then has an opportunity to pass but doesn\u2019t connect well from the baseline and Kyrgios puts the smash away like a volleyballer accepting a precise set. Tired of the game dragging on, Kyrgios wheels out the cannon and kabooms a couple of monster serves, the second ending with a full throated roar of approval. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e166c018f087e8308e6b0b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T00:01:44.715Z\">12.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): </strong>A nondescript opening to the game sees Norrie 40-0 ahead but he\u2019s serving with a lack of rhythm that eventually comes back to haunt him with a double-fault. The latest in a long line of overhit forehands brings Kyrgios back into the contest and he earns deuce with the rally of the match, pulling Norrie left and right with fierce thwacks, then drawing his opponent in with a subtle drop shot, eventually ending the torture with a simple overhead. </p> <p>Oh dear, this is getting ugly for Norrie now, another unforced error long gifts a break point, and the limpest second serve dribbles into the net for a double-fault.

After taking in the delights of Perth and Brisbane during the group phase, the action has relocated to Sydney for the knockout stage, specifically Ken Rosewall Arena in the Olympic Park precinct. <strong>Action gets underway at 10am local time (11pm UK)</strong>.</p> <p>There are three matches scheduled for the tie, beginning with <strong>Cameron Norrie v Nick Kyrgios</strong>, followed by<strong> Dan Evans v Alex de Minaur</strong>, and finishing with the doubles where <strong>Jamie Murray &amp; Joe Salisbury </strong>will take on<strong> Chris Guccione &amp; John Peers</strong>.</p> <p>The winners of this quarter-final will face the likely - and unenviable - prospect of a semi-final with tournament favourites and recent Davis Cup winners Spain. Rafael Nadal and co may slip up in the last eight tie against Belgium, but after storming through the group phase with a 9-0 unbeaten record, that seems fanciful.</p> <p>Based on pre-tournament rankings GB and Australia were rated the 17th and 18th best teams in the draw, meaning both can be pleased with their progress so far, irrespective of their performance today. But the hosts will be favoured to make it to the last four after streaking a tough Group F, going unbeaten against the likes of Alex Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Denis Shapovalov. With ta partisan crowd behind them the mercurial Kyrgios and nuggety de Minaur will be hard to beat.</p> <p>GB by contrast finished top of Group C by set countback after finishing level with Belgium and Bulgaria on two wins apiece, and level again with the Belgians on six match victories. Under the leadership of Tim Henman Great Britain have coped well with the absence of the injured Andy Murray, not to mention not being able to call up on Kyle Edmund, a man ranked 14 in the world this time last year, but now struggling for form.</p> <p>If you would like to join in the conversation, please send your emails to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a> or tweets to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f13d8c42fed96c188b4e9ca38bf9450ed3b66e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f13d8c42fed96c188b4e9ca38bf9450ed3b66e/0_0_4500_3203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Kyrgios\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Kyrgios is up first for Australia against Great Britain in the ATP Cup quarter-finals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report from Ken Rosewall Arena: Well, there\u2019s not much left to say. An utterly thrilling end to what has been a fine advertisement for this competition today. With entertainment you\u2019d have to be a curmudgeon not to have enjoyed it. Australia are through to a Saturday semi-final with either Belgium or Spain, who play next up on Ken Rosewall Arena. But for now, from me, that\u2019s all I can take. Thanks for joining today. Look out for Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report from Sydney which will be online shortly. Bye for now. \u201cThat was the most stressful tie-breaker I\u2019ve ever been involved in,\u201d says Kyrgios. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be having a couple of red wines tonight.\u201d De Minaur jokes that Kyrgios \u201cblatantly carried me out there\u201d following his narrow three-and-a-half-hour loss to Dan Evans not half an hour prior. Kyrgios quips: \u201cNot at all, he just needs a bit of guidance. He gets down on himself really easily and I just tried to keep him positive.\u201d The bromance is complete. Quite how De Minaur pulled through that one is anyone\u2019s guess. But he did, and Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s last-minute decision to change his doubles line-up pays off in spades. The presumably knackered De Minaur and Kyrgios are cock-a-hoop in the post-match interview. An extraordinary end to this quarter-final. Fair play to Kyrgios and De Minaur \u2013 they quickly get up off the ground to congratulate Murray and Salisbury at the net, and after celebrating with the joyous Australian bench, head over to their British counterparts to offer their commiserations. Match tie-break: Australia 18-16 Great Britain Groans ring out as Kyrgios finds the net on his first serve on another Australian match point now, but those groans turn to rapturous cheers soon after as Kyrgios and De Minaur finally seal victory! There\u2019s a brief challenge, which comes to naught, and once confirmed, the two Australian players fall in a heap on the ground! Match tie-break: Australia 16-16 Great Britain De Minaur can only find the net and Britain, with the ball in Murray\u2019s hand, have another chance to close this out. Guess what? We\u2019re still going. De Minaur delivers a ferocious return to level things up once again. Come on! Match tie-break: Australia 15-15 Great Britain Salisbury must serve to keep GB in the match once again now, and he pulls a huge serve right out of the top drawer \u2013 Kyrgios cannot return and the momentum is with Britain! A third match point follows... De Minaur serves.... it returned out. This is getting ridiculous. Match tie-break: Australia 13-13 Great Britain It\u2019s Salisbury\u2019s turn now to play the villain as he smashes long, handing Australia a third chance to secure victory. Kyrgios to serve... not taken! De Minaur\u2019s volley goes into the net - a rather tired shot. Match tie-break: Australia 12-12 Great Britain Murray has a glorious chance to wrap things up but he\u2019s long with a forehand at the net! He holds his head in his hands and well he might as Kyrgios swings the pendulum in Australia\u2019s favour once again on the next point, delivering a leaping backhand smash to bring up their own match point! Thrilling stuff \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why match tie-breaks are used. Saved, again. Back to 12-12. Match tie-break: Australia 10-11 Great Britain Match point is saved on Britain\u2019s serve and we go once again... Salisbury\u2019s second serve at 10-10 is superb and Kyrgios\u2019s return is well wide. Match point for GB... Match tie-break: Australia 10-9 Great Britain Kyrgios serves again - his first is out but with the ball in play on the second, he fires an unanswerable forehand winner down the line to bring up a match point for Australia! Match tie-break: Australia 9-9 Great Britain Match point for GB... but Kyrgios pulls out a monster serve just when it is needed and Australia live to fight another day. There needs to be a cushion of two points for a winner to be declared. Match tie-break: Australia 8-8 Great Britain And Britain level at 8-8 after Murray finally, gleefully, puts away a volley at the net! Remember it\u2019s first to 10... Match tie-break: Australia 8-7 Great Britain Kyrgios is wild with one return which flies out at the baseline, and the visitors creep back into it once again. The tension in the crowd is palpable. And before too long we\u2019re back on serve as Britain launch a gutsy fightback! Match tie-break: Australia 7-4 Great Britain Kyrgios wins his service point but De Minaur can\u2019t return Murray\u2019s next serve and Britain have a way back into this. Salisbury finishes off at the net after Murray\u2019s next serve to claw further back into it, but Australia edge further ahead as De Minaur\u2019s volley is hit straight into Murray. Match tie-break: Australia 4-2 Great Britain So here we go. A final match tie break in the third rubber to settle who advances into Saturday\u2019s semi-final. It doesn\u2019t get more dramatic that this. And it\u2019s the Australians who delight the home crowd as they edge ahead. Second set: Australia* 3-6 6-3 Great Britain (*denotes server): They say sometimes doing nothing is the best thing. Kyrgios watches a long-looking shot sail through the air. De Minaur, at the net, leaves it for his deeper-lying partner, and Kyrgios expertly allows it to drop just outside the baseline. De Minaur then delivers a delightful drop volley and Australia level the ledger. A match tie break to settle a place in the semi-finals against either Rafa\u2019s Spain or Belgium (likely the former). Second set: Australia 3-6 5-3 *Great Britain (*denotes server): GB are ahead 30-15 and Murray faults his service to De Minaur. His second lands wide and his receiver skews it even wider - too wide for the line on the other side of the court. Then Kyrgios fluffs the next return and gets ready to serve for the second set. Second set: Australia* 3-6 5-2 Great Britain (*denotes server): De Minaur is serving. He swings one out wide and rediverts Murray\u2019s return low and down the line. Salisbury attempts to catch it with the edge of his racquet to no avail. De Minaur is perky, sprightly even. How can this be so after his marathon exertions of today? It matters not, for Australia are in the box seat and Murray must serve to keep GB in the second set. Second set: Australia* 3-6 4-2 Great Britain (*denotes server): Kyrgios resists the urge to pound a return at the net, instead opting for a heavily spun forehand down the tramlines. De Minaur has a similar reply to Salisbury\u2019s next serve with a shot along the opposite side and it\u2019s 0-30. They trade points to 30-40 and Salisbury serves a let, and then a good one that prompts a wide-ranging, high-pressure rally which ends on an anti-climax via a GB error. Second set: Australia* 3-6 3-2 Great Britain (*denotes server): Australia are starting to find a way around the Great Wall of Britain. There has to be a Trump joke in there somewhere. Kyrgios lets loose a big serve and de Minaur smacks the return so hard it\u2019s uncatchable. De Minaur hustles thrice to block quickfire volleys, and the collective display of reflex is astounding. But it\u2019s not enough to stop Britain breaking back. Second set: Australia 3-6 3-1 Great Britain* (*denotes server): Britain get off the mark and we\u2019re back to Kyrgios\u2019 serve. When you get an early break ... Second set: Australia* 3-6 3-0 Great Britain (*denotes server): A soft Murray return to de Minaur\u2019s second serve makes easy pickings for Kyrgios. De Minaur is struggling to place his first serves but he manages one while up 40-15 - even if they do lose the point. The next one is simple and serve is held. Second set: Australia 3-6 2-0 Great Britain* (*denotes server): Murray belts another smashed volley and it\u2019s 30-15, but Australia make it 30-30 and then Kyrgios makes Salisbury run, first out wide and then back the other way as Murray simultaneously makes a rare mistake at the net. Then, unbelievably, he makes another as Australia patiently prodded away through a lengthy rally. A valuable break to get the hosts back in this match. Second set: Australia* 3-6 1-0 Great Britain (*denotes server): In the first set Murray and Salisbury hit 15 winners and two unforced errors. Not bad at all. That said, Australia hold here to love. First set: Australia 3-6 Great Britain* (*denotes server): After a frenetic green-and-gold start, the first set belongs to Team GB. Nothing is breaching the British forecourt fortress and a frustrated Kyrgios whips one into the net. Is captain Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s selection backflip looking so wise now? First set: Australia* 3-5 Great Britain (*denotes server): The Brits are targeting de Minaur\u2019s serve. Australia go down -30 after Salisbury returns with interest and the Demon swipes high and wide. Salisbury is a monster at the net. Impenetrable. He improves on his next serve, not so quick but placed with sufficient authority to put Murray off and force an error. Murray is more alert the next time around and he steers a top-spinner down the tramlines and out of reach as de Minaur drops a second service game with only a point won. First set: Australia 3-4 Great Britain* (*denotes server): Murray is doing well on his first serve, and GB are soon up 40-15 as de Minaur\u2019s return is punished by Salisbury at the net. The Aussies rally to 40-30 but that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. First set: Australia* 3-3 Great Britain (*denotes server): Kyrgios holds his serve to love in less than a minute. Up 40-0, he whispers to de Minaur behind the two balls in his claws, undoubtedly tactics. He doesn\u2019t need them, for his final serve is too much. First set: Australia 2-3 Great Britain* (*denotes server): For the first time in this first set Britain are in front. They steal this game to love, de Minaur thrashing a serve into the net. First set: Australia* 2-2 Great Britain (*denotes server): The Brits come forward and hunt in a pair at the net, smothering Australia\u2019s attempts to play their baseline game. They\u2019re up 40-15 and Kyrgios and de Minaur are switching spots, getting the runaround as Murray and Salisbury ping volley after volley. The Brits break back and show they won\u2019t be overawed. First set: Australia 2-1 Great Britain* (*denotes server): GB can\u2019t let this game slip. Australia are hyped up and firing on all cylinders and a double break may as well mean ceding the set. This is a must-hold game, and hold they do. First set: Australia* 2-0 Great Britain (*denotes server): Down 0-30, Kyrgios serves and maintains the aggression. His partner is at the net to put away the reply and Team GB capitulate. First set: Australia 1-0 Great Britain* (*denotes server): Well well. Any concerns about the endurance of de Minaur can be put to bed right away. Three quickfire winners from the Demon and Australia have already broken GB. They player are out warming up and we have another email, this time from James Evans. Yes, before you ask, there is a relation. \u201cWill most definitely be following the below, after witnessing an epic match by Dan, my nephew,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat win should see him back in Dubai next month.\u201d At the very least, he\u2019s now resting, which is more than we can say about de Minaur. Call it youthful exuberance, but he\u2019s about to put himself through it all again. GB have won the toss and elected to serve. Here we go. The deciding doubles rubber is coming right up. Plenty of eyebrows are being raised by Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s selection u-turn; having Kyrgios in his current mood back on court will at the very least be entertaining. An email! \u201cEvenin\u2019 Emma! I imagine it\u2019s just me out here,\u201d writes Adam Hirst in Rio. \u201cGreat effort from Evans there\u2026 great match all round really\u2026 and that win puts him at 31 in the live rankings, so into the top 32 for Melbourne possibly! Still some way to go to confirm it, other players below still playing in tournaments\u2026 but being seeded for that would be a boost.\u201d Peers is ranked 25 in the world in doubles and was the 2017 Australian Open men\u2019s doubles champion. Just saying. Well, well, well. How about this? Australia have decided to switch up their doubles team: The wisdom of that will become apparent before too long, but how on earth can De Minaur back up after his exertions over the past three and a half hours? Seems crazy! Well that was one of the more remarkable matches you\u2019ll see, period. Tremendous endorsement for the ATP Cup. Dan Evans and Alex de Minaur battled for nearly three and a half hours. The final set alone was 82 minutes. The former can claim bragging rights but both well and truly gave everything. Here\u2019s what Evans had to say of an Australian opponent who pushed him all the way: He\u2019s higher than me in the rankings. He\u2019s a better player than me. This is what team competition is about. It\u2019s a great rivalry and great support.\u201d It\u2019s all on the line now in the doubles where Jamie Murray &amp; Joe Salisbury will take on Chris Guccione &amp; John Peers, with the prospect of a semi-final match-up against Rafael Nadal\u2019s Spain, the tournament favourites and recent Davis Cup winners. Third set tie-break: Evans* 7-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): It\u2019s Evans\u2019 fifth match point and a let forces another go at his first serve. De Minaur wallops the ball out and that\u2019s that. After all the drama and emotion, the finish is almost confusing, anti-climactic. There\u2019s a split-second before Evans realises he\u2019s done it. Then it\u2019s game, set and match. Thoroughly deserved. Third set tie-break: Evans 5-2 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Henman told him to go for the forehand but it\u2019s a monster backhand that brings Evans to 4-2. And he makes a mockery of de Minaur\u2019s serve, sending him one way and flicking the other. This is looking very much like Team GB\u2019s match now. Third set tie-break: Evans 3-2 de Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur is already down 2-0 in the tie-break but with a flourish and a short drop shot he\u2019s back to 2-1. Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 6-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Four match points saved! Pressure is all on de Minaur now. Hold serve and claim set and match, and Australia progress through to the semi-finals. Drop this game and Team GB level with the doubles to play. De Minaur is 15-30 down and lashing hard, flat shots in quick succession before approaching the net for a volley and ... can\u2019t scoop it over. But the Australian counters a deep Evans forehand with a backhand that saves one match point, then two via a pile-driver of a forehand to draw level at deuce. Evans doesn\u2019t back down, driving an aggressive volley down court followed by a put-away for a third match point. Seconds later it\u2019s a third match point saves. The pendulum swings again as a de Minaur error gifts Evans a fourth match point. He aces. Saves a fourth. Lets out a roar. Back to deuce. Evans misplaces a down-the-line backhand. Advantage Australia. De Minaur catches the net but the ball doesn\u2019t go over. Deuce. De Minaur faults, then goes for it on the second serve to the point the man in the black down the other end has no response. Advantage Australia. And just when we thought this epic could produce no more, the 20-year-old nails a cross-court winner to hold serve. We\u2019re going to a tie-break. Third set: Evans* 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 6-5 de Minaur (*denotes server): Three hours this pair have been on court now at Ken Rosewall Arena, and what a mesmerising show they\u2019ve delivered. Evans appears in discomfort but still negotiates a searing de Minaur return and sends it back with interest. De Minaur, meanwhile, holds his nerve down 40-15 to take it to deuce and earn himself a break point which he promptly throws away by hitting a return into the net. Evans holds the advantage now and, after one fault, has enough on his second serve to engender another Aussie ball in net. Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 5-5 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Team GB captain Tim Henman spends the break telling Evans he has \u201cpermission to pull the trigger at any stage on your forehand.\u201d He unleashes a full-stretching hook smash, but de Minaur stays in the zone and hangs onto his serve - and the match. Third set: Evans* 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 5-4 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans administers three points that are about as close to perfection as one can desire. And 40-0 down, de Minaur requests and is granted a short break to remove the shoelaces from his right shoe which have broken amid all the drama. But he\u2019s having trouble threading the new laces through as his foot shakes uncontrollably up on a chair. Hewitt holds his foot steady. That\u2019s what captains are for. It makes little difference in the end as de Minaur bundles a shot into the net and Evans holds. Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 4-4 de Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur holds with ease. Who ever said team tennis isn\u2019t exciting. Third set: Evans* 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 4-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): Never write off a kid with his head down and his eyes on the prize. In a controversial discussion point, the umpire gives Evans a time violation despite him rushing back and already practically serving as the countdown hit zero. His first serve is taken off him at 30-30. De Minaur capitalises and breaks back and we\u2019re back on serve. This match just keeps on giving. Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 4-2 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans\u2019 Team GB posse are offering words of encouragement. \u201cBig push mate,\u201d they tell their compatriot. And push he does the serving de Minaur, who double faults the first point and undoes all the good work from the previous game by giving Evans multiple break points. De Minaur uses his last challenge trying to claim an Evans\u2019 shot is long of the baseline but Hawkeye shows it\u2019s 1mm in. Still, the Aussie persists and yet another backhand winner - he\u2019s tallied 16 to Evans\u2019 six - makes it 30-40. No matter, Evans reigns in the next point. And here\u2019s the full report of that shock result at the Brisbane International: Third set: Evans* 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 3-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): What were we saying about errors? Evans makes one on serve at 30-30 and gifts de Minaur a break point. But de Minaur has no chance of returning his next serve, which was a bit of a rocket, and it\u2019s deuce. Ad Evans. Back to deuce. Evans approaches for the volley and de Minaur returns low but with just enough venom that the Brit mucks up his forehand volley. Deuce. Ad Evans. Deuce.More tussling and tangoing and de Minaur, as he has done throughout this riveting, see-saw match, forces Evans to take that extra shot. Ad de Minaur. Evans dispatches a rare missed first serve and his second isn\u2019t strong enough to stop the Demon unleashing a cracking backhand to break back. Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 3-1 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans has taken the most risks throughout this affair and de Minaur played it a little safer. Sometimes it means additional errors, as in two of the three first points of this game that allow de Minaur to sail to 40-0. At others, it manifests in a build-up and winner that doesn\u2019t give his opponent time to blink, like when he rallies back to 40-15. And sometimes it forces his opponent to step up another gear, as de Minaur did to hold this particular game. Third set: *Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 3-0 de Minaur (*denotes server): The wind is in the British sails now. Has de Minaur got what it takes to deflate them and hit back straight away? Not with Evans serving as he is. An ace down the T at 40-15 up brings up a three-game advantage for Great Britain and leaves Australia with it all to do now. Third set: Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 2-0 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Clearly buoyed by how that last game ended, Evans manages to bring up a break point in this next game, much to the delight of his pumped up teammates on the sidelines. But de Minaur is more than equal to it, lunging to reach a perfectly executed volley at the net. The Australian\u2019s radar is off a point later as he seeks to close out the game \u2013 he challenges, unsuccessfully \u2013 and we go again. Evans brings up another break point and this time he takes it, sparking a flurry of congratulatory chat from his teammates. \u201cGreat pressure mate, all over \u2018im! Great stuff Evo!\u201d Advantage GB. Third set: *Evans 7-6(7-4), 4-6, 1-0 de Minaur (*denotes server): And with impeccable timing, Channel Nine conks out, just as the third and deciding set is about to get underway. A black screen is all I have to go off, so not much chance of telling you what happened in the first four points of the game. Sorry about that. But we\u2019re back with images now and De Minaur is 40-15 up. Evans manages to save one of those break points before he runs around a forehand to fire a winner down the line and level things up at deuce. Another forehand winner later and Evans stands on the brink of holding. Out comes a big serve which de Minaur can\u2019t return and the momentum the Australian held at the outset dissipates. Tremendous fight from Evans there. Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 4-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): This game is essentially the previous game in reverse. De Minaur has three set points at 40-0 before Evans pushes him back to deuce. Hewitt and Evans share some words between points. We imagine they weren\u2019t very nice. Maybe it\u2019s just coincidence but when play resumes de Minaur absolutely nails a forehand for the advantage and then unloads another to seal the game and set. A nightmare scenario materialises for Barty as she loses the second set on a tie-break and the match to Jennifer Brady, the American qualifier. The world No 1 falls 6-4, 7-6(7-4) to the 24-year-old from Pennsylvania in a huge upset. Might the long lead-in time to the match have played its part in Barty\u2019s demise? More to come on that one, surely. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 4-5 de Minaur (*denotes server): Hmmm, not so fast. Evans is clearly determined to close out this match and rushes 40-0. No sooner have blinked than de Minaur makes it deuce, sealed by a drop shot that caught Evans utterly and completely off guard. To be fair, he returns the favour with a glorious angled winner to take the advantage. De Minaur gives him one back. Then, blimey. An Evans shot has de Minaur pulls so far out of court he has to put extra on his response to offset the acute angle. The manner with which he does so has Lleyton Hewitt and Nick Kyrgios wide-eyed and open-mouthed in the stands. The pair trade advantages and there\u2019s a bee\u2019s whisker in this. De Minaur elicits a thumbs-up from Evans when he reigns supreme in a superb rally. In the end, though, Evans stays strong and denies his Australian opponent a second break. Nick Kyrgios is a happy camper. There can be no doubting the Australian, who put his team into a 1-0 lead earlier on, is absolutely loving this tournament and the team format. He laughed and joked his way through the rubber against Cam Norrie and played with a joy that is sometimes lacking from his game. \u201cOur team\u2019s got each others\u2019 backs,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cOne of my good friends Jordan Thompson was here today so that made me play a bit better. But I love the team event. Rusty [Lleyton Hewitt] is the best captain and all the teammates supporting each other, being there for one another and it\u2019s paying off.\u201d Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 3-5 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans executes a short shot that sneaks just over the net and nestles inside the line. He thinks it\u2019s good enough, until de Minaur races down for a straight-barrelled shot down the line. This game plays host to some classic high-stakes tennis complete with dummy runs and sneaky slices, and it\u2019s a half-volley from Evans that takes the score to deuce. But de Minaur holds his nerve and the game, and can now win the set if he breaks in the next game. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 3-4 de Minaur (*denotes server): We do love a lob! De Minaur\u2019s approach shot to the baseline was inch-perfect but Evans matched and then raised him one with a high ball over his head to draw ahead 30-15. One Evans backhand winner and one de Minaur smash later and we\u2019re at 40-30. The game, in the end, belongs to Evans. And while there\u2019s still just one game in this set Australia are well and truly back in the mix. Toe-to-toe stuff. De Minaur must ensure he doesn\u2019t allow errors to creep in as he did in the first set. Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 2-4 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Phew. Crisis averted as de Minaur fights back from two break points and two advantages before a bullet serve is too much for Evans and he holds serve. It didn\u2019t start so positive for the Aussie. There\u2019s nothing wrong with two top-draw, top-spin forehands but Evans is handed a favour when his reply nicks the net and sneaks over just out of reach. Patient aggression in the subsequent two rallies helps the Brit to 15-40 but de Minaur denies him the break and pushes to deuce. Suddenly Evans is at the net defending himself against a barrage of brutal shots, the last of which he\u2019s simply no chance. De Minaur can\u2019t close out the first advantage but he\u2019s good for the second. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 2-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): Some fancy Australian footwork gives de Minaur an early advantage, but then he challenges Evans\u2019 serve and alas, it\u2019s nicked the line. Evans starts to feast at the baseline and slice, slice, slice, before de Minaur bottles his shot and the game. Ash Barty in trouble. Meanwhile, up in Brisbane, things aren\u2019t going entirely to plan for Australia\u2019s top player. The world No 1 has dropped the first set of her WTA tournament opener having been made to wait until today to play. American qualifier Jennifer Brady, who saw off Maria Sharapova in her opener on an outside court earlier this week, took the first set 6-4, heaping the pressure on Barty\u2019s shoulders as she now seeks to recover and avoid a disappointing and unexpected early exit. Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 1-3 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Crucial game and the key for both is to hold their respective nerves. De Minaur attempts to up the ante on a long baseline rally and is rebuffed by the net, but Evans smashes a shot out in the next point and we\u2019re back at 15-15. De Minaur takes the third point and a robust forehand forces another Evans error. One ace later and thank you very much, de Minaur is doing some damage. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 1-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans down 15-30 and a simple return from de Minaur prompts a wayward shot. Can the 20-year-old break for Team Australia and dig himself out of this hole? Of course he can. Evans has him running back towards the baseline but the Brit isn\u2019t expecting the ball to come back and out of reach. Second set: Evans 7-6(7-4) 1-1 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Welcome back de Minaur. Just when we thought he was on the backfoot he holds his service game to love, forcing his combatant into two errors on the way. Second set: Evans* 7-6(7-4) 1-0 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans races ahead to 30-15 but can do nothing about a searing backhand from de Minaur that nestles right on the baseline in the back corner. Nonetheless, he maintains composure with a winner of his own for 40-30 and takes the game courtesy of an unforced error from the Australian. Afternoon all. Right, Evans has taken a much-needed first set for Team GB and given de Minaur a lot to do in the second. Right, that\u2019s a good time for me to pass on the baton to Emma Kemp. Thanks for your company today. First set: Evans* 7-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Superbly constructed point from Evans crafts two set points for Great Britain. Then de Minaur dumps a return into the net and the set is Evans\u2019! Tiebreak: Evans 7-4 de Minaur First set: Evans 6-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans immediately snatches a mini-break back after de Minaur nets following a superb rally, reminiscent of the opening couple of games earlier in the match. Tiebreak: Evans 5-4 de Minaur First set: Evans* 6-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans wins his first point easily but then he is blown off court by a rasping return winner. De Minaur back on serve. Tiebreak: Evans 4-3 de Minaur First set: Evans 6-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur still looks bothered by that missed smash but he pulls it together on his own serve. Tiebreak: Evans 3-2 de Minaur First set: Evans* 6-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Wow! de Minaur misses the smash! A total fresh air swing to an Evans lob lost in the new canopy of the Ken Rosewall Arena. Kyrgios has issues with it earlier in the morning, and now this absolute shocker. His pain is doubled when Evans benefits from a very fortunate net cord to move up 2-0. Tiebreak: Evans 2-0 de Minaur First set: Evans* 6-6 de Minaur (*denotes server): Evans races to 30-0 but de Minaur steps it up with a scintillating one-two punch, first a lob fizzing with topspin, then a leaping crosscourt backhand that practically took the line with it on its way to 30-15. That\u2019s as good as it gets for de Minuar though and Evans holds to 15. Tiebreak. First set: Evans 5-6 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Evans has snatched for a couple of winners earlier in rallies than he perhaps has needed to, and he does so again in de Minaur\u2019s latest service game, handing his opponent a quick and easy hold. Again Evans will serve to say in the set. First set: Evans* 5-5 de Minaur (*denotes server): Both players open cautiously in a game of vital importance but de Minaur still manages to overshoot the runway. He returns to his power game to level but some excellent Evans serving takes him out to 40-15 with two shot points. A thrilling leaping overhead backhand from de Minaur intercepts a well-targeted lob, adding a frisson to the contest. Evans senses the change in energy and is handed a violation for taking too long over his serve, a point he subsequently loses. No bother. Evans controlled deuce off his racquet to level at 5-5. First set: Evans 4-5 de Minaur* (*denotes server): At 15-15 de Minaur seems to be getting into his head a little but Evans searches unnecessarily for a winner to gift 30-15, then an ace gives the Australian some breathing space. A comprehensive smash means Evans will walk away from the changeover needing to hold serve to remain in the set. First set: Evans* 4-4 de Minaur (*denotes server): You know when a rally\u2019s good on this court without even needing to open your eyes because the sound of the players\u2019 sneakers squeaking is its own symphony. The best rally since game three ends in favour of Evans, who presses home his advantage to move to 40-0 despite de Minaur thrashing a return to his toes. A second ace keeps us level pegging. First set: Evans 3-4 de Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur needs an easy, steadying service game, and he gets it, holding to love, sealing the deal with a thumping forehand. First set: Evans* 3-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): \u201cActions speak louder than words\u201d Henman tells Evans at the change, focussing his charge while he engages in running dialogue with the Australian bench. The Briton is benefiting from an increasing number of errors creeping into de Minaur\u2019s game, a fluffed return at 30-15 in particular a missed opportunity. Evans holds to return to parity after trailing 0-3 early. If Kyrgios plays like he did today for the remainder of January he\u2019ll make tennis a front page sport in Australia. First set: Evans 2-3 de Minaur* (*denotes server): There\u2019s an urgency to de Minaur that makes for compelling watching. He reaches the ball a fraction before you expect and his racquet comes through quicker than you\u2019re prepared for, and when he loads up the big forehand crosscourt it\u2019s got more oomph than you\u2019d imagine for a man his size. That said, he leaks from 15-0 to 15-40 with some needless errors and despite clawing back to 30-40 he fails to defend the second break point when Evans pummels a forehand down the line. A welcome break of serve for Great Britain and a disappointing game for de Minaur. First set: Evans* 1-3 de Minaur (*denotes server): Henman talks of \u201ctargets\u201d and \u201cpoints on your terms\u201d to Dan Evans at the change of ends, and he gets a few cheapies to settle any nerves. After those epic opening two games the match has dipped into a much more error-strewn contest. First set: Evans 0-3 de Minaur* (*denotes server): A comparatively straightforward service hold for de Minaur in the circumstances and Australia race into a 3-0 advantage. First set: Evans* 0-2 de Minaur (*denotes server): Already this match has settled into a rhythm of long technical rallies. From one of those, lasting 28-shots, De Minaur puts away a volley to move to 0-30. Evans digs in and drills a Federer-like single-handed pass after another gruelling exchange to tie things up at 30-30. A rare unforced error from de Minaur offers Evans game point but another superb demonstration of hitting from both men ends with deuce. This is glorious tennis, full of tempo changes and precision stroke-making. Evans pulls out his best serve of the match at deuce to gain a second game point but de Minaur\u2019s hustle sees it off. Evans gets another look but de Minaur refuses to relent. A third game point is saved with a monstrous forehand return then the Australian seizes the initiative with a forehand-backhand one-two punch. This has been a wonderful game, de Minaur\u2019s returning in particular exceptional. And it earns him an early break! The pressure on the Evans serve was too much and, with both men already red faced and sweating profusely, de Minaur steals an early march. Evans likes a bit of chirp. This will be worth keeping an eye on. First set: Evans 0-1 de Minaur* (*denotes server): Right from the off, the opening point is very structured and deliberate, both players using a range of strokes, spins and slices, before Evans finds the net with a volley coming into the net. There\u2019s a pause while the video review confirms a de Minaur foot fault, a delay preceding two more punishing rallies that end the way of the Australian, the second of which culminating in a superb winner from de Minaur that hit the corner with him at full stretch on his forehand side. He serves out a love game comfortably. Here we go, de Minaur to serve. This should be an interesting match-up. Neither player is likely to blast the other off court (a la Kyrgios) with both earning reputations for their court coverage of variety of strokes. Rankings-wise de Minaur should be favoured, but there\u2019s only a few hundred points separating the pair in the live standings. As with the opening match this pair have met just once before with the advantage going the way of the Great Briton at last year\u2019s Rogers Cup. Attention now turns to Dan Evans v Alex de Minaur. That was brutal from Nick Kyrgios. That\u2019s the kind of form that gets tennis fans so excited. The serving (11 aces, just one break) was imposing, never allowing Norrie to settle. Then there was the variety - the one underarm serve, the drop shots, the angles - showing his all-round talent. Norrie never looked at the races, lacking rhythm on serve and routinely hitting groundstrokes long. His frustration spilled over in the first set leading to a cracked racquet, and he looked beaten in the second long before the scoreboard determined it as fact. Second set: Norrie 2-6, 2-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Ace. Ace. Ace. Let. Let. Return error. Game. Set. Match. Kyrgios. Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 2-5 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Can Norrie build from this? No. He recovers from 0-30 to 30-30 courtesy of an unfamiliar edgy-looking Kyrgios but some weak serving opens the door for his rival to blow his whole house down. Another break of serve and now Kyrgios is one hold of serve away from an emphatic opening win. Second set: Norrie 2-6, 2-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios moves to 30-15 with his seventh ace of the match and 40-15 with a thunderbolt wide to Norrie\u2019s forehand. The Briton stays in contention with the help of a net cord then comes out on top in a rally Kyrgios thought he had in his pocket to engineer deuce. That rally contained Kyrgios failing to punish a smash that he may have lost in the unfamiliar lighting of this arena\u2019s new canopy. Norrie does well to force a second deuce, then a third, capitalising on Kyrgios getting too cute with his drops. A break follows after the left-hander controls a long rally, but it doesn\u2019t last for long, the Australian dumping down an emphatic ace. A double-fault, Kyrgios\u2019 fifth, gives Norrie his sixth break point of the match - and finally he takes one! For only the second time this tournament Kyrgios is broken. Can Norrie build from this? Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): There\u2019s a new contender for rally of the match, and finally the crowd is audible, after both players scurried around the court playing improvised shots to keep the ball in play. Kyrgios greeted his eventual winner with a double fist-pump and a little shimmy, then wins the next point to move 0-30 up. It could be more but in VAR snafu territory the video review camera on the service line was not working to confirm or deny a Norrie foot-fault. Norrie gets to 15-30 and in control of the next rally but a despairing Kyrgios retusn ball after ball, the sound of his Nike sneakers screeching on the court reverberating around Ken Rosewall Arena. Unfamiliar hustle from the Australian but a reminder he has it in his locker. Once more, only one of multiple break points are required with a sumptuous dropped volley closing out another thoroughly entertaining game. Second set: Norrie 2-6, 1-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): The one area of Kyrgios\u2019 game that needs some refinement today is his timing coming into the net. Norrie passes him again after the Australian tried to come in on his second serve. The players then exchange unforced errors but Norrie\u2019s comes after at least engaging Kyrgios in a rally. He does so again next point, and extracts another error to glimpse an opening. Opening closed. What a player. Kyrgios again comes in on his second serve and Norrie hits a smart return right on the Australian\u2019s toes; not to worry, a drop-shot of rare class is his answer, taking the game to deuce. But the tension doesn\u2019t end there. Kyrgios double-faults with an overly aggressive pair of serves, both marginally wide. Norrie then has an opportunity to pass but doesn\u2019t connect well from the baseline and Kyrgios puts the smash away like a volleyballer accepting a precise set. Tired of the game dragging on, Kyrgios wheels out the cannon and kabooms a couple of monster serves, the second ending with a full throated roar of approval. Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): A nondescript opening to the game sees Norrie 40-0 ahead but he\u2019s serving with a lack of rhythm that eventually comes back to haunt him with a double-fault. The latest in a long line of overhit forehands brings Kyrgios back into the contest and he earns deuce with the rally of the match, pulling Norrie left and right with fierce thwacks, then drawing his opponent in with a subtle drop shot, eventually ending the torture with a simple overhead. Oh dear, this is getting ugly for Norrie now, another unforced error long gifts a break point, and the limpest second serve dribbles into the net for a double-fault. Five points in a row to Kyrgios and he\u2019s a break up after barely paying attention to the first three points of the game. This match will not last much longer I fear. Second set: Norrie 2-6, 1-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Shot of the match so far from Norrie, a crosscourt passing shot from deep in his forehand corner with Kyrgios at the net. The Australian swats the adversity away with four powerful serves and some intimidating movement on his side of the net. He is playing like a boxer controlling the centre of the ring and Norrie is so far not meticulous enough to work around him. Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): \u201cPick your targets, come on\u201d is Henman\u2019s advice to Norrie as he serves first in the second set. It\u2019s quickly followed by \u201cbad luck, never mind\u201d as a neat Kyrgios drop shot brings the game back to 15-15. Unforced errors are traded for 30-30 before Norrie controls a rally to engineer space to put away a crosscourt backhand then serve unreturnably to hold. It\u2019s so nice to see Kyrgios enjoying his tennis. He flourishes in team environments. First set: Norrie 2-6 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Brutal serving from Kyrgios, thumping ball after ball through Norrie like a 1980s West Indian fast bowler obliterating a tail. A comprehensive first set to the Australian. First set: Norrie* 2-5 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Norrie is unraveling a little here, striking groundstrokes long repeatedly and struggling with his serve. Kyrgios is remorseless, moving up 0-30 with another crosscourt forehand hit with ferocious power. A Norrie error gifts three break points, but Kyrgios needs only one. I am smiling broadly and almost giggling at that winner. Running in from the baseline and skimming his racquet along the blue rebound ace the Australian hit a flicked stone-skimmer of a shot, full of disguise, that Norrie could only watch in awe. This has been a demonstration of all Kyrgios\u2019 range of talent so far. A joy to watch. First set: Norrie 2-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios slips to 0-30 then misses his first serve. No bother, just a 199kph second-serve ace. But he follows that up with a second double-fault of the game to hand Norrie two break points. The Great Briton fails to take either, the second flying wildly off his racket as a long rally was starting to take shape. Another unforced error at deuce ends with Norrie throwing his racquet away in disgust, forcing him to jog to the far corner of the court to unzip his kit bag and pull out a replacement. It\u2019s first use is for an angry return that sails long to gift Kyrgios the hold. First set: Norrie* 2-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Norrie\u2019s first serve is roughly as fast as Kyrgios\u2019 second serve, meaning there are fewer cheap points on offer for the Briton and more long rallies. Kyrgios finally prevails in one of those to go up 15-30 but Norrie responds with a counterpunch forehand to exploit space Kyrgios left behind eschewing a backhand for a forehand. \u201cGet on the attack\u201d encourages Henman to his left-handed charge, but he is powerless to resist Kyrgios moving to his third break point - and he takes it - Norrie thrashing a forehand wide when the winner was on offer. It\u2019ll be a long way back into this set from here for Team GB. First set: Norrie 2-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Aye aye! Trademark Kyrgios. He races to 40-0 with a couple of booming serves and a well-placed drop shot then seals the deal with AN UNDERARM SERVE that catches Norrie off-guard. Magnificent entertainment from the Australian. First set: Norrie* 2-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Much better hold from Norrie, winning to love with a game full of intensity and hustle forcing Kyrgios into a series of errors. First set: Norrie 1-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Big confidence booster for Norrie, winning the opening point on Kyrios\u2019 serve, passing the Australian after he tried to serve and volley. The big-serving entertainer responds with four straight points complete with sizzling serves, massive runaround forehands, and a thrilling leaping two-handed crosscourt backhand winner. Kyrios has only dropped serve once all tournament so far. First set: Norrie* 1-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): The opening point of the match is a long rally that will test out the ability of these players to go full tilt in this thick Sydney air. Norrie takes it, but he then slips 15-40 behind with consecutive double faults, both of which were way off target. Kyrgios then misses wide with his return to a half-paced second serve to see off the game then fades a forehand nervously into the net for deuce. Real let-off for Norrie, and he takes advance, steering another long rally then hammering an ace to secure the opening game. The absence of proper uniforms does give the air of an exhibition. Australia, despite the mixture of apparel sponsors, at least look like a team with their gold shirts and green shorts. Norrie has won the toss and will serve first. Still plenty of seats available by the looks of things. Organisers must have wished a marquee match-up like this landed in the bracket allowing an evening session. Drilling down a little on Norrie v Kyrgios before tie one gets underway... This is only the second time they\u2019ve met in competition, Norrie taking their inaugural meeting a couple of years ago after Kyrgios retired with injury in the second set. Whenever Kyrgios is in action it\u2019s customary to focus on the importance of his serve. He is ranked by the ATP as the fifth-best in the sport, so if he brings his A game he will be hard to overcome. But Norrie is a canny returner and a fierce scrapper who will relish taking on such a combustible opponent. Time for a sing song in Ken Rosewall Arena. Australia patiently standing through their former and current national anthems. While Australia, led by Lleyton Hewitt, are benefiting from one of those spells in Kyrgios\u2019 career where we all cross our fingers and toes and hope the prodigious talent stays this focussed for the remainder of his career. Alongside him in the singles is Alex de Minaur, a quintessentially Australian sportsman, and a player who would not look out of place in the top ten before the end of the season. Great Britain, under the leadership of Tim Henman, have proven a tight-knit and resilient bunch so far this ATP Cup. Australia has an abundance of quality tennis centres and the 10,000 capacity Ken Rosewall Arena is right up there with the best following the completion of a canopy roof in time for the ATP Cup. Weather and air quality: It\u2019s mild and humid in Sydney today with temperates in the mid-20s. There\u2019s a southerly wind that\u2019s bringing smoke into the city from the fires burning in southern NSW, meaning the air conditions are not great. The official forecast is for the air quality to be \u201cpoor\u201d, meaning the air is \u201cunhealthy for sensitive people, and could cause symptoms, especially in people with heart or lung disease.\u201d But there\u2019s also an hourly alert in place indicating that because of particles pm10 \u201ceveryone, especially people with heart or lung disease should avoid outdoor exertion and stay inside as much as possible. If you have symptoms rest and use your reliever medicine. If symptoms persist, seek medical advice.\u201d The tennis community is acutely aware of the risks posed by Australia\u2019s poor air quality. Is the ATP Cup a success? That will be the question that dominates column inches in the space between the men\u2019s tennis caravan departing Sydney and alighting in Melbourne for the Australian Open. It is stating the obvious that it makes little sense for a tournament like this to be so close in the calendar to its rival for the mantle of World Cup of Tennis - November\u2019s Davis Cup Finals. And the anecdotal evidence from crowds is that Perth\u2019s tennis fans have missed the convivial Hopman Cup, while the scheduling in Brisbane between the ATP and WTA Tours has confused a few in Queensland, not least Maria Sharapova. But then, once the idea of an ATP Cup was floated around this time of year, it was an opportunity Tennis Australia were never going to pass up. It remains to be seen how the players respond, whether the event carries the prestige of a supposed World Cup, and if there\u2019s a $$$ return on the ATP\u2019s investment. Hello everybody and welcome to live game-by-game coverage of the first ATP Cup quarter-final between Great Britain and Australia. After taking in the delights of Perth and Brisbane during the group phase, the action has relocated to Sydney for the knockout stage, specifically Ken Rosewall Arena in the Olympic Park precinct. Action gets underway at 10am local time (11pm UK). There are three matches scheduled for the tie, beginning with Cameron Norrie v Nick Kyrgios, followed by Dan Evans v Alex de Minaur, and finishing with the doubles where Jamie Murray &amp; Joe Salisbury will take on Chris Guccione &amp; John Peers. The winners of this quarter-final will face the likely - and unenviable - prospect of a semi-final with tournament favourites and recent Davis Cup winners Spain. Rafael Nadal and co may slip up in the last eight tie against Belgium, but after storming through the group phase with a 9-0 unbeaten record, that seems fanciful. Based on pre-tournament rankings GB and Australia were rated the 17th and 18th best teams in the draw, meaning both can be pleased with their progress so far, irrespective of their performance today. But the hosts will be favoured to make it to the last four after streaking a tough Group F, going unbeaten against the likes of Alex Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Denis Shapovalov. With ta partisan crowd behind them the mercurial Kyrgios and nuggety de Minaur will be hard to beat. GB by contrast finished top of Group C by set countback after finishing level with Belgium and Bulgaria on two wins apiece, and level again with the Belgians on six match victories. Under the leadership of Tim Henman Great Britain have coped well with the absence of the injured Andy Murray, not to mention not being able to call up on Kyle Edmund, a man ranked 14 in the world this time last year, but now struggling for form.

Then again, perhaps letting your private transport conglomerate rake in obscene profits while the world chokes on its exhaust fumes is entirely appropriate. Transport Fever 2 doesn\u2019t need to be a firebrand vehicle for climate activism, but having such themes inform the systems more closely would give it a little more personality and relevance. As it stands, this is a pleasant if not particularly distinctive game that may provide frustrated commuters with hours of transport therapy.",

It is arguably one of the best smart TV boxes available.</p> <p>But it is not a good smart speaker. Irritating volume fluctuations and a decidedly average speaker make it worse than a separate Echo Dot. The home entertainment equipment control is likewise poor. It works fine enough for turning on your TV for the Fire TV interface, but is inconsistent for other devices and can\u2019t replicate enough functionality via voice that you don\u2019t need to routinely reach for the original remote. It\u2019s irritating more than it is useful once the novelty has worn off.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say Alexa doesn\u2019t work very well at controlling the Fire TV interface, playback of shows by name and quickly jumping to a particular point in a movie. But you can do that just fine using the mic button on the remote \u2013 the same remote and capability you get with the Fire TV Stick 4K which costs less than half the price.</p> <p>The Fire TV Cube is still significantly cheaper than most of the competition, but if you want the combo of an Amazon smart TV box and an Alexa smart speaker, buy the Fire TV Stick 4K with an Echo Dot and save \u00a310 or more.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> fast, comprehensive audio and video support, most streaming services including YouTube and Apple TV, Alexa remote, voice control of Fire TV interface</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no BT Sport, variable volume output bad as a smart speaker, device control more trouble than it\u2019s worth, more than twice the price of Fire TV Stick 4K</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5140f5f4597140d565432dbf9d1e1cf17323e61b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5140f5f4597140d565432dbf9d1e1cf17323e61b/704_342_3569_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon fire tv cube review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back of the Cube has a microUSB socket takes the optional, but included in the box, ethernet adapter if your wifi isn\u2019t up to scratch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/sky-q-2019-review-price\">Sky Q 2019 review: premium TV at a premium price</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/14/virgin-v6-tv-review-tv-recorder\">Virgin V6 TV review: jack of all trades, master of none</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

For comparison, the Fire TV stick costs \u00a339.99, the Fire TV stick 4K costs \u00a349.99, the Nvidia Shield costs \u00a3149.99 and the Apple TV 4K costs \u00a3179. Verdict The Amazon Fire TV Cube is an excellent smart TV box, supporting a wide selection of apps and services, video and audio standards and with snappy, lag-free performance. It is arguably one of the best smart TV boxes available. But it is not a good smart speaker. Irritating volume fluctuations and a decidedly average speaker make it worse than a separate Echo Dot. The home entertainment equipment control is likewise poor. It works fine enough for turning on your TV for the Fire TV interface, but is inconsistent for other devices and can\u2019t replicate enough functionality via voice that you don\u2019t need to routinely reach for the original remote. It\u2019s irritating more than it is useful once the novelty has worn off. That\u2019s not to say Alexa doesn\u2019t work very well at controlling the Fire TV interface, playback of shows by name and quickly jumping to a particular point in a movie. But you can do that just fine using the mic button on the remote \u2013 the same remote and capability you get with the Fire TV Stick 4K which costs less than half the price. The Fire TV Cube is still significantly cheaper than most of the competition, but if you want the combo of an Amazon smart TV box and an Alexa smart speaker, buy the Fire TV Stick 4K with an Echo Dot and save \u00a310 or more. Pros: fast, comprehensive audio and video support, most streaming services including YouTube and Apple TV, Alexa remote, voice control of Fire TV interface Cons: no BT Sport, variable volume output bad as a smart speaker, device control more trouble than it\u2019s worth, more than twice the price of Fire TV Stick 4K Other reviews Sky Q 2019 review: premium TV at a premium price Virgin V6 TV review: jack of all trades, master of none",

The second, encompassing 2% of women, was a \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d category \u2013 with characteristics including a greater probability of sexual coercion, STI diagnoses, various aspects of sexual dysfunction and abortion.</p> <p>For women, all five categories of poorer sexual health were linked to distress and lower satisfaction with their sex life, relative to having good sexual health, while for men only sexual function problems were linked with higher distress.</p> <p>\u201cMen don\u2019t seem to be similarly affected by exposure to STIs,\u201d said Parkes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to bother men quite so much as women.\u201d</p> <p>Some characteristics were found to be common to different categories of poorer sexual health, such as depression, while drug and alcohol use, and first sexual experiences at an early age were linked to many categories of poor sexual health across the sexes.</p> <p>There were also specific differences between categories: for example women with low interest in sex tended to be older, while the prevalence of different relationship styles varied across categories.</p> <p>While the study does not reveal cause and effect, the authors say it suggests that policies that tackle issues underpinning many categories may improve a broad range of sexual health problems, and that particular interventions could be tailored to certain groups.</p> <p>Dr Peter Greenhouse of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was not surprising that women experienced a more diverse and higher rates of sexual health problems, not least because of unwanted pregnancies, painful conditions including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/sep/28/what-is-endometriosis-guide\">endometriosis</a>, greater risk of sexual coercion and STIs usually being transmitted more easily from men to women.</p> <p>He also pointed out that the data for the new study was collected several years ago, and therefore it did not capture the impact of dating apps such as Tinder on sexual ill-health.</p> <p>But he said the scale of the disparity between men and women\u2019s sexual ill-health \u201cscreams out\u201d of the study, highlighting the need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/30/sexual-disease-gonorrhoea-health-cuts-local-authority-sexually-transmitted\">reverse cuts to sexual health services</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe clinics have never been weaker than they are now, just when they need to be stronger, and even better resourced for women because of this disparity,\u201d he said.</p>",

The second, encompassing 2% of women, was a \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d category \u2013 with characteristics including a greater probability of sexual coercion, STI diagnoses, various aspects of sexual dysfunction and abortion. For women, all five categories of poorer sexual health were linked to distress and lower satisfaction with their sex life, relative to having good sexual health, while for men only sexual function problems were linked with higher distress. \u201cMen don\u2019t seem to be similarly affected by exposure to STIs,\u201d said Parkes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to bother men quite so much as women.\u201d Some characteristics were found to be common to different categories of poorer sexual health, such as depression, while drug and alcohol use, and first sexual experiences at an early age were linked to many categories of poor sexual health across the sexes. There were also specific differences between categories: for example women with low interest in sex tended to be older, while the prevalence of different relationship styles varied across categories. While the study does not reveal cause and effect, the authors say it suggests that policies that tackle issues underpinning many categories may improve a broad range of sexual health problems, and that particular interventions could be tailored to certain groups. Dr Peter Greenhouse of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was not surprising that women experienced a more diverse and higher rates of sexual health problems, not least because of unwanted pregnancies, painful conditions including endometriosis, greater risk of sexual coercion and STIs usually being transmitted more easily from men to women. He also pointed out that the data for the new study was collected several years ago, and therefore it did not capture the impact of dating apps such as Tinder on sexual ill-health. But he said the scale of the disparity between men and women\u2019s sexual ill-health \u201cscreams out\u201d of the study, highlighting the need to reverse cuts to sexual health services. \u201cThe clinics have never been weaker than they are now, just when they need to be stronger, and even better resourced for women because of this disparity,\u201d he said.",

Thought patterns and eating habits become engrained \u2013 physically, emotionally and psychologically. By the time I became pregnant, I\u2019d been \u201crecovered\u201d for a few years and \u201cin recovery\u201d for several before that. But pregnancy was the first time in 15 years I felt hungry. During pregnancy, our bodies need more fuel and water \u2013 creating a baby is physically laborious. Having trained myself as a teenager to ignore the sensation, I did not recognise it at first. Eventually I came to remember the feeling, and that eating helped.</p> <p>In a way, pregnancy was an antidote to anorexia. Having been through IVF, with so much time to mentally prepare and so much at stake, I relished my growing bump and everything it symbolised. My body was supposed to look different.

It wasn\u2019t simply the perpetual \u201cbaby body\u201d chat. When I looked back, the ingredients for my near-relapse were amassed during pregnancy. Enforced eating habits had been normalised again. I\u2019m supposed to stick within normal limits for the first two trimesters and increase my calorie intake by 200 in the last? No problem.

Caroline Davies writes that the Sussexes have said they will seek to become financially independent, though it is unclear how; and their move is seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghans-move-signals-slimmed-down-future-for-royals\">unprecedented in modern times</a>, with comparisons being drawn to the abdication of Edward VIII.

Gardiner, 62, told the Guardian last night: \u201cI am considering running and will decide in the next 24 hours.\u201d It would make him the seventh declared candidate. Gardiner is understood to have been encouraged to stand as an alternative leftwing candidate by MPs concerned that Rebecca Long Bailey\u2019s campaign has stuttered. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is racing ahead in popularity among members, with a mounting number of official nominations. Gardiner, the MP for Brent North, has held his seat since 1997 and was a junior minister under Tony Blair.

Administrators have told 300,000 investors they have lost nearly a fifth of their money. Woodford\u2019s flagship fund, once worth more than \u00a310bn, fell below \u00a33bn as investors rushed to withdraw their money after a series of poorly performing picks. In full-year accounts issued on Tuesday, the company blamed press coverage for the fund\u2019s demise as well as Woodford\u2019s poor stock-picking. A Woodford spokesperson said: \u201cThe accounts relate to the financial year before the equity income fund was suspended. We can confirm that the partners did not take any profits or income during the fund\u2019s suspension, nor was any management fee earned from managing Woodford Patient Capital Trust.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Insecure future for children \u2013 </strong>New research estimates more than 100,000 children are living in London without secure immigration status, despite more than half of them being UK-born.

The findings were condemned by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. The research warns the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/100000-children-in-london-without-secure-immigration-status\">number of undocumented young people could surge</a> if an estimated 350,000 young European nationals are not helped to apply for post-Brexit settlement.

After 10 films, X-Men fatigue was settling in, but The New Mutants was pitched as something different. Not only would it be the first scary movie in the universe but it would introduce a host of never-before-seen-on-screen characters \u2013 Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy), Wolfsbane (Maisie Williams), Cannonball (Charlie Heaton), Sunspot (Henry Zaga), and Danielle Moonstar, AKA Mirage (Blu Hunt) \u2013 and trap them in a haunted asylum, a juicy prospect that was enough to pique interest. The director Josh Boone pitched the story, based on the <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-the-new-mutants-the-demon-bear-saga-was-so-groundbreaking\">Demon Bear </a><a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-the-new-mutants-the-demon-bear-saga-was-so-groundbreaking\"> arc</a> by the writer Chris Claremont and the relatively avant-garde artist Bill Sienkiewicz, as the start of a trilogy, one that would later introduce characters like Karma and Warlock. The movie was scheduled for release on 13 April 2018.</p> <p>But by January, the cracks started to show. The film was pushed way back to February 2019 and then to August 2019 to make space for Deadpool 2 and Dark Phoenix, respectively. Per the Tracking Board, the <a href=\"https://www.tracking-board.com/inside-the-drama-surrounding-foxs-new-mutants-including-a-top-secret-new-cast-member-exclusive/\">studio wanted the film reworked</a> to be even scarier, to capitalize on the new horror wave started by Get Out and It.

Fans noted that both the casting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/12/features\">Alice Braga as Dr Cecilia Reyes</a> and <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-mutants-movie-has-found-its-sunspot-but-why-ar-1795586698\">Henry Zaga as Sunspot</a> erased their identities as Afro-Latinx characters and perpetuated issues of colorism \u2013 already oft spoken about <a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2018/7/10/17554856/x-men-storm-dark-skinned-actress-colorism-alexandra-shipp-halle-berry\">in regard</a><a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2018/7/10/17554856/x-men-storm-dark-skinned-actress-colorism-alexandra-shipp-halle-berry\"> to Storm</a>. Comparing character redesigns and colorings across comic book runs can be fraught, but canonically all three have been portrayed as darker-skinned in their earliest incarnations. This seems like an unfortunate misstep that goes against the nature of the story itself, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/12/features\">Stan Lee told the Guardian in 2000</a> that the X-Men were a direct metaphor \u201cfor what was happening with the civil rights movement\u201d.

In the comics, the demonic bear that killed Dani\u2019s parents stalks and nearly kills her, and when the bear comes to finish the job, the New Mutants throw down in a hospital. It\u2019s a horror story that is, at its core, about the importance of friendship, family and the ties that bind \u2013 and aren\u2019t the best horror tales often about that? With rumors that New Mutants will feature a <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/could-the-new-mutants-give-us-one-of-marvels-first-big-1840712424\">romance between Dani and Wolfsbane</a>, it\u2019s easy to see how Boone (who directed The Fault in Our Stars) could ground a more nightmare-inducing adaptation in a tale of young love. Does that make The New Mutants automatically good? Not necessarily, but it\u2019d mark the film as more unique than the vast majority of city-leveling X-Men films, and put it more in line with standalones like Logan and Deadpool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3663cde8ed51c0ee80ecf8baebbdf99fd5d3e3e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3663cde8ed51c0ee80ecf8baebbdf99fd5d3e3e9/0_0_1366_730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maisie Williams in The New Mutants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"534\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maisie Williams in The New Mutants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marvel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The New Mutants also has the benefit of a cast of fresh faces. A rather thorny issue with the X-Men films as a whole is how poorly they\u2019ve juggled their vast stable of characters, focusing primarily on the same white, often male, leads. While the original 2000 X-Men had a unique, gritty, indie quality to it \u2013 terrified loner Rogue meets gruff father figure Wolverine \u2013 the subsequent films got lost in the sauce, repeatedly centering Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto, and then to a lesser extent, Jean and Mystique, to the detriment of literally everyone else in the X-verse. Rogue\u2019s powers went mostly unexplored; Jubilee is never named on camera; the <a href=\"https://colorwebmag.com/2018/04/04/darwin-shouldnt-have-died-in-x-men-first-class-an-angry-retrospective/\">omega-level Darwin</a> was easily killed; Kitty Pryde\u2019s comic book role was handed to Wolverine in Days of Future Past; Storm and <a href=\"https://www.themarysue.com/give-emma-frost-her-own-damn-movie/\">Emma Frost were underutilized</a>; the list goes on. To put it frankly, the core X-Men films suffered from a profound lack of imagination, and though they\u2019re ensembles, not a single one of their 12 films can boast a character of color as the primary lead. Isn\u2019t it disappointing that the franchise that was built on the importance of being different was too afraid to be different itself?</p> <p>This is what The New Mutants, warts and all, has going for it: Blu Hunt\u2019s Dani Moonstar is the first Native American to lead a comic book film, a fact that\u2019s gotten buried in all the scheduling conflicts and reshooting drama. Though Hunt\u2019s casting <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/marcusjones/the-latest-additions-to-new-mutants-have-spawned\">also fueled some concerns of colorism</a>, it remains a notable leap forward. There\u2019s an opportunity \u2013 a hope \u2013 that Boone and the other writers on the film also fixed the problems of the original Demon Bear story (Dani turns into a damsel in distress, and the Demon Bear inexplicably turns two white characters into Native Americans) and let Dani be the true lead in her own tale.</p> <p>That the sun will set on this entire Fox franchise right as the studio landed on Dani as a lead feels particularly tragic. Despite being fantastical tales of aliens, monsters, superhumans and robots, nearly all comic book films have issues around primarily favoring the stories of white characters, and/or casting light-skinned or white-passing actors. The New Mutants, at the very least, foregrounds an indigenous woman of color, who literally wrestles with her heritage and legacy, all while developing a newfound family at Xavier\u2019s school. It stands a good chance of being a fun one-off film, but the brass tacks of it all is that Dani Moonstar deserved better, as all the X-Men of color deserved better.</p> <p>Hopefully Disney will see the value in Dani\u2019s story and keep her around, or at least greenlight future X-Men projects focused on lesser-seen characters from the get-go. If Disney ends up rebooting with Professor X and Magneto again, while pushing off all the characters of color until a third phase (a la Black Panther), The New Mutants will forever be remembered as a landmark casting, but also a tragic example of too little, too late.</p>",

Once an undocumented child turns 18, they face the threat of deportation to a country they may never have visited.</p> <p>Undocumented people can include those who arrived in the UK with proper documentation but who stayed beyond their permitted time, those who entered without proper documentation, trafficked children, unaccompanied minors whose temporary leave to remain was withdrawn once they reached adulthood and young people born to parents who are themselves undocumented.</p> <p>The research found that more than half of the UK\u2019s estimated 674,000 undocumented adults and children live in London.

Instead, the report has reviewed previous research and analysed all available data to come up with a conservative estimate.

      "bodyText": "New research estimates that more than 100,000 children are living in London without secure immigration status, despite more than half of them having been born in the UK. Children who are undocumented may face problems accessing higher education, health care, opening bank accounts, and applying for driving licences, housing and jobs. The findings were condemned by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, as a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. The study, commissioned by the mayor and undertaken by the University of Wolverhampton, estimated that there were around 107,000 undocumented children and 26,000 18- to 24-year-olds in London. Once an undocumented child turns 18, they face the threat of deportation to a country they may never have visited. Undocumented people can include those who arrived in the UK with proper documentation but who stayed beyond their permitted time, those who entered without proper documentation, trafficked children, unaccompanied minors whose temporary leave to remain was withdrawn once they reached adulthood and young people born to parents who are themselves undocumented. The research found that more than half of the UK\u2019s estimated 674,000 undocumented adults and children live in London. It warns that the number of undocumented young people could rise dramatically if the estimated 350,000 young European nationals in the UK are not helped to apply for the EU Settlement Scheme that will enable them to remain after Brexit. Assessing the size of Britain\u2019s undocumented population is inevitably a challenging process, since there is no official data and it requires counting people outside most formal systems. Instead, the report has reviewed previous research and analysed all available data to come up with a conservative estimate. The study suggests that the population of undocumented migrant children has grown by 56% between March 2011 and March 2017. The report highlights the high cost of regularising immigration status. \u201cThe Windrush scandal has exposed the barriers facing people who have lived in the UK for many years, including a complex application process, a lack of awareness of the system, cuts to legal aid and the high cost of applications \u2013 with the high court last month deeming as \u2018unlawful\u2019 a government decision to charge \u00a31,012 to register children as British citizens,\u201d the report states. \u201cSince 2012, only 10% of families with undocumented children in the UK have applied to secure their immigration status.\u201d This finding echoes research by the Let us Learn campaign group published last year, which found that the cost of renewing an application for a resident with limited leave to remain has increased by 238% in five years \u2013 from \u00a3601 per person in 2014 to \u00a32,033 in January 2019.

      "body": "<p>To visit Dr Dirk Obbink at Christ Church college, Oxford, you must first be ushered by a bowler-hatted porter into the stately Tom Quad, built by Cardinal Wolsey before his spectacular downfall in 1529. Turn sharp right, climb a flight of stairs, and there, behind a door on which is pinned a notice advertising a 2007 college arts festival, you will find Obbink\u2019s rooms. Be warned: you may knock on the door in vain. Since October, he has been suspended from duties following the biggest scandal that has ever hit, and is ever likely to hit, the University of Oxford\u2019s classics department.</p> <p>An associate professor in papyrology and Greek literature at Oxford, Obbink occupies one of the plum jobs in his field. Born in Nebraska and now in his early 60s, this lugubrious, crumpled, owlish man has \u201cwon at the game of academia\u201d, said Candida Moss, professor of theology at Birmingham University. In 2001, he was awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award for his expertise in \u201crescuing damaged ancient manuscripts from the ravages of nature and time\u201d. Over the course of his career, he has received millions in funding; he is currently, in theory at least, running an \u00a3800,000 project on the papyrus rolls carbonised by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79.</p> <p>Since he was appointed in 1995, Obbink has welcomed many visitors into his rooms at Christ Church: dons, undergraduates, researchers. Less orthodox callers, too: among them, antiquities dealers and collectors. In the corner of Obbink\u2019s study stands a pool table, from which two Egyptian mummy masks stare out impenetrably. Its green baize surface is all but obscured by papers and manuscripts \u2013 even, sometimes, a folder or two containing fragments of ancient papyrus. One bibliophile remembers a visit to this room, \u201clike the set of an Indiana Jones movie\u201d, a few years ago. He was offered an antique manuscript for sale by a man named Mahmoud Elder, with whom Obbink owned a company, now dissolved, called Castle Folio.</p> <p>One blustery evening towards the end of Michaelmas term, 2011, two visiting Americans climbed Obbink\u2019s staircase \u2013 Drs Scott Carroll and Jerry Pattengale. Both worked for the Greens, a family of American conservative evangelicals who have made billions from a chain of crafting stores called Hobby Lobby. At the time, the family was embarking on an ambitious new project: the Museum of the Bible, which opened in Washington DC in 2017. Carroll was then its director. Items for the Green collection were bought by Hobby Lobby, then donated to the museum, bringing a substantial tax write-off. Pattengale was the head of the Green Scholars Initiative, a project offering academics research opportunities on items in the Green collection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/07/a-scandal-in-oxford-the-curious-case-of-the-stolen-gospel-podcast\">A scandal in Oxford: the curious case of the stolen gospel \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Greens, advised by Carroll, were buying biblical artefacts, such as Torahs and early papyrus manuscripts of the New Testament, at a dizzying pace: $70m was spent on 55,000 objects between 2009 and 2012, Carroll claimed later. The market in a hitherto arcane area of collecting sky-rocketed. \u201cFortunes were made. At least two vendors who had been making \u20ac1-2m a year were suddenly making \u20ac100-200m a year,\u201d said one longtime collector.</p> <p>That wintry evening, Carroll and Pattengale were making one of their occasional trips to seek Obbink\u2019s expertise on matters papyrological. <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/june-web-only/first-century-mark-pattengale-inside-saga.html\" title=\"\">According to Pattengale</a>, just as they were about to leave, Obbink reached into a manila envelope and pulled out four papyrus fragments, one from each of the gospels. Obbink told them that three of these scraps dated from the second century AD.</p> <p>But the fourth, a fragment of the Gospel of Mark \u2013 a 4cm by 4cm scrap the shape of a butterfly\u2019s wing, containing just a few broken words \u2013 was earlier than that. It was almost certainly from the first century AD, which would make it the oldest surviving manuscript of the New Testament, copied<strong> </strong>less than 30 years after Mark had actually written it. Conservative evangelicals<strong> </strong>place enormous weight on the Gospels as \u201cGod-breathed\u201d words. The idea that such an object existed was indescribably thrilling. Carroll was \u201cecstatic\u201d, Pattengale recalled. \u201cVeins along his neck bulged. He paced with arms flailing.\u201d</p> <p>Carroll, who declined to be interviewed, has said that Pattengale\u2019s account is full of \u201cmisrepresentations, misrecollections, and exaggerations\u201d. <a href=\"http://evangelicaltextualcriticism.blogspot.com/2019/06/scott-carroll-responds-to-christianity.html\" title=\"\">But he has confirmed this</a>: Obbink showed him the Mark fragment \u201con the pool table in his office \u2026 and he then went into some paleographic detail why he believed it must date to the late-first century \u2026 It was in this conversation that he offered it for consideration for Hobby Lobby to buy.\u201d</p> <p>No purchase was made at the time. Nevertheless, the objects did eventually end up being sold to the Greens, after Carroll left their employ in 2012. The vendor, or so it appears, was Dirk Obbink. His name, and seemingly his signature, appear on a purchase agreement with Hobby Lobby dated 4 February 2013.</p> <p>The problem is that the items \u2013 if the purchase agreement is genuine \u2013 were not Obbink\u2019s to sell. They are part of the Oxyrhynchus collection of ancient papyrus, owned by the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) and housed at Oxford\u2019s Sackler Library.</p> <p>Thirteen additional fragments from the collection, it transpired this autumn, had also been sold to the Greens, 11 apparently by Obbink in 2010, and two by a Jerusalem-based antiquities dealer, Baidun &amp; Sons. (A spokesperson for the company\u2019s owner, Alan Baidun, says he was an agent acting in good faith, and that he checked the provenance supplied by the person who sold them to him.)</p> <p>Six further fragments from the Oxyrhynchus collection have turned up in the possession of another collector in the US, Andrew Stimer, a spokesperson for whom says he acquired them in good faith, and with an apparently complete provenance (though parts of it have subsequently been <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/hobby-lobby-scandal-widens-as-museum-of-the-bible-admits-oxford-prof-sold-illicit-papyri-to-green-family\" title=\"\">shown to have been falsified</a>). The dealer who sold them to Stimer told him they had come from the collection of M Elder of Dearborn, Michigan. That is, Mahmoud Elder, Obbink\u2019s sometime business partner. (Elder did not respond to requests for comment. Both the Museum of the Bible and Stimer have cooperated fully with the EES, and have taken steps to return the fragments.)</p> <p>In total, the EES has now discovered that 120 fragments have gone missing from the Oxyrhynchus collection over the past 10 years. Since the appearance, in June 2019, of that fateful purchase agreement and invoice bearing Obbink\u2019s name, the scale of the scandal has taken time to sink in. What kind of a person \u2013 what kind of an academic \u2013 would steal, sell, and profit from artefacts in their care? Such an act would be \u201cthe most staggering betrayal of the values and ethics of our profession\u201d, according to the Manchester University papyrologist Roberta Mazza.</p> <p>The alleged thefts were reported to Thames Valley police on 12 November. No one has yet been arrested or charged. Obbink has not responded to interview requests from the Guardian, and has issued only one public statement. \u201cThe allegations made against me that I have stolen, removed or sold items owned by the Egypt Exploration Society collection at the University of Oxford are entirely false,\u201d he has said. \u201cI would never betray the trust of my colleagues and the values which I have sought to protect and uphold throughout my academic career in the way that has been alleged. I am aware that there are documents being used against me which I believe have been fabricated in a malicious attempt to harm my reputation and career.\u201d</p> <p>It seems that Dr Dirk Obbink is either a thief,<strong> </strong>has been caught up in a colossal misunderstanding, or, perhaps most shockingly of all, is the victim of an elaborate effort to frame him.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A case for Inspector Morse, perhaps. But the real detectives in this case have been a transatlantic band of papyrologists, theologians, classicists and biblical scholars, who have turned their deductive and evidence-sifting professional skills to the mystery. For them, what started as intellectual curiosity has turned into something more like a crusade against the perversion of the ethics of their field.</p> <p>This band of scholarly sleuths, who have published their findings in books and on blogs and social media, includes the<strong> </strong>theologian Candida Moss; Brent Nongbri, a scholar of early Christianity based at the Norwegian School of Theology; Mazza, whose investigations have sometimes made her feel, she said, as if she were in a Coen brothers\u2019 movie; and the contributors to a blog called Evangelical Textual Criticism. The last, a forum \u201cfor people with knowledge of the Bible in its original languages\u201d, has not, until now, had much call for \u201cbreaking news\u201d banners.</p> <p>All these academics have, for different reasons, a strong interest in the Oxyrhynchus collection \u2013 half a million ancient papyrus fragments that have transformed knowledge of the Greco-Roman world. The fragments were excavated in Egypt, from 1896 onwards, by two Oxford classicists, Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt. A hunch led them to dig out some low mounds in the village of el-Behnesa, the site of the ancient Greek city of Oxyrhynchus, founded after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC. To their delight, they hit upon rubbish dumps in which 700 years\u2019 worth of papyrus had been discarded. The papyrus, preserved by the desert-dry conditions, was covered in writing \u2013 mostly Greek, the earliest from the third century BC.</p> <p>Grenfell and Hunt\u2019s discoveries forged an extraordinary, direct link with antiquity. Most of the oldest surviving manuscripts, had, until then, come from no earlier than the 10th century. What classical literature there was \u2013 for example, just seven out of over 120 plays by Sophocles \u2013 had survived because medieval monks had thought it worth preserving, copying it over and over again down the generations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5be6a566bd2384a37ff8ae6dbacc6243f8cf29ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be6a566bd2384a37ff8ae6dbacc6243f8cf29ea/0_232_3613_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Dirk Obbink working on papyrus at the Sackler Institute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Dirk Obbink working on papyrus at the Sackler Institute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geraint Lewis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Oxyrhynchus, though, an entire culture was revealed in the rubbish, unfiltered by monkish taste, and dating directly from antiquity: previously lost works by canonical writers such as Sappho, Pindar, and Menander; fragments of biblical texts; letters, bills, receipts, tax returns, even magical spells. Legally, under the colonial conditions of the time, the fragments became the property of the Egypt Exploration Fund (now Society) and were taken to Oxford, where for years, they were simply kept in boxes in Grenfell and Hunt\u2019s rooms in Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, as the scholars, then their successors, started to sift, edit and publish them.</p> <p>Oxyrhynchus spawned a whole new sub-discipline of classics: papyrology. More than a century after the discoveries, one of papyrology\u2019s main tasks is to publish these scrappy manuscripts. That involves offering a proposed reconstruction of a text; translating and dating it; and producing a commentary on its significance. Over the past century, just over 5,000 of the half-million Oxyrhynchus papyri have been published. Each appearance of a volume in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri Series \u2013 there are now 83 \u2013 is a real event for classicists, historians, theologians. \u201cThey redraw the map of what we know,\u201d said Tim Whitmarsh, professor of Greek at Cambridge.</p> <p>To be a papyrologist \u2013 to tease sense from damaged, ancient, near-illegible writing \u2013 you need to possess linguistic brilliance, a profound historical imagination, and a codebreaker\u2019s ability to play with different hypotheses of a text\u2019s meaning. It is patient, painstaking work \u2013 but also, exciting. It offers the thrill of discovery. One papyrologist told me, \u201cI could have spent my career thinking about old chestnuts like the terminal date of Caesar\u2019s command, or whatever. But what I love is reading stuff that no one has read before.\u201d</p> <p>Today, the Oxyrhynchus collection is held in a back room on the first floor of Oxford\u2019s Sackler classics library, where you\u2019ll see a scholarly mess of paperwork, microscopes and books. The collection\u2019s walls are lined with tall, locked cupboards, filled with ranks of boxes. Open one, and you will see the dark-brown papyrus, astonishingly tough given its age, still wrapped in 1910s and 20s pages of the university newspaper, the Oxford Gazette. Some fragments are large, even up to A4 size; many are tiny, known as \u201ccornflakes\u201d in the trade.</p> <p>The Oxyrhynchus project is its own little fiefdom. Not exactly secretive, but very far from open, it carries the reputation of being cultish, even within the Oxford classics faculty. At any one time, up to three general editors share the duties of working on the material and assigning it to scholars for study and publication. Until 2016, Obbink was one of that trio of editors, with 24-hour-access. A curator-researcher also works day-to-day with the material. Researchers are employed to help; scholars come in and out to study the material. It is Obbink, rather than anyone else, on whom suspicions have focused.</p> <p>There is a rough, handwritten catalogue of the entire collection, on 12cm by 7cm index cards, as well as photographs, which gives a rough indication of what each fragment contains. Editors have not usually been forthcoming about the details of the unpublished material, fearing an onslaught of interested academics. For scholars outside the charmed circle, who wonder what gems lie in wait, that can be frustrating. For a criminal, it might create an opportunity. The fewer people who know what is in the collection, the easier it might be to pilfer from it.</p> <p>When the EES announced in October that index cards and photos had, in many cases, disappeared along with the missing fragments themselves, the scale of the alleged crime began to become clear. Any lingering suggestion that all this had been some colossal misunderstanding was blown aside. Whoever had stolen the fragments had tried to erase any trace of their existence, so that the crime would never come to light. \u201cDestroying the catalogue records \u2013 that\u2019s such an anti-intellectual thing to do, it blows the mind,\u201d said Candida Moss.</p> <p>However, the alleged thief seems to have erred in one crucial respect: they do not seem to have known, or taken into account, that there was back-up information allowing the EES to ascertain what had allegedly been stolen. (The EES has remained silent on the nature of this backup, but prior to digitisation, libraries would photograph card-index catalogues and transfer the images to microfiche.)</p> <p>Despite that apparent oversight, one thing is close to certain: the items were taken by someone familiar with the collection\u2019s inner workings. Which means \u2013 colossal a betrayal as that would be \u2013 the crime was almost certainly an inside job. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After Carroll and Pattengale\u2019s visit to Oxford in 2011, tantalising rumours of the discovery of a first-century fragment of Mark rippled through American evangelical circles. On 1 February 2012, in Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina, two theologians, Prof Bart Ehrman and Dr Daniel Wallace, were debating \u2013 to a rapt audience of 1,500 \u2013 whether the original text of the New Testament could be recovered. Suddenly, Wallace dropped a bombshell.</p> <p>\u201cThe oldest manuscript of the New Testament is now a fragment of Mark\u2019s Gospel that is from the first century,\u201d he claimed. \u201cMy source is a papyrologist who worked on the manuscript, a man whose reputation is unimpeachable.\u201d It was, recalled Ehrman at a recent conference in San Diego, \u201ca real jaw-dropper\u201d.</p> <p>Ehrman was bursting with questions. How extensive was the fragment? Who was the papyrologist? Had the dating been corroborated by others? Wallace said he was sworn to secrecy. All he could reveal was that the fragment would soon be published by the academic imprint, Brill.</p> <p>A few months later, Brill did indeed announce a new publication: the Green Scholars Initiative Papyri Series, edited by Obbink and Pattengale, a series of volumes of \u201crare unpublished papyri texts from the Green collection\u201d. The mystery fragment of first-century Mark, then, must belong to the Greens, Ehrman reasoned. The only problem was that the fragment \u201cwasn\u2019t published that year, and it wasn\u2019t published the next year, and it wasn\u2019t published the next year,\u201d said Ehrman. \u201cI started to feel like it was the parousia [Christ\u2019s second coming] \u2013 it\u2019s coming soon, but we don\u2019t know when.\u201d</p> <p>For the scholar sleuths \u2013 as they would soon become \u2013 alarm bells started ringing. Where had this fragment come from? Why the secrecy? Was it legal? The trade in antiquities is governed by laws designed to protect artefacts from two things. First, the kind of mass removal of cultural heritage that was a feature of the colonial era. Second, illegal excavation and looting of archaeological sites, acts that involve an irreparable loss of knowledge, and, like many criminal trades with a high-value product, are run on human exploitation and violence. Buyers of artefacts, therefore, are supposed to establish provenance: proof that the item was legally removed from its country of origin, usually before 1970, when a Unesco convention on cultural heritage was widely adopted. The Greens, it was becoming apparent to observers, were not doing that. In 2017, for example, a consignment of ancient Iraqi cuneiform tablets they had purchased was found to have been smuggled into the US as \u201ctile samples\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the absence of solid information about the fragment of Mark and its origin, gossip proliferated. A widely reported claim was that it had emerged from an ancient Egyptian mummy mask. Obbink\u2019s sometime visitor Scott Carroll, whose lecture style is more 19th-century showman than sober scholar, was speaking publicly about mummy masks a lot at the time, claiming they were a great source of early New Testament papyri. Because some mummy masks had been manufactured from a kind of papier-mache of recycled papyrus, known as \u201ccartonnage\u201d, you could, he told audiences, dissolve the masks in soap and warm water, prise the constituent sheets of papyrus apart and, hey presto, reveal early manuscripts \u2013 fragments of the Gospels, of Homer, whatever. \u201cMy wife will laugh and remember the time she would come into the house and smell mummy on the stove,\u201d Carroll told an audience in Mexico, in 2013. \u201cNothing like the smell of mummy on the stove.\u201d</p> <p>All the talk of dissolving mummy masks horrified serious scholars: destroying artefacts in the speculative search for other ancient artefacts is not exactly museological best practice. Those with a cynical cast of mind also observed that mummy masks were a great way to launder illegally procured papyri. All you had to do was claim you had found your dodgy papyrus manuscript in a legally acquired ancient mummy mask. (Such masks were relatively widely produced in antiquity; today, you can find them on eBay.) Mummy masks could be turned into \u201cbottomless provenance machines\u201d, as one collector put it.</p> <p>The scholar-sleuths began to trawl the internet looking for more videos of Carroll and those close to him, on the hunt for further information about the mystery Mark fragment. One video showed a talk by an evangelical author called Josh McDowell, an associate of Carroll\u2019s: in it, he revealed that the fragment of Mark was from the Gospel\u2019s first chapter. That seemingly tiny piece of information would, later, turn out to be a crucial clue in putting together the story of the alleged thefts from the Oxyrhynchus collection. In 2017, yet another video was ferreted out by scholar-sleuths, and was reposted on the Evangelical Textual Criticism blog. In it, Carroll \u2013 about whom there is no suggestion of misconduct in this regard \u2013 says that he had seen the fragment of Mark, in \u201cOxford at Christ Church, and actually on [Obbink\u2019s] pool table\u201d. The fragment, he said, actually hadn\u2019t come from a mummy mask, as far as he could tell. It was, however, for sale.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Dirk Obbink cuts an eccentric figure, even by Oxford standards. In 2014, around the time his antiquities dealership Castle Folio was incorporated, he bought himself a castle. Or, rather, the Texan equivalent \u2013 an 1890s neo-Gothic pile in Waco, called Cottonland Castle. He already had a six-bedroom house in Oxford\u2019s suburbs, in the garden of which he had dug a large, L-shape swimming pool \u2013 an upgrade from the canal boat he had once shared with a colleague.</p> <p>He has a reputation for elusiveness. \u201cIf Dirk says: \u2018See you,\u2019 I know I won\u2019t clap eyes on him for weeks,\u201d said one papyrological colleague. In the early 2000s, he held the chair of papyrology at the University of Michigan \u2013 a full-time job \u2013 but failed to resign from Oxford, leaving colleagues \u201cprofoundly disappointed by his conduct\u201d, according to a senior US-based classicist. It didn\u2019t seem to matter. \u201cIn certain institutional contexts, you somehow become untouchable,\u201d one professor of classics told me.</p> <p>At the same time, Obbink is, in some ways, a standard-issue Oxford don \u2013 head in a book, limited social skills, \u201can absent-minded professor type\u201d, as one collector called him. He added: \u201cI have a hard time believing that he stole Oxyrhynchus papyri in cold blood and sold them to Hobby Lobby.\u201d</p> <p>In January 2014, Obbink had a moment of media glory, when he discovered and published two new fragments of poems by the seventh-century BC poet Sappho. It was global news. \u201cA Sappho poem,\u201d as the Telegraph\u2019s headline put it, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10607569/A-new-Sappho-poem-is-more-exciting-than-a-new-David-Bowie-album.html\" title=\"\">is more exciting than a new David Bowie album</a>\u201d. At the time, the story, at least as it was reported by me and others, was all about the thrill of precious new words by a great poet. It was left to experts in the illegal traffic of antiquities to point out that the \u201cnew\u201d Sappho was not just a tender poem about her brothers \u2013 but also, and importantly, an ancient artefact. One archaeologist-blogger posted a different kind of headline: \u201cNo-Questions-Asking UK Academic Reads a Freshly Uncovered Ripped-up Papyrus from Unknown Source.\u201d</p> <p>Now, in the light of the revelations of the alleged thefts of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, scholars are looking at the Sappho story with new eyes, and asking, with a fresh sense of urgency, whether the manuscript can have been legally obtained. There are even doubts as to its authenticity. The latest gossip in classical circles is that it might even be a fake. \u201cEverything about it seems too good to be true,\u201d one senior Cambridge classicist told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0e938024bc3053d094a8602cd0d266f636d16fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0e938024bc3053d094a8602cd0d266f636d16fd/0_0_3613_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Dirk Obbink at the Sackler Institute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Dirk Obbink at the Sackler Institute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geraint Lewis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Doubts about the Sappho papyrus have niggled away at scholars because Obbink\u2019s account of how it was acquired \u2013 all the time reporting, he said, what he had been told by its nameless owner \u2013 has been at best sketchy, and at times contradictory. At first, in January 2014, he revealed only that the Sappho papyrus was owned by an anonymous private collector in London. Then, in February, he said the manuscript had come from \u201ca mummy cartonnage panel\u201d. It had been carbon-dated, he said, to AD201, plus or minus a century. For expert Egyptologists, though, that was a red flag. Both things \u2013 mummy cartonnage and a date of AD100-300 \u2013 cannot be true. Papyrus ceased to be used to make mummy cartonnage in around AD14.</p> <p>In January 2015, the story changed. The Sappho manuscript hadn\u2019t been found in mummy cartonnage, after all, but \u201cindustrial cartonnage\u201d, perhaps used for bookbinding. This \u201cindustrial cartonnage\u201d, with the Sappho supposedly hidden within it, had been purchased by auction at Christie\u2019s in 2011, as part of a mixed lot of papyrus. This new information conveniently solved the dating problem, since industrial cartonnage was still being made during the period to which the Sappho manuscript had been carbon-dated. The detail about the Christie\u2019s auction also suggested the item was legal \u2013 the papyrus in that particular lot had been exported from Egypt prior to the 1970 Unesco convention on the export of artefacts.</p> <p>Obbink published an explanation of how the two types of cartonnage had come to be confused. A piece of mummy cartonnage and a piece of industrial cartonnage had been dissolved together by the owner\u2019s staff, he said, and the resulting sheets of papyrus got muddled up. Obbink also reported that at some point some 20 smaller fragments of the Sappho manuscript had been \u201cdeemed insignificant\u201d by the anonymous owner, and sold off to the Greens.</p> <p>In this entire story of the origins of \u201cP.Sapph.Obbink\u201d \u2013 to use the manuscript\u2019s scholarly nomenclature \u2013 there was no solid evidence, no documentation, no images, and no external witnesses. Nor did Christie\u2019s possess relevant images of its auction lot of 2011 \u2013 the mixed lot of papyrus containing the piece of industrial cartonnage in which the Sappho fragment was supposedly concealed. Everything depended on the word of the great Oxford don.</p> <p>Now, Mike Sampson, a papyrologist at the University of Manitoba, has found evidence, seen by the Guardian, suggesting that the origin-story of the Sappho manuscript reported by Obbink may be a fiction. Sampson was sent a PDF by an academic source. The document is a glossy, lavishly illustrated brochure produced by Christie\u2019s. It advertises the Sappho fragment for sale by private treaty. A \u201cprivate treaty sale\u201d is a service whereby an auction house will broker a sale between vendor and buyer discreetly, outside the relatively public auction schedule. (The document is quite separate from the 2011 auction, and was produced some time after it.) The brochure will have been circulated very discreetly, too, to a few key collectors. Sampson has analysed the metadata of the PDF, and believes that the Sappho fragment was in fact probably offered for sale by private treaty twice \u2013 once in 2013, prior to the public announcement of its existence, and again in 2015. (No price is mentioned, but a collector familiar with the field estimates a likely figure of around $800,000.)</p> <p>In the brochure, there are, at last, images that purport to show how the two different types of cartonnage \u2013 mummy cartonnage and industrial cartonnage \u2013 were confused. One picture shows a brightly painted blue-and-red piece of mummy cartonnage lying in a ceramic basin beside a brown mass of what appears to be flattened papyrus, described as \u201ccartonnage\u201d. The caption recaps the final story reported by Obbink \u2013 that the two items were muddled up in a \u201cconfusion of processing\u201d. However, in the opinion of Sampson, it \u201cdefies belief\u201d that the entirely different objects could have been confused. Furthermore, because of the physical condition and measurements of the brown papyrus mass in the photograph, he thinks it unlikely that the Sappho manuscript could have emerged from within it, as claimed.</p> <p>Perhaps Sampson\u2019s most telling finding, though, is that parts of the Sappho manuscript were shown in public when they were supposedly still undiscovered in a wodge of industrial cartonnage.<strong> </strong>According to his study of the PDF\u2019s metadata, the photographs of the materials sitting side by side in the ceramic basin, prior to \u201cprocessing\u201d, were taken on 14 February 2012. And yet there is video footage of Scott Carroll brandishing 26 small fragments of the Sappho, those that ended up belonging to the Greens, a week earlier, on 7 February 2012.</p> <p>There is no suggestion Carroll was involved in wrongdoing in this regard: the point is that the timeline seems so implausible as to be impossible. According to Sampson, whose analysis will appear in full in a forthcoming academic article, the most plausible interpretation of all this is that the photographs were retrospectively staged by persons unknown \u2013 along with images of the Sappho fragment apparently being prised from a dark-brown mass of papyrus.</p> <p>The most obvious reason for staging an origin-story for the Sappho manuscript like this would be to conceal the fact that the papyrus had been illegally imported, excavated or traded. The other possible reason \u2013 though this is not Sampson\u2019s personal view \u2013 would be to mask a fake.</p> <p>In response to this new evidence, Christie\u2019s told me: \u201cChristie\u2019s endeavours to uphold the highest standards of due diligence. We would never knowingly offer any works of art without good title or incorrectly catalogued or authenticated. We take our name and reputation very seriously and would take all necessary steps available to address any situation of inappropriate use.\u201d The auction house says that if there is any official investigation, they will cooperate. At present, however, the origins of the Sappho fragment remain shrouded in mystery.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In early 2016, the EES were becoming seriously alarmed that Obbink was refusing to supply an adequate account of the source of the Sappho manuscript \u2013 and also, increasingly, by the rumours that he had offered papyrus fragments for sale in his Oxford rooms. These rumours seemed outlandish \u2013 who would you be more likely to trust: the eminent Oxford papyrologist Dirk Obbink, or Scott Carroll, with his mummy masks on the stove?</p> <p>But still, from the stories circulating online, the EES knew two things about the notorious fragment of Mark that had supposedly been sold to the Green family: it was from the gospel\u2019s first chapter, and it was first century. It so happened that an item in their own collection was a papyrus catalogued in the 1980s as \u201cI/II\u201d, a note that could have been interpreted as \u201cfirst or second century AD\u201d. In 2011, a researcher on the Oxyrhynchus Project had identified it as from the first chapter of Mark. The fragment had not been officially signed out, but EES officials believed Obbink had it in his possession ostensibly to study.</p> <p>Obbink always denied that he had been trying to sell Oxyrhynchus items, as a <a href=\"https://www.ees.ac.uk/News/poxy-lxxxiii-5345\" title=\"\">later EES statement made clear</a>. Nevertheless, an official of the society was sufficiently suspicious that he might have been at least trying to sell the Mark fragment that he decided to try to smoke him out \u2013 by instructing him, in spring 2016, to publish the manuscript in the next volume, number 83, of the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Series. That would get the fragment out in the public sphere. It would also mean it would have to be physically returned to the Sackler classics library so that the editing could be checked by colleagues. In short, if Obbink were indeed trying to sell it, this move would stop him. Or so the EES official thought.</p> <p>That August, the EES decided not to reappoint Obbink a general editor of the Oxyrhynchus series, \u201cprimarily,\u201d it said in a public statement, \u201cbecause of unsatisfactory discharge of his editorial duties, but also because of concerns, which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts, especially the Sappho text\u201d.</p> <p>It was in May 2018 that a Cambridge-based biblical scholar, Elijah Hixson, flicking through the newly posted Amazon listing for volume 83 of the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Series, saw that one of the manuscripts about to be published was from the first chapter of Mark. This was, surely, the same item as the fragment of Mark that had been the source of such intense scholarly speculation over the previous seven years.</p> <p>But if that was the case, then something seriously odd was going on. The Mark fragment was, supposedly, part of the Green collection. It could not also belong to the EES. What\u2019s more, the reason the fragment was the source of such fascination was that it was from the first century. But the one about to be published was labelled as late-second, or early-third century. Hixson immediately posted a blog on Evangelical Textual Criticism spelling out his puzzlement. As a commenter on the post said, there had either been a catastrophic misunderstanding \u2013 or someone was lying.</p> <p>Naturally, there was also consternation in Washington, at the Museum of the Bible. Michael Holmes, the director of the Green Scholars Initiative since 2015, believed that the fragment of Mark belonged to them, not the EES. It had been bought and paid for by Hobby Lobby, and donated to the museum. They had the paperwork to prove it, though admittedly, not the papyrus.</p> <p>The items had, according to an agreement, been left with the vendor temporarily for further study. Something was very wrong. It looked as if they had been sold something that was not what it purported to be, by someone who didn\u2019t seem to own it; and what\u2019s more, they didn\u2019t even have the item in their possession.</p> <p>In April 2019, Holmes emailed Roberta Mazza in her capacity as an EES trustee, telling her that Obbink had allegedly sold the fragments to Hobby Lobby. Even at this point, Mazza told me, the whole idea still seemed crazy \u2013 as ridiculous as the plotline of 1960s Italian film Tot\u00f2truffa, in which a hustler pretends to sell the Trevi fountain to a tourist. Of course the items couldn\u2019t have been sold to Hobby Lobby \u2013 not least because the EES actually had possession of the items themselves. Holmes suggested a meeting so that they could, at last, establish the truth of the matter.</p> <p>Which is how, on 4 June, the New Testament scholar was taken aback to find himself in the insalubrious, narrow alleyway that flanks one of London\u2019s opera houses, looking for the entrance of Two Brydges, a bohemian private members\u2019 club frequented by singers and writers. His lunch dates in the wood-panelled restaurant were Mazza, the ancient historian Prof Dominic Rathbone, and Dr Margaret Mountford, a papyrologist and then chair of the EES \u2013 better known to the British public in her guise as Alan Sugar\u2019s former sidekick on the reality show, The Apprentice.</p> <p>\u201cAt the meeting I shared the evidence that Obbink had in fact sold \u2018first-century Mark\u2019 and three others to Hobby Lobby in January 2013,\u201d Holmes recalled at a recent conference. \u201cSold, but not delivered.\u201d</p> <p>Conversation around the table quickly turned to a further question: had there been other items that had been both sold \u2013 and delivered? In the following weeks, it was concluded that a further 13 papyri belonging to EES had been wrongfully sold to Hobby Lobby, 11 apparently by Obbink, two by the Jerusalem antiquities dealers, Baidun.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, on 23 June, Holmes circulated redacted copies of the alleged sales contracts between Hobby Lobby and Obbink for four Gospel manuscripts, including a fragment of Mark. One of the recipients was papyrus sleuth Brent Nongbri. He immediately published them on his blog: there was Obbink\u2019s apparent signature for all to see. Either the documents had been \u201cfabricated in a malicious attempt to harm [his] reputation\u201d, as Obbink\u2019s later statement claimed. Or he really had sold them. The prices of the items were redacted, but an expert told me he thought they could have been sold for $200,000 each.</p> <p>On 12 November, the thefts of all 120 fragments, including the four that had remained in Oxford and the 13 that had been delivered to the US, were reported to the police. On 18 December, the 13 were returned, after a delay while it was established that since they were stolen goods, they were exempt from VAT \u2013 a coda to the affair that Holmes called \u201cthe cherry on the sundae\u201d. The fragments that ended up in US collector Andrew Stimer\u2019s possession have also been returned to Oxford.</p> <p>Holmes is trying to improve practices at the Museum of the Bible. Hobby Lobby and the Greens have, he said, declared a halt to what he called \u201cproblematic\u201d acquisitions. Only items with fully researched provenances will be bought. Only papyri that have properly established legal provenance will be displayed online and in the museum, and published in scholarly volumes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/15/how-to-spot-a-perfect-fake-the-worlds-top-art-forgery-detective\">How to spot a perfect fake: the world\u2019s top art forgery detective</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At present, just over 20 papyri are displayed on the museum\u2019s website, out of 5,000. I asked Holmes whether one can therefore conclude that the Greens own around 4,980 papyri that lack reliable provenance. \u201cIn general, yes,\u201d said Holmes. The organisation is now negotiating, he told me, with national governments to return ownership of unprovenanced items to their countries of origin.</p> <p>Classicists are by turns gripped by the drama, and horrified by its implications. \u201cClassics runs on trust \u2013 on people working together to make our knowledge and understanding accessible to all,\u201d Helen Morales, professor of Greek at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told me. Whoever allegedly stole and sold the papyri \u201cbroke that trust, and thumbed their nose at the system,\u201d she said. Another lecturer in Greek told me that the alleged crime was, in effect, a deeply disturbing perpetuation of the \u201cprofiteering and the pillage\u201d of past centuries \u2013 just at the moment when the discipline was trying to reflect on a history of complicity with colonialism.</p> <p>In November, a \u201cpostmortem on so-called first-century Mark\u201d was held at the Society of Biblical Literature\u2019s annual conference in San Diego. As Nongbri joked at the time, it was really more of a vivisection. While reserving respect for Holmes\u2019s reforming efforts, Mazza did not pull her punches. The Greens have \u201cpoured millions on the legal and illegal antiquities market without having a clue about the history, the material features, cultural value, fragilities and problems of the objects,\u201d she said. This irresponsible collecting \u201cis a crime against culture and knowledge of immense proportions \u2013 as the facts unfolding under our eyes do prove.\u201d</p> <p>At the other end of this disturbing chain is someone who stole and sold Oxyrhynchus fragments to the evangelical billionaires. Whoever they are, they are still at large.

      "bodyText": "To visit Dr Dirk Obbink at Christ Church college, Oxford, you must first be ushered by a bowler-hatted porter into the stately Tom Quad, built by Cardinal Wolsey before his spectacular downfall in 1529. Turn sharp right, climb a flight of stairs, and there, behind a door on which is pinned a notice advertising a 2007 college arts festival, you will find Obbink\u2019s rooms. Be warned: you may knock on the door in vain. Since October, he has been suspended from duties following the biggest scandal that has ever hit, and is ever likely to hit, the University of Oxford\u2019s classics department. An associate professor in papyrology and Greek literature at Oxford, Obbink occupies one of the plum jobs in his field. Born in Nebraska and now in his early 60s, this lugubrious, crumpled, owlish man has \u201cwon at the game of academia\u201d, said Candida Moss, professor of theology at Birmingham University. In 2001, he was awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award for his expertise in \u201crescuing damaged ancient manuscripts from the ravages of nature and time\u201d. Over the course of his career, he has received millions in funding; he is currently, in theory at least, running an \u00a3800,000 project on the papyrus rolls carbonised by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79. Since he was appointed in 1995, Obbink has welcomed many visitors into his rooms at Christ Church: dons, undergraduates, researchers. Less orthodox callers, too: among them, antiquities dealers and collectors. In the corner of Obbink\u2019s study stands a pool table, from which two Egyptian mummy masks stare out impenetrably. Its green baize surface is all but obscured by papers and manuscripts \u2013 even, sometimes, a folder or two containing fragments of ancient papyrus. One bibliophile remembers a visit to this room, \u201clike the set of an Indiana Jones movie\u201d, a few years ago. He was offered an antique manuscript for sale by a man named Mahmoud Elder, with whom Obbink owned a company, now dissolved, called Castle Folio. One blustery evening towards the end of Michaelmas term, 2011, two visiting Americans climbed Obbink\u2019s staircase \u2013 Drs Scott Carroll and Jerry Pattengale. Both worked for the Greens, a family of American conservative evangelicals who have made billions from a chain of crafting stores called Hobby Lobby. At the time, the family was embarking on an ambitious new project: the Museum of the Bible, which opened in Washington DC in 2017. Carroll was then its director. Items for the Green collection were bought by Hobby Lobby, then donated to the museum, bringing a substantial tax write-off. Pattengale was the head of the Green Scholars Initiative, a project offering academics research opportunities on items in the Green collection. The Greens, advised by Carroll, were buying biblical artefacts, such as Torahs and early papyrus manuscripts of the New Testament, at a dizzying pace: $70m was spent on 55,000 objects between 2009 and 2012, Carroll claimed later. The market in a hitherto arcane area of collecting sky-rocketed. \u201cFortunes were made. At least two vendors who had been making \u20ac1-2m a year were suddenly making \u20ac100-200m a year,\u201d said one longtime collector. That wintry evening, Carroll and Pattengale were making one of their occasional trips to seek Obbink\u2019s expertise on matters papyrological. According to Pattengale, just as they were about to leave, Obbink reached into a manila envelope and pulled out four papyrus fragments, one from each of the gospels. Obbink told them that three of these scraps dated from the second century AD. But the fourth, a fragment of the Gospel of Mark \u2013 a 4cm by 4cm scrap the shape of a butterfly\u2019s wing, containing just a few broken words \u2013 was earlier than that. It was almost certainly from the first century AD, which would make it the oldest surviving manuscript of the New Testament, copied less than 30 years after Mark had actually written it. Conservative evangelicals place enormous weight on the Gospels as \u201cGod-breathed\u201d words. The idea that such an object existed was indescribably thrilling. Carroll was \u201cecstatic\u201d, Pattengale recalled. \u201cVeins along his neck bulged. He paced with arms flailing.\u201d Carroll, who declined to be interviewed, has said that Pattengale\u2019s account is full of \u201cmisrepresentations, misrecollections, and exaggerations\u201d. But he has confirmed this: Obbink showed him the Mark fragment \u201con the pool table in his office \u2026 and he then went into some paleographic detail why he believed it must date to the late-first century \u2026 It was in this conversation that he offered it for consideration for Hobby Lobby to buy.\u201d No purchase was made at the time. Nevertheless, the objects did eventually end up being sold to the Greens, after Carroll left their employ in 2012. The vendor, or so it appears, was Dirk Obbink. His name, and seemingly his signature, appear on a purchase agreement with Hobby Lobby dated 4 February 2013. The problem is that the items \u2013 if the purchase agreement is genuine \u2013 were not Obbink\u2019s to sell. They are part of the Oxyrhynchus collection of ancient papyrus, owned by the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) and housed at Oxford\u2019s Sackler Library. Thirteen additional fragments from the collection, it transpired this autumn, had also been sold to the Greens, 11 apparently by Obbink in 2010, and two by a Jerusalem-based antiquities dealer, Baidun &amp; Sons. (A spokesperson for the company\u2019s owner, Alan Baidun, says he was an agent acting in good faith, and that he checked the provenance supplied by the person who sold them to him.) Six further fragments from the Oxyrhynchus collection have turned up in the possession of another collector in the US, Andrew Stimer, a spokesperson for whom says he acquired them in good faith, and with an apparently complete provenance (though parts of it have subsequently been shown to have been falsified). The dealer who sold them to Stimer told him they had come from the collection of M Elder of Dearborn, Michigan. That is, Mahmoud Elder, Obbink\u2019s sometime business partner. (Elder did not respond to requests for comment. Both the Museum of the Bible and Stimer have cooperated fully with the EES, and have taken steps to return the fragments.) In total, the EES has now discovered that 120 fragments have gone missing from the Oxyrhynchus collection over the past 10 years. Since the appearance, in June 2019, of that fateful purchase agreement and invoice bearing Obbink\u2019s name, the scale of the scandal has taken time to sink in. What kind of a person \u2013 what kind of an academic \u2013 would steal, sell, and profit from artefacts in their care? Such an act would be \u201cthe most staggering betrayal of the values and ethics of our profession\u201d, according to the Manchester University papyrologist Roberta Mazza. The alleged thefts were reported to Thames Valley police on 12 November. No one has yet been arrested or charged. Obbink has not responded to interview requests from the Guardian, and has issued only one public statement. \u201cThe allegations made against me that I have stolen, removed or sold items owned by the Egypt Exploration Society collection at the University of Oxford are entirely false,\u201d he has said. \u201cI would never betray the trust of my colleagues and the values which I have sought to protect and uphold throughout my academic career in the way that has been alleged. I am aware that there are documents being used against me which I believe have been fabricated in a malicious attempt to harm my reputation and career.\u201d It seems that Dr Dirk Obbink is either a thief, has been caught up in a colossal misunderstanding, or, perhaps most shockingly of all, is the victim of an elaborate effort to frame him. * * * A case for Inspector Morse, perhaps. But the real detectives in this case have been a transatlantic band of papyrologists, theologians, classicists and biblical scholars, who have turned their deductive and evidence-sifting professional skills to the mystery. For them, what started as intellectual curiosity has turned into something more like a crusade against the perversion of the ethics of their field. This band of scholarly sleuths, who have published their findings in books and on blogs and social media, includes the theologian Candida Moss; Brent Nongbri, a scholar of early Christianity based at the Norwegian School of Theology; Mazza, whose investigations have sometimes made her feel, she said, as if she were in a Coen brothers\u2019 movie; and the contributors to a blog called Evangelical Textual Criticism. The last, a forum \u201cfor people with knowledge of the Bible in its original languages\u201d, has not, until now, had much call for \u201cbreaking news\u201d banners. All these academics have, for different reasons, a strong interest in the Oxyrhynchus collection \u2013 half a million ancient papyrus fragments that have transformed knowledge of the Greco-Roman world. The fragments were excavated in Egypt, from 1896 onwards, by two Oxford classicists, Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt. A hunch led them to dig out some low mounds in the village of el-Behnesa, the site of the ancient Greek city of Oxyrhynchus, founded after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC. To their delight, they hit upon rubbish dumps in which 700 years\u2019 worth of papyrus had been discarded. The papyrus, preserved by the desert-dry conditions, was covered in writing \u2013 mostly Greek, the earliest from the third century BC. Grenfell and Hunt\u2019s discoveries forged an extraordinary, direct link with antiquity. Most of the oldest surviving manuscripts, had, until then, come from no earlier than the 10th century. What classical literature there was \u2013 for example, just seven out of over 120 plays by Sophocles \u2013 had survived because medieval monks had thought it worth preserving, copying it over and over again down the generations. At Oxyrhynchus, though, an entire culture was revealed in the rubbish, unfiltered by monkish taste, and dating directly from antiquity: previously lost works by canonical writers such as Sappho, Pindar, and Menander; fragments of biblical texts; letters, bills, receipts, tax returns, even magical spells. Legally, under the colonial conditions of the time, the fragments became the property of the Egypt Exploration Fund (now Society) and were taken to Oxford, where for years, they were simply kept in boxes in Grenfell and Hunt\u2019s rooms in Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, as the scholars, then their successors, started to sift, edit and publish them. Oxyrhynchus spawned a whole new sub-discipline of classics: papyrology. More than a century after the discoveries, one of papyrology\u2019s main tasks is to publish these scrappy manuscripts. That involves offering a proposed reconstruction of a text; translating and dating it; and producing a commentary on its significance. Over the past century, just over 5,000 of the half-million Oxyrhynchus papyri have been published. Each appearance of a volume in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri Series \u2013 there are now 83 \u2013 is a real event for classicists, historians, theologians. \u201cThey redraw the map of what we know,\u201d said Tim Whitmarsh, professor of Greek at Cambridge. To be a papyrologist \u2013 to tease sense from damaged, ancient, near-illegible writing \u2013 you need to possess linguistic brilliance, a profound historical imagination, and a codebreaker\u2019s ability to play with different hypotheses of a text\u2019s meaning. It is patient, painstaking work \u2013 but also, exciting. It offers the thrill of discovery. One papyrologist told me, \u201cI could have spent my career thinking about old chestnuts like the terminal date of Caesar\u2019s command, or whatever. But what I love is reading stuff that no one has read before.\u201d Today, the Oxyrhynchus collection is held in a back room on the first floor of Oxford\u2019s Sackler classics library, where you\u2019ll see a scholarly mess of paperwork, microscopes and books. The collection\u2019s walls are lined with tall, locked cupboards, filled with ranks of boxes. Open one, and you will see the dark-brown papyrus, astonishingly tough given its age, still wrapped in 1910s and 20s pages of the university newspaper, the Oxford Gazette. Some fragments are large, even up to A4 size; many are tiny, known as \u201ccornflakes\u201d in the trade. The Oxyrhynchus project is its own little fiefdom. Not exactly secretive, but very far from open, it carries the reputation of being cultish, even within the Oxford classics faculty. At any one time, up to three general editors share the duties of working on the material and assigning it to scholars for study and publication. Until 2016, Obbink was one of that trio of editors, with 24-hour-access. A curator-researcher also works day-to-day with the material. Researchers are employed to help; scholars come in and out to study the material. It is Obbink, rather than anyone else, on whom suspicions have focused. There is a rough, handwritten catalogue of the entire collection, on 12cm by 7cm index cards, as well as photographs, which gives a rough indication of what each fragment contains. Editors have not usually been forthcoming about the details of the unpublished material, fearing an onslaught of interested academics. For scholars outside the charmed circle, who wonder what gems lie in wait, that can be frustrating. For a criminal, it might create an opportunity. The fewer people who know what is in the collection, the easier it might be to pilfer from it. When the EES announced in October that index cards and photos had, in many cases, disappeared along with the missing fragments themselves, the scale of the alleged crime began to become clear. Any lingering suggestion that all this had been some colossal misunderstanding was blown aside. Whoever had stolen the fragments had tried to erase any trace of their existence, so that the crime would never come to light. \u201cDestroying the catalogue records \u2013 that\u2019s such an anti-intellectual thing to do, it blows the mind,\u201d said Candida Moss. However, the alleged thief seems to have erred in one crucial respect: they do not seem to have known, or taken into account, that there was back-up information allowing the EES to ascertain what had allegedly been stolen. (The EES has remained silent on the nature of this backup, but prior to digitisation, libraries would photograph card-index catalogues and transfer the images to microfiche.) Despite that apparent oversight, one thing is close to certain: the items were taken by someone familiar with the collection\u2019s inner workings. Which means \u2013 colossal a betrayal as that would be \u2013 the crime was almost certainly an inside job. * * * After Carroll and Pattengale\u2019s visit to Oxford in 2011, tantalising rumours of the discovery of a first-century fragment of Mark rippled through American evangelical circles. On 1 February 2012, in Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina, two theologians, Prof Bart Ehrman and Dr Daniel Wallace, were debating \u2013 to a rapt audience of 1,500 \u2013 whether the original text of the New Testament could be recovered. Suddenly, Wallace dropped a bombshell. \u201cThe oldest manuscript of the New Testament is now a fragment of Mark\u2019s Gospel that is from the first century,\u201d he claimed. \u201cMy source is a papyrologist who worked on the manuscript, a man whose reputation is unimpeachable.\u201d It was, recalled Ehrman at a recent conference in San Diego, \u201ca real jaw-dropper\u201d. Ehrman was bursting with questions. How extensive was the fragment? Who was the papyrologist? Had the dating been corroborated by others? Wallace said he was sworn to secrecy. All he could reveal was that the fragment would soon be published by the academic imprint, Brill. A few months later, Brill did indeed announce a new publication: the Green Scholars Initiative Papyri Series, edited by Obbink and Pattengale, a series of volumes of \u201crare unpublished papyri texts from the Green collection\u201d. The mystery fragment of first-century Mark, then, must belong to the Greens, Ehrman reasoned. The only problem was that the fragment \u201cwasn\u2019t published that year, and it wasn\u2019t published the next year, and it wasn\u2019t published the next year,\u201d said Ehrman. \u201cI started to feel like it was the parousia [Christ\u2019s second coming] \u2013 it\u2019s coming soon, but we don\u2019t know when.\u201d For the scholar sleuths \u2013 as they would soon become \u2013 alarm bells started ringing. Where had this fragment come from? Why the secrecy? Was it legal? The trade in antiquities is governed by laws designed to protect artefacts from two things. First, the kind of mass removal of cultural heritage that was a feature of the colonial era. Second, illegal excavation and looting of archaeological sites, acts that involve an irreparable loss of knowledge, and, like many criminal trades with a high-value product, are run on human exploitation and violence. Buyers of artefacts, therefore, are supposed to establish provenance: proof that the item was legally removed from its country of origin, usually before 1970, when a Unesco convention on cultural heritage was widely adopted. The Greens, it was becoming apparent to observers, were not doing that. In 2017, for example, a consignment of ancient Iraqi cuneiform tablets they had purchased was found to have been smuggled into the US as \u201ctile samples\u201d. In the absence of solid information about the fragment of Mark and its origin, gossip proliferated. A widely reported claim was that it had emerged from an ancient Egyptian mummy mask. Obbink\u2019s sometime visitor Scott Carroll, whose lecture style is more 19th-century showman than sober scholar, was speaking publicly about mummy masks a lot at the time, claiming they were a great source of early New Testament papyri. Because some mummy masks had been manufactured from a kind of papier-mache of recycled papyrus, known as \u201ccartonnage\u201d, you could, he told audiences, dissolve the masks in soap and warm water, prise the constituent sheets of papyrus apart and, hey presto, reveal early manuscripts \u2013 fragments of the Gospels, of Homer, whatever. \u201cMy wife will laugh and remember the time she would come into the house and smell mummy on the stove,\u201d Carroll told an audience in Mexico, in 2013. \u201cNothing like the smell of mummy on the stove.\u201d All the talk of dissolving mummy masks horrified serious scholars: destroying artefacts in the speculative search for other ancient artefacts is not exactly museological best practice. Those with a cynical cast of mind also observed that mummy masks were a great way to launder illegally procured papyri. All you had to do was claim you had found your dodgy papyrus manuscript in a legally acquired ancient mummy mask. (Such masks were relatively widely produced in antiquity; today, you can find them on eBay.) Mummy masks could be turned into \u201cbottomless provenance machines\u201d, as one collector put it. The scholar-sleuths began to trawl the internet looking for more videos of Carroll and those close to him, on the hunt for further information about the mystery Mark fragment. One video showed a talk by an evangelical author called Josh McDowell, an associate of Carroll\u2019s: in it, he revealed that the fragment of Mark was from the Gospel\u2019s first chapter. That seemingly tiny piece of information would, later, turn out to be a crucial clue in putting together the story of the alleged thefts from the Oxyrhynchus collection. In 2017, yet another video was ferreted out by scholar-sleuths, and was reposted on the Evangelical Textual Criticism blog. In it, Carroll \u2013 about whom there is no suggestion of misconduct in this regard \u2013 says that he had seen the fragment of Mark, in \u201cOxford at Christ Church, and actually on [Obbink\u2019s] pool table\u201d. The fragment, he said, actually hadn\u2019t come from a mummy mask, as far as he could tell. It was, however, for sale. * * * Dirk Obbink cuts an eccentric figure, even by Oxford standards. In 2014, around the time his antiquities dealership Castle Folio was incorporated, he bought himself a castle. Or, rather, the Texan equivalent \u2013 an 1890s neo-Gothic pile in Waco, called Cottonland Castle. He already had a six-bedroom house in Oxford\u2019s suburbs, in the garden of which he had dug a large, L-shape swimming pool \u2013 an upgrade from the canal boat he had once shared with a colleague. He has a reputation for elusiveness. \u201cIf Dirk says: \u2018See you,\u2019 I know I won\u2019t clap eyes on him for weeks,\u201d said one papyrological colleague. In the early 2000s, he held the chair of papyrology at the University of Michigan \u2013 a full-time job \u2013 but failed to resign from Oxford, leaving colleagues \u201cprofoundly disappointed by his conduct\u201d, according to a senior US-based classicist. It didn\u2019t seem to matter. \u201cIn certain institutional contexts, you somehow become untouchable,\u201d one professor of classics told me. At the same time, Obbink is, in some ways, a standard-issue Oxford don \u2013 head in a book, limited social skills, \u201can absent-minded professor type\u201d, as one collector called him. He added: \u201cI have a hard time believing that he stole Oxyrhynchus papyri in cold blood and sold them to Hobby Lobby.\u201d In January 2014, Obbink had a moment of media glory, when he discovered and published two new fragments of poems by the seventh-century BC poet Sappho. It was global news. \u201cA Sappho poem,\u201d as the Telegraph\u2019s headline put it, \u201cis more exciting than a new David Bowie album\u201d. At the time, the story, at least as it was reported by me and others, was all about the thrill of precious new words by a great poet. It was left to experts in the illegal traffic of antiquities to point out that the \u201cnew\u201d Sappho was not just a tender poem about her brothers \u2013 but also, and importantly, an ancient artefact. One archaeologist-blogger posted a different kind of headline: \u201cNo-Questions-Asking UK Academic Reads a Freshly Uncovered Ripped-up Papyrus from Unknown Source.\u201d Now, in the light of the revelations of the alleged thefts of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, scholars are looking at the Sappho story with new eyes, and asking, with a fresh sense of urgency, whether the manuscript can have been legally obtained. There are even doubts as to its authenticity. The latest gossip in classical circles is that it might even be a fake. \u201cEverything about it seems too good to be true,\u201d one senior Cambridge classicist told me. Doubts about the Sappho papyrus have niggled away at scholars because Obbink\u2019s account of how it was acquired \u2013 all the time reporting, he said, what he had been told by its nameless owner \u2013 has been at best sketchy, and at times contradictory. At first, in January 2014, he revealed only that the Sappho papyrus was owned by an anonymous private collector in London. Then, in February, he said the manuscript had come from \u201ca mummy cartonnage panel\u201d. It had been carbon-dated, he said, to AD201, plus or minus a century. For expert Egyptologists, though, that was a red flag. Both things \u2013 mummy cartonnage and a date of AD100-300 \u2013 cannot be true. Papyrus ceased to be used to make mummy cartonnage in around AD14. In January 2015, the story changed. The Sappho manuscript hadn\u2019t been found in mummy cartonnage, after all, but \u201cindustrial cartonnage\u201d, perhaps used for bookbinding. This \u201cindustrial cartonnage\u201d, with the Sappho supposedly hidden within it, had been purchased by auction at Christie\u2019s in 2011, as part of a mixed lot of papyrus. This new information conveniently solved the dating problem, since industrial cartonnage was still being made during the period to which the Sappho manuscript had been carbon-dated. The detail about the Christie\u2019s auction also suggested the item was legal \u2013 the papyrus in that particular lot had been exported from Egypt prior to the 1970 Unesco convention on the export of artefacts. Obbink published an explanation of how the two types of cartonnage had come to be confused. A piece of mummy cartonnage and a piece of industrial cartonnage had been dissolved together by the owner\u2019s staff, he said, and the resulting sheets of papyrus got muddled up. Obbink also reported that at some point some 20 smaller fragments of the Sappho manuscript had been \u201cdeemed insignificant\u201d by the anonymous owner, and sold off to the Greens. In this entire story of the origins of \u201cP.Sapph.Obbink\u201d \u2013 to use the manuscript\u2019s scholarly nomenclature \u2013 there was no solid evidence, no documentation, no images, and no external witnesses. Nor did Christie\u2019s possess relevant images of its auction lot of 2011 \u2013 the mixed lot of papyrus containing the piece of industrial cartonnage in which the Sappho fragment was supposedly concealed. Everything depended on the word of the great Oxford don. Now, Mike Sampson, a papyrologist at the University of Manitoba, has found evidence, seen by the Guardian, suggesting that the origin-story of the Sappho manuscript reported by Obbink may be a fiction. Sampson was sent a PDF by an academic source. The document is a glossy, lavishly illustrated brochure produced by Christie\u2019s. It advertises the Sappho fragment for sale by private treaty. A \u201cprivate treaty sale\u201d is a service whereby an auction house will broker a sale between vendor and buyer discreetly, outside the relatively public auction schedule. (The document is quite separate from the 2011 auction, and was produced some time after it.) The brochure will have been circulated very discreetly, too, to a few key collectors. Sampson has analysed the metadata of the PDF, and believes that the Sappho fragment was in fact probably offered for sale by private treaty twice \u2013 once in 2013, prior to the public announcement of its existence, and again in 2015. (No price is mentioned, but a collector familiar with the field estimates a likely figure of around $800,000.) In the brochure, there are, at last, images that purport to show how the two different types of cartonnage \u2013 mummy cartonnage and industrial cartonnage \u2013 were confused. One picture shows a brightly painted blue-and-red piece of mummy cartonnage lying in a ceramic basin beside a brown mass of what appears to be flattened papyrus, described as \u201ccartonnage\u201d. The caption recaps the final story reported by Obbink \u2013 that the two items were muddled up in a \u201cconfusion of processing\u201d. However, in the opinion of Sampson, it \u201cdefies belief\u201d that the entirely different objects could have been confused. Furthermore, because of the physical condition and measurements of the brown papyrus mass in the photograph, he thinks it unlikely that the Sappho manuscript could have emerged from within it, as claimed. Perhaps Sampson\u2019s most telling finding, though, is that parts of the Sappho manuscript were shown in public when they were supposedly still undiscovered in a wodge of industrial cartonnage. According to his study of the PDF\u2019s metadata, the photographs of the materials sitting side by side in the ceramic basin, prior to \u201cprocessing\u201d, were taken on 14 February 2012. And yet there is video footage of Scott Carroll brandishing 26 small fragments of the Sappho, those that ended up belonging to the Greens, a week earlier, on 7 February 2012. There is no suggestion Carroll was involved in wrongdoing in this regard: the point is that the timeline seems so implausible as to be impossible. According to Sampson, whose analysis will appear in full in a forthcoming academic article, the most plausible interpretation of all this is that the photographs were retrospectively staged by persons unknown \u2013 along with images of the Sappho fragment apparently being prised from a dark-brown mass of papyrus. The most obvious reason for staging an origin-story for the Sappho manuscript like this would be to conceal the fact that the papyrus had been illegally imported, excavated or traded. The other possible reason \u2013 though this is not Sampson\u2019s personal view \u2013 would be to mask a fake. In response to this new evidence, Christie\u2019s told me: \u201cChristie\u2019s endeavours to uphold the highest standards of due diligence. We would never knowingly offer any works of art without good title or incorrectly catalogued or authenticated. We take our name and reputation very seriously and would take all necessary steps available to address any situation of inappropriate use.\u201d The auction house says that if there is any official investigation, they will cooperate. At present, however, the origins of the Sappho fragment remain shrouded in mystery. * * * In early 2016, the EES were becoming seriously alarmed that Obbink was refusing to supply an adequate account of the source of the Sappho manuscript \u2013 and also, increasingly, by the rumours that he had offered papyrus fragments for sale in his Oxford rooms. These rumours seemed outlandish \u2013 who would you be more likely to trust: the eminent Oxford papyrologist Dirk Obbink, or Scott Carroll, with his mummy masks on the stove? But still, from the stories circulating online, the EES knew two things about the notorious fragment of Mark that had supposedly been sold to the Green family: it was from the gospel\u2019s first chapter, and it was first century. It so happened that an item in their own collection was a papyrus catalogued in the 1980s as \u201cI/II\u201d, a note that could have been interpreted as \u201cfirst or second century AD\u201d. In 2011, a researcher on the Oxyrhynchus Project had identified it as from the first chapter of Mark. The fragment had not been officially signed out, but EES officials believed Obbink had it in his possession ostensibly to study. Obbink always denied that he had been trying to sell Oxyrhynchus items, as a later EES statement made clear. Nevertheless, an official of the society was sufficiently suspicious that he might have been at least trying to sell the Mark fragment that he decided to try to smoke him out \u2013 by instructing him, in spring 2016, to publish the manuscript in the next volume, number 83, of the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Series. That would get the fragment out in the public sphere. It would also mean it would have to be physically returned to the Sackler classics library so that the editing could be checked by colleagues. In short, if Obbink were indeed trying to sell it, this move would stop him. Or so the EES official thought. That August, the EES decided not to reappoint Obbink a general editor of the Oxyrhynchus series, \u201cprimarily,\u201d it said in a public statement, \u201cbecause of unsatisfactory discharge of his editorial duties, but also because of concerns, which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts, especially the Sappho text\u201d. It was in May 2018 that a Cambridge-based biblical scholar, Elijah Hixson, flicking through the newly posted Amazon listing for volume 83 of the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Series, saw that one of the manuscripts about to be published was from the first chapter of Mark. This was, surely, the same item as the fragment of Mark that had been the source of such intense scholarly speculation over the previous seven years. But if that was the case, then something seriously odd was going on. The Mark fragment was, supposedly, part of the Green collection. It could not also belong to the EES. What\u2019s more, the reason the fragment was the source of such fascination was that it was from the first century. But the one about to be published was labelled as late-second, or early-third century. Hixson immediately posted a blog on Evangelical Textual Criticism spelling out his puzzlement. As a commenter on the post said, there had either been a catastrophic misunderstanding \u2013 or someone was lying. Naturally, there was also consternation in Washington, at the Museum of the Bible. Michael Holmes, the director of the Green Scholars Initiative since 2015, believed that the fragment of Mark belonged to them, not the EES. It had been bought and paid for by Hobby Lobby, and donated to the museum. They had the paperwork to prove it, though admittedly, not the papyrus. The items had, according to an agreement, been left with the vendor temporarily for further study. Something was very wrong. It looked as if they had been sold something that was not what it purported to be, by someone who didn\u2019t seem to own it; and what\u2019s more, they didn\u2019t even have the item in their possession. In April 2019, Holmes emailed Roberta Mazza in her capacity as an EES trustee, telling her that Obbink had allegedly sold the fragments to Hobby Lobby. Even at this point, Mazza told me, the whole idea still seemed crazy \u2013 as ridiculous as the plotline of 1960s Italian film Tot\u00f2truffa, in which a hustler pretends to sell the Trevi fountain to a tourist. Of course the items couldn\u2019t have been sold to Hobby Lobby \u2013 not least because the EES actually had possession of the items themselves. Holmes suggested a meeting so that they could, at last, establish the truth of the matter. Which is how, on 4 June, the New Testament scholar was taken aback to find himself in the insalubrious, narrow alleyway that flanks one of London\u2019s opera houses, looking for the entrance of Two Brydges, a bohemian private members\u2019 club frequented by singers and writers. His lunch dates in the wood-panelled restaurant were Mazza, the ancient historian Prof Dominic Rathbone, and Dr Margaret Mountford, a papyrologist and then chair of the EES \u2013 better known to the British public in her guise as Alan Sugar\u2019s former sidekick on the reality show, The Apprentice. \u201cAt the meeting I shared the evidence that Obbink had in fact sold \u2018first-century Mark\u2019 and three others to Hobby Lobby in January 2013,\u201d Holmes recalled at a recent conference. \u201cSold, but not delivered.\u201d Conversation around the table quickly turned to a further question: had there been other items that had been both sold \u2013 and delivered? In the following weeks, it was concluded that a further 13 papyri belonging to EES had been wrongfully sold to Hobby Lobby, 11 apparently by Obbink, two by the Jerusalem antiquities dealers, Baidun. Soon afterwards, on 23 June, Holmes circulated redacted copies of the alleged sales contracts between Hobby Lobby and Obbink for four Gospel manuscripts, including a fragment of Mark. One of the recipients was papyrus sleuth Brent Nongbri. He immediately published them on his blog: there was Obbink\u2019s apparent signature for all to see. Either the documents had been \u201cfabricated in a malicious attempt to harm [his] reputation\u201d, as Obbink\u2019s later statement claimed. Or he really had sold them. The prices of the items were redacted, but an expert told me he thought they could have been sold for $200,000 each. On 12 November, the thefts of all 120 fragments, including the four that had remained in Oxford and the 13 that had been delivered to the US, were reported to the police. On 18 December, the 13 were returned, after a delay while it was established that since they were stolen goods, they were exempt from VAT \u2013 a coda to the affair that Holmes called \u201cthe cherry on the sundae\u201d. The fragments that ended up in US collector Andrew Stimer\u2019s possession have also been returned to Oxford. Holmes is trying to improve practices at the Museum of the Bible. Hobby Lobby and the Greens have, he said, declared a halt to what he called \u201cproblematic\u201d acquisitions. Only items with fully researched provenances will be bought. Only papyri that have properly established legal provenance will be displayed online and in the museum, and published in scholarly volumes. At present, just over 20 papyri are displayed on the museum\u2019s website, out of 5,000. I asked Holmes whether one can therefore conclude that the Greens own around 4,980 papyri that lack reliable provenance. \u201cIn general, yes,\u201d said Holmes. The organisation is now negotiating, he told me, with national governments to return ownership of unprovenanced items to their countries of origin. Classicists are by turns gripped by the drama, and horrified by its implications. \u201cClassics runs on trust \u2013 on people working together to make our knowledge and understanding accessible to all,\u201d Helen Morales, professor of Greek at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told me. Whoever allegedly stole and sold the papyri \u201cbroke that trust, and thumbed their nose at the system,\u201d she said. Another lecturer in Greek told me that the alleged crime was, in effect, a deeply disturbing perpetuation of the \u201cprofiteering and the pillage\u201d of past centuries \u2013 just at the moment when the discipline was trying to reflect on a history of complicity with colonialism. In November, a \u201cpostmortem on so-called first-century Mark\u201d was held at the Society of Biblical Literature\u2019s annual conference in San Diego. As Nongbri joked at the time, it was really more of a vivisection. While reserving respect for Holmes\u2019s reforming efforts, Mazza did not pull her punches. The Greens have \u201cpoured millions on the legal and illegal antiquities market without having a clue about the history, the material features, cultural value, fragilities and problems of the objects,\u201d she said. This irresponsible collecting \u201cis a crime against culture and knowledge of immense proportions \u2013 as the facts unfolding under our eyes do prove.\u201d At the other end of this disturbing chain is someone who stole and sold Oxyrhynchus fragments to the evangelical billionaires. Whoever they are, they are still at large. For now, the papyrus thief walks free. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Don\u2019t go on a diet.\u201d That\u2019s one tip from personal trainer <a href=\"https://bighealthandfitness.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Graham Waugh</a>, 50, and may be surprising given that he once weighed three times as much as he does now. A few years ago, he was 330kg (52st) and stuck at home, feeling as if he was waiting to die. Exercise had never been a part of his life, but after bariatric surgery, he began visiting the gym. When his weight reached 111kg (17.5st), the gym owner suggested he become a personal trainer. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m too fat and old.\u2019\u201d But then Waugh realised he could specialise in training people who had had similar problems with their weight and health. \u201cI\u2019d seen a lady in the waiting room at the obesity clinic and she looked plump, at worst. I thought to myself: \u2018If she had a gym she felt comfortable in, maybe she wouldn\u2019t need surgery.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Waugh isn\u2019t the only personal trainer with a powerful life story. For many trainers, it is the enormous change to their health and happiness that they experience at the gym that leads them into their chosen field \u2013 whether they have lost weight, gained strength or tackled physical or mental health issues. A prominent recent example is the former deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, 52. When he announced he was stepping down from politics in November, he also revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/12/tom-watson-lost-seven-stone-reversed-type-2-diabetes-interview\" title=\"\">he was retraining as a gym instructor</a>. Watson has been on what he describes as a \u201chealth journey\u201d, losing 51kg (8st), and reversing his type 2 diabetes diagnosis through diet and exercise.</p> <p>What lessons can we take from the trainers who have transformed their lives? \u201cDon\u2019t look at how much you\u2019ve got to lose,\u201d says Waugh. \u201cIf someone had told me I had to lose 35 stone, what do you think that would have done for my morale? What I had to do was make each day the best I could, try to make the best choices.\u201d A balanced diet is important, of course, but so is learning to forgive yourself. If you slip up in the morning with biscuits or cake, he says, don\u2019t write off the rest of the day.</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.almawhitecoach.com/\" title=\"\">Alma White</a>, it was learning consistency and self-respect, and moving past the allure of fad diets, that changed everything. In the space of one year, she transformed the way she ate, discovered exercise, lost 70kg (11st) and left a \u201ctoxic\u201d relationship. \u201cMy whole life did a huge about-turn,\u201d she says. Then she changed careers. She had been a busy, successful makeup artist but decided to become a personal trainer instead. \u201cI was so passionate about makeup, I never saw myself doing anything else. But my life had changed so much, I thought: \u2018I can\u2019t do this career because it\u2019s not fulfilling me in the way I know training and coaching would.\u2019 I decided that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life \u2013 I wanted to be able to give women the same feeling and confidence that I gained from my journey.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"816b7f8141751adf062af1ddc019e6566e7da7c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/816b7f8141751adf062af1ddc019e6566e7da7c4/153_3_619_774/400.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Waugh, who became a personal trainer after losing 210kg (33st).\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Waugh, who became a personal trainer after losing 210kg (33st).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image supplied by Graham Waugh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White, from London, studied for a year before becoming a full-time trainer. \u201cYes, it\u2019s about the weight loss and there is a huge aesthetic difference, but the mental difference is something you can\u2019t see in a picture and that\u2019s what I get the most fulfilment from.\u201d She has seen clients come off antidepressants, improve their relationships and change their lives in all sorts of ways.</p> <p>At one point, she weighed 159kg (25st). She is now 80kg (12st 6lb). \u201cI had a massive issue with emotional eating \u2013 that was how the weight piled on. I was in a really toxic relationship at the time, so that further fuelled my eating issues. I was a little bit overweight throughout my childhood but I put on a massive amount in that year, during that relationship.\u201d She thinks she gained about 40kg (6st). \u201cI had major confidence issues and anxiety. I suffered with depression.\u201d</p> <p>She moved in with her partner soon after they met, but the relationship turned sour. \u201cIt made a massive dent in my confidence. I was cut off from friends and family and because I\u2019d put on so much weight I didn\u2019t want to go out anyway. I felt trapped.\u201d</p> <p>She had seen some posts by a nutritionist on social media and decided to start tackling her diet. \u201cThere is so much misinformation and so many fads and you can get caught in a vicious circle of dieting. I dieted for as long as I can remember. I tried anything and everything.\u201d The nutritionist encouraged her to take a \u201cbefore\u201d photograph of herself, wearing only her underwear. \u201cI remember looking at it and thinking: \u2018My God, how have I got here?\u2019 I don\u2019t think I was aware of how overweight I was. That was a big wake-up call and I decided enough was enough and to seek help because I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere on my own.\u201d With the nutritionist\u2019s help, White lost quite a bit of weight over several months. \u201cThen I got myself a personal trainer and did some sessions with them and that\u2019s when I fell in love with weight training. It was the first time I felt a sense of achievement \u2013 that I could do this and that I really enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>It was hard work, she says, but what surprised her was how simple it was. \u201cAll I needed to do was to be consistent in my habits \u2013 continually train and eat well \u2013 and the weight would fall off. I loved weight training because when you lift heavy weights, you put yourself in an uncomfortable position, but being able to push past it made such a big difference in my life outside of the gym.\u201d She soon had the confidence to leave her relationship.</p> <p>White advises working out why you want to become fitter, rather than having it as a vague goal. Then accountability can help you stick with the exercise \u2013 through either a personal trainer, or a friend you go for a walk or run with. You don\u2019t need to go to the gym \u201cbut I think it can be easier because naturally our lifestyles don\u2019t give us that activity, so we need to plan it. Once you\u2019ve done it for a while, it becomes a habit, and the great thing with training is you\u2019ll see immediate benefits to your life. And you\u2019ll see there are no negatives.</p> <p>\u201cYou also have to be consistent with your nutrition. For a lot of people, overeating is a way of suppressing emotions. I see it time and time again \u2013 people don\u2019t know how to deal with their most powerful emotions so they use food as an outlet.\u201d She still has treats: \u201cThat is how you stay sane. I\u2019m not an advocate of cutting anything out of your diet; it\u2019s about having everything in moderation, and as much as your life needs. If you\u2019re sitting at a desk all day, you\u2019re going to need less.\u201d</p> <p>Waugh\u2019s issues with weight stretched back to his childhood. \u201cI was always really big,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was 17, I was 17st; when I was 18, I was 18st and it just went on.\u201d He lives in Luton, and when he was about 30, and weighing around 28st (178kg), he walked up a hill one day and started having heart palpitations. \u201cI assumed I was having a heart attack and I became scared to go out. Because I was stuck indoors I was getting depressed and because you associate happy times with food I would eat. I would be happy because I was eating something I really loved, then I\u2019d get depressed afterwards because I was eating crap.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t eat much during the day but a typical evening meal, often from the takeaway, might consist of a doner kebab with extra meat, a couple of portions of chips and four burgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbfafb18ebd416b5ad6b06918b2caca58e06a16c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbfafb18ebd416b5ad6b06918b2caca58e06a16c/0_885_6589_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I fell in love with weight training\u2019 \u2026 White.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I fell in love with weight training\u2019 \u2026 White.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waugh became a recluse for about 15 years. He rarely left his sofa, didn\u2019t go into the kitchen (his wife cared for him) and slept on a special medical bed. Did he want to get fitter? \u201cMy mental health wasn\u2019t allowing me to do that.\u201d He says he was largely left alone by the healthcare system, couldn\u2019t work and had no friends.</p> <p>One day, he got a call from his sister, who told him that their brother, who was only 40, had died suddenly. \u201cHe had lived a healthy life and I felt cheated. I felt that death was meant for me.\u201d Then, he says, he told himself: \u201cYou\u2019re a selfish bastard just sitting waiting here for death to happen.\u201d</p> <p>His GP referred him to an obesity clinic and eventually he was put on a waiting list for bariatric surgery \u2013 a gastric sleeve procedure to drastically reduce the size of the stomach. \u201cI said: \u2018If you save my life, I\u2019ll pay it back.\u2019 I think I only had a 20% chance of survival and there was a huge team at my operation \u2013 two or three anaesthetists, four surgeons.\u201d Another operation \u2013 a duodenal switch, which reduces absorption of food by rerouting the small intestine \u2013 was scheduled, but first Waugh had to lose more weight. \u201cI started going to the gym and my addiction changed from eating to being at the gym. I worked my backside off, lost a lot of weight really fast, and then a year later the surgeon did the switch.\u201d</p> <p>His aim now is to train people to either prevent obesity surgery, or to lose weight in preparation for it, as well as people who have fibromyalgia or other illnesses. He says his own story gives him an understanding of their emotional challenges and physical capabilities. \u201cThat person is going to walk into an environment they\u2019re not going to be comfortable in, they\u2019re going to be nervous, they might have bad anxiety. What I have to do is say: \u2018Are you all right walking in to the gym on your own? Do you want to come in the back way? Do you want me to meet you in the car park? Can you manage the stairs?\u2019 These are all hurdles before they walk in the door.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53b1c381e50dd1ada1ca314bd0468cee70bb02c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b1c381e50dd1ada1ca314bd0468cee70bb02c3/0_252_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Helping people with back problems is my calling\u2019 \u2026Trevor Harrison-Phipps.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Helping people with back problems is my calling\u2019 \u2026Trevor Harrison-Phipps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image supplied by Trevor Harrison-Phipps</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.thpfitness.com/\" title=\"\">Trevor Harrison-Phipps</a>, from Croydon, was in his late 40s when he discovered exercise could cure the back pain he had endured for nearly 30 years. He had been a builder when he suffered a back injury while mixing concrete. He couldn\u2019t work for six months and was told he would need surgery, but refused even though he was in agony and his movement was restricted. Things improved to the point that he was able to work as a graphic designer but the pain remained. He remembers when his son was three, lying on the floor with him, trying to take a paracetamol and in tears.</p> <p>He was on constant painkillers, plus antidepressants at one point, and he saw countless osteopaths who couldn\u2019t help. \u201cHaving that pain eating away at you day in, day out, destroys you. You can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d One friend, an ex-wrestler in his 70s, advised him to do a series of stretches but Harrison-Phipps ignored the advice for years. \u201cWhen I was at my lowest ebb and overweight and depressed, I thought: \u2018Let\u2019s just do these four stretches in bed.\u2019\u201d Within days, his back pain had improved and he says it felt miraculous. \u201cFrom that I got the confidence to go to the gym. The stretches were just the start of everything.\u201d</p> <p>He had been going to the gym for a couple of years before looking around at the personal trainers there and thinking: \u201cThis is my calling \u2013 I\u2019ve got to help people with back problems.\u201d He became a personal trainer four years ago at the age of 50, and now trains people who also have joint issues or arthritis.</p> <p>What does he tell people? \u201cSleep well, exercise and eat well and the rest looks after itself. Try to always exercise, even if it is just for 10 or 15 minutes. It\u2019s not hard to make healthy food \u2013 you can have the bad stuff, but you\u2019ve got to have a balance so the good stuff outweighs it. Sleep and rest periods, along with relaxation, put you in a better mindset.\u201d</p> <p>And his own mindset? \u201cThis is the best job in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI love people and I\u2019m with people all day long. Recently I got one lady who couldn\u2019t walk up the stairs \u2013 she had really bad arthritis. She\u2019s done 24 sessions with me now and she runs up and down stairs all day long.\u201d He says he has prevented at least two clients from needing shoulder surgery. He loves, he says, \u201cthe buzz of seeing people\u2019s lives change\u201d.</p> <p>Waugh feels the same. It\u2019s one thing to help people lose a bit of weight to fit into a dress, he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m talking about changing people\u2019s lives, if not saving their lives.\u201d</p>",

Then accountability can help you stick with the exercise \u2013 through either a personal trainer, or a friend you go for a walk or run with. You don\u2019t need to go to the gym \u201cbut I think it can be easier because naturally our lifestyles don\u2019t give us that activity, so we need to plan it. Once you\u2019ve done it for a while, it becomes a habit, and the great thing with training is you\u2019ll see immediate benefits to your life. And you\u2019ll see there are no negatives. \u201cYou also have to be consistent with your nutrition. For a lot of people, overeating is a way of suppressing emotions. I see it time and time again \u2013 people don\u2019t know how to deal with their most powerful emotions so they use food as an outlet.\u201d She still has treats: \u201cThat is how you stay sane. I\u2019m not an advocate of cutting anything out of your diet; it\u2019s about having everything in moderation, and as much as your life needs. If you\u2019re sitting at a desk all day, you\u2019re going to need less.\u201d Waugh\u2019s issues with weight stretched back to his childhood. \u201cI was always really big,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was 17, I was 17st; when I was 18, I was 18st and it just went on.\u201d He lives in Luton, and when he was about 30, and weighing around 28st (178kg), he walked up a hill one day and started having heart palpitations. \u201cI assumed I was having a heart attack and I became scared to go out. Because I was stuck indoors I was getting depressed and because you associate happy times with food I would eat. I would be happy because I was eating something I really loved, then I\u2019d get depressed afterwards because I was eating crap.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t eat much during the day but a typical evening meal, often from the takeaway, might consist of a doner kebab with extra meat, a couple of portions of chips and four burgers. Waugh became a recluse for about 15 years. He rarely left his sofa, didn\u2019t go into the kitchen (his wife cared for him) and slept on a special medical bed. Did he want to get fitter? \u201cMy mental health wasn\u2019t allowing me to do that.\u201d He says he was largely left alone by the healthcare system, couldn\u2019t work and had no friends. One day, he got a call from his sister, who told him that their brother, who was only 40, had died suddenly. \u201cHe had lived a healthy life and I felt cheated. I felt that death was meant for me.\u201d Then, he says, he told himself: \u201cYou\u2019re a selfish bastard just sitting waiting here for death to happen.\u201d His GP referred him to an obesity clinic and eventually he was put on a waiting list for bariatric surgery \u2013 a gastric sleeve procedure to drastically reduce the size of the stomach. \u201cI said: \u2018If you save my life, I\u2019ll pay it back.\u2019 I think I only had a 20% chance of survival and there was a huge team at my operation \u2013 two or three anaesthetists, four surgeons.\u201d Another operation \u2013 a duodenal switch, which reduces absorption of food by rerouting the small intestine \u2013 was scheduled, but first Waugh had to lose more weight. \u201cI started going to the gym and my addiction changed from eating to being at the gym. I worked my backside off, lost a lot of weight really fast, and then a year later the surgeon did the switch.\u201d His aim now is to train people to either prevent obesity surgery, or to lose weight in preparation for it, as well as people who have fibromyalgia or other illnesses. He says his own story gives him an understanding of their emotional challenges and physical capabilities. \u201cThat person is going to walk into an environment they\u2019re not going to be comfortable in, they\u2019re going to be nervous, they might have bad anxiety. What I have to do is say: \u2018Are you all right walking in to the gym on your own? Do you want to come in the back way? Do you want me to meet you in the car park? Can you manage the stairs?\u2019 These are all hurdles before they walk in the door.\u201d Trevor Harrison-Phipps, from Croydon, was in his late 40s when he discovered exercise could cure the back pain he had endured for nearly 30 years. He had been a builder when he suffered a back injury while mixing concrete. He couldn\u2019t work for six months and was told he would need surgery, but refused even though he was in agony and his movement was restricted. Things improved to the point that he was able to work as a graphic designer but the pain remained. He remembers when his son was three, lying on the floor with him, trying to take a paracetamol and in tears. He was on constant painkillers, plus antidepressants at one point, and he saw countless osteopaths who couldn\u2019t help. \u201cHaving that pain eating away at you day in, day out, destroys you. You can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d One friend, an ex-wrestler in his 70s, advised him to do a series of stretches but Harrison-Phipps ignored the advice for years. \u201cWhen I was at my lowest ebb and overweight and depressed, I thought: \u2018Let\u2019s just do these four stretches in bed.\u2019\u201d Within days, his back pain had improved and he says it felt miraculous. \u201cFrom that I got the confidence to go to the gym. The stretches were just the start of everything.\u201d He had been going to the gym for a couple of years before looking around at the personal trainers there and thinking: \u201cThis is my calling \u2013 I\u2019ve got to help people with back problems.\u201d He became a personal trainer four years ago at the age of 50, and now trains people who also have joint issues or arthritis. What does he tell people? \u201cSleep well, exercise and eat well and the rest looks after itself. Try to always exercise, even if it is just for 10 or 15 minutes. It\u2019s not hard to make healthy food \u2013 you can have the bad stuff, but you\u2019ve got to have a balance so the good stuff outweighs it. Sleep and rest periods, along with relaxation, put you in a better mindset.\u201d And his own mindset? \u201cThis is the best job in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI love people and I\u2019m with people all day long. Recently I got one lady who couldn\u2019t walk up the stairs \u2013 she had really bad arthritis. She\u2019s done 24 sessions with me now and she runs up and down stairs all day long.\u201d He says he has prevented at least two clients from needing shoulder surgery. He loves, he says, \u201cthe buzz of seeing people\u2019s lives change\u201d. Waugh feels the same. It\u2019s one thing to help people lose a bit of weight to fit into a dress, he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m talking about changing people\u2019s lives, if not saving their lives.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Forget the parched wasteland that is Brexit Britain in bleak midwinter. Let me take you to a place where the political terrain is so radically different as to be idyllic. In this land, rows of cheap starter homes neatly line the blossoming streets of new garden cities, and no twentysomething frets about getting on to the housing ladder. Not a solitary infant goes to bed hungry. And when you or your loved ones fall ill, a trusty family doctor is on call from 8am to 8pm, all seven days of the week.</p> <p>Already I hear you rumbling like a famished teen at Nando\u2019s: where is this paradise? Sweden or, at the outside, Singapore? No, my friend: it is the UK in 2020. Or at least, it was supposed to be, because all of those treasures and so many more were promised to arrive by this year by the serious, sober all-powerfuls who run the country.</p> <p>Remember Gordon Brown? Practically the first thing he did on becoming prime minister in 2007 was vow to build an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jul/11/gordonbrown.labour1\" title=\"\">extra 3m homes by 2020</a>. Many would nestle in 10 new \u201ceco-towns\u201d, into which he pumped <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/who-killed-the-eco-town/5204103.article\" title=\"\">millions of taxpayer pounds</a>. Big, bold and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/jacob-rees-mogg-slouch-commons\" title=\"\">more sprawling than Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> on a parliamentary bench, it was a classic Brown plan. Except at the finish line we can see that not a single eco-town ever got off the drawing board, while the UK has built only 1.9m homes. Far from being fixed, the housing crisis has grown.</p> <p>Another scheme that never got beyond a slogan was Tony Blair\u2019s cast-iron guarantee in 1999 that within two decades no child would live in poverty. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/mar/19/politicalnews.politics\" title=\"\">Ambitious and inspiring</a>, it was soon dropped and replaced with a more modest target. And that seven-day GP service was dreamed up by David Cameron, who guaranteed it would be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-pledges-to-deliver-7-day-gp-services-by-2020\" title=\"\">UK-wide by this year</a>. Then again, this was the same man who planned to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9782928/David-Cameron-I-want-to-lead-the-country-until-at-least-2020.html\" title=\"\">remain prime minister until 2020</a>.</p> <p>No other year has been as loaded up with targets, goals and predictions as 2020. Over the past two decades, governments red and blue have regularly given their grandest objectives this deadline \u2013 near enough to imagine yet sufficiently far away not to act. And so the most prophecy-laden year of the century is also the one that will most brazenly shortchange us.</p> <p>Time after time, some beleaguered secretary of state has delivered a speech or released a strategy that swept the thorniest problems in his or her portfolio into a \u201c2020 vision\u201d. It wins them headlines and buys them breathing space; and in a more serious political culture they would now be being held to account. But no \u2013 because this is Britain. So let us count our squandered inheritance.</p> <p>Let\u2019s remind ourselves how Brown once pledged that in 2020 no car showroom in the country would sell new gas guzzlers, only <a href=\"https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/features/opinion/gavin-green/why-gordon-brown-mustnt-swallow-electric-car-spin/\" title=\"\">electrics or hybrids</a>. Or his 2010 assurance that by now every home in the country would enjoy <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8579333.stm\" title=\"\">superfast broadband</a>, with the UK outstripping Silicon Valley to become \u201cthe world leader in the digital economy\u201d. Whatever you thought of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/15/jeremy-corbyn-promises-free-broadband-under-labour-video\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s free broadband offer</a> at last month\u2019s election, history reminds us that some ideas just keep coming around, like orphaned suitcases on an airport carousel.</p> <p>As chancellor, George Osborne swore he would pull government finances back into the black by 2020 \u2013 an oath that became government policy in 2015, only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\" title=\"\">become history the year after</a>. Hopped up on his \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, he launched a crusade to double the value of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-exports-target-manufacturers\" title=\"\">UK exports up to \u00a31 trillion</a> by this year. He must have known it was pie in the sky. At \u00a3675bn, today\u2019s export total is stuck far below his target while the UK\u2019s trade deficit <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/october2019#main-points\" title=\"\">continues to balloon</a>.</p> <p>Will any of the 2020 targets be hit? Yes, that set by Blair to get 20% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/19/fossil-fuels-fall-to-record-low-in-britains-energy-mix-data-shows\" title=\"\">electricity from renewable energy</a>. But that was part of an EU-wide drive with Brussels checking and chivvying on progress \u2013 the same Brussels to which in three weeks\u2019 time we bid adieu.</p> <p>I could carry on in this fashion, a journalist playing skittles with Westminster\u2019s failed resolutions and asking Dude, where\u2019s my utopia?But that ducks the bigger question: what damage have these broken promises done to our politics? All the pledges were made long before the all-out lie-fest that was the EU referendum of 2016. None were stuck on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\" title=\"\">fibbing bus</a>. Yet government ministers must have made many of these solemn vows with fingers crossed behind their backs. In their corner were civil servants forsworn from peddling porkies. Former mandarin Jill Rutter describes Whitehall\u2019s justification for this reciprocal make-believe as: \u201cWe won\u2019t tell you that it can\u2019t be done if you won\u2019t sack us when it\u2019s not done.\u201d And she is only half joking.</p> <p>Perhaps it helps that every two-bit consultancy and business guru has wallowed in 2020-ism. In 1998, the Henley Centre predicted that by today \u201cthe longest commuter journey will be just under two hours, mainly for the very wealthy <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/why-life-in-2020-may-be-short-on-joy-26185751.html\" title=\"\">using the space shuttle</a>\u201d. Yes, it did really predict that. Countless managers have used the year as the peg for some catastrophic transformation, such as those at Manchester University who embarked upon a \u201c2020 strategy\u201d promising to improve staff satisfaction while <a href=\"http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=25548\" title=\"\">driving up earnings</a>. Instead, the university starts this decade at war with swaths of its workforce and clunking through <a href=\"https://www.masterplan.manchester.ac.uk/projects/\" title=\"\">vanity building projects</a> even while its <a href=\"https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-he-agencies-other-2019-manchester-sees-credit-rating-slip/\" title=\"\">credit rating keeps slipping</a>.</p> <p>Tying this together is a belief in what the Henley forecasters dubbed \u201cfriction-free capitalism\u201d. The 2020-ers thought they had capitalism sussed. Nowhere on their horizons was there a global banking crash, let alone a lost decade. Add to that a belief among Blair and his heirs that they also knew how to win at politics. This school of thought focused on retail and salesmanship \u2013 which, as University of East Anglia professor of political theory <a href=\"https://people.uea.ac.uk/a_finlayson\" title=\"\">Alan Finlayson</a> observes, were driven by big \u201coffers\u201d designed to grab headlines rather than worrying too hard about delivery.</p> <p>Yet even while Blair and Brown, Cameron and Osborne were staring into the middle distance and describing the shimmering visions ahead, their voters saw institution after institution engulfed by crisis: high-street banks, MPs over expenses, the press with phone-hacking, local councils and public services butchered by cuts.</p> <p>What value in a glorious future when the present is so chaotic?

      "bodyText": "Forget the parched wasteland that is Brexit Britain in bleak midwinter. Let me take you to a place where the political terrain is so radically different as to be idyllic. In this land, rows of cheap starter homes neatly line the blossoming streets of new garden cities, and no twentysomething frets about getting on to the housing ladder. Not a solitary infant goes to bed hungry. And when you or your loved ones fall ill, a trusty family doctor is on call from 8am to 8pm, all seven days of the week. Already I hear you rumbling like a famished teen at Nando\u2019s: where is this paradise? Sweden or, at the outside, Singapore? No, my friend: it is the UK in 2020. Or at least, it was supposed to be, because all of those treasures and so many more were promised to arrive by this year by the serious, sober all-powerfuls who run the country. Remember Gordon Brown? Practically the first thing he did on becoming prime minister in 2007 was vow to build an extra 3m homes by 2020. Many would nestle in 10 new \u201ceco-towns\u201d, into which he pumped millions of taxpayer pounds. Big, bold and more sprawling than Jacob Rees-Mogg on a parliamentary bench, it was a classic Brown plan. Except at the finish line we can see that not a single eco-town ever got off the drawing board, while the UK has built only 1.9m homes. Far from being fixed, the housing crisis has grown. Another scheme that never got beyond a slogan was Tony Blair\u2019s cast-iron guarantee in 1999 that within two decades no child would live in poverty. Ambitious and inspiring, it was soon dropped and replaced with a more modest target. And that seven-day GP service was dreamed up by David Cameron, who guaranteed it would be UK-wide by this year. Then again, this was the same man who planned to remain prime minister until 2020. No other year has been as loaded up with targets, goals and predictions as 2020. Over the past two decades, governments red and blue have regularly given their grandest objectives this deadline \u2013 near enough to imagine yet sufficiently far away not to act. And so the most prophecy-laden year of the century is also the one that will most brazenly shortchange us. Time after time, some beleaguered secretary of state has delivered a speech or released a strategy that swept the thorniest problems in his or her portfolio into a \u201c2020 vision\u201d. It wins them headlines and buys them breathing space; and in a more serious political culture they would now be being held to account. But no \u2013 because this is Britain. So let us count our squandered inheritance. Let\u2019s remind ourselves how Brown once pledged that in 2020 no car showroom in the country would sell new gas guzzlers, only electrics or hybrids. Or his 2010 assurance that by now every home in the country would enjoy superfast broadband, with the UK outstripping Silicon Valley to become \u201cthe world leader in the digital economy\u201d. Whatever you thought of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s free broadband offer at last month\u2019s election, history reminds us that some ideas just keep coming around, like orphaned suitcases on an airport carousel. As chancellor, George Osborne swore he would pull government finances back into the black by 2020 \u2013 an oath that became government policy in 2015, only to become history the year after. Hopped up on his \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, he launched a crusade to double the value of UK exports up to \u00a31 trillion by this year. He must have known it was pie in the sky. At \u00a3675bn, today\u2019s export total is stuck far below his target while the UK\u2019s trade deficit continues to balloon. Will any of the 2020 targets be hit? Yes, that set by Blair to get 20% of electricity from renewable energy. But that was part of an EU-wide drive with Brussels checking and chivvying on progress \u2013 the same Brussels to which in three weeks\u2019 time we bid adieu. I could carry on in this fashion, a journalist playing skittles with Westminster\u2019s failed resolutions and asking Dude, where\u2019s my utopia?But that ducks the bigger question: what damage have these broken promises done to our politics? All the pledges were made long before the all-out lie-fest that was the EU referendum of 2016. None were stuck on a fibbing bus. Yet government ministers must have made many of these solemn vows with fingers crossed behind their backs. In their corner were civil servants forsworn from peddling porkies. Former mandarin Jill Rutter describes Whitehall\u2019s justification for this reciprocal make-believe as: \u201cWe won\u2019t tell you that it can\u2019t be done if you won\u2019t sack us when it\u2019s not done.\u201d And she is only half joking. Perhaps it helps that every two-bit consultancy and business guru has wallowed in 2020-ism. In 1998, the Henley Centre predicted that by today \u201cthe longest commuter journey will be just under two hours, mainly for the very wealthy using the space shuttle\u201d. Yes, it did really predict that. Countless managers have used the year as the peg for some catastrophic transformation, such as those at Manchester University who embarked upon a \u201c2020 strategy\u201d promising to improve staff satisfaction while driving up earnings. Instead, the university starts this decade at war with swaths of its workforce and clunking through vanity building projects even while its credit rating keeps slipping. Tying this together is a belief in what the Henley forecasters dubbed \u201cfriction-free capitalism\u201d. The 2020-ers thought they had capitalism sussed. Nowhere on their horizons was there a global banking crash, let alone a lost decade. Add to that a belief among Blair and his heirs that they also knew how to win at politics. This school of thought focused on retail and salesmanship \u2013 which, as University of East Anglia professor of political theory Alan Finlayson observes, were driven by big \u201coffers\u201d designed to grab headlines rather than worrying too hard about delivery. Yet even while Blair and Brown, Cameron and Osborne were staring into the middle distance and describing the shimmering visions ahead, their voters saw institution after institution engulfed by crisis: high-street banks, MPs over expenses, the press with phone-hacking, local councils and public services butchered by cuts. What value in a glorious future when the present is so chaotic? What\u2019s the point of grand designs drawn up in Westminster when daily life for the public is a prosaic mess? In that gulf has bred the nihilism that threads through Brexit alongside contempt for politicians, now seen as so untrustworthy that one might as well stick a serial liar in No 10. Boris Johnson famously loves a legacy project \u2013 an airport island here, a garden bridge there. The difference this time is that when our blonde Nero promises voters a grand target, not even his own side will waste a second believing it. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>The reports of Peter Cook\u2019s death on 9 January 1995 had no difficulty arriving at a consensus about him, but then there had been plenty of time to consider his legacy. Although Cook was only 57, his triumphs and innovations were generally agreed to lie in the distant past. There was Beyond the Fringe, the groundbreaking revue he wrote and performed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanbennett\">Alan Bennett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/27/sir-jonathan-miller-obituary\">Jonathan Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/28/guardianobituaries.media\">Dudley Moore</a>, and which brought new bite to British satire. There was Not Only \u2026 But Also, the TV sketch comedy in which he and Moore played Pete and Dud, a pair of flat-capped, mackintosh-wearing amateur philosophers. And there were the improvised Derek and Clive albums that pushed comedy into the realms of scabrous obscenity.</p> <p>Even toward the end of his life, Cook was still an inspired improviser. This could be in an official capacity (in Why Bother?, upper-class braggart Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling, one of his longest-running characters, was quizzed by the young satirist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chris-morris\">Chris Morris</a>) or in an impromptu one (he would call late-night radio phone-ins under assorted guises including Sven the Norwegian fisherman). But such activity did nothing to subdue the image of Cook as a man with a bright future behind him.</p> <p>At the time of his death, Stephen Fry observed that \u201cbeing British in this part of the century meant living in the country that had Peter Cook in it\u201d while Morris remarked that the worst thing that could happen would be \u201cthe sanctification of Peter Cook as the Princess Diana of Hampstead\u201d. The reality has been more regrettable than that. Twenty-five years after his death, mentions of Cook are scarce even as his influence proliferates in satirical news shows (The Daily Show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/15/mash-report-bbc2-satirical-news-show-nish-kumar\">The Mash Report</a>), standup (the cultivated, fine-grained monotony of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/james-acaster-interview-adulthood-is-still-a-bit-daunting\">James Acaster</a>) and such character comedies as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/14/joan-and-jericha-podcast-new-series-julia-davis-vicki-pepperdine\">Dear Joan and Jericha</a>, the improvised podcast with Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine as filth-obsessed agony aunts \u2013 the true spiritual heirs to Derek and Clive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6713b937be14a369a7cdf58f528831cab9c1155c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6713b937be14a369a7cdf58f528831cab9c1155c/0_104_1257_1160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corpsing \u2026 Pete and Dud in Not Only \u2026 But Also guise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"923\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corpsing \u2026 Pete and Dud in Not Only \u2026 But Also guise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dezo Hoffman/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cook\u2019s personality is all over <a href=\"https://www.private-eye.co.uk/\">Private Eye</a> magazine, which he bankrolled for decades, and his standing has always been high among his fellow comics: in 2005, he was voted the greatest comedian of all time in a poll of 300 UK and US comedy performers, writers and directors. By 2012, he was at sixth place in a similar poll by the TV channel Dave. If that\u2019s what wasted talent looks like, we should all be lucky enough to fall short.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/07/adrian-edmondson-jennifer-snog-ages\">Adrian Edmondson</a>, star of The Young Ones and Bottom, was a fan from the days of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcK97jwsIiU\">Not Only \u2026 But Also</a>. \u201cThere were quite a lot of jokes about sex, or the lack of it, which resonated with who I was then,\u201d he says. \u201cI adored Morecambe and Wise but they never went there.

      "bodyText": "The reports of Peter Cook\u2019s death on 9 January 1995 had no difficulty arriving at a consensus about him, but then there had been plenty of time to consider his legacy. Although Cook was only 57, his triumphs and innovations were generally agreed to lie in the distant past. There was Beyond the Fringe, the groundbreaking revue he wrote and performed with Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller and Dudley Moore, and which brought new bite to British satire. There was Not Only \u2026 But Also, the TV sketch comedy in which he and Moore played Pete and Dud, a pair of flat-capped, mackintosh-wearing amateur philosophers. And there were the improvised Derek and Clive albums that pushed comedy into the realms of scabrous obscenity. Even toward the end of his life, Cook was still an inspired improviser. This could be in an official capacity (in Why Bother?, upper-class braggart Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling, one of his longest-running characters, was quizzed by the young satirist Chris Morris) or in an impromptu one (he would call late-night radio phone-ins under assorted guises including Sven the Norwegian fisherman). But such activity did nothing to subdue the image of Cook as a man with a bright future behind him. At the time of his death, Stephen Fry observed that \u201cbeing British in this part of the century meant living in the country that had Peter Cook in it\u201d while Morris remarked that the worst thing that could happen would be \u201cthe sanctification of Peter Cook as the Princess Diana of Hampstead\u201d. The reality has been more regrettable than that. Twenty-five years after his death, mentions of Cook are scarce even as his influence proliferates in satirical news shows (The Daily Show, The Mash Report), standup (the cultivated, fine-grained monotony of James Acaster) and such character comedies as Dear Joan and Jericha, the improvised podcast with Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine as filth-obsessed agony aunts \u2013 the true spiritual heirs to Derek and Clive. Cook\u2019s personality is all over Private Eye magazine, which he bankrolled for decades, and his standing has always been high among his fellow comics: in 2005, he was voted the greatest comedian of all time in a poll of 300 UK and US comedy performers, writers and directors. By 2012, he was at sixth place in a similar poll by the TV channel Dave. If that\u2019s what wasted talent looks like, we should all be lucky enough to fall short. Adrian Edmondson, star of The Young Ones and Bottom, was a fan from the days of Not Only \u2026 But Also. \u201cThere were quite a lot of jokes about sex, or the lack of it, which resonated with who I was then,\u201d he says. \u201cI adored Morecambe and Wise but they never went there. And, of course, the double act I had with Rik Mayall owed a lot to the Pete and Dud characters from the pub and the art gallery. Not exclusively \u2013 we also stole from Steptoe and Son, Hancock and Sid James. But it was a seemingly newish tradition of these sorts of characters being absurd in domestic situations, quite removed from the more heightened comedy of the Goons or Monty Python.\u201d Eddie Izzard \u2013 who attended the same preparatory school as Cook, St Bede\u2019s in East Sussex, albeit several decades later \u2013 was also strongly influenced by his steeply escalating absurdity. \u201cThe surreal diversions that I do \u2013 \u2018He was nine-foot tall and his name was Steve and he was made out of jam\u2019 or whatever \u2013 come from Pete and Dud because they were just pushing all the time, much more than Python. \u201cThere was a sense that these guys were winging it, and that came in useful for me when I was a solo street performer: people would come, people would go, but you had to be able to improvise in and out of this rough set you were doing.

      "bodyText": "Irregular migration into the European Union has fallen to its lowest annual level since 2013, the European border and coast guard agency has said, despite a significant increase in the number of arrivals to Greece. Frontex said that according to preliminary figures for 2019, irregular crossings detected on the bloc\u2019s external borders fell by 6% to just over 139,000 \u2013 about 92% down on the record number set during the 2015 European migration crisis. The decline was primarily due to significant falls in the numbers of people reaching European shores via the central and western Mediterranean routes, the agency said, while the eastern Mediterranean route saw a corresponding increase. About 14,000 people, mostly from Tunisia and Sudan, used the central Mediterranean route from north Africa \u2013 mainly Libya \u2013 to Italy and Malta, a 41% decline. Those taking the western Mediterranean route, mostly Moroccans and Algerians crossing into Spain, dropped by 58% to 24,000. But the eastern Mediterranean route into Greece saw \u201cgrowing migratory pressure\u201d from spring until September, Frontex said, with more than 82,000 irregular migrants detected on the route in 2019 \u2013 a 46% increase on the previous year. The agency said arrivals via this route during the second half of last year were at their highest level since the EU signed its 2016 agreement with Ankara aimed at limiting the influx of irregular migrants entering the EU through Turkey. There was also evidence that some people who had been transferred to the mainland from the Greek islands, where conditions in overcrowded camps are appalling, later moved on to the western Balkans. The number of irregular migrants detected on the EU\u2019s Albanian and Serbian borders was more than double last year\u2019s total. Overall, Afghan nationals accounted for almost a quarter of all irregular arrivals in 2019, Frontex said, almost three times as many as in the previous year. There were also more women and children than in recent years.",

Qantas is considering re-routing its Perth to London flights via Singapore or Hong Kong but its code-share deal with Dubai-based Emirates remains unchanged, a spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for Virgin Australia said the airline\u2019s similar agreement with Etihad also remained in place. Emirates and Etihad run multiple non-stop services every day from Melbourne and Sydney to the United Arab Emirates, where both are headquartered, using large-capacity planes that each carry hundreds of people. On Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Authority banned American carriers from flying into the Gulf, or over Iran and Iraq, following missile attacks by Iran on military bases in Iraq that host US forces. The attacks were in retaliation for the US assassination of top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who was killed by an American drone strike near Baghdad airport last week on the orders of US president Donald Trump. In an apparently unrelated incident, a plane bound for Kiev crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran airport on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. Australia\u2019s regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, does not issue FAA-style safety rulings and instead relies on airlines to make their own judgments. Qantas currently runs one flight of its own that passes through the area, the QF9 service from Perth to London. \u201cWe\u2019re adjusting our flight paths over the Middle East to avoid the airspace over Iraq and Iran until further notice,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at temporarily routing QF9 through Asia until we\u2019re able to return to our normal flight path through the Middle East. \u201cThis would mean a fuel stop in a city like Singapore or Hong Kong but it would enable us to still carry a full load of passengers on these heavily booked flights, and minimise disruption that way.\u201d Qantas\u2019s other flight to London, QF1, is unaffected as it already makes a pitstop in Singapore.

On 27 January, more than 100 Auschwitz survivors will travel to southern Poland for a day of commemorations at the site of the sprawling network of extermination and concentration camps, on the anniversary of the date in 1945 that Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. It is the last significant anniversary at which a large number of survivors are expected to be alive and well enough to attend. Four days earlier, an event titled Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism is planned at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial on the western slope of Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. More than 45 heads of state and world leaders are set to fly in for the ceremony, which will include orchestra performances and Jewish mourning prayers. The organisers hope it will lead to a firm plan of action to combat rising antisemitism and Holocaust denial. Instead, the buildup to the event has been hit by controversy. \u201cIt turns out that the presidents of Russia, Germany and France \u2013 whose government collaborated with Nazi Germany at the time \u2013 will speak, but the organisers do not agree to a speech by the president of Poland,\u201d Andrzej Duda said in a television interview on Sunday. \u201cI absolutely do not agree to this.\u201d On Tuesday, his office announced he would not take part. B\u0142a\u017cej Spychalski, a spokesman for Duda, told Polish news outlets that \u201ca situation in which the president of Poland will sit and listen to the false words of President Putin without being able to reply is unacceptable\u201d. The Russian government has recently launched a campaign to whitewash the Soviet Union\u2019s 1939 non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany and subsequent invasion of Poland, and instead claims Poland was partly responsible for starting the second world war. In a statement, Yad Vashem said it had never received an official Polish request for President Duda to speak, a claim denied by Marek Magierowski, Poland\u2019s ambassador to Israel, who said that both Yad Vashem and the Israeli authorities had known about \u201cthe conditions for the participation of President Duda\u201d for at least four months. Yad Vashem also rebutted comments from Duda that he should speak because Poland was the country that had the most citizens murdered at Auschwitz. \u201cIt is important to note, that out of 1.1 million victims of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, some 1 million were Jews who were murdered simply because they were Jewish, unrelated to the countries of origin. Hence, the nationalities of the victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau have no bearing on the identity of leaders who will address the Fifth World Holocaust Forum,\u201d said the statement. Relations between Poland and Israel have been strained in recent years, with accusations that the nationalist government in Warsaw wants to play down instances of Polish collaboration in the Holocaust. Last February, the acting Israeli foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, said that \u201cPoles suckle antisemitism with their mothers\u2019 milk\u201d. In response, the Polish prime minister, , accused him of racism and pulled out of a planned summit in Jerusalem. Daniel Blatman, who teaches Holocaust studies at the University of Jerusalem and is chief historian at a new museum of the Warsaw ghetto in Poland, said he understood Duda\u2019s decision to pull out of the event. \u201cI can understand that a representative of Russia should speak at the anniversary, since it was the Red Army which liberated the camp. But why should the president of France speak, when the French government deported 30,000 Jews to Auschwitz, but not the president of Poland?\u201d As well as the international disputes, concern has also been raised about how the event will play inside Israel, where a new election to break political deadlock is due in March. While the country\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, and prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will address the forum, the head of the opposition, Benny Gantz, had a request to speak denied. Israeli media reported that Gantz\u2019s party, which is hoping to topple the prime minister\u2019s ruling Likud party in the March election, was concerned Netanyahu would use the podium to promote his political agenda.",

      "bodyText": "On New Year\u2019s Eve, rumours spread that the Mallacoota golf club was among the buildings that had burnt down. In fact, the rough was charred but some holes were playable and the clubhouse was spared. This week, two men turned up wanting to get on the course. \u201cThey came and asked and we said we couldn\u2019t promise it was safe,\u201d says the golf club\u2019s Kerri Warren. \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019re just happy to go and hit a ball. There\u2019s not much to do with the roads closed and the power out.\u2019\u201d On New Year\u2019s Eve, the world watched in horror as thousands of holidaymakers sheltered on the foreshore of the tiny Victorian coastal town. In dramatic scenes captured on smartphones and seen around the world, holidaymakers were told to get in the water if the raging fires got too close. About 100 homes were destroyed in the end, according to estimates, but a wind change spared the centre of town itself. Now attention is turning to those who have stayed. \u201cEarly on, I was a bit lost actually, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d says Christy Bryar, who was taking refuge at the wharf when the fires came. \u201cI\u2019ve registered to volunteer, that way whenever anything is needed I get a phone call.\u201d That has meant everything from helping at the food bank to the animal hospital. \u201cJust extra hands,\u201d says Bryar, who is an architect. \u201cI don\u2019t have the specialist skills at the moment but in the future I\u2019ll be more help.\u201d Bryar lives on a 10-hectare (26-acre) property at Gipsy Point, a tiny hamlet surrounded by national parks about 15 minutes\u2019 drive from Mallacoota. Her home was destroyed in the fires that swept through East Gippsland on New Year\u2019s Eve. Lost too was one of two 30-year-old orchards on their property. When she made it back there this week, most of the animals were gone and the land now looks \u201cmonochromatic\u201d. Bryar\u2019s partner, David, is professional firefighter but is recovering from a broken collarbone and a broken foot and has not been cleared to work. While Bryar was at Mallacoota, David went with the Country Fire Authority to Gipsy Point. \u201cThere were only two homes lost in Gipsy Point, and no lives lost, so I think he did a very good job,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he\u2019s feeling the weight of not being able to look after our own house.\u201d Most of the holidaymakers who were pushed to the foreshore when the fires came have also left, relocated by air or on a massive naval ship that was deployed last week. On Wednesday, the last of the evacuees reached land. But some have stayed. \u201cYou just want to help out,\u201d says Kelly Dubberley, a Ballarat resident who remains at the caravan park with his family. \u201cThere\u2019s [thousands] of people evacuated, so that\u2019s [thousands of] people not spending money in the town to get it back on its feet.\u201d Dubberley, a carpenter, and his wife, Stacey, who is a nurse, have found plenty to do as the recovery operation kicks into gear. When he speaks to Guardian Australia, he is off to help build a koala enclosure for the temporary animal hospital. The power is still out in town although authorities have been handing out generators and shops in the main street are open. Some locals are coming into the caravan park to have hot showers, Dubberley says. He is expecting to be locked in for weeks, though authorities are aiming to reopen the main road much sooner.

But after spending Christmas an ocean away from your family not having to go through the same stuff you do every year, you know you can\u2019t do another family Christmas. This week, reportedly without consulting the royal family, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex released a statement saying: \u201cWe intend to step back as \u2018senior\u2019 members of the royal family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty the Queen \u2026 We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and north America, continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.\u201d The couple said the discussions had been many months in the making; but who hasn\u2019t after a family Christmas felt like \u201cstepping back\u201d from their relatives? Weirdly, or perhaps not, 8 January, the day the Sussexes put out their public statement, is known as \u201cDivorce Day\u201d. That is the most popular day of the year to commence proceeding for divorce, according to statistics. Data analysed by divorce support service Amicable have shown that more than 40,500 people in the UK will search \u201cdivorce\u201d online in January. Adult children can\u2019t really divorce their families but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to. (And vice versa, I might add.) Christmas is a time when we often return to our family of origin. It\u2019s a weird time, a reverse of the Tom Hanks movie Big, where we are inhabiting our adult bodies but finding ourselves hurled back to childhood roles. In those intense, often claustrophobic days leading up to Christmas, the day itself and right up to New Year\u2019s, we can revert to old family roles, patterns and grievances. Some of us even find ourselves sleeping in our childhood bedrooms, legs hanging off the too-short bunk bed, the musty Star Wars sleeping bag barely keeping us warm. There\u2019s not just a regression we experience at Christmas, but a whole suite of guilt, expectations and old wounds can arise. We are reminded of our family obligations, and over mince pies and too much alcohol, often reminded of where we fall short. For every family enjoying a happy time at Christmas, there will be another family next door, comprised of ageing parents and grown-up children who strain under the pressure of being together. After surviving a family Christmas it\u2019s really normal to want to release a statement to the world saying \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m STEPPING BACK! (and moving continents!!!)\u201d For Harry and Meghan, stepping back from the royal family means stepping back from a life of feeling trapped in a particular, narrow and stifling role. It means stepping back from a bullying and destructive British media that have already inflicted so much trauma on Harry throughout his life and Meghan since their marriage. It means breaking ancestral patterns and problems that come with being a royal. It\u2019s the Sussex\u2019s Bonnie and Clyde moment; a break for the border, a cry of liberation.

      "bodyText": "First published in 1979, The White Album, Joan Didion\u2019s collection of essays and journalism about the 1960s, has become a modern classic of New Journalism. Didion uses a highly stylised cadence and a fragmented, mosaic style of storytelling to illustrate the times. But her voice is also a metaphor: language breaks down, the world is breaking down, she\u2019s having a breakdown. This is the second of Didion\u2019s landmark works to be taken to the stage, the first being The Year of Magical Thinking \u2013 a memoir about the death of her husband \u2013 which opened on Broadway in 2007. The White Album is a tougher proposition. While the theme of Didion\u2019s book is the search for and failure to find a narrative, on the stage, this failure of narrative can be disorienting and unsatisfying for theatregoers. Which is perhaps the point. The director Lars Jan and the Early Morning Opera have brought The White Album to the stage after almost eight years of trying to obtain the rights. They eventually secured them with the promise to Didion that the text of the book\u2019s first, eponymous essay would be performed in its entirety. \u201cWe promised to do every word. We weren\u2019t going to cut anything \u2013 we were going to start with the first word and end with the last,\u201d Jan said in an interview. The first words of that essay \u2013 \u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live\u201d \u2013 have become famous in their own right and, when delivered on stage by the actor and co-creator Mia Barron, they produce chills. The fragmented scenes take a form like chapters and cover Didion\u2019s perspective on key moments during the late 60s \u2013 the trial of Huey Newton, a Doors recording session, the San Francisco State College student protests and the Manson murders \u2013 as well as her own psychiatric assessment and the packing list she uses when she\u2019s on assignment. It is essentially a monologue \u2013 Barron reciting the wordy text from memory \u2013 broken up with asides or quotes from a Greek chorus of hippies, protesters, musicians and activists, played in large part by members of the audience, led by surreptitious instructions fed through earpieces, who volunteered beforehand to be part of the show. Jan has also previously said that it was not necessary for Barron to actually embody Didion: \u201cShe is using the words of the text to create a character, to speak those words instinctively,\u201d he said.

In appeal documents filed with the federal court on Monday, Stone claimed White made a series of errors and said Leyonhjelm\u2019s statements about Hanson-Young should also be protected by the implied right to freedom to discuss political matters contained in the constitution. \u201cQualified privilege should protect public statements made by a politician regarding the conduct and character of another politician, which are not actuated by malice, without a further requirement of reasonable care in publishing the statement,\u201d he said. Leyonhjelm\u2019s appeal relies on a 1997 case in which the high court found the constitution implied a right to freedom of political speech after New Zealand prime minister David Lange sued the ABC for defamation over a Four Corners program about donations from big business to his Labour party. The high court decision narrowed the scope of the right from what had been established in a previous case involving Labor politician Andrew Theophanus, but upheld its existence. In his appeal documents, Stone said White was wrong to find that Leyonhjelm \u201cacted unreasonably by failing to verify with the respondent [Hanson-Young] or other senators whether she had interjected using words to the effect of those attributed her\u201d. He also argued that White\u2019s finding that Leyonhjelm was motivated by malice should be set aside because \u201cthe motive of causing political damage to the respondent [Hanson-Young] or her political party could not be regarded as improper\u201d. And he said White was \u201cwrong to have relied on authorities regarding the conduct of newspapers or broadcasters reliant on sources, but ought to have given primacy to the situation in which the appellant [Leyonhjelm] was a politician, discussing the conduct of another politician, in an incident in which he was himself a politician, and having heard the interjection himself\u201d. Hanson-Young told Guardian Australia that \u201cwhile we haven\u2019t considered the grounds of appeal yet, I expect my lawyers will vigorously oppose the appeal,\u201d she said. Stone and Leyonhjelm could not be reached for comment.",

There were 100 new daily temperature records set at spots around New Zealand. The country has not experienced the severe weather extremes that have plagued neighbouring Australia and its climate is traditionally much more temperate. But the \u201ctrend towards warming shows that we are affected by climate change\u201d, said Professor James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University Wellington, in comments to New Zealand\u2019s Science Media Centre. Renwick said that seas around New Zealand experienced \u201crecord warmth\u201d in many locations.

We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Boasting of<strong> US strength</strong>. \u201cOur missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast...The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\u201d</li> \n   <li>A new <strong>Iran deal</strong>? Much to US allies\u2019 chagrin, Trump announced in 2018 that the US intended to \u201cexit\u201d the 2013, multi-national Iran nuclear deal aimed at persuading Iran to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for the easing of harsh economic sanctions. Trump said moments ago: \u201cIran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Greece, France, Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Further <strong>sanctions</strong>: \u201cAs we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.\u201d No details given. </li> \n   <li><strong>NATO</strong>: \u201cThe civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward. Today I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-is-it-why-does-trump-want-to-scrap-it\">What is the Iran deal and why does Trump want to scrap it?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1608718f08c39722647096\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T17:07:21.851Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump talks of \"shared priorities\" with Iran, in apparent de-escalation</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump rounded off his short TV address to the public with what might normally be considered some small-talk or waffle but in the current context and with this president counts as actual diplomatic outreach.</p> \n  <p>It may be no more than lip service. But given that Trump often opts for bellicose and extremely simplistic rhetoric in denouncing or threatening anyone he regards as a foe, his closing sentences were noteworthy.</p> \n  <p>In fact, all the signals from the last 19 or so hours are that both Iran and the US have embarked on a hasty de-escalation of their sudden crisis.</p> \n  <p>As he wound down his speech moments ago, Trump referred to the battle against Islamic State, and American forces\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/28/the-guardian-view-on-baghdadis-death-not-enough-to-destroy-islamic-state\">assassination</a> of ISIS leader <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a></strong> last October.</p> \n  <p>But then he swiftly pivoted.</p> \n  <p>\u201cISIS is a natural enemy of Iran,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe should work together on this and other shared priorities.

The first projectiles struck their targets shortly after the Iranian general\u2019s coffin was lowered into the ground in the city of Kerman. The Revolutionary Guards called the operation \u201cMartyr Suleimani\u201d. They distributed videos of the missiles being launched to be broadcast across Iranian media.</p> \n   <p>Despite this theatricality, the attacks appear to have been carefully designed to avoid US casualties: fired at bases that were already on high alert and so far registering no confirmed deaths. Adel Abdul Mahdi, the Iraqi prime minister, said he was forewarned of the attacks as they were imminent, and passed the alert to troops stationed at the base.</p> \n   <p>Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the strikes were characterised as self-defence and within the boundaries of international law, not the first shots in a war. He added the attacks had now concluded.

Rockets reportedly fell on the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d around the US embassy and military facilities in Baghdad today, but details have been scarce. Trump spoke with Justin Trudeau and Boris Johnson on the phone. The leaders discussed working together to ensure that Iran doesn\u2019t acquire a nuclear weapon. Catch up on news and analysis of the US-Iran crisis: Trump pulls back for now but game of chicken with Tehran far from over The optics of Trump\u2019s announcement: America stands ready to strike EU leaders relieved as Trump steps away from Iran conflict \u2018They took good revenge\u2019: Iranians respond to Iraq strikes False claims spread online after Iran missile attack on Iraqi airbases Mike Pence said the US isn\u2019t seeking a regime change in Iran, but wants \u201cto see the regime change its behavior\u201d in an interview on CBS. The vice-president earlier tweeted that the \u201cAmerica is safer and stronger because of President Trump\u2019s decisive action\u201d toward Iran. Pence\u2019s tone matches that of Trump, vacillating between appearing strong and backing off. As the Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy wrote in his analysis, though Trump\u2019s public address this morning, which he delivered while \u201cflanked by cabinet members and backed by eight military officers, communicated a clear subtext: America stood ready to strike\u201d \u2013 even as his speech was notably non-provocative. Lindsey Graham said that fellow Republican senators Mike Lee and Rand Paul were \u201coverreacting\u201d and that those seeking to limit the president\u2019s war powers were \u201cempowering the enemy\u201d. Lee told Fox News that it was \u201cwrong\u201d for the Trump administration to insist that there must be \u201cno dissension\u201d in the GOP over warlike actions from the president. In the aftermath of the Iran missile attacks, there\u2019s been a spread of online disinformation. The Guardian\u2019s Jim Waterson reports: Iran\u2019s missile attacks on two Iraqi airbases have been accompanied by a spread of online disinformation, falsely labelled images and claims of news sources being hacked, which have added to jitters in the region regarding the attacks. Iranian state television said on Wednesday that at least 80 \u201cAmerican terrorists\u201d were killed, despite the US making clear that it had not sustained any casualties as a result of rocket attacks on Iraqi military bases hosting American troops. The attacks occurred in retaliation for the US\u2019s assassination of the powerful Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Iran has a long history of running state-backed disinformation campaigns which attempt to influence opinion overseas, with Facebook regularly banning Iranian pages it believes are spreading false and divisive material aimed at audiences in the US and UK. Twitter suspended an account impersonating the Israeli journalist Jack Khoury, which had been used to promote false claims that hundreds of US soldiers had been injured in the attacks and claimed they had been secretly evacuated to a hospital in Tel Aviv by a military aircraft. An initial assessment by western intelligence agencies has found that the Ukrainian airliner that crashed in Iran wasn\u2019t brought down by a missile, according to a Reuters report citing an anonymous Canadian security source. Earlier today, Tehran said it would not be handing the plane\u2019s black box to Boeing, fueling concerns that the crash, which killed all 176 passengers, was caused by a missile aimed at Iraqi bases used by US forces. The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, told reporters that Iran\u2019s missile attack had been intended to kill American personnel and cause damage to the al-Asad airbase. \u201cI believe, based on what I saw and what I know, is that (the strikes) were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel. That\u2019s my own personal assessment,\u201d Milley said. \u201cBut the analytics is in the hands of professional intelligence analysts. So they\u2019re looking at that.\u201d The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said the intent has yet to be determined. Hello again, US politics watchers, I take my leave now after a lively day but hand you over to my colleague, Maanvi Singh, in California to take you through the next few hours of US-involved geopolitical events and reaction here in the United States. Key events so far today: The US House will vote tomorrow on new legislation to curb the president\u2019s war powers, after Donald Trump failed to consult or inform Congress before he ordered the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week. Rockets have been falling in the heavily-fortified \u201cGreen Zone\u201d around the US Embassy and military facilities in Baghdad. Details scarce so far. Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau spoke on the phone about the US-Iranian crisis and the crash of a Ukrainian flight outside Tehran earlier today in which many Canadian passengers were killed. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are meeting in Washington this hour. Donald Trump gave a live televised address at the White House this morning, in which he said \u201cIran appears to be standing down\u201d after its relatively restrained missile strike on US facilities in Iraq overnight, and pledged more sanctions against Iran, but also appealed to the Islamic republic to explored \u201cshared priorities\u201d with the US, such as Islamic State. \u201cNo evidence of imminent threat\u201d - Booker Here is some more reaction from both sides of the aisle - but in surprisingly parallel directions, rather than the usual polar opposite. Democratic 2020 candidate Cory Booker just tweeted about the Capitol Hill briefing on the US-Iran crisis. Booker and other Democrats running for president have had their campaigns rudely interrupted by the rising tension over Iran. Less prominent 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard was, seconds ago, on CNN saying more or less the same thing. Meanwhile, Republican maverick Senators of the day, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Utah\u2019s Mike Lee, are also exasperated. Lee told Fox News that the congressional briefing was \u201clame\u201d and that it was \u201cwrong\u201d for the senior Trump administration briefers - the secretary of state, defense secretary, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and director of the CIA - to tell GOP members of congress that there must be \u201cno dissension\u201d in the ranks over any warlike actions from Donald Trump. It seems the members were given very luke warm, unreassuring assurances over whether Congress would be involved in any near future further actions of aggression towards Iran. Lee called it the worst briefing he\u2019d ever heard in his nine years in the Senate. No casualties in Green Zone - initial reports Still very few details about the latest incident in Baghdad. But here are a few more fragments, via Reuters. Sirens were sounding inside the Green Zone. Police sources told Reuters at least one of the rockets fell 100 metres from the US Embassy. \u201cTwo Katyusha rockets fall inside the Green Zone without causing casualties. Details to follow,\u201d the military said. Two loud blasts followed by sirens had been heard in Baghdad, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. US Democrats, who dominate the House of Representatives, are still furious that they were not consulted or even notified before Donald Trump took unilateral action late last week to assassinate senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani as he was being driven away from the Baghdad airport in Iraq. It may be no more than a democratic gesture (given that the Republicans dominate the Senate and are foursquare behind their president, Trump) but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced the introduction of legislation to curb the president\u2019s war powers, and it will come up for voting tomorrow. As the Guardian\u2019s senior political reporter, Lauren Gambino, just noted. Nancy Pelosi tweeted about it earlier. Here\u2019s a bitter little tit-for-tat on Twitter last weekend. For some slightly deeper dives on this topic, here are interesting pieces about presidential war powers from the New Yorker and NPR. Meanwhile, my world affairs editor colleague, Julian Borger, analyses the bigger picture on the US and Iran and where things stand this afternoon. Latest report, with details just trickling in so far, is of three Katyusha rockets, commonly used my militias, have fallen inside Baghdad\u2019s heavily-fortified Green Zone and have started a fire, police sources report, via Reuters. The US embassy may have been the intended target. Commercial airlines are rerouting flights throughout the Middle East to avoid potential danger during heightened tensions between the US and Iran. Jumbled schedules could affect as many as 15,000 passengers per day, lengthen flight times by an average of 30 to 90 minutes, and severely bruise the bottom line for airlines, industry analysts said, and The Associated Press reported. \u201cIn a war situation, the first casualty is always air transport,\u201d said Dubai-based aviation consult Mark Martin, pointing to airline bankruptcies during the Persian Gulf and Yugoslav wars. At least 500 commercial flights travel through Iranian and Iraqi airspace daily, Martin said. A Ukrainian passenger jet crashed shortly after taking off from Iran\u2019s capital early Wednesday killing 167 passengers and nine crew members just hours after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack, but Iranian officials said they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ukrainian officials initially agreed, but later backed away and declined to offer a cause while the investigation is ongoing. Air France and Dutch carrier KLM both said Wednesday that they had suspended all flights over Iranian and Iraqi airspace indefinitely. German airline Lufthansa and two of its subsidiaries also canceled flights to Iraq. The Russian aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, issued an official recommendation for all Russian airlines to avoid flying over Iran, Iraq, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman \u201cdue to existing risks for the safety of international civil flights.\u201d Australian carrier Qantas said it was altering its London to Perth, Australia, route to avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice. Malaysia and Singapore Airlines are re-routing, too. The US Federal Aviation Administration said it was barring American pilots and carriers from flying in areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace. Initial reports coming in suggest that there were two loud blasts, moments ago, followed by sirens, Reuters witnesses said. The cause was not immediately clear. The quartet of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, the still relatively new defense secretary Mark Esper, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley and the historically-controversial CIA director Gina Haspel strode across Capitol Hill today to brief members of Congress on the Iran issues. There is some difference of perspective on how effective the briefing was. Here is a reported take from a Republican member of Congress: And: Senior Democrat and chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, Eliot Engel, who was deeply involved in the Trump impeachment inquiry, was unimpressed. Mixed reaction from libertarian Republican Rand Paul: Democrat Pramila Jayapal said of the administration\u2019s stated justification for assassinating Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in the Baghdad area last week: \u201cThere was NO raw evidence presented that this [Suleimani plotting against US] was an imminent threat.\u201d British prime minister Boris Johnson and his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, had a telephone call with each other earlier in which they discussed the need for urgent de-escalation on all sides in the US-Iran crisis following Iranian missile attacks on military bases housing US troops in Iraq overnight, a spokesperson for Johnson said. The leaders also discussed working together, and with international partners, to ensure Iran is prevented from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Johnson also offered condolences for the Canadians who lost their lives in the Ukrainian airliner that crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. There are few specifics available in terms of the two leaders\u2019 reactions to Donald Trump announcing this morning the intention for the US to impose further sanctions on Iran, and the US president\u2019s urging of allies to abandon the \u201cremnants\u201d of the Iran Nuclear Deal, the international accord to trade a loosening of sanctions for Iran\u2019s backing off from developing their own nuclear missile capability. The pre-dawn crash of a US-built Boeing airliner in Iran earlier today, with the loss of 176 lives, looks set to strain fragile international protocols on co-operation in air disaster investigations at a time when the United States and Iran are already mired in confrontation. The relatively new Boeing 737-800NG jet flown by Ukraine International Airlines burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran and crashed on Wednesday, Reuters writes this afternoon. The results of an investigation and even the way it is set up and coordinated could inflame political differences as mystery surrounds the jet\u2019s sudden nosedive, analysts said. Iran and the United States are co-signatories of the basic global agreement on modern aviation 75 years ago and sit together at the United Nations\u2019 aviation agency. The 1944 Chicago Convention gave rise to strict rules about how air accidents should be investigated, marking a blueprint for co-operation that has largely stood the test of time even as member countries shunned other types of diplomatic cooperation. As the country where the jet was designed and built, the United States has a right to be accredited to the investigation and would normally appoint Boeing, which is bogged down in its own corporate and safety crisis involving its ground 737 Max aircraft type, as its own technical adviser. But Wednesday\u2019s crash immediately triggered fresh signs of international distrust. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was prepared to offer Ukraine assistance but he did not mention any role for Iran in the ensuing investigation. It\u2019s been a lively day so far in US-facing international politics. There will be plenty more developments to come, so do read on. Here are the key events so far: British foreign secretary Dominic Raab and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo will meet in Washington later today. The event was brought forward and was originally scheduled to happen tomorrow. Earlier, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump talked on the phone, but almost no details have emerged. The US has promised full cooperation in investigations following the crash of a Ukrainian passenger flight shortly after take-off from Tehran in the early hours. There is unofficial talk that it was shot down. Donald Trump ended his live address at the White House earlier by appealing to Iran to coordinate with the US on \u201cshared priorities\u201d such as shutting off ISIS. Trump said in his address that Iran appears to be \u201cstanding down\u201d after missile launches from Iran towards US forces in Iraq almost 24 hours ago avoided (perhaps deliberately, according to sources) causing any US casualties. Nevertheless, Trump announced more economic sanctions on Iran and asked NATO to get more involved. Influential Iraqi Shi\u2019ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said a little earlier today that the crisis Iraq was experiencing in recent days of heightened international tension is now over following de-escalation rhetoric from both Iran and the US. He called on Iranian-backed militia groups not to carry out attacks. A new, strong Iraqi government able to protect the nation\u2019s sovereignty and independence should be formed in the next 15 days and usher in an early election, the populist cleric said in a statement, Reuters reports. He added that Iraqis should still seek to expel foreign troops, however. \u201cI call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions, and to shut down the extremist voices of some rogue elements until all political, parliamentary and international methods have been exhausted,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s latest view on the US-Iran crisis is that relief from tension and aggression may be short-lived. Dominic Raab, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, arrived in Washington an hour ago. He had been expected to meet with counterpart Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, tomorrow but the meeting has been brought forward to late this afternoon. It\u2019s now expected to take place at 4.30pm ET/9.30pm GMT this afternoon. So far, we understand the two will not make public remarks before they disappear into their t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate but that could always change in the moment. The two have met before, several times, and this was a pre-planned visit following the Conservative Party victory in December\u2019s UK general election. It\u2019s not an emergency meeting following the eruption of the US-Iran crisis in the last week (which affects NATO, British troops in Iraq, Britain\u2019s participation in the Iran nuclear deal and British interests overall in a stable Middle East). But there seems little doubt the events of the last six days will now be on the agenda. Donald Trump urged Britain and others earlier today to join the US in abandoning the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, a terse read-out from the White House on a phone call earlier today between Donald Trump and British prime minister Boris Johnson. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the current situation in the Middle East and agreed to continue close coordination in support of shared national security interests.\u201d The US did not consult nor notify the UK before it assassinated Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week. From Istanbul today: Turkey and Russia called on the US and Iran to prioritize diplomacy and de-escalate tensions, warning that the exchange of attacks by Washington and Tehran could lead to a new cycle of instability in the region. The joint call was issued in a statement after a meeting between presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin in Turkey, where they were discussing cooperation on a gas pipeline, designed to connect the large gas reserves in Russia to the Turkish gas transportation network and provide energy supplies for Turkey, south and south-east Europe. In part, the joint statement read: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the escalation of the tension between the US and Iran as well as its negative repercussions on Iraq. We evaluate the targeting..of Qassem Suleimani and his entourage in Baghdad on 3 January as an act undermining security and stability in the region. \u201cIn light of the ballistic missile attacks by Iran against coalition military bases in Iraq on 8 January 2020, we believe that exchange of attacks and use of force by any party do not contribute to finding solutions to the complex problems in the Middle East, but rather would lead to a new cycle of instability and would eventually damage everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said a little earlier that the United States was calling for complete cooperation with any investigation into the cause of the crash of a Ukrainian airliner shortly after it took off from Tehran just over 12 hours ago. In a statement, Pompeo said the US was prepared to offer Ukraine all possible assistance after the crash of the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737, which burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard. There is speculation that the plane was shot down, and it appeared to burst into flames in mid-air. There is no confirmation of, or official lines on, causes yet. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said that there were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians on board. The Ukrainian nationals included two passengers and the nine crew. There were also 10 Swedish passengers, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals, my Guardian colleagues in London and the Middle East report. Meanwhile, announcing on his Facebook page that Ukraine would send a team of experts to Iran later today, president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: \u201cOur priority is to establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe.\u201d Highlights of Trump speech Here are some more detailed quotes of some of the main points made in the US president\u2019s short address from the White House a little earlier. Iran seen as standing down. \u201cNo Americans were harmed in last night\u2019s attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.\u201d Boasting of US strength. \u201cOur missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast...The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\u201d A new Iran deal? Much to US allies\u2019 chagrin, Trump announced in 2018 that the US intended to \u201cexit\u201d the 2013, multi-national Iran nuclear deal aimed at persuading Iran to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for the easing of harsh economic sanctions. Trump said moments ago: \u201cIran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Greece, France, Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA.\u201d Further sanctions: \u201cAs we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.\u201d No details given. NATO: \u201cThe civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward. Today I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.\u201d Donald Trump rounded off his short TV address to the public with what might normally be considered some small-talk or waffle but in the current context and with this president counts as actual diplomatic outreach. It may be no more than lip service. But given that Trump often opts for bellicose and extremely simplistic rhetoric in denouncing or threatening anyone he regards as a foe, his closing sentences were noteworthy. In fact, all the signals from the last 19 or so hours are that both Iran and the US have embarked on a hasty de-escalation of their sudden crisis. As he wound down his speech moments ago, Trump referred to the battle against Islamic State, and American forces\u2019 assassination of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last October. But then he swiftly pivoted. \u201cISIS is a natural enemy of Iran,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe should work together on this and other shared priorities. To the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future, and a great future, one that you deserve, of prosperity and harmony.\u201d He concluded that the US is \u201cready to embrace peace with all who seek it.\u201d This might be meaningless chat from the US president but indicates an unusual level-headedness, however brief, communicated via Trump by those advising him and is a clear de-escalation of the rhetoric. In his short speech, Donald Trump, who has been scathing and mocking of NATO, called on the alliance to \u201cget more involved in the Middle East\u201d. He didn\u2019t go into further detail and went on to boast that the USA is now self-sufficient in oil and natural gas, as \u201cthe number one producer in the world\u201d, and said: \u201cWe do not need Middle East oil.\u201d Trump then asserted, in warning Iran in characteristic tone, that \u201cour missiles are big and powerful and accurate...and lethal.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t want to use force, however, and said that \u201cAmerica\u2019s strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\u201d The US president just declared that he will impose additional economic sanctions on Iran. He is calling on Europe to \u201cbreak away from the remnants of the Iran nuclear deal\u201d, which he called a \u201cfoolish\u201d deal and had previously announced the US would abandon. Trump has not given any details about the nature of further sanctions. Donald Trump has described last week\u2019s missile assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani as \u201cdecisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist\u201d. \u201cLast week we eliminated the world\u2019s top terrorist,\u201d he said at the White House. Donald Trump has announced that there were no US casualties in the Iranian missile strikes on US facilities in Iraq last night. \u201cIran appears to be standing down,\u201d he said. The president has arrived and is now speaking. The US president is about to arrive at a briefing podium in the White House and will begin speaking shortly on the latest developments in the US-Iran crisis. Watch, live. Vice president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo just entered. US Congress in limbo over Trump\u2019s actions against Iran Senior US House Democrats a little earlier today said there is no set schedule yet for voting on a war powers resolution that would limit Donald Trump\u2019s actions regarding Iran, and that legislation is still being drafted. Representatives are seeking to put a check on the president\u2019s power after he failed to inform Congress in advance of the US drone strike last week that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Suleimani as he was driving away from Baghdad airport in Iraq. We are waiting for US president Donald Trump to make a televised address, live. He\u2019s behind schedule by almost 15 minutes so far. Meanwhile, despite what is being interpreted as relative restraint by Iran in its missile strikes last night, both towards the US and Iraq, the latest from Reuters is that the Iraqi foreign ministry plans to summon the Iranian ambassador in order to lodge an objection to the missile strikes on its soil. The White House press pool has been called to gather at the door of the Palm Room at the White House. They are waiting to enter an area called the grand foyer, in preparation for the president\u2019s address at the top of the hour. Portraits of Qassem Suleimani have been carried aloft in rallies from Gaza to Yemen, raising the prospect that his violent death will elevate him as an icon of anti-American resistance. The powerful Iranian commander, who was buried on Wednesday, was hailed as a \u201cliving martyr\u201d in the Islamic republic for his military and strategic exploits that included halting the Islamic State group as it rampaged across Iraq and Syria, the AFP agency writes. After his assassination at the age of 62, in a US drone strike in Baghdad last week, some observers say his martyr status will grow, rendering him a figurehead for the disparate pro-Iranian groups that he guided and fostered. \u201cThe shock factor isn\u2019t so much that Suleimani has died - he was after all in many battles - but the way the US president has taken ownership of this will create that type of zeal and drive and commitment across the Middle East,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. Suleimani was a polarising figure, even within his own country. But the so-called Iranian \u201caxis of resistance\u201d stretching from Iran to the Mediterranean Sea will now be \u201cgalvanised to focus more on their ultimate goal, which is the US withdrawal from as much of the Middle East as possible,\u201d Geranmayeh told AFP. Among Muslim Shiite communities, where Suleimani was seen as a champion in the face of Sunni aggression, there were expressions of grief, anger and resolve. \u201cThe blood of the martyrs... is not just Iranian or Iraqi but belongs to the Muslim community and to free men around the world,\u201d said a Huthi official in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital held by the Iran-backed militia. At a mourning ceremony in the Gaza Strip Suleimani was eulogised by the militant Palestinian movement Islamic Jihad and his image was raised high in Lebanon. In Iran, Suleimani was widely regarded as a hero for his staunch defence of the country, his defeat of the IS jihadist group, and his role in the grinding 1980s conflict between Iran and Iraq. Since his death, Suleimani has been hailed as the \u201cChe Guevara of the Middle East\u201d in some quarters, but the region\u2019s schisms and fractures present a much more complex picture. \u201cThey\u2019re packaging Suleimani as this foreign policy guru, martyr, strategist... away from the narrative that he was a terrorist and responsible for loss of life,\u201d said Sanam Vakil from the London-based Chatham House. Iran is believed to have deliberately sought to avoid US military casualties in last night\u2019s missile strikes on bases housing American troops in Iraq, according to US and European government sources familiar with intelligence assessments, Reuters writes moments ago. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday the Iranians were thought to have targeted the attacks to miss US forces, in order to prevent the crisis from escalating out of control, while still sending a message of Iranian resolve. A source in Washington said overnight that early indications were of no US casualties, while other US officials declined comment. US Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, speaking in the chamber on Capitol Hill moments ago communicated a relatively cautious message, following the Iranian missile strikes last night and ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s plan to address the nation on television at the top of the hour. \u201cI was troubled but not surprised by reports that Iran fired ballistic missiles at US forced,\u201d he said, of the strikes within Iraq. He said the Iranian threat \u201chad been growing for years\u201d and noted: \u201cIt will continue even beyond the death of Iran\u2019s master terrorist Qassem Suleimani. We must remain vigilant.\u201d He pointed out that \u201capparently\u201d there had been no injuries or deaths as a result of the strikes last night. \u201cBut they demonstrated progress Iran has made...towards a large and long-range missile force.\u201d McConnell then added that the strikes were \u201ca stark reminder that Iran and its proxies have been a cancer on Iraqi sovereignty and politics for a long time.\u201d Senior Democrats have been expressing concern about the lack of information coming from the Trump administration about the standoff with Iran, and have called on officials in the Defense department to provide regular briefings and documents to Congress. \u201cWhile recognizing the need for operations security, we similarly believe there is a requirement to be transparent with the American people about how many troops this Administration plans to deploy in support of contingency plans,\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and other senior Democrats wrote in a letter on Wednesday. The Democrats also expressed grave concern over Trump\u2019s recent comments on targeting Iranian cultural sites, and asked for clarification. They said they expected a response by Friday. The Pentagon has contradicted Trump, saying cultural sites would not be a target. US secretary of defense Mark Esper acknowledged that such an attack is against international law and would be considered a war crime, adding: \u201cWe will follow the laws of armed conflict.\u201d The Iranian strikes on Iraqi bases last night appear to have been carefully designed to avoid US casualties, and may offer both sides a pathway out of the standoff, the Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi writes: The Iranian strikes were heavy on symbolism. The missiles were launched around 1.30am in Iraq, roughly the same time as the drone strike that killed Suleimani outside Baghdad\u2019s airport on Friday morning. The first projectiles struck their targets shortly after the Iranian general\u2019s coffin was lowered into the ground in the city of Kerman. The Revolutionary Guards called the operation \u201cMartyr Suleimani\u201d. They distributed videos of the missiles being launched to be broadcast across Iranian media. Despite this theatricality, the attacks appear to have been carefully designed to avoid US casualties: fired at bases that were already on high alert and so far registering no confirmed deaths. Adel Abdul Mahdi, the Iraqi prime minister, said he was forewarned of the attacks as they were imminent, and passed the alert to troops stationed at the base. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the strikes were characterised as self-defence and within the boundaries of international law, not the first shots in a war. He added the attacks had now concluded. Even the hardline Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that they considered this round of overt hostilities to be over if the US declined to respond. This presents an opportunity for Trump that the US president appears to have recognised. Far from the over-the-top warnings he issued in recent days, he used his first comments after the unprecedented attack to play it down. Here\u2019s a summary of where events stand so far today: Iran launched more than a dozen missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US and coalition troops overnight, declaring the strikes to be retaliation for the killing last week of the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. You can read the full report here. Iranian officials initially told state media, without presenting evidence, that at least 80 US personnel had been killed or injured in the strikes, but President Donald Trump tweeted that casualty assessments were underway but \u201cso far, so good\u201d. He is expected to make a statement at 11am ET this morning. The Iraqi prime minister\u2019s office said it had received a verbal message from the Iranians shortly after midnight saying that their \u201cresponse to the assassination of the martyr Qassem Soleimani had begun or would start shortly\u201d and would be limited to US military stationed in Iraq. At the same time, they were informed by the Americans that strikes had begun against US forces at various locations in the country. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, described the bombings as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d for the US but warned that Tehran still had a wider goal of expelling its enemy from the region. He told an audience in the city of Qom: We just gave [the US] a slap in the face last night. But that is not equivalent to what they did. International leaders have called on both sides to refrain from further violence. EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said \u201cthe use of weapons must stop now to give space for dialogue\u201d. Meanwhile, a passenger plane bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has crashed a few minutes after taking off from Tehran\u2019s main international airport, killing 176 people. Iran\u2019s Red Crescent said there was no chance of finding survivors, and Pir Hossein Kulivand, an Iranian emergency official, later told state TV all those onboard had been killed. Iran has said it will not hand over the black box of the plane \u2013 which contains vital records of how the tragedy occurred \u2013 to Boeing. The White House has said Trump will deliver an address at 11am EST (4pm GMT) following the Iranian attacks on Iraqi military bases housing US troops Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s US politics live blog, where we\u2019ll be focused on the latest developments on the fallout from the Iranian missile attack on US forces in Iraq last night. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has condemned Iran\u2019s missile strike, and has urged Iran to refrain from further violence. European leaders have pleaded in public and in private with the Trump administration on Wednesday to draw a line in its conflict with Iran, and not to respond militarily to Iran\u2019s \u201cretaliatory\u201d missile attack, which came days after the US drone strike in Iraq that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is expected to address the public on TV this morning about the Iran crisis. The time has not yet been specified. In other US politics news, the impeachment process for bringing Trump to trial before the Senate is in suspended animation this morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to break off from briefing her caucus of Democrats on Capitol Hill, when they had expected to hear details about the next step in impeachment, last night, after the Iranian missiles were launched. There is no indication yet of when she intends to deliver the articles of impeachment (aka congressional charges against the president) to the Senate. The Republican-controlled Senate appears intent on attempting to barrel through with the eventual trial without any witnesses being allowed.",

He said on Wednesday night he would make up his mind in the following 24 hours but is understood to have been encouraged to stand as an alternative leftwing candidate by MPs concerned that Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign has got off to a poor start. The frontrunner \u2013 the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer \u2013 is racing ahead in popularity among members with a mounting number of official nominations. Gardiner, 62, told the Guardian: \u201cI am considering running and will decide in the next 24 hours.\u201d If he does throw his hat in the ring, he will be the seventh candidate to do so.

Another Guardian investigation in December found councils were placing children in care homes that inspectors have said did not provide a good standard of care, at a cost of millions of pounds. The Guardian asked councils across England for information on the number of children being sent to homes run by 78 providers, all of whose properties were listed by Ofsted as being inadequate or in need of improvements at the end of March. Fifty-eight children were placed in such homes by at least 23 local authorities in the following three-month period, handing more than \u00a32.3m to failing providers, according to freedom of information responses and analysis of councils\u2019 published expenditure. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: \u201cWe are investing \u00a31.5bn in social care so that every child in care receives the support they need, no matter where they live. \u201cBut we know that too many children are waiting for the stable and loving home they deserve, which is why we are boosting the number of foster and adoptive parents and offering plenty of support to these families from the word go \u2013 including \u00a345m through the Adoption Support Fund, announced recently by the education secretary.

It accommodated soldiers, first from the south-west of France and later southern Belgium, as part of the Roman effort to defend the imperial frontier and repel tribes from the north.</p> <p>The fort sits between the Roman cavalry fort at Chesters and the infantry outpost at Housesteads. Nearby is a Roman temple built by the fort\u2019s soldiers and dedicated to Mithras, an eastern god who, according to legend, captured and killed the primeval bull in a cave.</p> <p>Today sheep are more likely to be grazing on the grassy mounds which largely cover the remains of the 1.4 hectare (three and a half acre) fort.

      "bodyText": "A Roman fort at Hadrian\u2019s wall, in Northumberland, built around 122AD and which housed a garrison of 500 soldiers from Gaul, has been given to the nation. English Heritage has announced that Carrawburgh Roman fort has joined sites such as Stonehenge, Tintagel castle, and Eltham palace, in the national collection of historic sites and properties following its gift by a landowner. Carrawburgh is one of 16 forts along Hadrian\u2019s wall, a boundary line that stretches 73 miles. It accommodated soldiers, first from the south-west of France and later southern Belgium, as part of the Roman effort to defend the imperial frontier and repel tribes from the north. The fort sits between the Roman cavalry fort at Chesters and the infantry outpost at Housesteads. Nearby is a Roman temple built by the fort\u2019s soldiers and dedicated to Mithras, an eastern god who, according to legend, captured and killed the primeval bull in a cave. Today sheep are more likely to be grazing on the grassy mounds which largely cover the remains of the 1.4 hectare (three and a half acre) fort. English Heritage said that compared to other sites on the wall Carrawburgh had undergone very little archaeological excavation, which meant it had many secrets and stories to be explored. The site has been looked after by the family of Jennifer Du Cane since 1950. She said: \u201cIt has been a great privilege but also a serious responsibility to own Carrawburgh Roman fort. The time has come to pass on this amazing site as a gift to the nation.\u201d Carrawburgh is the first site of its type acquired by English Heritage since the body was made a charity by the government in 2015. Kate Mavor, English Heritage\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis is a great start to the new year, not only for English Heritage but for the nation who will get to enjoy this wonderfully evocative site on what was once the edge of the Roman empire.\u201d Legal ownership of the site has transferred to Historic England, the government\u2019s heritage adviser, and it will be cared for by English Heritage as part of the national heritage collection, which comprises about 420 sites, many free to enter, that together tell the story of England. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \u201cWe are enormously grateful for this generous gift. Hadrian\u2019s wall is one of England\u2019s most important historic sites and Carrawburgh makes a really valuable addition to our national collection of historic properties. \u201cThe fort represents a key part of the Roman frontier and is of outstanding archaeological significance.

      "bodyText": "A shortage of prosecutors and experienced police officers has left investigators \u201cstruggling to cope\u201d with obligations to disclose key evidence to defendants in criminal trials, according to a critical inspectorate report. Although there have been significant improvements, the Crown Prosecution Service is failing to give proper charging advice \u2013 over material that should have been handed over or had not been used \u2013 in almost half of cases. Kevin McGinty, HM chief inspector of the CPS, said the underlying problem was a lack of resources. \u201cThe challenge facing the CPS and police is considerable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CPS has been struggling to deal with its caseload without having the numbers of lawyers needed to do it. \u201cSimilarly, the police have struggled with the impact of stretched resources and the lack of understanding of disclosure obligations by inexperienced police officers.\u201d The 82-page report, which reviewed more than 1,100 sample prosecutions, found that high-priority areas such as homicide, terrorism or complex fraud are mostly dealt with by specialist police teams and CPS units that understand the law and have sufficient resources. The difficulties over disclosure occur in what is termed as \u201cvolume crown court\u201d cases where there are \u201cstretched police resources and [a] lack of understanding of criminal justice matters by large numbers of inexperienced police officers who are only infrequently required to compile a prosecution file\u201d. The review added: \u201cThe quality of case preparation, and thus the handling of disclosure, is also often undermined by under-resourced CPS staff who are struggling to cope with the sheer volume of work \u2026 almost without exception, those faults have been caused or exacerbated by the problem of too few legal staff being spread too thinly over a volume of work of ever-increasing complexity.\u201d Defendants have the right to know the evidence against them that the prosecution says proves they are guilty and also, subject to limited exceptions, what unused material exists that could undermine the case against them. The ubiquity of mobile phones, laptops, CCTV and other digital information has inflated the volume of material available in even routine criminal investigations, adding to work pressures on prosecutors and detectives. The collapse of a series of rape trials against Liam Allan and others at the end of 2017 exposed the failure of the CPS and police to hand over crucial details to the defence to ensure that the accused received a fair trial. The HMCPSI (Her Majesty\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate) report, which was delayed by the general election, examined 555 live trial files and 560 pre-charge decisions spread across each of the 14 geographical CPS areas. It says the focus on disclosure procedures in police and CPS is having an impact but that in many instances \u201cthe improvement is from a low baseline\u201d, adding that performance will \u201cneed to improve further to reach an acceptable standard\u201d. Among key findings were that the number of cases where the CPS charging advice dealt properly with disclosable and non-disclosable unused material, fully meeting the required standard, was 49%. This is an improvement from the last similar assessment in 2017 when the comparable figure was 29%. There has been a marked improvement in cases where the CPS correctly advised the police in the charging advice on reasonable lines of inquiry \u2013 rising from 46% in 2017 to 74% now. Prosecutors improved compliance with the requirement to review defence statements and provide comments and advice to police from 41% of cases to 60% of cases over the same period. One area of performance deemed \u201cunacceptably low\u201d is where the CPS provides feedback to police when they identified failures in the handling of unused material in pre-charge cases. There has been fierce criticism of the CPS\u2019s handling of rape cases, where the number of convictions has fallen sharply while complaints surge. About 16% of the completed trial files examined by HMCPSI involved rape and serious sexual offence prosecutions. Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: \u201cWe must not forget that victims of crime and those accused of committing crimes can be the most affected by disclosure failures, and the fact that in less than 50% of the cases inspected was disclosure done properly is not reassuring to the public. \u201cAs the report acknowledges, there has been further investment in the CPS.

      "bodyText": "Whirlpool should offer the owners of more than half a million recalled washing machines the option of a refund alongside a repair or replacement, according to the Which? consumer group. The US company is launching the UK-wide recall on Thursday after admitting that up to 519,000 appliances sold under its Hotpoint and Indesit brands between October 2014 and February 2018 were a fire risk because they could be affected by a door lock flaw that could lead to overheating. The company has offered to repair or replace the unsafe machines, but Which? has warned that this could leave a large number of customers with the dangerous appliances in their homes for many months. Its warning follows earlier research into Whirlpool\u2019s \u201cchaotic\u201d repair or replacement programme for fire-risk tumble dryers that started in 2015. It found that a quarter (26%) of affected customers were told they would have to wait longer than six months for their tumble dryer to be repaired. The washing machine recall was announced just a week before Christmas when hundreds of thousands of families were told their Hotpoint or Indesit washing machine had a serious safety fault, which to date has caused 79 fires. Which? has since been contacted by worried Whirlpool customers who are struggling without the use of their washing machine and fear they could be left in limbo for months while waiting for a repair or replacement. Others have bought new machines rather than endure a long wait for a functioning appliance and many have racked up considerable expenses in trips to the launderette. The consumer group says it is also concerned about conflicting advice from Whirlpool and the government\u2019s product safety regulator about whether or not customers can continue to use the machines at all while they are left to wait for a repair or replacement. Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection at Which?, said: \u201cIt would clearly be unacceptable if customers were left for many months without adequate washing facilities in their homes, particularly when there is also no offer to cover consequential costs such as trips to the laundrette. \u201cThe company should do the right thing and offer customers a refund, so people can get fire-risk machines out of their homes and quickly find a suitable replacement.\u201d A Whirlpool spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to apologise for any inconvenience caused by this recall. The issue relates to a particular combination of components which are no longer used in the production of certain models of Indesit and Hotpoint washing machines. \u201cReplacing or repairing affected units completely removes the risk of this issue and avoids any possibility of the machines entering the second-hand market. Therefore this is the most effective means of removing this risk from people\u2019s homes.\u201d",

The downturn was influenced by a 0.9% fall in sales in the crucial final two months of the year when many retailers get most of their annual profits.

She said this was reflected in job losses, shop closures and company restructurings that hit the industry last year, as well as weak consumer demand. Dickinson said: \u201cTwice the UK faced the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, as well as political instability that concluded in a December general election, further weakening demand for the festive period.\u201d Retailers were facing the challenge of the shift to online shopping and more cautious spending, triggered by economic uncertainty and concerns about the environment, she said. The shift towards renting and a soft housing market, as well as the trend towards buying and owning less \u201cstuff\u201d, also hit retail. December figures from Barclaycard indicated a move away from buying goods towards spending on experiences. The data, published on Thursday, indicated a 19% rise in cinema ticket sales, 11.7% increase in spending in pubs and 12.5% jump in takeaway orders, while spending on clothing, toys and computer games contracted. The figures shine a light on a terrible year for the high street during which thousands of stores have closed and 140,000 shop staff have lost their jobs. A string of well-known names have been forced to call in administrators. The fashion chains Karen Millen, Coast and Forever 21, Scottish department store Watt Brothers, pawn shop Albermarle &amp; Bond, and the Jamie\u2019s Italian restaurant group all disappeared from the high street last year. In addition, retailers including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge owner Arcadia, HMV, Laura Ashley, Bathstore, LK Bennett and cake and cafe group Patisserie Valerie have closed a large number of outlets as part of a restructuring. More than 12% of stores now stand empty, according to analysts at Local Data Company, compared with 11.5% a year ago. Ronald Nyakairu, its lead analyst, said he expected the pace of closures to continue as those retailers most affected by the shift to online, such as fashion, were consolidating into fewer bigger sites. \u201cRetailers are centralising. Where they can have a city centre store that serves a whole metropolitan area, they will,\u201d he said. This week the exodus continued with Mothercare and Links of London to close all their UK stores. That comes after non-food retailers took the brunt of the pain in 2019 as sales fell 1.6% in the final quarter of the year, while food sales rose just 0.7%, according to the BRC and KPMG. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u201cFor many players Christmas did not deliver the results it has in the past.\u201d As more than a third of non-food retail sales were made online in December, the future of a string of other high street businesses remains in the balance. The fashion retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 and camera group Jessops, which are both seeking a rescue deal after falling into administration, and Beales, the department store which needs a cash bailout, are all likely to close stores.

      "bodyText": "A new government Town of the Year competition has backfired spectacularly after officials failed to realise that it was being launched in a place that has been a city for 19 years. Civic leaders in Wolverhampton expressed incredulity after the communities secretary Robert Jenrick was described in a government press release as \u201ckicking off his countrywide town tour in Wolverhampton\u201d. As if to compound the error, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government reported Jenrick as having toured Wolverhampton\u2019s \u201ctown centre\u201d. Wolverhampton was one of three towns named as a Millennium 2000 City after a decade-long campaign by local MPs and councillors, fighting off competition from 36 other places. It will be seen as particularly embarrassing for Jenrick, who was born and educated in Wolverhampton \u2013 which became a city when he was 18 \u2013 although he lived in nearby leafy Shropshire. Labour figures said it was proof that the Conservatives are paying lip service to the West Midlands and to the UK\u2019s neglected towns as they seek to consolidate gains made in the general election. Pat McFadden, the MP for Wolverhampton South East, said: \u201cThe Tories have made big promises to invest more in local communities but it\u2019s not a great start if ministers don\u2019t even know that Wolverhampton is a city not a town.\u201d Claire Darke, the mayor of Wolverhampton, said: \u201cWe have been a city for 19 years and they need to catch up. Are they that out of touch that they did not bother to look it up? \u201cMy concern would be that this competition is politically motivated and that they are doing it because there is a tough fight next year to vote for [a] regional mayor for the West Midlands and they are trying to attract support.\u201d The competition for English towns was announced on Wednesday with the aim to \u201ccelebrate towns\u2019 achievements\u201d, including in areas such as entrepreneurship, technology, community, enterprise and integration. A press release said: \u201cKicking off his countrywide town tour in Wolverhampton, communities secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: \u2018People have put their trust in this new government and we\u2019re making an immediate start to serve local communities and deliver real change, through our \u00a33.6bn Towns Fund.\u2019\u201d When approached for further comments on Wednesday, a ministry spokesperson said: \u201cRt Hon Robert Jenrick MP was on an embargoed visit to Wolverhampton today where he made a tour of the town centre.\u201d On a visit to Wolverhampton last year, Jenrick appeared to grasp that it was now a city, saying: \u201cI think Wolverhampton is an example of where government can work to improve the city centre to help it evolve as consumer habits are changing. \u201cThere are a lot more opportunities to get more homes and workspaces into a city centre like this and give it new life and help the city centre to thrive in the future.\u201d But in a separate interview last year he again described Wolverhampton as a town, saying: \u201cWolverhampton is a town I\u2019ve known for almost 40 years.

During the general election, he made a number of high-profile pledges to allocate funds to neglected towns in the north of England and the Midlands where the Tories were fighting to win marginal constituencies.
