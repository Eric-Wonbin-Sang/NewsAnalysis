      "body": "<p>With a flashy, showgirl name like Diamond Dealers and Cockney Geezers (Channel 4) this one-off documentary was always going to be a bit of frivolous fun. Trotters, on Bethnal Green Road in east London, is a small independent jewellery shop that likes to think big. The business was founded by Judd Green\u2019s father in 1991, and passed down to his son, who now runs the shop with his best friends from school, Kallum and Alex. This rapid-fire hour, narrated by Dani Dyer, is an attempt to showcase the trio\u2019s cheeky chappy charm as much as it is about the art of selling spectacularly expensive watches and chains.</p> <p>Trotters has a big following on Instagram, and a customer base all over the UK, with people making the trip to Bethnal Green from as far afield as Bradford, much to the amusement of Dyer\u2019s voiceover. Their patrons haggle and often pay in cash, and the shop is certainly a lively kind of place. While recent documentaries about pet food and chocolate factories seemed little more than glorified ads, this at least tries to get to the heart of what makes Trotters tick. Judd, Kallum and Alex are keen to make the point that the people shopping with them are people like them. \u201cWe get a lot more working-class than we do posh people,\u201d explains Judd.</p> <p>We see a lot of the customers who come through, each showing off their own form of British eccentricity. There\u2019s Grizz, referred to euphemistically as a \u201clocal amateur horticulturalist\u201d, who wants his sparkly union jack pendant to be \u201ciced up\u201d before he takes a trip to California to explore the cannabis industry there. There\u2019s a lot of double-speak here, and though I was desperate to know more about the people who appeared, it never scratched much more than the surface. Ashley and Ashley, a couple from Essex, popped in so male Ashley could buy female Ashley a diamond crucifix. \u201cWe had a little breakup a few weeks ago,\u201d explains male Ashley. \u201cHad to butter her up a little bit.\u201d When female Ashley reappears a few weeks later, all that butter has melted away (demonstrating the true cost of a relationship when she cannot get the full cost of the make-up necklace refunded).</p> <p>The best customer is Charlotte, who comes to look at angel-wing pendants. Now, perhaps the arrival of a very eccentric customer when cameras were in the shop was a coincidence; let\u2019s not be cynical. Charlotte turns out to be a psychic and clairvoyant who can read the tarot. Naturally, she offers to show off her skills, and by reading Alex\u2019s palms she deduces that he is a bit anaemic, and has irritable bowel syndrome. Even if they did bus her in for a bit of drama, it was delightful, and possibly the most English of psychic consultations that has ever taken place: \u201cTell me what the future holds.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have a dicky tummy if you keep eating pastry.\u201d</p> <p>As a film, though, this can\u2019t contain the big characters within it, and never sufficiently trusts that the \u201cnowt so queer as folk\u201d approach will sustain it, even though it would. Instead, it falls back on contrivances (if it is one) like the psychic. They also pop up to Sheffield to meet the boxer Charlie Edwards, who has just FaceTimed them, to chat about a special commission, and do little to improve north-south relations when they say it\u2019s \u201clike going back in time\u201d and \u201cproper Billy Elliot\u201d as they drive into the city. There\u2019s a semi-tortured explanation given for a quick trip to New York that seems to take place just so Dyer gets to say: \u201cFrom the East End to the east coast.\u201d They\u2019re there, I think, to look at the kind of watch worn by DJ Khaled in an Instagram video, called \u201cthe chandelier\u201d, a blinding piece of bling, literally; it\u2019s so shiny it should come with a warning to never look directly at it. They go for dinner in an empty restaurant with the rapper Casanova 2X, who thinks the watch is over the top, so they don\u2019t bring one home with them. End of the New York segment. That\u2019s it. We get the setup, but nothing delivers. It leaves you with the post-junk food feeling, like you\u2019ve eaten, and you\u2019re sort of full, but you\u2019re also nowhere near satisfied.</p> <p>Actually, the boys do decide to get a chandelier made in the end, but they order it from Hong Kong, and the rest of the episode is concerned with whether they can shift a watch for \u00a3120,000 or not. Spoiler alert: everyone thinks a watch that costs more than four times the average annual UK salary is a bit too showy. Like the wares Trotter is peddling, this documentary is flashy and never understated, but unlike the contents of the shop, it has little to offer in the way of value.</p>",

Judd, Kallum and Alex are keen to make the point that the people shopping with them are people like them. \u201cWe get a lot more working-class than we do posh people,\u201d explains Judd. We see a lot of the customers who come through, each showing off their own form of British eccentricity. There\u2019s Grizz, referred to euphemistically as a \u201clocal amateur horticulturalist\u201d, who wants his sparkly union jack pendant to be \u201ciced up\u201d before he takes a trip to California to explore the cannabis industry there. There\u2019s a lot of double-speak here, and though I was desperate to know more about the people who appeared, it never scratched much more than the surface. Ashley and Ashley, a couple from Essex, popped in so male Ashley could buy female Ashley a diamond crucifix. \u201cWe had a little breakup a few weeks ago,\u201d explains male Ashley. \u201cHad to butter her up a little bit.\u201d When female Ashley reappears a few weeks later, all that butter has melted away (demonstrating the true cost of a relationship when she cannot get the full cost of the make-up necklace refunded). The best customer is Charlotte, who comes to look at angel-wing pendants. Now, perhaps the arrival of a very eccentric customer when cameras were in the shop was a coincidence; let\u2019s not be cynical. Charlotte turns out to be a psychic and clairvoyant who can read the tarot. Naturally, she offers to show off her skills, and by reading Alex\u2019s palms she deduces that he is a bit anaemic, and has irritable bowel syndrome. Even if they did bus her in for a bit of drama, it was delightful, and possibly the most English of psychic consultations that has ever taken place: \u201cTell me what the future holds.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have a dicky tummy if you keep eating pastry.\u201d As a film, though, this can\u2019t contain the big characters within it, and never sufficiently trusts that the \u201cnowt so queer as folk\u201d approach will sustain it, even though it would. Instead, it falls back on contrivances (if it is one) like the psychic. They also pop up to Sheffield to meet the boxer Charlie Edwards, who has just FaceTimed them, to chat about a special commission, and do little to improve north-south relations when they say it\u2019s \u201clike going back in time\u201d and \u201cproper Billy Elliot\u201d as they drive into the city. There\u2019s a semi-tortured explanation given for a quick trip to New York that seems to take place just so Dyer gets to say: \u201cFrom the East End to the east coast.\u201d They\u2019re there, I think, to look at the kind of watch worn by DJ Khaled in an Instagram video, called \u201cthe chandelier\u201d, a blinding piece of bling, literally; it\u2019s so shiny it should come with a warning to never look directly at it. They go for dinner in an empty restaurant with the rapper Casanova 2X, who thinks the watch is over the top, so they don\u2019t bring one home with them. End of the New York segment. That\u2019s it. We get the setup, but nothing delivers. It leaves you with the post-junk food feeling, like you\u2019ve eaten, and you\u2019re sort of full, but you\u2019re also nowhere near satisfied. Actually, the boys do decide to get a chandelier made in the end, but they order it from Hong Kong, and the rest of the episode is concerned with whether they can shift a watch for \u00a3120,000 or not. Spoiler alert: everyone thinks a watch that costs more than four times the average annual UK salary is a bit too showy. Like the wares Trotter is peddling, this documentary is flashy and never understated, but unlike the contents of the shop, it has little to offer in the way of value.",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of gun rights activists, many of them armed, gathered in Virginia\u2019s capital on Monday as the governor declared a state of emergency ahead of a protest against strict new gun control laws pledged by the state\u2019s freshly elected Democratic majority government. Chanting \u201cWe will not comply\u201d, gun rights activists packed the street in front of the Virginia\u2019s state house, where the governor, Ralph Northam, had temporarily banned anyone from carrying firearms. On the streets outside, though, some protesters carried rifles and wore full tactical gear. One protester estimated that as many as 70% of the crowd was armed, most of them more discreetly, with concealed handguns. Police estimated that 22,000 people attended the rally, most of them in the streets outside the state house, where guns were allowed. Virginia\u2019s politicians had braced for potential violence at the state house, with some raising fears that the gun rights rally could turn violent, like the deadly 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Instead, Monday\u2019s rally was crowded but calm, with members of militia groups and violent far-right groups such as the Proud Boys strolling the streets, but no counter-protesters in sight. In part because of the expected presence of thousands of Virginians who had no affiliation with hate groups, local anti-fascist activists had announced days before the rally that there would be no counter-protests. One person was arrested, for wearing a mask in public, police said. The single arrest raised questions, since many protesters in the streets outside the rally had worn masks. \u201cI was kind of scared it would keep the turnout low,\u201d Jacob Taylor, 33, a Virginia resident, said, describing the conspiracy theories and fears of violence that had circulated before the event. He said he had turned out to the protest, his first ever political rally, because \u201cI don\u2019t want what I thought to be false rhetoric to keep people from coming\u201d. Taylor said that, as a gun owner, he had been motivated to come to the state capitol because some of the bills Democrats had talked about \u201cwould have directly affected what I can own and what I can do\u201d. For several hours, before an official rally organized by a state gun rights group began, protesters in the street in front of the capitol building chanted, sang the national anthem and took turns addressing the crowd through a megaphone. Northam \u201clied and he said he knew there was imminent danger out here. But all I see is God-fearing, American-loving patriots out here,\u201d one speaker, a contributor to Infowars said to cheers. Wherever the \u201cchickenshit governor is hiding, make sure he hears you right now\u201d, he called. \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d the crowd chanted. The large law enforcement presence at the rally was strikingly restrained, with no riot gear. The presence of thousands of armed citizens outside the elegant state capitol building was meant as a warning: Democrats, not just in Virginia but nationwide, should back off attempts to pass sweeping gun control laws. Early in the morning, two men pushed through the packed crowd in bright red T-shirts that read \u201cMake Politicians Afraid Again\u201d, with the image of a military-style rifle underneath. Conservative pundits were touting the non-violent gathering as evidence that law-abiding gun owners are not a threat to the publicdespite high numbers of daily shooting deaths. Shannon Watts, the founder of gun control group Moms Demand Action, condemned the rally. \u201cArmed insurrectionists who threaten violence and lawlessness if they don\u2019t get their way don\u2019t represent the majority of Virginians,\u201d she said. In Richmond, a city where nearly half of local residents are black, the gun rights protesters on Monday were overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male. Among the thousands of demonstrators were some men in tactical gear, armed with military-style rifles. The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones had showed up with members of the far-right group the Proud Boys. So did some members of anti-government militias. Northam had declared a state of emergency last Wednesday, citing \u201cthreats of violence\u201d, in an effort to avoid a repeat of violence that erupted at a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, when a march by white nationalists led to the death of a counter-protester. Local anti-fascist activists from Richmond and Charlottesville announced over the weekend that they would not be holding any counter-protests, citing safety concerns. Donald Trump acknowledged and encouraged the rally on Twitter on Monday. On Saturday, after a security briefing for lawmakers, Virginia\u2019s Republican house minority leader put out a public statement condemning \u201cany group that comes to Richmond to spread white supremacist garbage\u201d. \u201cWhile we and our Democratic colleagues may have differences, we are all Virginians and we will stand united in opposition to any threats of violence or civil unrest from any quarter,\u201d Todd Gilbert wrote. Tensions in Virginia have run high since November 2019, when Democrats won control of the state government for the first time in 26 years and pledged to pass a package of gun control laws, from universal background checks to an extreme risk protection order law to a ban on military-style assault weapons. Since then, pro-gun activists across Virginia have organized a vigorous grassroots movement to protest against the new bills. The standoff in Virginia, where the National Rifle Association (NRA) is headquartered, has also prompted spiraling conspiracy theories and intense rhetoric from gun owners about tyranny and civil war.",

A spokesman for Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, Abbas Mousavi, said last month that \u201cIran will not submit to political games and propaganda\u201d in response to media reports of diplomatic pressure. Moore-Gilbert was detained for \u201cviolating Iran\u2019s national security\u201d, Mousavi said. \u201cLike any other individual with a sentence, [she] will serve her time while enjoying all legal rights.\u201d Moore-Gilbert\u2019s most immediate concern is with her simple survival in prison. She has repeatedly written to authorities requesting better access to medication, and for money to buy food she can safely eat \u2013 she is allergic to much of the prison\u2019s food \u2013 and personal items. She says she needs about A$70 (US$50) a month to survive. \u201cI am entirely alone in Iran. I have no friends or family here and in addition to all the pain I have endured here, I feel like I am abandoned and forgotten, that after so many times of asking my embassy, I still have no money at all to endure all of this.\u201d Sources with knowledge of Moore-Gilbert\u2019s case argue the Australian government should be pushing more forcefully to have the academic \u2013 if she can\u2019t be freed \u2013 moved from the isolation of Ward 2A to the general prison population. But diplomatic progress on Moore-Gilbert\u2019s case is complicated by the intense external and internal pressure the Iranian government faces at present, labouring under sanctions and with its relations with the west under acute strain. Iran responded to the US assassination of its most powerful general, Qassem Suleimani, with missile strikes on US bases in Iraq earlier this month. But in the hours after the strikes, on-alert Revolutionary Guards accidentally shot down a passenger plane in Tehran, killing 176 civilians, and sparking mass anti-government protests in the capital. Australia has historically had a more resilient relationship with Iran than most of its western allies, but it is increasingly seen in Tehran through the prism of its staunch allegiance to the US. Canberra has, for now, fewer levers of influence to pull with Tehran. Australia last week sent the warship HMAS Toowoomba to the Middle East as a contribution to the US-led coalition protecting oil tankers traversing the Strait of Hormuz, on Iran\u2019s southern border. Iran also wants to force western militaries from neighbouring Iraq \u2013 over which it seeks to impose greater influence \u2013 and Australia\u2019s continued troop commitment to the US coalition there is a further complication in the relationship. The Iranian citizen Negar Ghodskani, held in an Adelaide prison for two years on allegations of sanctions busting while she fought extradition to the US, was ultimately sent to America last year \u2013 to Iranian displeasure \u2013 where a judge sentenced her to time served and ordered her released. Ghodskani has since returned to Iran. Two other Australians \u2013 the travel bloggers Jolie King and Mark Firkin \u2013 held for allegedly flying a drone near a military base in Tehran were released in October reportedly as part of an unacknowledged \u201cprisoner swap\u201d for the Iranian doctoral student Reza Dehbashi Kivi, who was imprisoned in Brisbane on sanctions-busting charges. There are other Iranians in Australian custody on similar charges, but Canberra is anxious to avoid the impression of straight prisoner swaps. Tehran is less concerned about the optics of prisoner exchanges. Up to five people with dual British-Iranian nationality, or with UK connections, are believed to be held in prisons in Iran, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anousheh Ashoori, also in Evin, and sentenced to five and 12 years in prison respectively. Families of detained Britons have said they are being held as collateral and that the heightened tensions have made it harder to secure their release.",

I don\u2019t rule out the possibility of broadcasting football on that platform.\u201d Which, in the world of scheming sport administrators, is about as close as you\u2019ll get to a \u2018yes\u2019.",

Anne Twomey, a professor at the University of Sydney, issued the warning on Tuesday after Scott Morrison asked the attorney general to \u201cclarify\u201d and \u201caddress\u201d legal issues with the program which the auditor general found was skewed towards marginal seats. Two leading plaintiff law firms, Slater and Gordon and Maurice Blackburn, have offered to run a class action or test case against the program, citing comments by the Australian National Audit Office that it was \u201cnot evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was\u201d for McKenzie, the former sports minister, to approve grants.\u2019 Coledale football club \u2013 already the most outspoken critics among the clubs which missed out on funding \u2013 has already contacted Maurice Blackburn about launching a case. Twomey told ABC News Breakfast the commonwealth is \u201conly given limited powers under the constitution\u201d and \u201cthere is no power given to it in relation to sport\u201d. Twomey cited the case brought by Ron Williams against the federal government\u2019s chaplaincy scheme, in which the high court found the commonwealth can\u2019t spend money unless there is parliamentary authorisation and \u201cunless there\u2019s some support in the constitution for it\u201d. Twomey suggested the commonwealth could argue the community sport infrastructure grants program comes under the \u201cnationhood power\u201d, but she doubted that \u201cresurfacing an oval\u201d would constitute a \u201cnational emergency\u201d or something that states are unable to do. \u201cWe know that the states can, and do, give out sports grants. \u201cSo, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit either of those, which means there\u2019s a bit of a problem in terms of supporting this program.\u201d Twomey said the lack of ministerial power is a secondary reason the program may be unlawful. \u201cThat\u2019s a power that\u2019s been vested by the legislation in Sports Australia \u2026 and that means that there are some difficulties there in terms of working out how it is that the minister could make the final decision in relation to these grants. \u201cSo, the grants themselves may well be unlawful.\u201d Martin Smith, a coach and member of the Coledale football club\u2019s infrastructure working group, told Guardian Australia its executive is still considering launching a case and despite reservations about the time commitment and potential negative fallout \u201cthe early signal is, yes, we\u2019d like to do it\u201d. The Coledale Waves are a rapidly growing club, which reached 600 registered players by adding more teams for women and men over 18 despite having only one field. Smith said the club had \u201cexpended significant hours\u201d on an application to upgrade its facilities, because the club\u2019s field has no lights and no space for both storage and women\u2019s change rooms. \u201cWe were probably in that group of recommended clubs that missed out due to the minister\u2019s intervention. \u201cDo we feel angry? Yes, probably - and disappointed that taxpayer money was spent in this way. \u201cThe class action \u2013 if it comes to that \u2013 I believe is a worthy thing. Governments should not be able to act in this reprehensible manner.\u201d Slater and Gordon practice group leader, Andrew Baker, noted that one of the \u201cmain advantages\u201d of a class action is that any claim \u201cwill automatically cover all groups that fall within the class\u201d. He said this was an \u201cimportant feature\u201d given clubs \u201care probably going to be reluctant\u201d to bring individual claims because they will need to apply for grant funding in future. In its scathing report, the ANAO said: \u201cA significant shortcoming was that, while the program guidelines identified that the minister for sport would approve [community sport infrastructure grant] funding, there are no records evidencing that the minister was advised of the legal basis on which the minister could undertake an approval role, and it is not evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was.\u201d It noted that although the sports minister has a power to direct Sports Australia \u201cit was not used\u201d. The attorney general, Christian Porter, told Guardian Australia the government had noted the comments concerning the legal basis for ministerial involvement and \u201cgiven the lack of any conclusive view offered by the auditor general, the prime minister has sought further consideration of the issue, which I am attending to\u201d. McKenzie and the prime minister Scott Morrison insist that all projects granted funding were eligible and no rules were broken in the administration of the scheme. On Monday the sports grants scandal drew in Morrison after revelations that he had personally handed out grants in his electorate of Cook, including a $200,000 grant to the Lilli Pilli Football Club. The ABC reported that Lilli Pilli Football Club had started works in October 2018, despite Sports Australia guidelines stipulating that projects that have already commenced works are not eligible for funding. A spokesman for Sports Australia told Guardian Australia the club has \u201cbeen making progressive upgrades to [its] facilities\u201d and its grant application, submitted in September 2018, related to the second stage of projects. \u201cThe club\u2019s second stage projects included the fit-out of gender-neutral change-rooms and a community room,\u201d he said. \u201cSport Australia notified the club of their successful grant application in December 2018, with work commencing on their second stage projects in January 2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama spoke out on America\u2019s Martin Luther King Day holiday on Monday, posting a link to the civil rights leader\u2019s 1963 letter from an Alabama jail, written while King was in detention for leading a march of black protesters without a permit and urging a boycott of businesses owned by white people. \u201cEvery so often, I re-read Dr King\u2019s Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\u201d the former Democratic president wrote. \u201cWhile some of the injustices may have changed, his poetic brilliance, moral clarity and tests of conscience still reverberate today. Take a moment to reflect on his righteous call.\u201d As America\u2019s first and so far only black president, Obama took a lead on Monday as many US cities held MLK Day events and competing candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination put aside rivalries and rows to march arm-in-arm in South Carolina. In his letter, King decried racial intolerance, writing: \u201cLet us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\u201d Obama\u2019s post came on the same day that predominantly white gun rights supporters marched in Richmond, Virginia, protesting against gun control laws proposed by the state assembly\u2019s new Democratic majority. In contrast, many political leaders offered their appreciation for King, who was assassinated by a white separatist in Memphis in 1968. In Columbia, South Carolina, where a Confederate battle flag was removed from the statehouse cupola in 2000 and only banished entirely in 2015 after a teenaged white supremacist gunmen opened fire in a Charleston Baptist church, killing nine Bible study participants, Democratic presidential candidates gathered in a potent show of unity. Putting aside their recent dispute over the electability of a female candidate, the Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders publicly shook hands at the Zion Baptist church. They then took part in leading a march on the statehouse arm-in-arm with fellow Democratic party 2020 election rivals Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Deval Patrick and Tulsi Gabbard. \u201cThis is the handshake,\u201d Gabbard said as Sanders and Warren reached across her to shake hands in the front row of the church service. In last week\u2019s Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, which holds its caucuses on 3 February to open voting in the 2020 Democratic nomination contest, Warren and Sanders had clashed amid a rumbling row. They had a fiery exchange over what was said during a private conversation about a woman\u2019s chances of becoming president. As Sanders extended his hand on live TV afterward, Warren pulled back and it was later revealed she had accused Sanders of calling her a liar over the disagreement. On Monday, the candidates linked arms and began the six-block walk from the Zion Baptist church to the South Carolina statehouse, singing We Shall Overcome. South Carolina holds its primary on 29 February. Sanders\u2019 spokesman, Michael Wukela, said the King event in South Carolina was about respect, \u201cpure and simple\u201d, noting that racial inequality, including criminal justice and poverty, highlighted the importance of the state\u2019s showcase holiday celebration, known as Columbia\u2019s King Day at the Dome. \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand shoulder-to-shoulder with people who face these challenges every day yet still manage to embrace a vision of hope and grace, then you don\u2019t deserve their respect, much less their vote,\u201d Wukela said. Joe Biden, who leads polling in the state with 36% support overall and 43% among black voters, according to a recent Fox News poll, said on Sunday that he feared that the progress made during the 1960s was unraveling. \u201cFolks, some mornings I wake up and I think it\u2019s more like what it must have been in 1920 than 2020,\u201d Biden said. Blaming Donald Trump, he claimed that the progress of the civil rights movement \u201chas not been able to be stopped until recently\u201d. \u201cI thought you could defeat hate \u2026 hate only hides,\u201d he added \ufeff At the White House, the president issued a statement: \u201cToday, we pause to honor the incredible life and accomplishments of Dr King, who helped shape the civil rights movement, gave hope to millions experiencing discrimination, and whose enduring memory inspires us to pursue a more just and equal society.\u201d Trump also tweeted about the day. And later in Washington, a mixture of cheers and boos greeted Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence, as they arrived at the Martin Luther King Jr memorial. They stood at the base of the sculpture for a minute, their heads bowed. Some members of the crowd chanted \u201c U-S-A!\u201d and a few delivered sustained boos.",

The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he has the votes to open the trial without an immediate provision for witness testimony, which could be secured later during the trial. However, McConnell said he did not have the votes to dismiss the impeachment articles out of hand.</p> \n<h2><strong>Senate trial</strong></h2> \n<p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin \u2013 although there could be a short adjournment to allow the sides to prepare. Impeachment managers will make their case, to be followed by the defense. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions to the chief justice who would cause them to be read. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p> \n<h2>Evidence examination</h2> \n<p>Both the prosecution and defence may \u2013 in theory, depending on the rules agreed for the trial \u2013 bring in witnesses, who may be examined and cross-examined. The former national security adviser John Bolton and former vice-president Joe Biden have both said that they would be prepared to testify if subpoenaed.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday at 1pm ET, the Senate will convene to approve rules for the impeachment trial of Donald Trump and to hear opening arguments in the case. The proceedings could result in the president\u2019s removal from office \u2013 but that is seen as unlikely. Here\u2019s what will happen next: Senate votes on ground rules The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he has the votes to open the trial without an immediate provision for witness testimony, which could be secured later during the trial. However, McConnell said he did not have the votes to dismiss the impeachment articles out of hand. Senate trial After the oath, the trial proper will begin \u2013 although there could be a short adjournment to allow the sides to prepare. Impeachment managers will make their case, to be followed by the defense. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions to the chief justice who would cause them to be read. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote. Evidence examination Both the prosecution and defence may \u2013 in theory, depending on the rules agreed for the trial \u2013 bring in witnesses, who may be examined and cross-examined. The former national security adviser John Bolton and former vice-president Joe Biden have both said that they would be prepared to testify if subpoenaed. The Senate may try to alter the parameters of the evidence under examination by putting forward a motion to restrict or increase it. Closing arguments The prosecution and the defence will put forward their final statements, with the House managers going last, giving the House of Representatives the first and last word. Deliberation The senators deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view. But that\u2019s open to change, too. Final vote The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has received a setback in the Lords after three amendments to the bill were passed. In the government\u2019s first parliamentary defeat since the general election, peers voted for EU citizens to have the right to be given official documentation if they lawfully reside in the UK after Brexit. They backed a cross-party amendment to the withdrawal agreement bill allowing for physical proof of status. The second defeat was over the power of British courts to depart from European court of justice judgments and the third swiftly followed when peers backed a move to allow cases to be referred to the supreme court to decide whether to depart from EU case law. However, because of Johnson\u2019s big majority, the results are expected to be overturned by the Commons. The Lords passed the first amendment, moved by Liberal Democrat peer Jonny Oates, by 270 votes to 229. It would give EU citizens in the UK the automatic right to stay, rather than having to apply to the Home Office, and would ensure they can get physical proof of their rights. Afterwards the Home Office minister Brandon Lewis issued a statement rejecting outright the calls for a physical card to prove settled status, adding that the government\u2019s policy would not change. He tweeted: \u201cI disagree with the results of today\u2019s @UKHouseofLords vote. The EU settlement scheme grants #EUcitizens with a secure, digital status which can\u2019t be lost, stolen or tampered with. There will be no change to our digital approach.\u201d A survey of EU citizens published on Monday showed that 90% want a physical card to demonstrate their right to be in the country and to avert discrimination by employers and landlords post-Brexit. Oates said that without physical documentation EU citizens eligible to remain in the UK would be \u201cseverely disadvantaged\u201d in dealings with landlords, airlines, employers and other officials. He denied it was an attempt to challenge Brexit or \u201cfrustrate\u201d the legislation, which has already passed through the Commons with large majorities ahead of Brexit day on 31 January. Oates said EU citizens covered by the settled status scheme should have the right to a physical form of proof of status, instead of the digital-only proof proposed by the government. He said the right to remain should also be based on eligibility and not forfeited by failing to meet an arbitrary deadline under a cut-off date in June 2021, which could lead to EU citizens being \u201ccriminalised\u201d afterwards. Speaking for Labour, Lord McNicol of West Kilbride said the party was \u201cfar from convinced\u201d about the government\u2019s proposals and would vote against them unless concessions were granted. Home Office minister Lady Williams of Trafford said the amendment could lead to \u201cID card creep\u201d. She defended the digital provision of proof, insisting the service was robust and reliable, and said physical documents could be lost, stolen or tampered with. \u201cThe government is adamant that we must avoid the situation where years down the line EU citizens who have built their lives here find themselves struggling to prove their rights and entitlements in the UK,\u201d Williams said.",

So it\u2019s not surprising that along with Peru and Chile, which also run many thousands of miles north to south, it has one of the most varied climates. The area around the capital, Buenos Aires, has fairly equable weather conditions: mild in winter and warm to hot in summer, with plenty of sunshine, and rain falling fairly evenly throughout the year. Farther inland, the regions of the north-east and west are quite variable: to the north the climate is tropical, with hot, humid summers and cooler, sunnier winters. The area around the Andes \u2013 which includes South America\u2019s highest peak, Aconcagua, at 7,000 metres \u2013 is generally dry and sunny, with annual rainfall less than 250mm. The southern part of Argentina \u2013 known as Patagonia (a name shared with neighbouring Chile) \u2013 is mostly very dry, especially the further east you go. The north of the region enjoys warm summers but the south has generally very cool conditions, where Tierra del Fuego boasts many features of a sub-Antarctic climate, fauna and flora.",

When they come up with collective wisdom, spirit and know-how they are a dream to coach.\u201d Hayes insisted her job is merely to empower the players: \u201cI recruit them, they know what I do within, but I believe in collective decision-making. I said to the group at half-time: \u2018What do you want to do second half?\u2019 They need to make decisions. They see and feel the game too. It\u2019s a collaboration.\u201d At half-time the players talked about \u201cthe spaces we wanted to force Arsenal into and made some decisions about how we were going to deal with that\u201d, Hayes revealed. With the game already lost Arsenal changed tack, introducing width through Lisa Evans and Beth Mead, but Chelsea\u2019s players showed their willingness to adapt their plan at a time when the manager is least able to get her thoughts across. That is not to say she does not try: players flit to the touchline and exchange words with the manager throughout and she is as close to the pitch as she can get. It is not just her relationship with the players that is significant, however. It is her relationships with her staff as well. Watch Hayes in her dugout and she stares into the eyes of each member of staff when they talk to her, listening intently. Where Chelsea can struggle, though, is against teams that do not try to play them at their own game and instead absorb the pressure. Their draws with Liverpool and Brighton could prove costly and are the reason Chelsea are one point behind Arsenal and Manchester City, albeit with a game in hand. It is possible the west London side could finish the season unbeaten but without having won the league. They are fast learning the lesson that overcoming the teams at the bottom matters as much as masterminding victory against those at the top. \u201cIt is a bit frustrating but teams like Liverpool and Brighton obviously set up differently and it\u2019s hard to break them down,\u201d said Ingle. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as people think on the outside. When they put 11 players behind the ball, it\u2019s different from when you\u2019re playing Arsenal and they\u2019re coming out at you. We need to be better against those type of teams.\u201d After the Arsenal game Hayes made a point of praising Beth England. \u201cShe\u2019s the best No 9 in the country,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHer running, her work-rate \u2013 wow.\u201d That wow factor is important \u2013 especially against the sides outside the top three \u2013 but the real beauty of Chelsea\u2019s win on Sunday was the team\u2019s collective effort at implementing their plan to rip open the reigning champions \u2013 and with it the title race.",

It also found a further 119 million had either given up actively searching for work or lacked access to the jobs market because of their personal situations. Alongside those officially classified as unemployed, about 473 million people across the planet are affected.</p> <p>Calling for urgent efforts to ensure that all types of paid work are also of decent quality, Guy Ryder, the director general of the ILO, said: \u201cFor millions of ordinary people, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to build better lives through work.</p> <p>\u201cPersisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion are preventing them from finding decent work and better futures.

      "bodyText": "Nearly half a billion people around the world are struggling to find adequate paid work, trapping individuals in poverty and fuelling heightened levels of inequality, according to a UN report. In a study published as world leaders fly into the Swiss ski resort of Davos to voice concerns over inequality and the climate crisis, the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization (ILO) said more than 473 million people around the world lacked the employment opportunities to meet their needs. In addition, the UN agency said global unemployment was due to rise for the first time in almost a decade in 2020, as weaker levels of economic growth around the world lead to the number of people out of work rising by about 2.5 million to stand at more than 190 million. The report comes after the UN said last week that trade tensions risked dragging down global growth this year, in a development that would derail international efforts to tackle poverty in low-income countries and distract from the task of decarbonising the world economy. Out of a working-age population of 5.7 billion people around the world, the ILO found as many as 165 million people were employed but unable to find work with an adequate amount of paid hours to meet their needs. It also found a further 119 million had either given up actively searching for work or lacked access to the jobs market because of their personal situations. Alongside those officially classified as unemployed, about 473 million people across the planet are affected. Calling for urgent efforts to ensure that all types of paid work are also of decent quality, Guy Ryder, the director general of the ILO, said: \u201cFor millions of ordinary people, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to build better lives through work. \u201cPersisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion are preventing them from finding decent work and better futures. That\u2019s an extremely serious finding that has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion.\u201d The ILO said countries around the world were missing out on the potential economic and social benefits of a huge pool of human talent. In a stark assessment of the risks from underemployment, it said the lack of productive, well-paid jobs meant more than 630 million workers worldwide lived in extreme or moderate poverty on incomes of less than $3.20 (\u00a32.46) a day. Despite a gradual trend to reduce global poverty levels, it said that these people lacked adequate income to escape destitution.",

      "bodyText": "Department for Transport officials did not tell the then transport secretary about a plan that could have prevented a costly legal dispute between rail operators and the government, the high court has heard. Stagecoach and other rail firms are seeking tens of millions of pounds in compensation in a claim that could have far-reaching implications for a privatised rail system that lawyers acting for the firms said was \u201cin crisis\u201d. The rail company Arriva settled with the government over the East Midlands franchise on the eve of the trial but the case went ahead on Monday. A court heard that the DfT was responsible for a \u201clong series of missteps and mistakes\u201d when it was run by Chris Grayling between July 2016 and July 2019. Stagecoach had been bidding for the Southeastern, East Midlands and West Coast franchises, the latter in partnership with Virgin and the French state rail firm, SNCF. The lawsuit revolves around the department\u2019s decision to exclude the bids last year because the rail companies would not promise to fund enough of any future increase in the railways pension scheme deficit, currently estimated at \u00a37.5bn. Lawyers for the West Coast Partnership said the DfT realised the government needed to shoulder more financial risk to make the franchises financially viable for private firms. Jason Coppel QC, acting for the train operators, said the Treasury had initially refused to agree to a DfT proposal that the government share the cost of multiple future pension scheme revaluations. Because the train companies would not agree to share risks they could not predict, their bids were deemed non-compliant with the franchise process. DfT officials realised at this point that they had \u201cnon-compliant bids that were believable and compliant bids that were unbelievable\u201d, the court heard. The Treasury subsequently agreed to share the risk of more potential pension deficit increases, said Coppel, but officials from the DfT did not tell Grayling. Coppel also criticised the DfT over the volume of trial evidence that has been declared a commercial secret, accusing the department of hiding information that was \u201cembarrassing\u201d rather than confidential. He said DfT officials were used to a culture that was \u201chighly resistant to openness and accountability\u201d. The combination of a broken rail franchising system, the rail pension deficit and secrecy in the DfT had been an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d, he said. A spokesperson for Arriva UK Trains said: \u201cWe can confirm that we have agreed a settlement on terms confidential to both parties and, as a result, have withdrawn our claim.\u201d The outcome of the case could potentially lead to multimillion-pound compensation payouts and two completed franchise competitions being declared invalid, threatening awards to Abellio on East Midlands and First-Trenitalia on West Coast. The DfT said it could not comment on an active legal case.",

Usdaw, the retail union and Labour\u2019s fourth largest affiliate, on Monday nominated the shadow Brexit secretary for leader and Angela Rayner for deputy leader. Starmer had already won support from Unison, the UK\u2019s largest trade union, and the environmental affiliate Sera, reaching the threshold to make it on to the final ballot to replace Jeremy Corbyn. The decision will be a blow for the Birmingham MP Jess Phillips. It was widely believed that Usdaw, one of the \u201cbig five\u201d unions, was the most likely to give her its support. She and Emily Thornberry still have no nominations from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) or affiliated groups, leaving them with a difficult path to the next round. Responding to Usdaw\u2019s decision to endorse him for the Labour leadership, Starmer said the party \u201cwill stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement as we take on the Tories and rebuild trust with working people\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m honoured to have received Usdaw\u2019s endorsement for the Labour leadership,\u201d he went on. He has also won support of 11 of the 14 CLPs to nominate so far. Starmer is the first of the five leadership candidates to win the requisite support to be on the final ballot. Party rules say a candidate has to have won the nomination of at least two trade unions plus one affiliate comprising 5% of affiliate members. The only other route on to the ballot is by receiving nominations from at least 5% of CLPs. Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as favourite to win the support of Unite and the Communication Workers Union and has already received the backing of the grassroots organisation Momentum. Sources from GMB believe that the Wigan MP Lisa Nandy may win the support of the union on Tuesday. Emily Thornberry appears to be struggling to secure union nominations. Monday\u2019s decision at Usdaw\u2019s central office in Manchester was made by the union\u2019s 15-strong executive council. Paddy Lillis, Usdaw\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cUsdaw believes that Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner are the right leadership team to unite and rebuild Labour after a devastating election loss. Our members desperately need Labour in power, they cannot afford another decade of Conservative governments attacking workers\u2019 rights, incomes and public services. \u201cThe Labour party must be led by someone who can persuade voters that they have what it takes to be a prime minister and we are a government in waiting. That is at the heart of Usdaw\u2019s decision to make these nominations.\u201d GMB\u2019s 50-strong executive will decide who they will back on Tuesday following a meeting and candidates\u2019 hustings behind closed doors at the TUC\u2019s headquarters. An announcement is expected at 4pm. Nandy has been in contact with the union\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, and her campaign is run by the MP Louise Haigh, who is a firm favourite with the union. Starmer is still in the running for the GMB vote, sources said, because he is \u201ca safe pair of hands\u201d. Nandy\u2019s campaign received a boost last week when the National Union of Mineworkers backed her as a candidate. The deadline has now passed for people to join Labour to vote in the leadership contest, which will end with the announcement of the winner on 4 April. Phillips, who has admitted in the Guardian to an \u201cawful\u201d first hustings in Liverpool on Sunday, has today said the party must stop trying to appease \u201cfearmongering opportunists\u201d who sought to exploit immigration. Writing in the Independent, Phillips said Labour needed to challenge the \u201cpernicious myth\u201d that working-class communities were hostile to immigration.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our latest story on Isabel dos Santos: That may be all from us in Davos tonight. Newsflash: PwC\u2019s chairman says he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the revelations that his company is caught up in the Luanda Leaks scandal. The Guardian, and other media outlets, reported last night how Isabel dos Santos, daughter of Angola\u2019s former president, had accrued a $2bn fortune through a series of deals involving state companies and offshore tax havens. PwC acted as her accountant consultant and tax advisor -- so is now facing serious questions about its role. Chairman Bob Moritz has just been tackled about the revelations, at the end of his press conference here in Davos. Moritz says the issue was brought to PwC\u2019s attention at a corporate, global level. An investigation is being conducted, and in the meantime PwC has ceased working with certain individuals and corporations. Moritz says PwC aims for high standards, and expects its people to meet those standards. He says that he\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d on a personal level, that the problems weren\u2019t spotted earlier, and that PwC didn\u2019t exit its relationship with Dos Santos earlier. We\u2019ll find out what went wrong, and we will take appropriate action to re-establish trust in the organisation, he pledges, adding ruefully: It\u2019s not exactly our finest hour, but hopefully we can move with speed [to resolve it]. There are some interesting regional differences within CEOs, PwC says. In Europe, bosses are more awake to climate - both as a threat and an opportunity. While in the US, CEOs are simply more confident in their ability to grow revenues this year. Q: Does rising pessimism mean we risk a recession next year? PwC predicts a slowing global economy, but not a recession in 2020. That chimes with the IMF\u2019s new, lower growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021 this morning. Onto questions... Q: This survey took place in the autumn, before the US-China trade deal, so are CEOs probably more optimistic today? Moritz agrees that some pessimism has eased, but there\u2019s still plenty of uncertainty - especially with a presidential election in November. Q: Stock markets are at record highs, so what are they seeing that your CEOs aren\u2019t? Moritz points out that the markets are \u201cflush with cash\u201d, meaning investors are scrambling to find an asset with a yield - driving prices up. Q: So is there going to be a correction? You may see some companies struggle to justify the valuations out there, Moritz says.... but he\u2019s not going to predict who, or when..... Q: Is there any hope of tackling the climate emergency, if it\u2019s not even in the top 10 risks which CEOs are worried about? PwC\u2019s Bob Moritz suggests that CEOs do have lots of other immediate risks to worry, which have pushed climate down their agenda. The key is for business leaders to see climate as an \u201cupside opportunity\u201d, not a downside risk, he says. He\u2019s talking about \u201cpurpose and profit being aligned together\u201d -- a modern spin on the old adage of \u2018going well by doing good\u2019, perhaps? The number of CEOs confident about revenue growth prospects has fallen in every major economy, PwC\u2019s Bob Moritz adds, apart from China. In China, bosses are more upbeat.... due to hopes of increased domestic demand. Moritz tells his audience at Davos that there are several key issues keeping CEOs awake at night. They include: Trade conflict - fears have risen significantly, since Donald Trump began imposing tariffs on China and Europe Regulation, which is \u201cseen as a huge challenge\u201d -- particularly with regards to tech giants Cybercrime But climate is NOT in this list. It\u2019s an increasing risk, but not in the top 10 threats cited by the 1,500+ CEOs interviewed for PwC survey, says Moritz. The reality is that climate at the CEO level is not a top 10 risk. That\u2019s pretty alarming, and disappointing, given the urgent need to tackle the climate emergency (as the IMF flagged up today). Why are business leaders gloomier? Bob Moritz, chair of PwC, says the magnitude, and the range, of risks facing business chiefs is pushing confidence down. It\u2019s not all gloom -- he reckons the Phase One US-China trade deal has lifted sentiment, as has Boris Johnson\u2019s decisive election win last month. But the survey is certainly gloomy. For example, the number of CEOs are very confident in their firm\u2019s ability to grow its revenue has fallen steadily. Newsflash: pessimism among the world\u2019s top CEOs has jumped sharply over the last year. That\u2019s according to PwC, the accountancy and consultancy firm. Its annual survey of over 1,500 global business leaders, just released, shows that optimism about global growth has hit the lowest level in the survey\u2019s 23-year history. For the first time, a majority think global growth will slow -- which means they are less optimistic about their own company\u2019s prospects. The gloom is spread widely across the world\u2019s companies, PcW flags up. The survey is being presented now.... As usual, the World Economic Forum is beginning with its Crystal Awards ceremony. I\u2019ll post proper details later, but for now.... Hello from Davos. This quiet ski resort is filling up with scores of limousines, plenty of police and a horde of the so-called Global Elite. Business leaders, academics, campaigners and the media are back for the 50th World Economic Forum. And corporate signs are EVERYWHERE - Facebook has apre-fabricated HQ in the middle of town. SAP, Amazon Web Services and Accenture all have prime spots too, along with Zurich who are giving out their traditional blue hats to the masses. All quite remarkable. Still, we\u2019ll have the opening ceremony later, plus a big survey of CEOs by PwC. On the financial markets, it has been a fairly quiet start to the week, with US markets closed for Martin Luther King Day. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda Europe, says: This comes following a rather eventful start to the year, since which markets have largely stabilised. The signing of the phase one trade deal [between the US and China] will allow investors to turn their attention elsewhere and this week that place will be the mountains, more specifically, Davos. The World Economic Forum gets underway [officially] tomorrow which means lots of panel discussions, meetings and interviews for traders to get their teeth stuck into. Given the current environment, it may not be the most market impactful event that we\u2019ll see but when it comes to a gathering of some of the most influential people in the world, you can never be too sure. Stock markets are trading slightly lower. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 24.8 points, or 0.32%, at 7649.61 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.11% at 13,540.47 France\u2019s CAC down 0.34% at 6079.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.54% at 24,011.79 Oil prices have gone up after major production shutdowns in Libya. Brent crude has added 54 cents to $65.39 a barrel, up 0.83%, while US crude is 36 cents ahead at $58.9 a barrel, up 0.61%. Sterling is down slightly against the euro and the dollar, trading at \u20ac1.1722 and $1.2993 respectively. Hundreds of protesters are marching to the ski resort of Davos to call on global leaders to step up action on the climate crisis. They started their three-day march yesterday and some wore koala bear costumes to call attention to the Australian bush fires. They are set to arrive at Davos on hiking trails or by train after their 30km hike, because authorities have banned foot traffic on a road leading to Davos from the neighbouring village of Klosters, Reuters reported. In contrast, many of the business and political leaders are flying in by private jet \u2013 or arriving in limousines. Protesters will face up to 5,000 military personnel and police as they get to Davos, where US president Donald Trump is the headline speaker, as in 2018 (he pulled out last year). He is expected to attend Davos tomorrow and on Wednesday \u2013 while back in the US the Senate holds impeachment hearings to decide whether he should be removed from office. Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old climate change activist, will also address the World Economic Forum. She was told by Trump via Twitter in December to \u201cwork on her anger management problem\u201d and \u201cchill,\u201d whereupon she changed the bio of her Twitter account to: \u201cA teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.\u201d The press conference has finished. Copinath is now talking about rising political tensions in the Middle East. The reaction has been fairly muted. She notes that the price of oil has gone up by $3 to $4. Moving on to another topic... social unrest. The IMF\u2019s chief economist says: Social unrest picked up quite sharply in 2019 in many parts of the world, for different reasons. She stresses that governments\u2019 social spending must be well targeted to protect the poor. She is now taking questions about climate change, which the IMF has identified as a major risk to the world economy. It is a major issue and countries should display all the political will that is needed to get the job done. Copinath says the IMF had been hoping for a more comprehensive trade deal between the US and China. The two biggest economies have been locked in a trade dispute since June 2018. She says the phase one trade deal between the US and China, signed last week, is estimated to reduce the cumulative negative impact on global growth to 0.5% from the previously estimated 0.8%, between 2018 and 2020. Here is our full story on the IMF\u2019s latest outlook. Over to the IMF\u2019s chief economist Gita Copinath, who says: We are projecting a modest recovery in growth. The IMF\u2019s head has told policymakers to \u201cbe ready to act if growth slows again\u201d. You can watch the press conference live here. She has summarised the outlook thus: \u201cTentative stabilisation, sluggish recovery.\u201d In Davos, the IMF\u2019s managing director Kristalina Georgiev is discussing the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook. She says the world economy remains \u201csluggish\u201d and that everyone is adjusting to live with the \u201cnew normal\u201d of greater uncertainty. The IMF has cut its growth forecasts for the global economy, but also hopes that the downturn is bottoming out, reports Graeme Wearden from Davos. The IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook predicts the world economy will grow by 3.3% in 2020, compared with a forecast of 3.4% three months ago. Growth in 2021 has been revised down, to 3.4% from 3.6%. The Fund also estimates that global GDP only rose by 2.9% last year, which would be the weakest annual performance since the financial crisis. Back in 2017, it grew by 3.8%. The IMF is blaming \u201cincreased social unrest\u201d for the downgrades, along with weaker-than-expected growth in emerging markets such as India. It also cites rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran, and the threat of a deeper trade dispute between the US and other trading partners, such as Europe. \u201cA materialization of these risks could lead to rapidly deteriorating sentiment, causing global growth to fall below the projected baseline,\u201d the IMF says in a report headlined \u201ctentative stabilisation, slugging recovery?\u201d. But it also sees signs that the slowdown in global trade, and the decline in manufacturing, are bottoming out. The US-China \u2018Phase One\u2019 trade deal and declining fears of a no-deal Brexit have boosted market sentiment, it adds. The Fund is presenting its findings in Davos, at the start of this week\u2019s World Economic Forum. Newsflash from Davos: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world economy is increasingly vulnerable to the impact of the climate emergency, writes my colleague Graeme Wearden from Switzerland. Today\u2019s World Economic Outlook cites hurricanes in the Caribbean, droughts and bushfires in Australia, floods in eastern Africa, and drought in Southern Africa as examples of weather disruption in 2019. It warns that the problem could worsen without coordinated action, saying: Climate change, the driver of the increased frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters, already endangers health and economic outcomes, and not only in the directly affected regions. It could pose challenges to other areas that may not yet feel the direct effects, including by contributing to cross-border migration or financial stress (for instance, in the insurance sector). A continuation of the trends could inflict even bigger losses across more countries. Several of Britain\u2019s top pension funds have warned that they would have lost hundreds of millions of pounds if they had sold out of oil and gas stocks in recent years, according to Reuters, which contacted 47 of Britain\u2019s largest pension schemes, 33 of which said they were not divesting from fossil fuels. For example, pension funds for Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire, which together manage \u00a339.6bn in assets, estimate in their annual reports they would have lost more than \u00a3600m combined had they pulled out of fossil fuels. Time for a quick look at the markets. The main European stock markets are trading slightly lower today, while oil prices have jumped due to major production shutdowns in Libya. Brent crude is 48 cents higher at $65.33 a barrel, up 0.74% while US crude is 0.6% ahead at $58.9 a barrel. FTSE 100 index down 23.7 points, or 0.31%, at 76550 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.06% at 13,533 France\u2019s CAC down 0.24% at 6085 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.26% at 24,078 Sterling has recovered somewhat but is still slightly lower against both the euro and the dollar, after comments from chancellor Sajid Javid over the weekend stoked hard Brexit fears. US markets are closed today for Martin Luther King Day. The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2020 Global Risks Report ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats faced by humanity in the next ten years. Its research shows that $44 trillion of economic value generation \u2013 over half the world\u2019s total GDP \u2013 is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Nature loss matters for most businesses \u2013 through impacts on operations, supply chains, and markets. The question is to what extent the Davos participants \u2013 political and business leaders \u2013 will act on the various reports and their findings. But the overriding theme at Davos looks to be the climate crisis. Is the World Economic Forum becoming the World Climate Forum? Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who is attending Davos again after her first appearance last year, wrote in the Guardian recently: We demand that at this year\u2019s forum, participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels. We don\u2019t want these things done by 2050, 2030 or even 2021, we want this done now \u2013 as in right now. While we wait for the global economic forecasts from the International Monetary Fund, out at 1pm GMT, the Bundesbank has released growth estimates for Germany. The German economy grew last year at the slowest pace since 2013, the country\u2019s central bank estimates. Hit by weaker exports, Germany is expected to have expanded by just 0.6% in 2019, the lowest since the eurozone\u2019s debt crisis. Exports have been hit by China\u2019s economic slowdown and trade wars. Following a boom in recent years, activity in Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector \u201cdeclined strongly and in a broad range of sectors,\u201d the Bundesbank said. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, will not attend Davos because its organisers \u201cabruptly changed its agenda,\u201d according to a foreign ministry spokesman. Tensions are high between the US and Iran. Earlier this month, Iran launched missile strikes aimed at US troops in Iraq in what it said was retaliation for the killing of the top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Tehran also admitted shooting down a passenger jet, after denying it for several days. The belated admission sparked protests across the country. Over in Davos, climate protesters marched to the ski resort yesterday to highlight the escalating climate crisis. It will be interesting to see how much of this is filtering through to the official event. At 1pm GMT, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab and other WEF officials will hold a press conference to outline this year\u2019s programme and participants. Many will be flying in on their private jets, thereby contributing to the climate crisis. Also at that time, at a separate press conference the International Monetary Fund will present its World Economic Outlook. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva will kick off the presentation, while IMF chief economist Gita Copinath will summarise the updated forecast. The pound is falling after comments from the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, over the weekend stoked fears of a hard Brexit. He told the Financial Times on Saturday that Britain would not commit to sticking to EU rules in post-Brexit trade talks. There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union \u2013 and we will do this by the end of the year. Sterling lost 0.24% against the dollar to $1.2978, and was down 0.21% against the euro at \u20ac1.1703. Back in the UK, pressure on households appears to have eased somewhat, with the household finance index from IHS Markit hitting a one-year high in January. It measures households\u2019 perceptions of financial wellbeing and rose to 44.6 from 43.2 in December, suggesting a post-election bounce. However, the index measuring future financial wellbeing dipped back into negative territory follow a slight improvement in December. Almost one in four households think that the Bank of England\u2019s next move will be a rate cut. The index is based on survey data collected by Ipsos Mori and is the first consumer survey published each month. Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, said: Latest survey data certainly show some post-election bounce for UK households, with the headline index up to a one-year high and house price expectations at their strongest since October 2018. That said, cooling inflation was most likely the real driving force, propping up real earnings and disposable incomes. \u201cWhile falling living cost pressures are stimulating purchasing power, UK households are aware that weak economic conditions have led to an increased likelihood of lower interest rates. How this will impact consumer spending behaviour will be crucial to the UK\u2019s growth prospects.\u201d Capitalism, in its current form, is seen as doing more harm than good, a survey of more than 34,000 people in 28 countries found ahead of the Davos meeting. The \u201cEdelman Trust Barometer\u201d was launched in 2000 and is conducted by the US communications firm Edelman. Lack of trust in capitalism was most pronounced in Thailand and India, at 75% and 74% respectively, with France close behind on 69%. Other countries where the majority of people agreed with the statement that capitalism is doing more harm than good include Australia, Canada, the United States, South Korea, Hong and Japan. And here is a list of the political leaders and leaders from international organisations, trade unions, charities and NGOs, who are attending Davos. There will be \u201c10 leaders under the age of 20\u201d including the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who might square up to US president Donald Trump who is also flying in. Running alongside the daytime discussions, schmoozing and night-time partying, there is an arts and culture festival for the first time with a number of sessions and \u201cimmersive art installations\u201d. Cultural leaders attending Davos include the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Cambridge university professor Mary Beard. Trying to combat its reputation as an elitist gathering, the World Economic Forum has published a number of blogs ahead of the official opening at 4.30pm GMT today. This year\u2019s theme is how do we \u201ccreate a more cohesive and sustainable world\u201d. Blogs include a discussion of whether, as businesses are thriving while societies aren\u2019t, this is the end of an era for shareholder capitalism; \u201cfinancing fossil fuels risks a repeat of the 2008 crash;\u201d and \u201cThe route to true gender equality? Fix the system, not women\u201d. Trading volumes are thin as US markets will be closed for Martin Luther King Day. In London, the shopping centre firm Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, suffered a 7% fall in its share price after confirming that it was in talks with investors about a fund raising by the end of February to shore up its battered finances. It is thought to be looking to raise as much as \u00a31bn, although the company\u2019s market value is only \u00a3288m. Intu has been hit as a number of well-known retailers have gone under or negotiated rent reductions in a bid to stay alive. Tonic maker Fever-Tree, the former stock market darling, has seen its shares slump 21% today, the lowest level since April 2017. It admitted that trading had been tough in the UK over Christmas and blamed general belt-tightening among consumers, although it remains the market leader with its premium drinks mixers. The company now expects 2019 profits to be 5% below 2018, when it enjoyed a 34% jump in pre-tax profits to \u00a375.6m. Annual revenues are now set to come in at \u00a3260.5m, lower than expected. This equates to a 10% year-on-year growth rate, well below the 40% surge in sales seen in 2018. Fever-Tree already cut its sales outlook in November. Tim Warrillow, the chief executive and co-founder, said then that the company would hold off heavy promotional discounting over the Christmas period. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Falling sales in the UK will inevitably spark fears the gin boom has turned to bust, while guidance for weaker sales in the US and lower margins undermine Fevertree\u2019s long term pitch that it can replicate its success across the pond. The European stock markets have opened. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 flat Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.2% France\u2019s CAC down 0.1% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.1% In Asia, shares held on to their gains despite a jump in the oil price. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.2% to near a 15-month high, China\u2019s CSI 300 gained 0.75% and Australia\u2019s main index added 0.2% to an all-time peak. Crude oil prices have hit their highest level in more than a week due to production shutdowns in Libya. Brent crude rose as high as $66 a barrel and was later up 68 cents to $65.53, a 1% gain. And the world\u2019s 22 richest men are wealthier than all the women in Africa combined, says Oxfam. The world\u2019s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60% of the planet\u2019s population, according to the latest inequality report from the charity Oxfam. The climate crisis will loom large over Davos, and Mark Carney, who becomes the new UN special envoy for climate change and finance once his term as governor of the Bank of England ends in mid-March, will be attending. He will also be the UK\u2019s key adviser for the next UN climate change conference in Glasgow in November (COP26). The other thing on people\u2019s minds are trade disputes. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, says: Those surveyed in the WEF\u2019s Global Risks Report 2020 identified economic disputes, including trade tensions, as the number one risk to the global economy this year. Alongside this, \u201cdomestic political polarisation\u201d and \u201cextreme heat waves\u201d were flagged as top threats. We also expect world leaders to debate the 2020 events which have already unfolded and the repercussions of these, not least the US-Iranian conflict. Note that the WEF will get underway hot on the heels of the release of IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook update, providing the macroeconomic context for the discussions. Larry Eliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has looked back at the last few decades since the annual talkfest in the snow started. The World Economic Forum is \u201ccommitted to improving the state of the world\u201d but in key respects things look worse today than they did in the early 70s. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Davos week. \u0010Nearly 3,000 people from 117 countries will descend upon the Swiss ski resort this week, including 53 heads of state or government, for the 50th annual gathering of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Even more than last year, it is overshadowed by the escalating climate crisis, and the slowing global economy amid trade tensions. US president Donald Trump (who faces impeachment at home) is coming again this year, as is the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. The German chancellor Angela Merkel, European commission president Ursula von der Leyen, and Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng will all be speaking over the next few days. My colleagues Larry Elliott and Graeme Wearden are on their way to Davos too. Graeme has looked ahead to what the next four days might bring: Ahead of the event, which is attended by some of the world\u2019s richest people and always attracts scores of protesters, a WEF report said said greater social mobility would help shrink the gap between rich and poor and lift global growth by almost 5% in the next decade. But it found that only a handful of 82 countries surveyed had put in place policies that would foster social mobility. At lunchtime, we\u2019ll get the latest economic forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. The Agenda 1pm GMT: IMF publishes World Economic Outlook 4.30 GMT: World Economic Forum opening ceremony 5pm GMT: PwC survey of global CEOs released",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/tony-hall-to-step-down-as-bbc-director-general\" title=\"\">resignation</a> yesterday of the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall marks a perilous moment in the corporation\u2019s existence. Whoever replaces Hall has the substantial task of tackling the hostile politics of Boris Johnson\u2019s government as well as fighting obsolescence in a post-broadcast age.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s social contract is for a civic, not commercial, enterprise. Its promise is for something owned by society, offering more than the flat space of internet \u201ccontent\u201d. This contract is in need of urgent renewal, if that is at all possible. However, the omens from a Conservative government are that it wishes to throw the contract into the white-hot furnace of lobbying cash generated by commercial media and tech platforms, seeking to limit the BBC\u2019s reach and funding.</p> <p>It is hard for even those of us who have been tracking the corporation for the past 30 years to remember a worse or more dangerous time for the broadcaster. It faces an assault <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/four-big-issues-the-new-bbc-director-general-will-find-in-their-intray\" title=\"\">on three fronts</a>: externally, the forces of technology and globalised platforms are disrupting audience behaviour and diluting its appeal as a broadcaster; internally, staff morale has been sapped by a damaging series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/sarah-montague-wins-400000-settlement-from-bbc-for-unequal-treatment\" title=\"\">pay and discrimination cases</a> that should have been avoided; and politically it faces a hostile government that is sensing that perhaps for the first time, there are no votes to be lost in eroding the funding and the power of the BBC. </p> <p>It is a rule of broadcasting that every decade has at least one BBC scandal, and usually more than one director general. In the 2000s there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/29/bbc.davidkelly1\" title=\"\">defenestration of Greg Dyke</a> after he enraged the Labour government with unprovable accusations that it had \u201csexed up\u201d a document claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. In 2012 another crisis \u2013 over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-branded-incapable\" title=\"\">failure to air</a> an expos\u00e9 on the deceased BBC celebrity Jimmy Savile accusing him of predatory child sex offences \u2013 led to the shortest tenure of a director general in the BBC\u2019s 90-year history. It was also the sequence of events that brought Lord Hall back from the Royal Opera House to \u201csteady the ship\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/four-big-issues-the-new-bbc-director-general-will-find-in-their-intray\">Four big issues the new BBC director general will find in their in-tray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hall\u2019s crisis has been slower to bloom and he has chosen his exit point: his first two years in charge saw him heal the wounds inflicted over Savile and install new blood to take on new digital challenges. But the wheels started to come off in 2015 with the disastrous secret deal over the licence fee Hall struck with the then Conservative chancellor George Osborne. Hall agreed to accept the long-term cost of granting over-75s free licences, even though it was a political policy. It was a poor decision that cost the BBC \u00a3750m. More tellingly, it was a blow to the corporation\u2019s political independence. The following four years saw the BBC not just missing steps but falling down flight after flight of stairs. Brexit coverage ahead of the 2016 referendum was weak, and after the vote became the focus of toxic and divisive scrutiny. Its internal crisis over underpaying women broke out in a series of high-profile cases. Its journalism, always the backbone of the BBC, seemed to falter under sustained and often coordinated attack, some of which was undeserved and some of which hit the mark.</p> <p>Internally Hall\u2019s management issues went beyond editorial and pay questions, and included a strategic stagnation. Despite attempts to reorganise television and radio \u2013 with a long-needed merger in production and commercial departments, and constant talk of digitisation \u2013 very little changed as quickly as it needed to. This can be seen in the fog of the streaming platform wars: the BBC somehow managed to lose its way with the iPlayer, an asset that once dominated streaming and on-demand services in the UK, but now wilts in the face of Amazon, Netflix, YouTube et al.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s chairman, David Clementi, gave a speech three months ago in which he noted that iPlayer\u2019s share of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2019/clementi-omc\" title=\"\">video on demand viewing</a> was 18% compared with Amazon and Netflix\u2019s 55%. Government regulation has played a part in failing to allow the BBC adequate latitude to develop a global platform. Again, the corporation needed to make a better case or at least be a more wily negotiator.</p> <p>Hall, though, should at least be credited with a timely exit. The post is an impossible mix of editor-in-chief and chief executive. The last director general to be appointed without journalistic credentials was Michael Checkland, who served for five years from 1987. An accountant by training, Checkland was an effective bulwark against Margaret Thatcher\u2019s campaign to dismantle the BBC, which culminated with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_Committee\" title=\"\">Peacock report</a> into its financing. Checkland had John Birt as his deputy \u2013 they formed a duo who were unpopular with staff at the time but whose combined rigour and strategic mettle saved the corporation from a potentially early demise.</p> <p>The existential crisis facing the BBC today is far bigger, and Hall\u2019s successor needs to be someone with a deep knowledge of the political and regulatory environment, backed by a steely presence in news. </p> <p>\u2022 Emily Bell is director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism</p>",

      "bodyText": "The resignation yesterday of the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall marks a perilous moment in the corporation\u2019s existence. Whoever replaces Hall has the substantial task of tackling the hostile politics of Boris Johnson\u2019s government as well as fighting obsolescence in a post-broadcast age. The BBC\u2019s social contract is for a civic, not commercial, enterprise. Its promise is for something owned by society, offering more than the flat space of internet \u201ccontent\u201d. This contract is in need of urgent renewal, if that is at all possible. However, the omens from a Conservative government are that it wishes to throw the contract into the white-hot furnace of lobbying cash generated by commercial media and tech platforms, seeking to limit the BBC\u2019s reach and funding. It is hard for even those of us who have been tracking the corporation for the past 30 years to remember a worse or more dangerous time for the broadcaster. It faces an assault on three fronts: externally, the forces of technology and globalised platforms are disrupting audience behaviour and diluting its appeal as a broadcaster; internally, staff morale has been sapped by a damaging series of pay and discrimination cases that should have been avoided; and politically it faces a hostile government that is sensing that perhaps for the first time, there are no votes to be lost in eroding the funding and the power of the BBC. It is a rule of broadcasting that every decade has at least one BBC scandal, and usually more than one director general. In the 2000s there was the defenestration of Greg Dyke after he enraged the Labour government with unprovable accusations that it had \u201csexed up\u201d a document claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. In 2012 another crisis \u2013 over the failure to air an expos\u00e9 on the deceased BBC celebrity Jimmy Savile accusing him of predatory child sex offences \u2013 led to the shortest tenure of a director general in the BBC\u2019s 90-year history. It was also the sequence of events that brought Lord Hall back from the Royal Opera House to \u201csteady the ship\u201d. Hall\u2019s crisis has been slower to bloom and he has chosen his exit point: his first two years in charge saw him heal the wounds inflicted over Savile and install new blood to take on new digital challenges. But the wheels started to come off in 2015 with the disastrous secret deal over the licence fee Hall struck with the then Conservative chancellor George Osborne. Hall agreed to accept the long-term cost of granting over-75s free licences, even though it was a political policy. It was a poor decision that cost the BBC \u00a3750m. More tellingly, it was a blow to the corporation\u2019s political independence. The following four years saw the BBC not just missing steps but falling down flight after flight of stairs. Brexit coverage ahead of the 2016 referendum was weak, and after the vote became the focus of toxic and divisive scrutiny. Its internal crisis over underpaying women broke out in a series of high-profile cases. Its journalism, always the backbone of the BBC, seemed to falter under sustained and often coordinated attack, some of which was undeserved and some of which hit the mark. Internally Hall\u2019s management issues went beyond editorial and pay questions, and included a strategic stagnation. Despite attempts to reorganise television and radio \u2013 with a long-needed merger in production and commercial departments, and constant talk of digitisation \u2013 very little changed as quickly as it needed to. This can be seen in the fog of the streaming platform wars: the BBC somehow managed to lose its way with the iPlayer, an asset that once dominated streaming and on-demand services in the UK, but now wilts in the face of Amazon, Netflix, YouTube et al. The BBC\u2019s chairman, David Clementi, gave a speech three months ago in which he noted that iPlayer\u2019s share of video on demand viewing was 18% compared with Amazon and Netflix\u2019s 55%. Government regulation has played a part in failing to allow the BBC adequate latitude to develop a global platform. Again, the corporation needed to make a better case or at least be a more wily negotiator. Hall, though, should at least be credited with a timely exit. The post is an impossible mix of editor-in-chief and chief executive. The last director general to be appointed without journalistic credentials was Michael Checkland, who served for five years from 1987. An accountant by training, Checkland was an effective bulwark against Margaret Thatcher\u2019s campaign to dismantle the BBC, which culminated with the Peacock report into its financing. Checkland had John Birt as his deputy \u2013 they formed a duo who were unpopular with staff at the time but whose combined rigour and strategic mettle saved the corporation from a potentially early demise. The existential crisis facing the BBC today is far bigger, and Hall\u2019s successor needs to be someone with a deep knowledge of the political and regulatory environment, backed by a steely presence in news. \u2022 Emily Bell is director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers acting on behalf of Donald Trump on Monday branded the impeachment case against him \u201cflimsy\u201d and a \u201cdangerous perversion of the constitution\u201d, setting the stage for the opening of his long-awaited Senate trial on Tuesday. As the president prepared to jet off to Davos, where he is set to give a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, the White House submitted its formal trial defence brief, a 110-page document in which it also claimed the impeachment process has been a \u201ccharade\u201d and insisted Trump did \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine. The brief \u2013 submitted as a counter to a document filed by the House Democrats on Saturday \u2013 presented the most thorough outline to date of the lines of defence that Trump\u2019s lawyers plan to use against the case to remove the president at his congressional trial, scheduled to begin in the US Senate on Tuesday. \u201cThe articles of impeachment now before the Senate are an affront to the constitution and to our democratic institutions,\u201d his legal team wrote, adding: \u201cThe articles themselves \u2013 and the rigged process that brought them here \u2013 are a brazenly political act by House Democrats that must be rejected. They debase the grave power of impeachment and disdain the solemn responsibility that power entails.\u201d Trump and his legal team urge a swift resolution to the trial, concluding with Trump\u2019s decisive acquittal on a vote by the Republicans who dominate the Senate. Monday\u2019s brief added: \u201cThe process that brought the articles here violated every precedent and every principle of fairness followed in impeachment inquiries for more than 150 years. Even so, all that House Democrats have succeeded in proving is that the president did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 case centres around a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked his counterpart to do him a \u201cfavour\u201d and investigate both a conspiracy theory concerning election interference and ties between the former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter and the eastern European country. Monday\u2019s brief stated that the two articles do not amount to impeachable offenses and that the inquiry was not aimed at looking for the truth. \u201cInstead, House Democrats were determined from the outset to find some way \u2013 any way \u2013 to corrupt the extraordinary power of impeachment for use as a political tool to overturn the result of the 2016 election and to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d wrote Trump\u2019s legal team. \u201cAll of that is a dangerous perversion of the constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly condemn.\u201d They also claimed that the articles of impeachment are \u201cstructurally deficient\u201d because they charge multiple acts and accused Democrats of watering down the grounds for impeachment. It comes after the House impeachment managers, who will act as prosecutors in Trump\u2019s trial, released their own legal brief on Saturday in a 111-page document. In a joint statement, the House managers, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia Garcia, said the case against Trump is \u201csimple, the facts are indisputable and the evidence is overwhelming: President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardizing our national security, the integrity of our elections and our democracy\u201d. They added: \u201cAnd when the president got caught, he tried to cover it up by obstructing the House\u2019s investigation into his misconduct.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team issued an initial response on Saturday that claimed the impeachment articles are \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d and \u201ca brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election \u2013 now just months away\u201d. The House of Representatives now has until midday Tuesday to respond to Trump\u2019s defense \u2013 an hour before the start of the impeachment trial, scheduled for 1pm. Senators, who will act as the jury, will then sit six days a week, Monday to Saturday, between 1pm and 5 or 6pm ET. With a Republican-controlled Senate and a two-thirds majority needed to convict on either of the two articles \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress \u2013 it appears highly unlikely that Trump will be removed. However, Democrats only need four Republicans to form a majority to win votes over rules and witnesses. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said on Sunday that he wants to hold a vote on Tuesday on whether witnesses and additional evidence will be allowed to be brought before the trial if the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, does not include them in his proposal. On Monday morning Trump appeared to tweet in response, saying: \u201cThey didn\u2019t want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate.

That is why, unlike previous elections when usually one major party campaigned on a safety-first, \u2018no change\u2019 agenda, all parties in 2019 could not begin to make progress if they defended the status quo and the result seems more like a plea for change than a positive and enthusiastic endorsement of any party.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the old post-war social contract \u201cseems broken\u201d. </strong>That was because its four pillars were \u201cnear a state of collapse\u201d, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First, for millions, work no longer pays.</p> \n   <p>Second, no matter how hard you strive, opportunities for upward mobility seem limited and there appears to be less room at the top.

Excessive boardroom remuneration packages, the bankers\u2019 bonus culture and shocking extremes of inequality have put paid to that.</p> \n   <p>Finally, our 75-year-old safety net looks threadbare, as in every town and city, child poverty and homelessness are on the increase and food banks, clothes banks, bedding banks, baby banks and charities generally substitute for the welfare state.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said artificial intelligence could make the regional divide even worse. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The advance of A.I., whereby jobs are threatened and then displaced by technology, could make the regional divide between a new education-rich and a new education-poor even worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there was a danger of Boris Johnson becoming more extreme by the time of the next election. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no doubt that Boris Johnson will find it difficult to reconcile \u2013 within his party\u2019s neo-liberal economic framework \u2013 the demands from the north for higher spending and more government intervention with the demands of his suburban and shire south that want the opposite \u2013 less public spending, less government intervention and lower taxes.</p> \n   <p>And so to win the next election he may feel compelled to resort to uniting his very different constituencies around another bout of nationalism: to anti-Europeanism or to anti-immigrant gesturing or even to playing the anti-Scottish card, claiming \u2013 as his party did in 2015 and 2019 \u2013 that under a Labour-SNP coalition, Scotland \u2013 they will say with only eight per cent of the UK population \u2013 will run England, despite its 83 per cent of the population.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The key issue here is around level playing field issues. There is no way the EU will ever sign up to a trade deal that allows tariff free, quota free and frictionless access to UK goods coming into the EU if there isn\u2019t a level playing field in terms of how they\u2019re produced, because that would be unfair competition ...</p> \n   <p>From an Irish perspective I think there will be very strong solidarity across the EU, as there was in the first round of Brexit negotiations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Last week Newsnight\u2019s <strong>Nicholas Watt</strong> reported that there are UK ministers who believe <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51139220?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics&amp;link_location=live-reporting-correspondent\">Britain will have the advantage of being able to exploit supposed EU divisions </a>in the post-Brexit trade talks.

That is why the mandate and approach the EU will take is important.</p> \n   <p>The other thing that is very important from an Irish perspective is the full implementation of the [withdrawal agreement] and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland because ... the guarantees that have been provided to prevent border infrastructure being necessary between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland require new structures are put in place, new committees are put in place in terms of managing the trade relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p> \n   <p>And we all know what is in that protocol and there is a lot of work to ensure that is in place in plenty of time.

He says as a result child poverty is rising, and it could reach 5m later this decade. It is a scandal, he says.</p> \n  <p>He recalls being in George Bush\u2019s office during the financial crisis. Bush complained about Barack Obama, he says, he says he says the Republicans should attack him as a Harvard elitist. Brown says he told Bush that was a bit rich because Bush was a Yale elitist.</p> \n  <p>But he says Bush\u2019s line illustrated an important point. To attack populists, you have to portray them as being part of an elite. And he says Labour\u2019s problem sometimes has been that it has been seen as part of the elite.</p> \n  <p>Turing to the SNP, he says they are supposed to be a social democratic party. But education is falling apart in Scotland, he says. He says the SNP are not the radicals they claim to be. </p> \n  <p>Brown is now talking about the importance of offering hope. In every situation, Labour has to give hope for the future, he says.</p> \n  <p>He says Boris Johnson cannot claim that he has a majority for Conservative values. People want change, he says.

He says the devolution agenda is much more advanced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The real problems is in England, he says.</p> \n  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Chris Bryant</strong> jokingly asks Brown if he has considered standing for the party leadership. He says his anxiety is that Labour has become \u201ca grievance machine\u201d, not a source for hope. </p> \n  <p>And the Labour MP<strong> Angela Eagle </strong>says Brown has pointed out that paradox that nationalism is now a coordinate, worldwide movement. She says Labour needs to get back to talking about its values. </p> \n  <p><strong>Charlie Falconer</strong>, the former Labour lord chancellor, says he is worried about Brown\u2019s plan to reopen the constitution for debate at a time of economic uncertainty.

The presenter expressed surprise, because the official budget for the project at that point was just \u00a388bn. but Johnson stuck to his guns. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee064c8f08bacaf000cab8#block-5dee064c8f08bacaf000cab8\">He said he thought the final bill would be \u201cnorth of \u00a31oobn\u201d.</a></p> \n  <p>Perhaps Johnson knew more than he was letting on. Today\u2019s Financial Times says a leak of the review of HS2 by Doug Oakervee says it could cost up to \u00a3106bn. The FT story is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/307e3606-3ab7-11ea-a01a-bae547046735\">here (paywall)</a> and our own follow-up is here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/20/hs2-costs-government-review-west-midlands-manchester-leeds\">HS2 costs could rise to \u00a3106bn or more, warns government review</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>According to the FT, the Oakervee review says that \u201con balance\u201d HS2 should continue, but it recommends that work on the link from the West Midlands to Manchester and Leeds be put on hold for six months to explore whether it could be made up of a mix of standard and high-speed rail.</p> \n  <p>Speaking on the Today programme this morning, <strong>Andy Burnham</strong>, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said watering down what was proposed for the route north of Birmingham in this way would be unacceptable. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m worried by the suggestion that there might be a delay in the north, or even that we might get some kind of second-class option, a mix of high-speed and conventional lines that it\u2019s talking about.</p> \n   <p>And to me that would be the same old story. London to Birmingham, money is no object, and then all the penny pinching is done in the North of England.</p> \n   <p>That would not be acceptable to me, and I\u2019m sure wouldn\u2019t be acceptable to many other leaders across the north.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burnham also said the development of an east-west rail route across the Nnorth - known as HS3 or Northern Powerhouse Rail - relied on HS2 being built. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This isn\u2019t just about north-south rail. The point about HS2 is it lays the enabling infrastructure for the east-west links that we crucially need and most people here would say that those are even more important.</p> \n   <p>This is about building a railway for the north, right across the north, for the rest of the century.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t support the idea that we will see downgrading of what is done north of Birmingham.</p> \n   <p>That would be fundamentally unacceptable. If we get to a position where trains can go high-speed into Birmingham and then trundle their way north, then I\u2019m sorry but that just isn\u2019t good enough.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3eb1710bf81ef94cdf376857ec77c30d805ae1bd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3eb1710bf81ef94cdf376857ec77c30d805ae1bd/0_2050_2193_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2562c68f0879d539efb62c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-20T09:08:36.572Z\">9.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour leadership: Candidates criticise 'terrible' format chosen by party for official hustings</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The first official party hustings in the Labour leadership contest took place on Saturday, in Liverpool, and some observers said afterwards that the format made it all a bit dull and inconclusive.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has suffered his defeat defeat in parliament since the general election and peers voted to insert an amendment into the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill saying EU nationals should be given a physical document showing they have the right to be in the UK after Brexit. (See 4.41pm.) The defeat is likely to be overturned when the bill returns to the Commons on Wednesday. Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, has nominated Sir Keir Starmer for Labour leader. With Unison and Sera, the Labour environment campaign, also backing him, this means that he has got enough affiliate nominations to be guaranteed a place on the final ballot. He is the first of the five candidates left in the contest to clear this hurdle. In practice candidates can only clear the affiliates nominations hurdle with support from one of five big unions: Unite, Unison, GMB, Usdaw and CWU. Unite is expected to back Rebecca Long-Bailey. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has said the UK could break up soon without radical devolution of power to nations and regions. (See 4.32pm.) The Northern Ireland assembly has voted to withhold legislative consent from the UK government\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. (See 3.51pm.) The European commission has said the EU will not be ready to open trade talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal before the end of February. (See 12.27pm.) The bill for the HS2 high-speed rail link could soar to \u00a3106bn, according to a government-commissioned review that will raise further concerns about the project. Downing Street has hinted Boris Johnson could try to block a peerage for John Bercow if the former Speaker is nominated by Jeremy Corbyn. The Duke of Sussex has met Boris Johnson and other world leaders attending the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London during what is likely to be one of his few remaining engagements as an official royal. Owners of apartment blocks who refuse to strip dangerous combustible cladding will be named and shamed as part of new post-Grenfell safety measures, Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, has told MPs. That\u2019s all from us for this evening. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleague Rajeev Syal has tonight\u2019s main politics story: Here\u2019s some reaction from Labour MPs to the news that Usdaw has backed Starmer \u2013 as well as from his campaign chair, the former Labour MP Jenny Chapman: Starmer has said: I\u2019m honoured to have received Usdaw\u2019s endorsement for the Labour leadership. Our campaign is building unity across the labour movement, amongst trade unionists and members. Usdaw represent over 400,000 workers and fights every day for its members and for a fairer society. If I\u2019m elected leader, Labour will stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement as we take on the Tories and rebuild trust with working people. Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, has nominated Sir Keir Starmer for Labour leader. With Unison and Sera, the Labour environment campaign, also backing him, this means that he has got enough affiliate nominations to be guaranteed a place on the final ballot. He is the first of the five candidates left in the contest to clear this hurdle. In practice candidates can only clear the affiliates nominations hurdle with support from one of five big unions: Unite, Unison, GMB, Usdaw and CWU. Unite is expected to back Rebecca Long-Bailey, and the GMB is expected to back Lisa Nandy. If that does happen, that would mean Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry (neither of whom are likely to get the backing of the leftwing CWU) would only be able to make it onto the final ballot by getting nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (33 of them) - something they may struggle to do. Usdaw is also nominating Angela Rayner for the deputy leadership. Commenting on the decision, Paddy Lillis, Usdaws\u2019s general secretary, said: Usdaw believes that Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner are the right leadership team to unite and rebuild Labour after a devastating election loss. Our members desperately need Labour in power, they cannot afford another decade of Conservative governments attacking workers\u2019 rights, incomes and public services. The Labour party must be led by someone who can persuade voters that they have what it takes to be a prime minister and we are a government in waiting. That is at the heart of Usdaw\u2019s decision to make these nominations. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. In her webchat with Mumsnet earlier Jess Phillips, the Labour leadership candidate, was asked if she would get rid of Momentum from Labour on the grounds that it was acting as a party within a party. Phillips did not accept that description, and she praised some of its activists, but she also hinted that she had concerns about some of its activities. She said: Would I get rid of Momentum? I get asked that a lot. The answer is \u2026 there are some brilliant Momentum activists in my constituency who are just interested in getting a Labour government. So a blanket approach is inappropriate. However, if there is evidence that any group in the Labour party is organising without inviting anyone who wished to be a member in, or are operating an organisation that is more interested in controlling the party than getting Labour into power then any leader would have to act. If everyone is pulling together in the same direction, then groupings within the party will have the same aim and there should be no problems. Anyone from any group who bullies, harasses, is racist or stops the functioning of any Labour meeting through malice, would have no place in the Labour party. During the Tory leadership contest the Brexiter Mark Francois said that he had decided to vote for Boris Johnson after Johnson looked him in the eye and said the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October. The UK did not leave on 31 October. Last week Johnson said in a BBC interview that he was working on a plan to allow people to crowdfund an appeal to cover the cost of Big Ben chiming on 31 January, when the UK does leave the EU. Again Francois seemed to take Johnson at his word and helped to get an appeal going, even pledging \u00a31,000 himself. But Downing Street then ruled out the idea, saying the Commons authorities could not accept money raided in this manner. According to the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope, Francois is still hoping that Johnson will help to make his wish come true. Experience suggests this is unlikely. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, has said that the government should not just rely on its majority in the House of Commons to overturn Lords defeats. She said: I hope the prime minister and his colleagues will not think that they can get every detail of every bill right first time, and recognise that the second chamber is useful. A large Commons majority means the government is guaranteed to get its legislation through but it would be supremely arrogant to dismiss all scrutiny. Peers have voted for the Oates amendment by 270 votes to 229 - a majority of 41. This is an opposition amendment to the bill that would ensure that EU nationals living in the UK do get a physical document showing they have the right to be in the country. It is Boris Johnson\u2019s first defeat in parliament since the general election. Ministers are likely to overturn the defeat when the bill returns to the Commons on Wednesday. If the defeat is reversed, peers will then have to decide whether to accept that, when the bill goes back to the Lords during \u201cping pong\u201d, or whether to try again to pass the \u2018physical document\u2019 amendments. Peers have the power to ask the Commons to \u2018think again\u2019, but they almost always back down if the Commons insists on its version of the bill, and given the scale of Johnson\u2019s general election victory last month, peers won\u2019t feel that they have the authority to put up much of a fight. The full text of Gordon Brown\u2019s speech about the need for constitutional change is here, on his website. It is worth reading in full, but here are the main points. Brown called for radical devolution of decision-making to the nations and regions of the UK. He said: The recent revolt of the regions shows us that dictates from the centre will not work and that complaints will not be allayed unless people\u2019s voices themselves are heard and the outlying nations and regions gain new powers of initiative to become decision-making centres within the UK in their own right \u2013 given our history as a unitary state, nothing short of a constitutional revolution. The best start would be a UK-wide constitutional convention that would bring together the regions and nations of the UK to formulate a new way forward for our constitution. The convention should be preceded by region-by-region citizens\u2019 assemblies that listen closely to what communities are saying and where common ground lies. Citizens\u2019 assemblies \u2013 successfully organised in Ireland \u2013 can both encourage civilised debate and seek consensus where divisions have previously prevailed. In an earlier draft he called for a council-led \u2018Northern Exchequer board\u2019 to take charge of government spending in the north. (See 1.26pm.) He said the UK could break up if Westminster does not devolve power. He said: For after two divisive referendums in 2014 and 2016, and three bitter and tempestuous general elections in four years, we have to recognise the outcome of 2019 as a threat to the very existence of the United Kingdom. Boris Johnson will soon discover that he has no choice \u2013 either we remake Britain or we risk losing it. All parties need to present a positive alternative to nationalism that can reunite Britain and heal our deep divisions. He said the 2019 election was unusual because all major parties were campaigning for change. He said: The crisis runs much deeper than Brexit. That is why, unlike previous elections when usually one major party campaigned on a safety-first, \u2018no change\u2019 agenda, all parties in 2019 could not begin to make progress if they defended the status quo and the result seems more like a plea for change than a positive and enthusiastic endorsement of any party. He said the old post-war social contract \u201cseems broken\u201d. That was because its four pillars were \u201cnear a state of collapse\u201d, he said. First, for millions, work no longer pays. Second, no matter how hard you strive, opportunities for upward mobility seem limited and there appears to be less room at the top. Parents no longer feel confident that the next generation will do as well as the last. Third, extremes of wealth cannot now be justified \u2013 as once they were \u2013 by claiming that the huge remuneration packages that the elites receive are the result of effort and merit. Excessive boardroom remuneration packages, the bankers\u2019 bonus culture and shocking extremes of inequality have put paid to that. Finally, our 75-year-old safety net looks threadbare, as in every town and city, child poverty and homelessness are on the increase and food banks, clothes banks, bedding banks, baby banks and charities generally substitute for the welfare state. He said artificial intelligence could make the regional divide even worse. He said: The advance of A.I., whereby jobs are threatened and then displaced by technology, could make the regional divide between a new education-rich and a new education-poor even worse. He said there was a danger of Boris Johnson becoming more extreme by the time of the next election. He said: There is no doubt that Boris Johnson will find it difficult to reconcile \u2013 within his party\u2019s neo-liberal economic framework \u2013 the demands from the north for higher spending and more government intervention with the demands of his suburban and shire south that want the opposite \u2013 less public spending, less government intervention and lower taxes. And so to win the next election he may feel compelled to resort to uniting his very different constituencies around another bout of nationalism: to anti-Europeanism or to anti-immigrant gesturing or even to playing the anti-Scottish card, claiming \u2013 as his party did in 2015 and 2019 \u2013 that under a Labour-SNP coalition, Scotland \u2013 they will say with only eight per cent of the UK population \u2013 will run England, despite its 83 per cent of the population. Sadly the seeds have already been sewn for this, with the majority of Conservative anti-Europeans saying that the end of the Union is a price worth paying for Brexit. In the Lords debate Lord Oates is responding to the government minister, Lady Williams of Trafford. He says he was surprised by her argument. He says the Home Office can give EU nationals physical proof of their right to be in the UK while also keeping the details in a digital database. He says people like landlords will expect to be able to see a document showing someone has the right to be in the UK. He is putting his amendment to a vote. Peers are voting now. In the Lords the Home Office minster Lady Williams of Trafford is responding to the debate on clause 7 - the Oates amendment about giving EU nationals a document proving their right to be in the UK. She claims there is a danger of \u201cID card creep\u201d. She says if EU nationals get a physical document showing they have the right to be in the country, they will be asked to show this. So the Oates plan creates a risk of people being discriminated against for not having documentation in the way that happened to the Windrush generation, she claims. Earlier in the debate the crossbencher Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, who is backing the Oates amendment, said the Oates amendment would reduce the risk of Windrush-style injustices. Williams says physical documents can be \u201clost, stolen or tampered with\u201d. The government wants to use a digital system instead, she says. The Northern Ireland assembly has passed a motion refusing to give legislative assent to the UK government\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. In effect, it has rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. After a debate lasting almost three hours the power-sharing assembly, which was only revived just over a week ago, the motion was passed without opposition. Opening the debate Arlene Foster, the DUP first minister, said said the Brexit deal posed \u201csignificant challenges for Northern Ireland\u201d. She urged MLAs to \u201ctake a stand\u201d to show that the assembly was \u201cback in business\u201d and would not be overruled by the government. The Alliance party Kellie Armstrong said there was no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit and that the assembly should \u201cstand up and protect Northern Ireland\u201d. Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn Fein deputy first minster, said ahead of the debate: There is no good to come from Brexit - it brings nothing, only jeopardy to our economy and to jobs, to future prospects, and I think that will be reflected in the debate we will have in Assembly chamber today. And the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ahead of the debate. We have always said people here did not give consent for Brexit and it\u2019s important that this Assembly withholds consent for Brexit. We know this British Government will ignore us but when they are ignoring us they are ignoring the people of Northern Ireland, people of Scotland and the representatives of the people of Wales. That shows you what kind of government is sitting now in London. They do not care about people here, they don\u2019t care about people in Scotland, and they are determined to go on with the madness that is this Brexit. The vote will have no practical impact on the government\u2019s Brexit plans, but it is embarrassing for Johnson given his professed commitment to the union. In a similar vote the Scottish parliament refused to grant legislative consent to the EU (withdrawal agreement) will earlier this month. In the House of Lords peers have just started the report stage of the debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. There is likely to be at least one vote today, and more voting tomorrow, when peers will debate an amendment to effectively re-insert the Dubs provision on unaccompanied child migrants into the bill. The Lib Dem peer Lord Oates is opening the debate. He is moving an amendment backed by the Lib Dems, Labour and crossbenchers that would ensure that EU nationals remaining in the UK after Brexit get a document providing physical proof that they have the right to be in the country. Oates says EU nationals will want access to a physical document proving their right to be in the country. Otherwise there will be a risk that, at airports and elsewhere, they cannot prove their right to be in the country if an electronic database is not working. This measure will give them confidence, he says. He urges ministers to \u201cwalk in the shoes\u201d of EU nationals and consider the concerns they have about this. In the House of Lords the Labour peer Lord Foulkes has just asked a private notice question about the report in yesterday\u2019s Sunday Times claiming the government is considering moving the Lords to York. Earl Howe, the deputy leader of the Lords, gave a very non-committal answer. He said that the government would be announcing a commission on constitutional reform later this year, but that the government had not yet decided if this would cover the role of the House of Lords. When Foulkes said Howe had not answered his question about whether this idea was being seriously considered, Howe said in the past a joint committee looked at the case for moving parliament outside London and decided against it. But he said there was \u201cno reason\u201d why this idea could not be revived. Options were being looked at, he says. The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC that he thinks the United Kingdom could soon break up unless its constituent nations and regions get more say in how they are governed. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy PM, told reporters after a meeting in Brussels with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, that it would be a mistake for the British to underestimate the determination of the EU not to allow the UK an unfair competitive advantage after Brexit. He said: The key issue here is around level playing field issues. There is no way the EU will ever sign up to a trade deal that allows tariff free, quota free and frictionless access to UK goods coming into the EU if there isn\u2019t a level playing field in terms of how they\u2019re produced, because that would be unfair competition ... From an Irish perspective I think there will be very strong solidarity across the EU, as there was in the first round of Brexit negotiations. Last week Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt reported that there are UK ministers who believe Britain will have the advantage of being able to exploit supposed EU divisions in the post-Brexit trade talks. Coveney\u2019s words challenge that analysis. Coveney also voiced his concerns about the short timetable for completing a deal and establishing the effective customs border in the Irish Sea stipulated in the withdrawal agreement. He said: Because of the decisions the British prime minister has made, time is going to be very short. We have a lot to do and not much time to do it. That is why the mandate and approach the EU will take is important. The other thing that is very important from an Irish perspective is the full implementation of the [withdrawal agreement] and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland because ... the guarantees that have been provided to prevent border infrastructure being necessary between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland require new structures are put in place, new committees are put in place in terms of managing the trade relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And we all know what is in that protocol and there is a lot of work to ensure that is in place in plenty of time. So those structures need to be put in place in parallel with progressing the negotiations and discussions on future relationship and future trade deal \u2026 From an Irish perspective that is really important for obvious reasons. The Brown event is over. He did not take questions from journalists. His office has now sent out a partial text of the speech. I will post a summary soon. Gordon Brown is now responding to the questions/point raised by the five Labour parliamentarians. (See 1.44pm.) He says he agrees with Angela Eagle about the need for the left to find a response to the paradox of nationalism being international now. Responding to Charlie Falconer, he says he thinks you cannot separate the economic issues from the constitutional ones. He says child tax credits have been integrated into universal credit. He says as a result child poverty is rising, and it could reach 5m later this decade. It is a scandal, he says. He recalls being in George Bush\u2019s office during the financial crisis. Bush complained about Barack Obama, he says, he says he says the Republicans should attack him as a Harvard elitist. Brown says he told Bush that was a bit rich because Bush was a Yale elitist. But he says Bush\u2019s line illustrated an important point. To attack populists, you have to portray them as being part of an elite. And he says Labour\u2019s problem sometimes has been that it has been seen as part of the elite. Turing to the SNP, he says they are supposed to be a social democratic party. But education is falling apart in Scotland, he says. He says the SNP are not the radicals they claim to be. Brown is now talking about the importance of offering hope. In every situation, Labour has to give hope for the future, he says. He says Boris Johnson cannot claim that he has a majority for Conservative values. People want change, he says. And he says Labour can show what that change should be. The speech is over. We are now onto the Q&amp;A, but the first \u201cquestion\u201d comes from Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, who praises Brown\u2019s speech and says it was a riposte to those in the party who think they just need to keep their heads down, and the party will recover. Ian Murray, the only Labour MP in Scotland and a candidate for the deputy leadership, is speaking now. He says the devolution agenda is much more advanced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The real problems is in England, he says. The Labour MP Chris Bryant jokingly asks Brown if he has considered standing for the party leadership. He says his anxiety is that Labour has become \u201ca grievance machine\u201d, not a source for hope. And the Labour MP Angela Eagle says Brown has pointed out that paradox that nationalism is now a coordinate, worldwide movement. She says Labour needs to get back to talking about its values. Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, says he is worried about Brown\u2019s plan to reopen the constitution for debate at a time of economic uncertainty. Isn\u2019t there a danger that people just go for the populist option, as they almost did in Scotland? Wouldn\u2019t it be more important to focus on economic issues. Brown ends with another line familiar to people who have heard him speak in the past - quoting approvingly the President Kennedy speech (pdf) calling for not a declaration of independence, but a declaration of interdependence. Brown says Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the regions of England should be able to come together to put the case for the devolution of power over spending to the UK government. He says he knows from his own time as chancellor that a UK chancellor can resist these entities if they are on their own. But if they were united, the UK government would not be able to resist, he says. Brown is now making the case for using regional citizens\u2019 assemblies to consider the case for constitutional reform. He says he ha studied how they were used in Ireland, and he believes they would take the heat out of the debate on constitutional reform. Gordon Brown is speaking now. As is customary for the former PM, he is speaking without notes, and his speech is a mixture of new analysis with jokes and anecdotes that people familiar with his speeches will have heard before. A summary of the speech released by Brown\u2019s office in advance says Brown is calling for a UK-wide constitutional convention and region-by-region citizens\u2019 assemblies to gauge public opinion and to respond adequately to the needs of the regions and nations. It also says Brown is proposing \u201ca forum of the nations and regions\u201d to prevent post-Brexit centralisation of power in London. Brown is arguing that the anachronism of the House of Lords cannot be solved just be moving it to York, his office says. Brown says: An outdated institution 200 miles or so north of its current location is still an outdated institution. The summary also includes this quote from Brown calling for the creation of a \u201cNorthern Exchequer board\u201d to take charge of Treasury spending in the north. Brown says: I will argue for a council of the north and council of the Midlands that bring together local authorities, mayors and MPs and in the form of a Northern Exchequer board take powers from the Treasury over the allocation of regional resources - so that on vital issues, outlying regions and communities will no longer be governed simply by dictates from London second guessing what they want. The demand for more power to the north is far greater than can be met by gimmicks or gestures given that the UK is a unitary state but a multinational country; that it is asymmetric with 83% of the votes at elections in England and that political, financial and administrative power has been over-concentrated in one city in the south. The Labour MP Alison McGovern introduces Gordon Brown. She starts by saying some people have been talking about how the UK has had 40 years of neo-liberalism. (That is a reference to the new Labour MP Zarah Sultana, who used her maiden speech in the Commons to call for an end to \u201c40 years of Thatcherism\u201d.) McGovern challenges this analysis. She says under Margaret Thatcher inequality and child poverty rose. But under Brown inequality flattened, and 1m children were taken out of poverty, she says. (Sultana introduced the Labour leadership candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey when Long-Bailey held her official campaign launch in Manchester on Friday.) Gordon Brown is about to deliver his speech on constitutional reform at Westminster. There is a live feed here. And this is from the International Institute for Environment and Development, a sustainable development thinktank, on the PM\u2019s announcement about UK aid and coal. (See 10.23am.) This is from the IIED\u2019s director, Andrew Norton. The UK government\u2019s decision to stop providing aid to support coal projects is long overdue and a welcome step in the right direction \u2015 but it needs to go further. To meet the scale of the climate crisis, it must stop subsidising all fossil fuel exploration and production. And the climate finance it has committed to help developing countries, must be geared to meet local people\u2019s priorities and needs in their efforts to develop and thrive in the face of climate change. Global Witness, the anti-corruption, pro-environment campaigning organisation, has said that Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to end the use of UK aid money to fund coal mining or coal power plants (see 10.23am) will make little difference. This is from its senior climate campaigner Adam McGibbon. The UK government has not funded a coal plant overseas since 2002. This commitment to \u2018no new coal\u2019 therefore makes very little difference to the UK\u2019s lack of climate ambition, and it leaves untouched the billions in oil and gas support that the UK will continue to spend worldwide. To be a real climate leader, the UK government needs to end its support for all fossil fuels overseas. In a year that the UK is hosting a major UN climate summit, we need to see much stronger commitments from the UK that match up to the climate challenges the world is currently facing. Climate leaders don\u2019t spend billions overseas making climate change worse for the world\u2019s poorest people. According to Global Witness, 97% of energy support backed by UK Export Finance goes on fossil fuel projects, almost all involving oil and gas. It says these will not be affected by Johnson\u2019s announcement. The European commission has confirmed that it will not be ready to open talks with the UK on a future trade deal until the end of February at the earliest. The commission\u2019s chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, told journalists this morning: The commission can adopt its proposal for the negotiation directives only once the UK has actually withdrawn from the EU. But then there is still an institutional process for these to be adopted by the [European] council. This we know will take some time, which is why we have said we will start negotiations as quickly as we can, but it will certainly not be before the end of February, beginning of March. This is not a slowing down or speeding up of the process. This is simply the nature of the institutional process and the consultations that need to take place before the negotiation directives can be formally adopted. Boris Johnson has ruled out extending the post-Brexit transition period, and this timetable means that the UK and the EU will have just 10 months in practice to agree and ratify an agreement on their future partnership. Downing Street wants the talks to start soon, and has not ruled out opening talks with Washington on a UK-US deal before talks with Brussels get going. (See 12.05pm.) At the briefing Mamer was also asked about the comment from Sajid Javid, the chancellor, at the weekend saying the UK will not align with EU rules after Brexit. Mamer confirmed that this would mean less access to the single market for the UK. He said: There is a link between moving away from EU regulations and the degree of access that is possible into the single market. That position has not changed. I think both sides have expressed their positions very clearly and, hence, I have nothing to add to the comments that were made this weekend. This is from my colleague Peter Walker, who is at the UK-Africa summit. Steven Swinford has more from the No 10 lobby briefing. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM\u2019s spokesman hinted that, despite Jeremy Corbyn reportedly nominating John Bercow, the former Speaker, for a peerage in the dissolution honours, Boris Johnson could still block this. This is from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. In the past it has been normal for Speakers to be given a peerage when they retire. But nothing has been announced yet for Bercow, who stood down as an MP at the general election. Some Brexiter Tories believe that he should be denied one because they think he was biased in favour of remain when he was in the chair. Johnson\u2019s own intentions are unclear, although some reports have claimed that he is not opposed to Bercow ever receiving a peerage, but that he only wants to delay the appointment until after claims that Bercow bullied staff when he was an MP have been investigated. Bercow denies the allegations. Greenpeace has given a qualified welcome to Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement about the UK government ending aid spending on coal mining or coal power plant projects. (See 10.23am.) But it says the move does not go far enough. This is from John Sauven, Greenpeace UK\u2019s executive director. It\u2019s great that in the middle of a climate emergency the UK government is finally putting a stop to taxpayers\u2019 money being used to support coal plants and mines abroad. But if Britain wants to lead by example, it should also urgently phase out support for oil and gas developments, which are pushing the world closer to climate chaos. Supporters of HS2 have renewed their calls for the project to go ahead despite the reservations implicit in the Oakervee review leaked to the Financial Times. (See 9.33am.) This is from Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. Our business communities want to see HS2 delivered in full without further delay. This project is an investment that will transform the capacity of our railways and the potential of so many areas across the UK. While there can be no blank cheque, cutting the project back would put development and investment plans across the country at risk. This is from the Northern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison. Clearly we will have to wait to see if this leak is genuine. But all of the signals coming out of the official, thorough review by respected figures suggest that the only way we can truly hope to level up the UK economy and create the same opportunities for businesses and young people in the North and the Midlands as in London and the South East is in this year giving the green light to continue HS2. And this is from Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA transport union. The north of England has spent too long as the poor relation of transport investment. HS2 must go ahead and be built through to Scotland. It\u2019s time we brought our railways into the 21st century with confidence and pride. Here, fairly randomly, is some more political reaction to the FT story about the HS2 review concluding the project could now cost more than \u00a3100bn. (See 9.33am.) From David Davis, the Conservative former Brexit secretary From the SNP deputy leader and MSP Keith Brown From the Green MEP Ellie Chowns Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership candidate, has used the Phillips/Nandy complaints about the Labour hustings format (see 9.08am) to make a point about her own considerable frontbench experience. In his summary of the hustings on Saturday the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush said Thornberry came over as \u201cthe most fluent and polished of the candidates\u201d, although he also said she would benefit the most from a less rigid format. Labour is not responding publicly at this point to Lisa Nandy\u2019s call for the format of the official leadership hustings to be changed (see 9.08am), but Nandy is going to get a reply from Jennie Formby, the general secretary, and Nandy\u2019s points are going to be raised with the party\u2019s procedures committee, according to a party source. Boris Johnson has finished his speech. Here is the full quote from the passage where he announced that the UK would no longer spend aid money on fossile fuel projects. He said: A decade ago we were the one of the most carbon-heavy nations in Europe. Today we\u2019re a world leader in offshore. We regularly generate more of our electricity from renewables than from fossil fuels. And we have almost entirely weaned ourselves off coal. But there\u2019s no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it. We will breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky, we all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms. So from today the British government will no longer provide any new direct official development assistance [ie, overseas aid], investment, export, credit or trade promotion for thermal coal mining coal or coal power plants overseas. To put it simply, not another penny of UK taxpayers money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity. And instead we are going to focus on supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon alternatives. According to a report last year, the British government has spent \u00a3680m of its foreign aid budget on fossil fuel projects since 2010. Johnson is now addressing the point about the UK ending the use of aid money for investment in coal mining and coal power stations overseas. (See 9.51am.) He says there is no point the UK cutting its carbon emissions domestically if it is promoting carbon emissions abroad. He says the UK will encourage the development of alternative energy sources abroad. He says he does not accept that cutting emissions and promoting growth cannot go together. He says UK emissions have been cut by 42% since 1990. But GDP has grown by 67% over the same period, he says. Johnson says all the half tea drunk in the UK comes from Kenya. Britain without tea is not worth thinking about. And so Britain without Kenya is not worth thinking about, he says. He says he is talking about tea coming through Kenya, not necessarily tea grown in Kenya. Johnson is still speaking. He says the UK has a depth of expertise that cannot be matched elsewhere. He is referring now to UK exports to Africa. Here is an excerpt on this from the overnight press release. The prime minister will use his opening speech to illustrate this modern partnership with examples of UK businesses like Dorset-based Low Energy Designs, which is installing smart street lighting across Nigeria, Northern Irish firm Lagan which has won the contract to build a business park in Uganda, and Diageo which is investing \u00a3167 million to build a state of the art, environmentally friendly breweries in Kenya and wider East Africa. Johnson also claims chicken from Northern Ireland is being exported to Angola. Boris Johnson is speaking at the UK-Africa summit now. He says he regards this event as the culmination of the work he did as foreign secretary. As foreign secretary, he visited more African countries than any British politician in living memory, he claims. As foreign secretary he argued that the UK was a country African nations should be doing business with, he says. He says the UK is the \u201cobvious partner of choice\u201d. It is the ultimate \u201cone-stop shop\u201d, he says. He says in the City investment finance is being raised for every project you can imagine, in every possible currency. He says Canary Wharf alone is a bigger banking centre than Frankfurt. He says the UK has the biggest tech sector in this hemisphere. He says one in seven of the words kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers were educated in this country, including the Japanese emperor. The UK has a monopoly on the education of emperors, he jokes. He says the immigration system is changing. It will become fairer, treating people the same wherever they come from. Boris Johnson is due to speak shortly at the UK-Africa investment summit in London. According to a press release from Downing Street overnight, he will announce that the UK is going to stop using overseas aid to support coal mining or coal power plants overseas. No 10 says: At the Summit, the prime minister will announce an end to UK support for thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas, ending direct Official Development Assistance, investment and export credit. This announcement forms part of the UK\u2019s wider commitment to use its expertise and experience to help Africa transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable, sustainable forms of clean energy. In 2019 the UK went a record 83 days without generating electricity from coal. The UK was also the first major economy to set a legally binding target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and Glasgow will host the COP UN Climate Change Summit later this year. During the general election Boris Johnson told a radio presenter that HS2 would cost more than \u00a3100bn. The presenter expressed surprise, because the official budget for the project at that point was just \u00a388bn. but Johnson stuck to his guns. He said he thought the final bill would be \u201cnorth of \u00a31oobn\u201d. Perhaps Johnson knew more than he was letting on. Today\u2019s Financial Times says a leak of the review of HS2 by Doug Oakervee says it could cost up to \u00a3106bn. The FT story is here (paywall) and our own follow-up is here. According to the FT, the Oakervee review says that \u201con balance\u201d HS2 should continue, but it recommends that work on the link from the West Midlands to Manchester and Leeds be put on hold for six months to explore whether it could be made up of a mix of standard and high-speed rail. Speaking on the Today programme this morning, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said watering down what was proposed for the route north of Birmingham in this way would be unacceptable. He said: I\u2019m worried by the suggestion that there might be a delay in the north, or even that we might get some kind of second-class option, a mix of high-speed and conventional lines that it\u2019s talking about. And to me that would be the same old story. London to Birmingham, money is no object, and then all the penny pinching is done in the North of England. That would not be acceptable to me, and I\u2019m sure wouldn\u2019t be acceptable to many other leaders across the north. Burnham also said the development of an east-west rail route across the Nnorth - known as HS3 or Northern Powerhouse Rail - relied on HS2 being built. He explained: This isn\u2019t just about north-south rail. The point about HS2 is it lays the enabling infrastructure for the east-west links that we crucially need and most people here would say that those are even more important. This is about building a railway for the north, right across the north, for the rest of the century. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t support the idea that we will see downgrading of what is done north of Birmingham. That would be fundamentally unacceptable. If we get to a position where trains can go high-speed into Birmingham and then trundle their way north, then I\u2019m sorry but that just isn\u2019t good enough. The first official party hustings in the Labour leadership contest took place on Saturday, in Liverpool, and some observers said afterwards that the format made it all a bit dull and inconclusive. Under the rules drawn up by party HQ, candidates were given just 40 seconds to answer questions, and they were not allowed to interrupt each other or ask each other questions. Paul Mason, the Labour-supporting journalists, said this arrangements was \u201cdire\u201d. Now it seems at least two of the candidates agree with him. In an article for the Guardian Jess Phillips says she thought that she performed badly, and that the format was partly to blame. She says: The hustings was awful. I was awful because I was trying to hit a million different lines and messages in 40 seconds. Some were my lines, some were other people\u2019s, and it fell flat. It was not all my failing. The format of the hustings is terrible. To answer any question in 40 seconds is ridiculous. If it were possible to sum up, for example, an economic plan or an industrial strategy in 40 seconds, one wonders why they are actually hundreds of pages long. What a ridiculous farce. And now, as HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports, Lisa Nandy has written to Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, asking her to change the rules. She says the candidates should be given more than 40 seconds to reply to questions, and allowed to engage with each other. She says: We need these hustings to ignite a passionate debate in our party and this cannot be achieved by proscribing answers to 40 second sound bites and hermetically sealing the candidates from direct conversations between ourselves. The next official hustings is due in Leeds on Saturday. We will find out later what Labour HQ has to say about the Nandy request. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The UK-Africa investment summit opens. Boris Johnson is hosting it. There will be a live stream here. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.45pm: Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, gives a speech in Westminster on remaking Britain. He will use it to expand on arguments he made in this article for the Guardian. 1pm: Jess Phillips, the Labour leadership candidate, takes part in a live webchat for Mumsnet. After 3.30pm: Peers begin debating the report stage of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. They are expected to vote on amendments relating to citizens\u2019 rights and on the independence of courts. At some point today the executive of the Usdaw union is meeting to decide who to nominate in the Labour leadership contest. This is important because Usdaw is one of the five unions big enough to ensure that a candidate meets the 5% hurdle in this category. And at some point today Tory backbenchers are voting in an election for the chairmanship of the 1922 Committee. Sir Graham Brady is facing a challenge from Bill Wiggin. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Felt headgear and 19th-century fictional women \u2026 felt headgear and 19th-century fictional women \u2026 that\u2019s it! I was thinking of the fedora\u2019s cousin.</p> <p>Yes: the trilby. Previously Trilby, heroine of an 1894 novel, then slang for a foot (Trilby in the book had tremendous feet), next a kind of shoe, opportunistically trademarked in America \u2026 and, most enduringly, a felt hat with a shape either similar to or completely dissimilar to that of the fedora, depending how much or how little you pay attention to headgear.</p> <p>The novel? Its millinery legacy is perhaps its creator\u2019s third-largest achievement. His second is being grandfather not only to the five boys who inspired Peter Pan but also to a novelist whose name also endures: he was George and she remains Daphne du Maurier.</p> <p>And his largest achievement? For a long time, they said it was his talent to coin phrases used to this day. Case in point: \u201cbedside manner\u201d, originally meant facetiously, as it appears in <a href=\"https://punch.photoshelter.com/image/I0000dc53I7J12S0\">this 1884 du Maurier cartoon for Punch</a>. One problem: we see the same phrase used, with, I think, the same side-eye, in a novel of 1869:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"915f72309cf76388a3b2ef2999af5636d7a5f6f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/915f72309cf76388a3b2ef2999af5636d7a5f6f1/0_0_844_200/500.jpg\" alt=\"From Stepping Heavenward by Elizabeth Prentiss.\" width=\"500\" height=\"118\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Stepping Heavenward<em> </em>by<em> </em>Elizabeth Prentiss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The expression most associated with Du Maurier is \u201ccurate\u2019s egg\u201d, thanks to <a href=\"https://punch.photoshelter.com/image/I0000vVolHOJX5FQ\">another Punch cartoon</a> in which a nervous clergyman attempts good manners:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>TRUE HUMILITY. <br><em>Right Reverend Host.</em> \u201cI\u2019M AFRAID YOU\u2019VE GOT A BAD EGG, MR. JONES!\u201d <em>The Curate.</em> \u201cOH NO, MY LORD, I ASSURE YOU! PARTS OF IT ARE EXCELLENT!\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Two problems this time. The first is that \u201ccurate\u2019s egg\u201d is not as enduring as it seems, since it has effectively lost its meaning. It served a useful purpose for a while in offering a short way of saying something quite involved: \u201cany part of this being bad would spoil the whole thing \u2013 and has \u2013 but I am choosing to say that some of it is good, either knowingly, to cushion the blow, or with sarcasm\u201d. As often as not, though, it\u2019s used to mean something more like \u201ca mixed bag\u201d, which seems a shame when we already have expressions like \u201ca mixed bag\u201d.</p> <p>We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/may/13/crossword-roundup-cigarettes-alocohol\">discussed this tendency for phrases to lose nuance before</a>; then, I had not yet read last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/04/04/egg/\">piece on \u201ccurate\u2019s egg\u201d</a> at Garson O\u2019Toole\u2019s Quote Investigator \u2013 a site I trust, for what its worth. It seems that earlier the same year, the less celebrated satirical magazine Judy had a cartoon in which someone tries to be polite about an unpleasant egg. Perhaps, though, Du Maurier had introduced the social context which gives the joke its punch?</p> <p>He had not. Here\u2019s the caption for Judy\u2019s cartoon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>SCENE \u2013 BISHOP\u2019S BREAKFAST TABLE.<br><em>Bishop (to timid Curate on a visit).</em> DEAR ME, I\u2019M AFRAID YOUR EGG\u2019S NOT GOOD!<br><em>Timid Curate.</em> OH, YES, MY LORD, REALLY \u2013 ER \u2013 SOME PARTS OF IT ARE <em>VERY</em> GOOD.</p> </blockquote> <p>Judy\u2019s editor made a fuss, perhaps unaware that the whole being-polite-to-a-bishop-about-an-egg thing had been the subject of an anecdote which seems to have been <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UiVnAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA652\">knocking around</a> for at least 20 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"891ea9a0153cfad720861d59b778933c8d75aaaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/891ea9a0153cfad720861d59b778933c8d75aaaa/0_0_638_205/500.jpg\" alt=\"from The Academy, 1875.\" width=\"500\" height=\"161\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">from <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UiVnAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA652\">The Academy</a>, 1875.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Google Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that I wouldn\u2019t be astonished to discover that there was already a play called Trilby about a woman with nice feet, this brings us to our next challenge.

      "bodyText": "The news in clues In a qualifying puzzle for the Times crossword championship, a clue that simultaneously feels contemporary \u2026 26ac Russian politician still to admit large crime (7) [wordplay: synonym for \u201cstill\u201d containing (\u201cto admit\u201d) abbrev for \u201clarge\u201d, then synonym for \u201ccrime\u201d] [YET containing L, then SIN] [definition: Russian politician] \u2026 and, since the current leader seems to be trying to match Stalin\u2019s three decades of power, reminds us that there were once others, like Boris YELTSIN. Meanwhile, we have a tense image from Boatman in this clue \u2026 28ac UK citizen stands by Labour leader boxed in by Trotskyite extremes, likely to snap (7) [wordplay: term for UK citizen, next to (\u201cstands by\u201d) first letter of LABOUR (\u201cLabour leader\u201d) inside first and last letters (\u201cextremes\u201d) of TROTSKYITE] [BRIT, next to L inside TE] \u2026 for BRITTLE. And the solution is now out for a Times Jumbo from before the New Year \u2026 2d Scorer required in Johannesburg match? (5) [wordplay: abbreviated paraphrase of \u201cJohannesburg match\u201d] [abbreviated version of \u201cSouth Africa tie\u201d] [definition: scorer (as in one who writes musical scores)] while the Test it brings to mind continues. \u201cScorer\u201d seems especially fitting for Erik SATIE, as his scores are enjoyable before you even hear the music, not least for his instructions to musicians: \u201clight as an egg\u201d, \u201clike a nightingale with the toothache\u201d and the rest. Latter patter Here\u2019s Tramp \u2026 11ac Felt item of clothing; a piece turned over to iron (6) [wordplay: reversal (\u201cturned over\u201d) of slang for \u201ca gun\u201d (\u201ca piece\u201d), coming after (\u201cto\u201d) chemical symbol for iron] [reversal of A ROD, after FE] [definition: felt item of clothing] \u2026 misleading us by making \u201cfelt\u201d feel verbal rather than adjectival en route to FEDORA. Before the fedora, there was F\u00e9dora, an 1882 play which, the OED tells us, was perhaps most memorable for its stylish lead Sarah Bernhardt: The name of the play and its heroine appear to have been adopted slightly earlier for various items of womenswear, including hats. One moment. Felt headgear and 19th-century fictional women \u2026 felt headgear and 19th-century fictional women \u2026 that\u2019s it! I was thinking of the fedora\u2019s cousin. Yes: the trilby. Previously Trilby, heroine of an 1894 novel, then slang for a foot (Trilby in the book had tremendous feet), next a kind of shoe, opportunistically trademarked in America \u2026 and, most enduringly, a felt hat with a shape either similar to or completely dissimilar to that of the fedora, depending how much or how little you pay attention to headgear. The novel? Its millinery legacy is perhaps its creator\u2019s third-largest achievement. His second is being grandfather not only to the five boys who inspired Peter Pan but also to a novelist whose name also endures: he was George and she remains Daphne du Maurier. And his largest achievement? For a long time, they said it was his talent to coin phrases used to this day. Case in point: \u201cbedside manner\u201d, originally meant facetiously, as it appears in this 1884 du Maurier cartoon for Punch. One problem: we see the same phrase used, with, I think, the same side-eye, in a novel of 1869: The expression most associated with Du Maurier is \u201ccurate\u2019s egg\u201d, thanks to another Punch cartoon in which a nervous clergyman attempts good manners: TRUE HUMILITY. Right Reverend Host. \u201cI\u2019M AFRAID YOU\u2019VE GOT A BAD EGG, MR. JONES!\u201d The Curate. \u201cOH NO, MY LORD, I ASSURE YOU! PARTS OF IT ARE EXCELLENT!\u201d Two problems this time. The first is that \u201ccurate\u2019s egg\u201d is not as enduring as it seems, since it has effectively lost its meaning. It served a useful purpose for a while in offering a short way of saying something quite involved: \u201cany part of this being bad would spoil the whole thing \u2013 and has \u2013 but I am choosing to say that some of it is good, either knowingly, to cushion the blow, or with sarcasm\u201d. As often as not, though, it\u2019s used to mean something more like \u201ca mixed bag\u201d, which seems a shame when we already have expressions like \u201ca mixed bag\u201d. We discussed this tendency for phrases to lose nuance before; then, I had not yet read last year\u2019s piece on \u201ccurate\u2019s egg\u201d at Garson O\u2019Toole\u2019s Quote Investigator \u2013 a site I trust, for what its worth. It seems that earlier the same year, the less celebrated satirical magazine Judy had a cartoon in which someone tries to be polite about an unpleasant egg. Perhaps, though, Du Maurier had introduced the social context which gives the joke its punch? He had not. Here\u2019s the caption for Judy\u2019s cartoon: SCENE \u2013 BISHOP\u2019S BREAKFAST TABLE. Bishop (to timid Curate on a visit). DEAR ME, I\u2019M AFRAID YOUR EGG\u2019S NOT GOOD! Timid Curate. OH, YES, MY LORD, REALLY \u2013 ER \u2013 SOME PARTS OF IT ARE VERY GOOD. Judy\u2019s editor made a fuss, perhaps unaware that the whole being-polite-to-a-bishop-about-an-egg thing had been the subject of an anecdote which seems to have been knocking around for at least 20 years. Given that I wouldn\u2019t be astonished to discover that there was already a play called Trilby about a woman with nice feet, this brings us to our next challenge.

John Crace has been given an exclusive preview of the prime minister\u2019s scorecards \u2026</em></p> <p><strong>Stephen Barclay, Brexit secretary \u2013 10/10 </strong>The absolute dream cabinet minister. Someone who understands his job is to keep himself so uninformed there is never any danger of him saying anything that might be construed as news. A vital asset in his department. Have several times tried to explain to him that his department is being wound up and he will be promoted to the backbenches, but I am still none the wiser whether he has taken in this information. What a guy! A true professional to the last. <strong>Verdict: GOES</strong></p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid, chancellor \u2013 6/10 </strong>After a tricky start during which he imagined he was running the economy, Saj has settled down and realised now is not the time for fiscal responsibility and that his job is merely to say yes and write cheques for any project I happen to dream up. He has also made huge improvements in saying anything about Brexit that he thinks I want to hear, and there is little doubt he would be happy to change his mind again if it\u2019s convenient for me to change mine. <strong>STAYS</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster \u2013 3/10 </strong>It goes without saying that the Gover is the most slippery, least trustworthy person in government, present company excepted of course, but it\u2019s probably better keeping him on the inside in a non-job rather than having him cause trouble from the backbenches. Has so far managed to keep his head down and do nothing. Let\u2019s hope he stays that way. Things work so much more smoothly like this. Could still be a useful fall guy if Brexit goes tits up. <strong>STAYS</strong></p> <p><strong>Matt Hancock, health secretary \u2013 7/10 </strong>Though it can be tremendously tiring to be around someone this needy (barely a day goes by without him sending a text message saying he\u2019s always been 110% behind me and can I guarantee he won\u2019t be sacked?), Matt has had a good first term as health secretary. Primarily because he\u2019s the only person in the UK who believes me when I say we will be building 40 new hospitals, recruiting 50,000 new nurses and scrapping A&amp;E targets to improve performance. He\u2019s going to be terribly disappointed when he learns the reality. But that\u2019s really not my problem. <strong>STAYS</strong></p> <p><strong>Dominic Raab, foreign secretary \u2013 5/10 </strong>Although Dominic still has acute anger management problems and has been forced to take out a non-disclosure agreement with his entire department in regards to the whereabouts of several members of staff who were found floating face down in the Thames, he did just about manage to prevent himself from propelling the UK into a third world war after the US took out Qassem Suleimani while I was necking cocktails with Carrie in Mustique. <strong>STAYS</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Priti Patel, home secretary \u2013 4/10 </strong>A round peg in a round hole. The ideal home secretary is someone who is both vicious and dim, and Priti Vacant is blessed with an abundance of both qualities. <strong>STAYS</strong></p> <p><strong>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, work and pensions secretary \u2013 0/10 </strong>I have literally no idea who she is or if she has done anything. <strong>GOES</strong></p> <p><strong>Julian Smith, Northern Ireland secretary \u2013 6/10 </strong>What a jammy sod. I only gave him the job because I thought it would be easy to sack him when he screwed up. Then I surprise myself by getting an 80-seat majority, meaning the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in soon realised they were better off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/11/northern-ireland-assembly-reopens-three-years-after-collapse\">restoring the Stormont assembly</a> rather than continuing their squabbles, and Jules gets all the credit even though he did next to nothing. <strong>STAYS</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Wallace, defence secretary \u2013 3/10 </strong>It hurts me to say this as Ben was so far ahead of the game that he was touting me as the next prime minister even before I was. But he is an inveterate gossip; half the Sunday papers would have no stories without his help. He also made the schoolboy error of telling the truth about how we can no longer rely on the US.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has reportedly told ministers he intends to give them marks out of 10 before deciding whether to keep or cull them in a reshuffle next month. John Crace has been given an exclusive preview of the prime minister\u2019s scorecards \u2026 Stephen Barclay, Brexit secretary \u2013 10/10 The absolute dream cabinet minister. Someone who understands his job is to keep himself so uninformed there is never any danger of him saying anything that might be construed as news. A vital asset in his department. Have several times tried to explain to him that his department is being wound up and he will be promoted to the backbenches, but I am still none the wiser whether he has taken in this information. What a guy! A true professional to the last. Verdict: GOES Sajid Javid, chancellor \u2013 6/10 After a tricky start during which he imagined he was running the economy, Saj has settled down and realised now is not the time for fiscal responsibility and that his job is merely to say yes and write cheques for any project I happen to dream up. He has also made huge improvements in saying anything about Brexit that he thinks I want to hear, and there is little doubt he would be happy to change his mind again if it\u2019s convenient for me to change mine. STAYS Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster \u2013 3/10 It goes without saying that the Gover is the most slippery, least trustworthy person in government, present company excepted of course, but it\u2019s probably better keeping him on the inside in a non-job rather than having him cause trouble from the backbenches. Has so far managed to keep his head down and do nothing. Let\u2019s hope he stays that way. Things work so much more smoothly like this. Could still be a useful fall guy if Brexit goes tits up. STAYS Matt Hancock, health secretary \u2013 7/10 Though it can be tremendously tiring to be around someone this needy (barely a day goes by without him sending a text message saying he\u2019s always been 110% behind me and can I guarantee he won\u2019t be sacked?), Matt has had a good first term as health secretary. Primarily because he\u2019s the only person in the UK who believes me when I say we will be building 40 new hospitals, recruiting 50,000 new nurses and scrapping A&amp;E targets to improve performance. He\u2019s going to be terribly disappointed when he learns the reality. But that\u2019s really not my problem. STAYS Dominic Raab, foreign secretary \u2013 5/10 Although Dominic still has acute anger management problems and has been forced to take out a non-disclosure agreement with his entire department in regards to the whereabouts of several members of staff who were found floating face down in the Thames, he did just about manage to prevent himself from propelling the UK into a third world war after the US took out Qassem Suleimani while I was necking cocktails with Carrie in Mustique. STAYS. Priti Patel, home secretary \u2013 4/10 A round peg in a round hole. The ideal home secretary is someone who is both vicious and dim, and Priti Vacant is blessed with an abundance of both qualities. STAYS Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, work and pensions secretary \u2013 0/10 I have literally no idea who she is or if she has done anything. GOES Julian Smith, Northern Ireland secretary \u2013 6/10 What a jammy sod. I only gave him the job because I thought it would be easy to sack him when he screwed up. Then I surprise myself by getting an 80-seat majority, meaning the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in soon realised they were better off restoring the Stormont assembly rather than continuing their squabbles, and Jules gets all the credit even though he did next to nothing. STAYS Ben Wallace, defence secretary \u2013 3/10 It hurts me to say this as Ben was so far ahead of the game that he was touting me as the next prime minister even before I was. But he is an inveterate gossip; half the Sunday papers would have no stories without his help. He also made the schoolboy error of telling the truth about how we can no longer rely on the US. Enough\u2019s enough. GOES Nicky Morgan, digital, culture, media and sport secretary \u2013 4/10 Nicky has taken to her new role of being in the House of Lords like a duck to water. In cabinet meetings she now refuses to speak unless she is addressed by her full title of Baroness Morgan of Cotes. Having finally obtained an audience with her ladyship, I have to conclude that Nicky now believes the culture department is rather infra dig for a person of her status in life. GOES Robert Jenrick, housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 2/10 Poor chap rather embarrassed himself by not knowing the difference between a town and a city when he launched his Town in Bloom competition. But one doesn\u2019t want to be too hard on a 12-year-old who is still only on work experience. STAYS James Cleverly, minister without portfolio \u2013 9/10 Every prime minister needs a James. Someone who can be trusted to drop everything and go out on the Sunday politics shows at a time when everyone else is tucked up in bed to spout any old bollocks. Better still, he can do it convincingly as he doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s bollocks. Only the other day he told the country we were thinking of moving the Lords to York.

The House voted in December to pass the articles of impeachment, or charges, and these articles were delivered to the Senate in January as the case for the prosecution, in preparation for the Senate\u2019s trial of the president. The full articles can be read here, and are summarized below. Article 1: abuse of power The constitution provides that the House of Representatives \u201cshall have the sole power of impeachment\u201d and that the president shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. In his conduct of the office of president of the United States and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, Donald J Trump has abused the powers of the presidency, in that: Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States presidential election.

This failure means that the starting gun over how the BBC should be funded has already been fired.

Since Christmas, the former chair of Ofcom Patricia Hodgson has <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/28/three-quarters-want-bbc-licence-fee-abolished-poll-finds/\">called for a subscription model</a> to be introduced.</p> <p>Recognising the imminent threat, Hall said in a statement to staff: \u201cIt must be right that the BBC has one person to lead it through both stages.\u201d His decision to allow his successor time to manage both processes was greeted as \u201ca grown up thing to do\u201d by one commercial rival yesterday.</p> <p>The decision was also said to be encouraged by the BBC\u2019s chair, Sir David Clementi, whose four-year term is due to expire in February 2021.</p> <p>Given Hall\u2019s insistence that the last charter review was a \u201cstrong deal\u201d, it would be wise to take his statement that he leaves the BBC in a \u201cmuch stronger place than when I joined\u201d with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>Yet he has presided over several successes both onscreen and off. Unflappable in a crisis and with a strong track record as a journalist, Hall is popular among the BBC news team. He has brought a sense of calm to an organisation despite huge changes, thousands of job cuts and screams of bias. The BBC also moved early to leave London for the regions, particularly the north.</p> <p>Yet he mishandled the equal pay dispute, not appearing to realise until quite late that the government\u2019s insistence on revealing the identities of those paid more than \u00a3100,000 a year would give ammunition not to rivals wishing to poach its overpaid and typically older white male staff, but to its legions of underpaid and fed-up female employees.</p> <p>Even the government\u2019s pressure on an independent news organisation pales into insignificance next to its failure to remain essential to younger viewers and listeners. Last year an Ofcom report found that fewer than half of Britons aged 16 to 24 watched a traditional live BBC television channel each week. What\u2019s more, younger viewers were twice as likely to watch BBC programmes on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> than on the BBC\u2019s own iPlayer service.</p> <p>The same report was critical of the BBC\u2019s insistence that impartiality meant giving both sides an equal say and urged its journalists to be more willing to directly call out lies.</p> <p>Despite all this, reports from Ofcom and others still suggest that the BBC is one of the most trusted news organisations in the UK \u2013 and that means the battle ahead will be a monumental one. When he was appointed, the media commentator Steve Hewlett said Hall\u2019s \u201cbiggest test is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/apr/07/tony-hall-bbc-digital-future\">secure a digital future</a>\u201d. Now the biggest test is to secure its future full stop.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Tony Hall was appointed director general in 2013, he was given the task of steadying a BBC that had been seriously rocked by its handling of the Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine scandals. Hall may have lasted much longer than his predecessor\u2019s 54 days, but he leaves the BBC facing even greater existential threats. Even for a public service broadcaster used to crisis, the combination of an unfriendly government and an ageing audience present Hall\u2019s successor with exceptionally tough challenges. Hall had wanted to continue as director general until the BBC\u2019s centenary in 2022 when he would be 71, but the seeds of his decision to step down this summer were sown during the torrid negotiations to renew the BBC\u2019s 10-year charter when he agreed to a mid-term review in 2022. At the time Hall justified the BBC\u2019s agreement to pay for free licence fees for the over-75s, saying the fee had been guaranteed and index-linked until the end of 2027. But he lost a hard-fought negotiation over the government\u2019s insistence on having a mid-term review in 2022. This failure means that the starting gun over how the BBC should be funded has already been fired. John Whittingdale, the former cabinet minister who helped negotiate the settlement, confirmed as much yesterday when he said this review would be \u201cthe beginning\u201d of the discussion. Given how much is at stake, Hall\u2019s desire to hold out for the big celebratory parties was not tenable, even had there not been a job at the National Gallery on offer. The mid-term review is likely to be used to discuss both the abolition of the \u00a3154.50 charge and also the decriminalisation of non-payment, if Boris Johnson\u2019s thinly veiled threats since his election offer any clue. Since Christmas, the former chair of Ofcom Patricia Hodgson has called for a subscription model to be introduced. Recognising the imminent threat, Hall said in a statement to staff: \u201cIt must be right that the BBC has one person to lead it through both stages.\u201d His decision to allow his successor time to manage both processes was greeted as \u201ca grown up thing to do\u201d by one commercial rival yesterday. The decision was also said to be encouraged by the BBC\u2019s chair, Sir David Clementi, whose four-year term is due to expire in February 2021. Given Hall\u2019s insistence that the last charter review was a \u201cstrong deal\u201d, it would be wise to take his statement that he leaves the BBC in a \u201cmuch stronger place than when I joined\u201d with a pinch of salt. Yet he has presided over several successes both onscreen and off. Unflappable in a crisis and with a strong track record as a journalist, Hall is popular among the BBC news team. He has brought a sense of calm to an organisation despite huge changes, thousands of job cuts and screams of bias. The BBC also moved early to leave London for the regions, particularly the north. Yet he mishandled the equal pay dispute, not appearing to realise until quite late that the government\u2019s insistence on revealing the identities of those paid more than \u00a3100,000 a year would give ammunition not to rivals wishing to poach its overpaid and typically older white male staff, but to its legions of underpaid and fed-up female employees. Even the government\u2019s pressure on an independent news organisation pales into insignificance next to its failure to remain essential to younger viewers and listeners. Last year an Ofcom report found that fewer than half of Britons aged 16 to 24 watched a traditional live BBC television channel each week. What\u2019s more, younger viewers were twice as likely to watch BBC programmes on Netflix than on the BBC\u2019s own iPlayer service. The same report was critical of the BBC\u2019s insistence that impartiality meant giving both sides an equal say and urged its journalists to be more willing to directly call out lies. Despite all this, reports from Ofcom and others still suggest that the BBC is one of the most trusted news organisations in the UK \u2013 and that means the battle ahead will be a monumental one. When he was appointed, the media commentator Steve Hewlett said Hall\u2019s \u201cbiggest test is to secure a digital future\u201d. Now the biggest test is to secure its future full stop.",

But, as the writer Roxane Gay has said, no one is asking people to apologise for their privilege. They are just asking them, in Gay\u2019s words, to \u201cacknowledge how these factors helped you move through life\u201d. It\u2019s manners, basically, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>The lazy stereotype of the snowflake who can\u2019t read a Thomas Hardy novel without counselling is just that. As is the stereotype of the great unwoke, unwashed, racist, sexist idiot. This is a trap, people are complicated and the real world is not Twitter.</p> <p>But it was on Twitter that I posted a video of Fox, saying I had never heard of him, and was told that I must be aware of this minor thespian. But I have never seen the Morse spin-off in which he \u201cstarred\u201d. (It\u2019s called Lewis, apparently.) So sue me. On YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIv77x7Z5ic\" title=\"\">he can be found talking about woke culture as an \u201cintolerant\u201d religion where people who don\u2019t subscribe to it are \u201cheretics\u201d or the enemy. He thinks it\u2019s gone too far.</a> He says this stuff to Peter Whittle, who was the deputy leader of Ukip. So here we have Beavis and Butt-Head without the charm, repeating the familiar white-guy refrain about identity politics. It\u2019s all a nightmare.</p> <p>There is apparently money to be made by posh guys ventriloquising the so-called common man \u2013 whether they\u2019re slagging off vegans, Muslim women or climate protesters. In the future, everyone will bait liberals for 15 minutes. Fox is now in with the Spiked crew of provocateurs. Alt-left? Alt-right? Alt-dreary. There is a long line of these types, some cleverer than others: Rod Liddle, Richard Littlejohn and Jeremy Clarkson, with Toby Young, James Delingpole and Martin Daubney on the subs\u2019 bench. They present as dissenting voices, speaking truth to the elite. In reality, they just preach to people their age. To call this circle jerk of intolerance a culture war is to ennoble it. Not everyone can reach the ugly heights of Jordan Peterson.</p> <p>What people are saying when they say racism doesn\u2019t exist is that it doesn\u2019t exist for them. Their own identities are weirdly defined by a form of victimhood they profess to hate. So envious are they of oppressed people that they try to claim that they are too, in the name of free speech.</p> <p>There is now a backlash against women, against gay people, against black people, against the tiniest bit more diversity \u2013 and it is a concerted effort. Steve Bannon knows it, and the men who now run Breitbart know it. It moves in high places. We have government by Old Etonians and yet there remains a confusion about who runs the country, who is in the cultural establishment and who counts as a liberal.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to give much time to Fox, but I will get personal as he has made a podcast with Delingpole, who once had to apologise for using repugnant, sexually violent language against me. Why did he do it? Because I had criticised Michael Gove\u2019s education polices, and at that point one Dominic Cummings was Gove\u2019s special adviser, so they all leapt to Young\u2019s defence when he attacked me, too.</p> <p>These people <em>are</em> the establishment. White privilege and casual sexism is the sea they tend to swim in<strong>. </strong>Attention-seeking haters such as Katie Hopkins and strangely bitter successes such as Piers Morgan help spawn these posh understudies.</p> <p>Their side has won, so why are they such losers? Why are their egos so fragile? And why are they so easily rattled if they are only saying what ordinary people think, as they like to suggest?</p> <p>For that is the shtick, when really what they are doing is insidious. They exist to make those in power appear reasonable as they tear up the social contract.</p> <p>Fox is but a desperate fool who doesn\u2019t even see his part in the bigger game he plays. Let us not speak of him again. He is not worth even the notoriety.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But it was on Twitter that I posted a video of Fox, saying I had never heard of him, and was told that I must be aware of this minor thespian. But I have never seen the Morse spin-off in which he \u201cstarred\u201d. (It\u2019s called Lewis, apparently.) So sue me. On YouTube, he can be found talking about woke culture as an \u201cintolerant\u201d religion where people who don\u2019t subscribe to it are \u201cheretics\u201d or the enemy. He thinks it\u2019s gone too far. He says this stuff to Peter Whittle, who was the deputy leader of Ukip. So here we have Beavis and Butt-Head without the charm, repeating the familiar white-guy refrain about identity politics. It\u2019s all a nightmare. There is apparently money to be made by posh guys ventriloquising the so-called common man \u2013 whether they\u2019re slagging off vegans, Muslim women or climate protesters. In the future, everyone will bait liberals for 15 minutes. Fox is now in with the Spiked crew of provocateurs. Alt-left? Alt-right? Alt-dreary. There is a long line of these types, some cleverer than others: Rod Liddle, Richard Littlejohn and Jeremy Clarkson, with Toby Young, James Delingpole and Martin Daubney on the subs\u2019 bench. They present as dissenting voices, speaking truth to the elite. In reality, they just preach to people their age. To call this circle jerk of intolerance a culture war is to ennoble it. Not everyone can reach the ugly heights of Jordan Peterson. What people are saying when they say racism doesn\u2019t exist is that it doesn\u2019t exist for them. Their own identities are weirdly defined by a form of victimhood they profess to hate. So envious are they of oppressed people that they try to claim that they are too, in the name of free speech. There is now a backlash against women, against gay people, against black people, against the tiniest bit more diversity \u2013 and it is a concerted effort. Steve Bannon knows it, and the men who now run Breitbart know it. It moves in high places. We have government by Old Etonians and yet there remains a confusion about who runs the country, who is in the cultural establishment and who counts as a liberal. I don\u2019t want to give much time to Fox, but I will get personal as he has made a podcast with Delingpole, who once had to apologise for using repugnant, sexually violent language against me. Why did he do it? Because I had criticised Michael Gove\u2019s education polices, and at that point one Dominic Cummings was Gove\u2019s special adviser, so they all leapt to Young\u2019s defence when he attacked me, too. These people are the establishment. White privilege and casual sexism is the sea they tend to swim in. Attention-seeking haters such as Katie Hopkins and strangely bitter successes such as Piers Morgan help spawn these posh understudies. Their side has won, so why are they such losers? Why are their egos so fragile? And why are they so easily rattled if they are only saying what ordinary people think, as they like to suggest? For that is the shtick, when really what they are doing is insidious. They exist to make those in power appear reasonable as they tear up the social contract. Fox is but a desperate fool who doesn\u2019t even see his part in the bigger game he plays. Let us not speak of him again. He is not worth even the notoriety. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green will no longer face charges of misdemeanour assault in the US, after four counts alleging he repeatedly touched a pilates instructor inappropriately were dismissed. The retail tycoon had been formally charged with \u201cknowingly touching another person with the intent to injure, insult or provoke\u201d in May last year. He was accused of spanking the instructor and grabbing her buttocks at the Canyon Ranch resort in Tucson, Arizona, in 2016 and 2018, according to the Pima County attorney\u2019s office. However, at the request of the prosecution, Justice Vince Roberts dismissed the case at the end of last week, according to a court document released to the media by Green\u2019s company Arcadia. Green\u2019s behaviour had come under scrutiny after the former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain used parliamentary privilege in 2018 to name the Topshop tycoon as the businessman at the centre of harassment allegations. The move followed days of speculation over the identity of a mystery businessman described by the Daily Telegraph as the subject of multiple sexual harassment and bullying allegations. Green, 67, has always denied any unlawful behaviour. The court filing released by Green\u2019s Arcadia Group on Monday stated: \u201cUpon application of the Pima County attorney [Barbara LaWall], and for good cause being shown. It is hereby ordered that the above captioned cause is dismissed with prejudice,\u201d ie permanently. A spokesman for the tycoon said: \u201cThese matters are now closed,\u201d and added there were no outstanding civil or criminal cases in either the UK or the US relating to allegations about Green\u2019s behaviour. The attorney\u2019s office did not respond to calls from the Guardian. The filing from Arizona was a rare piece of recent good news for Green, who has encountered almost as many business as legal problems over the past 18 months. In December he secured a last-ditch \u00a3310m mortgage deal for his flagship Topshop store on Oxford Street in London with the US private equity company Apollo Management International. The deal appeared to be a relief to Green\u2019s Arcadia \u2013 which also controls high-street brands including Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans \u2013 as it had said that difficulties in refinancing the loan could mean it would have to raise new funds to survive. Last week Green announced a fresh wave of store closures in the wake of a tough Christmas. Arcadia had quietly confirmed the closure of at least 12 sites in the past few weeks, including one of its most high-profile stores at Westfield Stratford in east London. Several of the stores house more than one of Arcadia\u2019s brands but the majority include a Topshop. Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge shops are also due to close in the initiative. Arcadia owns 484 stores in the UK and employs 19,000 people. The landlords behind several of the closure sites \u2013 in Wolverhampton, Newbury, Blackburn, Bolton, Aylesbury and Worthing \u2013 had already agreed to 70% rent cuts as part of the rescue restructure finalised last year, but that had not been enough to save the outlets. A further 25 stores are likely to shut as, at the time of its restructuring in June last year, Arcadia said it planned to put the property arms of Evans and Miss Selfridge into administration.",

And in 11 months\u2019 time Brexit will hit the hard place where voters will find it isn\u2019t \u201cdone\u201d at all. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Becoming literary executor upon his father\u2019s death in 1973, Christopher took charge of 70 boxes of papers ranging from Oxford lectures to lexicons of invented Elvish.</p> <p>A collection of the primary legends of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/drawn-into-tolkiens-world-exhibition\" title=\"\">Middle-earth</a>, The Silmarillion, eagerly anticipated by legions of fans, had been worked and reworked since 1917, with constant evolutions in style, names and plot. Successive drafts, mostly unfinished, had been left in disorder. Christopher began a scholarly edition with variants and notes, but then he decided to publish a single narrative without commentary, eliminating discrepancies including any with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. </p> <p>On a banquet-sized table in the barn of his home in West Hanney, Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire, he scrutinised drafts, made selections, and harmonised details before typing it all up on his father\u2019s old machine. He had the assistance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/29/guy-gavriel-kay-jrr-tolkien-interview-fionovar-tapesty-the-summer-tree\" title=\"\">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>, a young Canadian who is now a fantasy novelist. Though it contained \u201ca great deal of my own personal literary judgment\u201d, Christopher said, editorial insertions were minimal, confined to links filling gaps in the sources.</p> <p>Published in 1977, The Silmarillion sold in millions. Though many reviewers and readers felt it too austere, and missed the down-to-earth hobbits, it quickly established itself as a devotees\u2019 favourite and deeply enriches the Middle-earth canon. Yet regret over the extent of editorial intrusion spurred Christopher to publish further books detailing his father\u2019s development of the stories, producing an unparallelled case study in literary creativity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"693c2a326421c6234d8e3728b62874d3d145375a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/693c2a326421c6234d8e3728b62874d3d145375a/414_581_5460_4450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The map of Gondor and Mordor drawn by Christopher Tolkien for The Return of the King, 1955.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"815\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The map of Gondor and Mordor drawn by Christopher Tolkien for The Return of the King, 1955.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: CR Tolkien</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christopher was born in Leeds, the third son of Edith (nee Bratt) and John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, professor of English language at the university there. His father\u2019s imagination struck such a chord with him that Christopher once said he grew up in Middle-earth and found the cities of The Silmarillion \u201cmore real than Babylon\u201d.</p> <p>Even at four or five, listening to his father read The Hobbit in draft, he would point out continuity errors. A kinship of spirit, not shared by his brothers, John and Michael, or younger sister, Priscilla, made him \u201cintensely lovable\u201d in his father\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>After his father became professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, Christopher went to the Dragon school there, and later to the Oratory school in Caversham, Berkshire. Three years off with an irregular heartbeat from 1938 coincided with early work on a sequel to The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, which was written partly to entertain him. He encouraged his father\u2019s tendency to hobbit whimsy, only curbed at the urging of the Oxford don <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cslewis\" title=\"\">CS Lewis</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9d9719d31bc1a3d75fc695f12ebe34401aed0cfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d9719d31bc1a3d75fc695f12ebe34401aed0cfd/0_0_1200_1819/660.jpg\" alt=\"The Silmarillion (1977), a collection of the primary legends of Middle-earth, sold in millions\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Silmarillion (1977), a collection of the primary legends of Middle-earth, sold in millions</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After undertaking an abbreviated undergraduate course at Trinity College, Oxford, at 17, Christopher trained in 1944-45 with the RAF in South Africa. His father sent him the chapters of Frodo and Sam\u2019s journey to Mordor as they were written, including passages that read like messages to soothe or stiffen his spirits. Christopher responded with detailed, constructive critiques.</p> <p>After the war he joined the Lewis\u2013Tolkien circle, the Inklings, taking over readings of The Lord of the Rings in his crisp, sonorous tones. He completed an English degree at Trinity, then took a BLitt on the Old Norse saga of King Heidrek the Wise. A critical edition in 1960 shows, like his father\u2019s work, an aptitude for medieval linguistic analysis and a fascination with the misty border between legend and history.</p> <p>Christopher lectured at Oxford on Old and Middle English and Old Norse from 1954, and produced editions of three Canterbury Tales with Nevill Coghill. But in 1975 he resigned as fellow of New College to focus on his father\u2019s literary legacy, without regrets. \u201cMy father\u2019s invented languages,\u201d he said, \u201care of more interest than the rather well-tramped field of Anglo-Saxon.\u201d</p> <p>But he never neglected the professor\u2019s work on medieval language and literature, editing and publishing JRR\u2019s translations of the Middle English Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo (1975), a collection of his landmark lectures, The Monsters and the Critics (1983); and much later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/jrr-tolkien-beowulf-translation-published\" title=\"\">Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary</a> (2014); plus two volumes of narrative poetry on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/05/jrr-tokien-sigurd-gudrun-poem\" title=\"\">The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan</a> (2009) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur\" title=\"\">The Fall of Arthur</a> (2013).

      "bodyText": "Christopher Tolkien, who has died aged 95, edited and published a huge body of writings left by his father, JRR Tolkien, extending the world of Middle-earth created in The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-55), but also providing an unparallelled portrait of a creative life. Becoming literary executor upon his father\u2019s death in 1973, Christopher took charge of 70 boxes of papers ranging from Oxford lectures to lexicons of invented Elvish. A collection of the primary legends of Middle-earth, The Silmarillion, eagerly anticipated by legions of fans, had been worked and reworked since 1917, with constant evolutions in style, names and plot. Successive drafts, mostly unfinished, had been left in disorder. Christopher began a scholarly edition with variants and notes, but then he decided to publish a single narrative without commentary, eliminating discrepancies including any with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. On a banquet-sized table in the barn of his home in West Hanney, Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire, he scrutinised drafts, made selections, and harmonised details before typing it all up on his father\u2019s old machine. He had the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, a young Canadian who is now a fantasy novelist. Though it contained \u201ca great deal of my own personal literary judgment\u201d, Christopher said, editorial insertions were minimal, confined to links filling gaps in the sources. Published in 1977, The Silmarillion sold in millions. Though many reviewers and readers felt it too austere, and missed the down-to-earth hobbits, it quickly established itself as a devotees\u2019 favourite and deeply enriches the Middle-earth canon. Yet regret over the extent of editorial intrusion spurred Christopher to publish further books detailing his father\u2019s development of the stories, producing an unparallelled case study in literary creativity. Christopher was born in Leeds, the third son of Edith (nee Bratt) and John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, professor of English language at the university there. His father\u2019s imagination struck such a chord with him that Christopher once said he grew up in Middle-earth and found the cities of The Silmarillion \u201cmore real than Babylon\u201d. Even at four or five, listening to his father read The Hobbit in draft, he would point out continuity errors. A kinship of spirit, not shared by his brothers, John and Michael, or younger sister, Priscilla, made him \u201cintensely lovable\u201d in his father\u2019s eyes. After his father became professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, Christopher went to the Dragon school there, and later to the Oratory school in Caversham, Berkshire. Three years off with an irregular heartbeat from 1938 coincided with early work on a sequel to The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, which was written partly to entertain him. He encouraged his father\u2019s tendency to hobbit whimsy, only curbed at the urging of the Oxford don CS Lewis. After undertaking an abbreviated undergraduate course at Trinity College, Oxford, at 17, Christopher trained in 1944-45 with the RAF in South Africa. His father sent him the chapters of Frodo and Sam\u2019s journey to Mordor as they were written, including passages that read like messages to soothe or stiffen his spirits. Christopher responded with detailed, constructive critiques. After the war he joined the Lewis\u2013Tolkien circle, the Inklings, taking over readings of The Lord of the Rings in his crisp, sonorous tones. He completed an English degree at Trinity, then took a BLitt on the Old Norse saga of King Heidrek the Wise. A critical edition in 1960 shows, like his father\u2019s work, an aptitude for medieval linguistic analysis and a fascination with the misty border between legend and history. Christopher lectured at Oxford on Old and Middle English and Old Norse from 1954, and produced editions of three Canterbury Tales with Nevill Coghill. But in 1975 he resigned as fellow of New College to focus on his father\u2019s literary legacy, without regrets. \u201cMy father\u2019s invented languages,\u201d he said, \u201care of more interest than the rather well-tramped field of Anglo-Saxon.\u201d But he never neglected the professor\u2019s work on medieval language and literature, editing and publishing JRR\u2019s translations of the Middle English Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo (1975), a collection of his landmark lectures, The Monsters and the Critics (1983); and much later Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary (2014); plus two volumes of narrative poetry on The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan (2009) and The Fall of Arthur (2013). The Letters of JRR Tolkien (1981) was edited with his biographer Humphrey Carpenter. As for Middle-earth, Pictures by JRR Tolkien (1979) and the bluntly titled Unfinished Tales (1980) were followed by The History of Middle-earth, in 12 volumes (1983-96), tracing how his father wrote The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and much else. Christopher\u2019s personal insight was vital in extracting and ordering this from mostly undated manuscripts ranging from calligraphic to catastrophic. Fans include the author Neil Gaiman, who says: \u201cIt feels like Christopher lets us in to his father\u2019s mind: lets us walk the road as JRRT walked it.\u201d Much bigger successes commercially were The Children of H\u00farin (2007), woven from multiple texts, and two books following the evolution of a tale apiece, Beren and L\u00fathien (2017) and The Fall of Gondolin (2018). This, his 24th volume on his father\u2019s work, was consciously his last. For outstanding contribution to literature, in 2016 Christopher received the Bodley medal. Richard Ovenden, Bodley\u2019s librarian, said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of another example where father and son worked in such a way together and then the son carried on the baton.\u201d Christopher remained effective custodian of his father\u2019s papers after lodging them at the Bodleian Library in Oxford in 1979, overseeing access by other scholars, whose work he read closely before publication, offering detailed comments in fax messages that were often acerbic and funny but scrupulously polite. He loathed the computer and vowed never to use email unless it were made illegal not to. Controversies over the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies were an unwelcome intrusion. \u201cFor him, his father\u2019s works started and ended as books,\u201d said David Brawn of his UK publisher, HarperCollins. Only after his retirement from the Tolkien Estate board in 2017 did it agree to work with HarperCollins and Amazon Prime on the upcoming Lord of the Rings prequel TV adaptation. Christopher married the sculptor Faith Faulconbridge in 1951. In 1967 they divorced and he married Baillie Knapheis, nee Klass, who had worked some time before as his father\u2019s secretary. After moving to the south of France in 1975, the couple lived comfortably but modestly first in La Garde-Freinet and then near Aups, giving much of the income from \u201cthe Tolkien business\u201d to charities humanitarian or cultural. He read copiously, mostly classics such as Walter Scott; wrote long and beautifully crafted letters; and enjoyed local wine, good food and convivial conversation with regular visitors from Britain. Terrifically funny, he was a gifted mimic of others\u2019 eccentricities. Despite some minor physical infirmity in his 90s, his prodigious memory remained intact, and he was still in touch with HarperCollins editors weeks before his death. He is survived by Baillie and their children, Adam and Rachel, and by Simon, the son of his first marriage. \u2022 Christopher Reuel Tolkien, editor and scholar, born 21 November 1924; died 16 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "Estimates of the economic cost of a hard Brexit vary, but it is generally agreed that this form of Brexit will be much more economically damaging than one where the UK seeks close alignment with the EU, its biggest trading partner. How does Sajid Javid and the entire Johnson government justify the hard Brexit it so evidently embraces (Brexit: Javid comments on non-alignment with EU prompt warnings of price rises, 18 January)? How will a race to the bottom serve the common good, or benefit business? To which EU regulations does the government take exception, and why? Andrea Leadsom has reduced weekly contact with the UK\u2019s five largest business groups to a monthly meeting with a wider group. This is how our government regards business. It is prepared to sacrifice jobs, and our common interests, on the altar of its ideology. It knows that certain business sectors will face an existential threat because of its policy, and it claims that they have had since 2016 to prepare for it. We need to know who will benefit from this government policy, and how. The government should be continually challenged to justify its approach. It isn\u2019t enough for minsters to tell business there will be no alignment. It needs to say why. It needs to explain how Britain will prosper by turning its back on its major trading partner. It needs to explain how Britain can prosper as a single nation in a world of increasing protectionism. Every MP must act in the nation\u2019s best interests. The government needs to justify the economic and human loss that its approach is bound to deliver. It has not done so, except in the vaguest of terms, and with slogans and soundbites. There are two words that strike terror in the heart of Johnson\u2019s government: honesty and transparency. It\u2019s time for both. Adrian Baskerville Soberton, Hampshire \u2022 Sajid Javid is naive to claim that \u201cwe will not be a rule taker\u201d. In a trade deal with the US, he must expect that it will dictate which standards apply. We should learn from the Canadians\u2019 painful experience of trade deals with the US. Anyone who thinks EU regulations are an assault on the sovereignty of the UK should brace themselves for the \u201cbrave new world\u201d of Johnson\u2019s and Javid\u2019s trade deal with the US. Peter Swann Emeritus professor of industrial economics, University of Nottingham \u2022 What will happen in so many areas of our lives after Brexit is anyone\u2019s guess. A gentle transition so we all end up wondering what all the fuss was about, or chaos on the roads with trucks queuing for hours and indecision and panic in boardrooms across the land. My confusion was only confounded by the chancellor\u2019s statement that we will no longer be aligned with EU regulations and standards after Brexit. A big question for many of us is what EU regulations are to be retained? Will we be inundated with US chlorine-soaked chicken? Will we have to search labels for the dreaded phrase \u201cgenetically modified\u201d? Will we adhere to the EU regulations on climate change and workers\u2019 rights? According to the House of Commons library, the EU Withdrawal Act means that \u201cIn practice the UK is retaining EU regulations, decisions and tertiary legislation and elements of the EEA agreement (as they existed on exit day).\u201d My understanding is that parliament will, in due course, consider which of the EU regulations and laws should become UK domestic law. So it seems that we must wait to see the result of deliberations in parliament before we know the true implications of leaving the EU. Only time will tell. Eileen Peck Benfleet, Essex \u2022 Sajid Javid insists that there will be short-term problems but the UK will be in a better position in the long term if we exclude any alignment with the EU after Brexit. Sadly, people eat food and use medicines in the short term. When people lose their jobs, telling them the UK will be better off in the long term is not helpful when the ensuing poverty means they are no longer able to put food on the table. Where will the jobs come from if we cannot access the market that accounts for over 40% of our trade? How far away is the long term? How do we survive the short term while waiting to arrive at the long term? We are heading towards the economic buffers just as there is a real prospect of a worldwide recession. John Cookson Bournemouth \u2022 There are those of us who remember the moment when Britain was allowed to join the common market, after several times being refused, and who have seen the many improvements to the poorer parts of the country that membership of the EU has made possible. While we now accept that it is generally believed the country\u2019s future lies outside the EU, we can hardly see relations with the EU as a war, nor leaving it as a victory. The news that there were plans to celebrate the 31 January with the ringing of church bells (Vicars reject drive to toll bells for Brexit, 16 January), plus the minting of coins and fireworks \u2013 as though it were an event similar to the defeat of the Armada, Trafalgar or the end of the second world war \u2013 must forcibly lead us to the conclusion that the British people\u2019s famous sense of humour is working overtime, or that the country is in need of psychiatric help.

She got up after a meal and announced: \u201cI\u2019ll just go and wash up\u201d, to be met with a chorus of \u201cNo, no \u2013 please sit down, we\u2019ll do all that.\u201d Peter Roland Bognor Regis, West Sussex \u2022 On eating an ice-cream sundae, I asked my companion if he would like my cherry. I quickly learned this was not an appropriate offer (he seemed to think it likely though). Theresa Graham Clevedon, North Somerset \u2022 Marika Sherwood (Letters, 14 January) is correct that Peter Fryer\u2019s book Staying Power should be available in all school libraries. However, more urgently, libraries should be available in all schools. Richard Boon London \u2022 Lily Kuo reports many possible reasons for China\u2019s declining birthrate (Report, 18 January), but does not mention the millions of \u201cmissing women\u201d as a result of selective abortions and female infanticide. Andy and Caroline Dearden York \u2022 In view of the state of politics worldwide, it seems entirely appropriate that we are entering the Chinese year of the rat. Suellen Pedley Faringdon, Oxfordshire \u2022 My husband will be 89 in July and I will be 74 in August. We have just booked a cruise to the Azores and Iceland for 2022.

It read like armageddon. CNN founder Ted Turner handed me the report as my job description. I wasn\u2019t a film-maker \u2013 I began as a photojournalist for NBC, capturing social issues in 70s New York \u2013 but he preferred that I learned to make films than for him to find another producer who understood the environmental crisis we were facing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Captain Planet is a metaphor for international cooperation with a penchant for bad puns and 60s music.

He said: \u201cThat\u2019s your problem.\u201d And my problem it was.</p> <p>We lifted the characters and locations from environmental documentaries I had made with Nick Boxer. The Planeteers and many of the characters were based on real people. The world didn\u2019t need another male macho superhero, so we made Captain Planet the quintessential antihero. He can\u2019t exist without the combined powers of the Planeteers. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, called them together when the degradation of the planet became too dire for her to bear.</p> <p>Each Planeteer controls a power of nature: earth, wind, fire, water \u2013 and heart. Heart is the most important power, as without it there can be no compassion. Captain Planet himself is a metaphor for international cooperation, with a penchant for bad puns and 60s music.

The <a href=\"https://www.figurerealm.com/actionfigure?action=seriesitemlist&amp;id=50\">merchandising</a> was hard for me to stomach, but business does what business does.

      "bodyText": "Barbara Pyle, co-creator/executive producer In 1980, America\u2019s Global 2000 Report to the President took the current trends of the planet \u2013 population pressures, overstretched resources \u2013 and projected them 20 years into the future. It read like armageddon. CNN founder Ted Turner handed me the report as my job description. I wasn\u2019t a film-maker \u2013 I began as a photojournalist for NBC, capturing social issues in 70s New York \u2013 but he preferred that I learned to make films than for him to find another producer who understood the environmental crisis we were facing. Ted called me into his office and said: \u201cCaptain Planet.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir?\u201d I asked. He said: \u201cThat\u2019s your problem.\u201d And my problem it was. We lifted the characters and locations from environmental documentaries I had made with Nick Boxer. The Planeteers and many of the characters were based on real people. The world didn\u2019t need another male macho superhero, so we made Captain Planet the quintessential antihero. He can\u2019t exist without the combined powers of the Planeteers. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, called them together when the degradation of the planet became too dire for her to bear. Each Planeteer controls a power of nature: earth, wind, fire, water \u2013 and heart. Heart is the most important power, as without it there can be no compassion. Captain Planet himself is a metaphor for international cooperation, with a penchant for bad puns and 60s music. Not unlike the UN. Never in our wildest dreams did we think our over-the-top storylines would come true. In one episode, Planeteer Wheeler renounces his powers and visits a future where flooding and food shortages are the new normal. We set it in 2025, but it is already happening. The show became a global phenomenon: people recognised their countries and their neighbours. The merchandising was hard for me to stomach, but business does what business does. Captain Planet\u2019s image was prohibited on single-use products. The action figures were made from plastic scrap and only recycled paper was used. Our goal was to arm a generation with the knowledge to find more sustainable ways of living on the planet. The millennials are living proof that it worked. These adult Planeteers are growing into positions of power, bringing their knowledge to bear to make the changes we need. This work is critical, because today, it\u2019s as if the show\u2019s eco-villains have come to life. Opposing them are legions of inspired people worldwide, marching to combat the climate crisis. However, we are almost at the point of no return. The fate of our species \u2013 and all living things \u2013 is now truly in our hands. David Coburn, actor who voiced Captain Planet I\u2019d been acting professionally since I was 13, and had a voiceover career by the time of the show\u2019s audition. They asked me to perform a scene where Captain Planet gets washed clean of toxic goo. I made a \u201cdog shake\u201d sound before I said my line, and got the gig. I later discovered I\u2019d replaced Tom Cruise, who had already recorded the first five episodes. Everyone on the voice cast was grateful to be associated with the project, and worked for minimum wage. This seemed amazing to me given some of the A-listers I recorded with: Jeff Goldblum, Meg Ryan, Malcolm McDowell \u2026 Whoopi Goldberg, who voiced Gaia, brought in her Oscar (best supporting actress for Ghost) for us to play with. It\u2019s fun to play a bad guy, and I enjoyed giving Captain Pollution \u2013 Captain Planet\u2019s evil clone \u2013 a valley accent. This wasn\u2019t a swipe at Bill and Ted, or Snake from The Simpsons: it was just the voice that, in the early 90s, represented total irresponsibility. There was one scene where MAL, the evil computer voiced by Tim Curry, gloated about pollution causing stronger storms and melting the Greenlandic ice sheet. The show was very prophetic in many ways, and it\u2019s alarming that the knowledge that fed into it has been ignored for so long. But I do think the conversation is changing now. Younger people are becoming more vocal and doing the job that we adults have neglected. I wrote to Greta Thunberg recently: if she\u2019s reading this, Captain Planet would love to help out.

Take 10 days of holiday between the two May bank holidays (8 and 25 May) to get a continuous 18 days off, including weekends. Make the most of the final long weekend of the summer \u2026 with a week discovering Dublin and its surroundings Plan a holiday in the first week of September and you\u2019ll only need to take four days of annual leave for a full week\u2019s break, as it will include the last summer bank holiday of the year on 31 August. If you live in the Midlands or the north of England, make the most of P&amp;O Ferries\u2019 service from Liverpool for a late summer trip to Dublin. The crossing time is eight and a half hours, there are up to six a day, and you can opt for a daytime or overnight journey. Meals are also included in the price of your ticket. Ireland is known for its festivals, and at the beginning of September, Dublin Fringe clicks into gear. The 16-day event takes over the streets with performances aimed at pushing boundaries and generally making you go: \u201cEh, what was that?\u201d (but in a good way). The city is also an excellent base for day trips, especially if you\u2019re in need of a nature fix before autumn arrives. The moody landscape of the Wicklow mountains will charm any hillwalker, while coastal towns such as Howth offer up clifftop views and seafood pub lunches. Take four days of holiday after the summer bank holiday (31 August) to get nine days off in a row, including weekends. Memorable holidays start with P&amp;O Ferries.

Casting aside the need for Instagram likes and bucket list ticks, slow travel shows there\u2019s more to holidaying than whistle-stop city tours and frantic red-eye flights. Instead, we want to take our time over things: the slow swoosh of a sun-drenched French boat trip; a peaceful cycle through the tulip fields of Holland; a rocky amble around the Irish coast. Recently, the movement has been strengthened even further, as the Swedish concept of <em>flygskam,</em> or \u201cflight shame\u201d \u2013 which encourages people to boycott air travel in order to lower carbon emissions \u2013 takes hold.

      "bodyText": "A British mother who spent years on the run with her two children before being caught after arriving on the island of Jersey in an inflatable boat has been given a suspended jail sentence. The parents of Lauren Etchells, a teacher, were also given the same sentence for helping her navigate the dangerous waters around the Channel Islands in a 4-metre (13ft) dinghy. Etchells broke a court order and fled Canada with her young daughter several years ago, leaving the girl\u2019s other mother distraught and police scrambling to track her down. She fled to Europe with her then partner Marco van der Merwe, her daughter and their newborn child, evading capture for three years despite Interpol issuing a red notice. She travelled to England, France, the Netherlands, the Middle East and possibly to Spain and Portugal, police believe. Etchells, 34, was finally caught after arriving in Jersey with her parents in July 2019 in a dinghy. She appeared alongside her parents, Brian Etchells and Angela Hardy, both 68, for sentencing on Monday at Jersey magistrates court. All three had pleaded guilty to making a false representation under immigration law. In addition, Lauren Etchells was convicted after a four-day trial at the same court in December of two charges of exposing a child to risk of harm. Her parents were convicted of two charges of aiding and abetting exposing a child to risk of harm. Assistant magistrate Peter Harris said: \u201cThese were rather unique circumstances which are unlikely to be repeated. Together they were using Jersey in an attempt to avoid compliance with a Canadian court order.\u201d He acknowledged the efforts made to reduce the risk of harm to the children, and that no harm was actually sustained. But he added: \u201cThe waters around Jersey can be very dangerous. Both children were exposed to a risk of harm.\u201d All three were each given six-month prison sentences, suspended for 12 months, and fined \u00a3500. They must also pay costs of \u00a31,600 between them. Prosecutor Simon Crowder told the court they initially claimed they had come to Jersey from France \u201cwith the intention of having lunch\u201d. Sarah Dale, defending Lauren Etchells, said: \u201cAs you heard throughout the trial, Miss Etchells believed that she and also her parents had taken all relevant precautions to ensure the safety of the children during the crossing. \u201cMiss Etchells\u2019s children are the greatest importance in her life and whatever her motive for making that crossing, she was adamant that she would not do anything at all that she felt put them at risk or endangered them.\u201d The court heard all three defendants were of previous good character. Rui Tremoceiro, defending Brian Etchells and Angela Hardy, echoed Dale\u2019s submissions about the steps taken to ensure the children were safe on the crossing. He added: \u201cThey are good, hardworking, law-abiding people.\u201d",

If we look at inflation expectations, there is little sign that inflation growth is going to spark into life, at least in the first half of this year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Inflation and inflation expectations\">  <iframe title=\"Inflation and inflation expectations \" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/icEie/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Yes, there will likely be an increase in the prices of some vegetables due to the fires, but that will not affect too greatly the underlying inflation growth. And no workers are going to get a better wage rise because the price of lettuces went up for a month or so.</p> <p>We remain stuck with low inflation growth, reflecting the overall low demand in the economy.</p> <p>When we turn to other leading indicators, we see little ahead that is going to change this.</p> <p>The most recent CBA <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/69c0cdd7c01b4acab4ef638678ddc980?s=1\">purchasing managers index</a> (PMI) revealed that \u201cAustralian services business activity shrank further at the end of the year, accompanied by a fall in employment\u201d. It also noted that its composite output index \u201cfell fractionally from 49.7 in November to 49.6 in December, indicating a decline in private sector business activity for a second straight month at the end of the year\u201d.</p> <p>This is also unlikely to be helped by the bushfires, which have already created a hit on consumer confidence.</p> <p>The first weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence survey of this year produced the worst result since September 2015, but also was merely an extension of a downward trend since the end of June:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index\">  <iframe title=\"ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uaHOs/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while the spread between the Australian government five- and two-year bond yields is back in positive territory, the current spread of around 10 basis points is more than half the 20-year average of 24 basis points.</p> <p>Whenever the interest rates being offered for a five-year bond are close to that offered for a two-year bond, it suggests a less than stellar outlook.</p> <p>On the employment front, the department of employment\u2019s leading indicator is finally starting to improve. After declining for 17 straight months, in November and December it began to rise. The problem is the overall indicator remains very much in negative territory:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Department of employment leading indicator of employment\">  <iframe title=\"Department of employment leading indicator of employment\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ClyIn/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And this is at the heart of our slow wages issue.</p> <p>On the trend of the past four years, we need unemployment to fall to around 4% before we are likely to see wages growth of around 3%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Phillips curve - wages and unemployment: 1998-2019\">  <iframe title=\"Phillips curve - wages and unemployment: 1998-2019\" aria-label=\"Scatter Plot\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EyXZg/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>With the current level at 5.2%, that means we need the equivalent of around 170,000 people moving from unemployment into a job. That is a big ask, and not one likely to occur while consumer confidence, PMI and labour-market leading indicators are all at below average levels.</p> <p>It is also not helped given the most recent estimate for non-mining private infrastructure spending for 2019-20 is lower than was predicted at the same time for 2018-19:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"4th estimate of private new capital expenditure - annual growth\">  <iframe title=\"4th estimate of private new capital expenditure - annual growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NhayD/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The upshot is in the face of the totality of this pretty downbeat data, the market still expects the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates, with the main question being whether it will wait until the May budget before doing so.</p> <p>The market, of course, is often wrong.

From 1997 to the end of 2013, the average annual private-sector wage growth for Australians was 3.5%; since then the average has been just 2.1%. For so long have we been stuck in a zone of low wages growth that it is now seven full years since we experienced that previous average level of wages growth. This low growth period has continued for such a length of time that the worry is it has become locked in \u2013 we have now reached a point where expectations of wages growth above long-run inflation levels (2.5%) are considered extreme. What is also a worry is that the year ahead sees little chance of any significant boost in the current levels. The latest Deloitte \u201cBusiness Outlook\u201d report, issued on Monday, suggested that \u201clow inflation (and its close cousin, weak wage gains) are set to linger for longer\u201d. You can understand why they take such a view. If we look at inflation expectations, there is little sign that inflation growth is going to spark into life, at least in the first half of this year: Yes, there will likely be an increase in the prices of some vegetables due to the fires, but that will not affect too greatly the underlying inflation growth. And no workers are going to get a better wage rise because the price of lettuces went up for a month or so. We remain stuck with low inflation growth, reflecting the overall low demand in the economy. When we turn to other leading indicators, we see little ahead that is going to change this. The most recent CBA purchasing managers index (PMI) revealed that \u201cAustralian services business activity shrank further at the end of the year, accompanied by a fall in employment\u201d. It also noted that its composite output index \u201cfell fractionally from 49.7 in November to 49.6 in December, indicating a decline in private sector business activity for a second straight month at the end of the year\u201d. This is also unlikely to be helped by the bushfires, which have already created a hit on consumer confidence. The first weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence survey of this year produced the worst result since September 2015, but also was merely an extension of a downward trend since the end of June: And while the spread between the Australian government five- and two-year bond yields is back in positive territory, the current spread of around 10 basis points is more than half the 20-year average of 24 basis points. Whenever the interest rates being offered for a five-year bond are close to that offered for a two-year bond, it suggests a less than stellar outlook. On the employment front, the department of employment\u2019s leading indicator is finally starting to improve. After declining for 17 straight months, in November and December it began to rise. The problem is the overall indicator remains very much in negative territory: And this is at the heart of our slow wages issue. On the trend of the past four years, we need unemployment to fall to around 4% before we are likely to see wages growth of around 3%: With the current level at 5.2%, that means we need the equivalent of around 170,000 people moving from unemployment into a job. That is a big ask, and not one likely to occur while consumer confidence, PMI and labour-market leading indicators are all at below average levels. It is also not helped given the most recent estimate for non-mining private infrastructure spending for 2019-20 is lower than was predicted at the same time for 2018-19: The upshot is in the face of the totality of this pretty downbeat data, the market still expects the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates, with the main question being whether it will wait until the May budget before doing so. The market, of course, is often wrong. This time last year it was predicting the cash rate would most likely still be 1.5%, rather than the current 0.75%: It is unlikely the market will be as wrong again (unless we have a 0% cash rate in 12 months\u2019 time) but the likelihood that it is too pessimistic seems rather slim. The government is making a bit of noise about new spending in response to the bushfires, but that is likely to be at best enough to counter the economic hit rather than provide a level of stimulus that was needed even before the fires. And unless there is a surprise improvement within the next six months, this most likely means we will have another year of weak wages growth. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

England, the emerging destination of choice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/14/womens-super-league-professional-success-top-clubs-sponsorship-crowds\">has been the most progressive</a> in this sense, with the WSL becoming the first (and so far, only) fully professional women\u2019s league in the world.</p> <p>While other nations cannot yet boast the same league-wide set-up as the WSL, an increasing number of clubs (mostly the \u2018big\u2019 franchises such as Barcelona, Juventus, Lyon, and Bayern Munich) provide professional salaries, facilities and resources for their women\u2019s teams anyway. The result is a mirror of the men\u2019s game: clusters of big clubs floating to the top of their respective leagues season after season.

It\u2019s a fear that\u2019s becoming increasingly acute as the gap between Matildas and non-Matildas widens. Indeed, this fear has driven the W-League to cling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/wide-reaching-plans-for-independent-w-league-revealed\">ever-closer to its partnership with the NWSL in the US</a>, hoping that the prospect of year-round football across two competitions will be enough to attract American talent and retain Australia\u2019s most marketable footballers.</p> <p>But the Matildas\u2019 European exodus is no crisis.

Indeed, Australian men are <em>expected</em> to test themselves abroad, knowing full well that success in the best leagues translates to success for the Socceroos. Australian football\u2019s feedback loop means the enthusiasm generated by the national team filters down the pyramid, sparking the next generation of local talent who develop domestically before stretching their wings elsewhere. It\u2019s sentiment perfectly encapsulated by the competition\u2019s slogan, \u2018Where Heroes Are Made!\u2019</p> <p>But herein lies the key difference: the enthusiasm generated by the Matildas in Australia doesn\u2019t have anywhere to grow. For despite being founded in 2008, the W-League is still a semi-professional competition, and its short season length means it\u2019s become little more than a glorified pre-season for the NWSL. The young players (and fans) whose imaginations have been sparked by the Matildas in recent years still don\u2019t have a professional domestic competition that can nurture them or capture their interest. So while Australia\u2019s top players should always be encouraged to seek opportunities in the best competitions in the world, it should not preclude the W-League from becoming one in its own right; to become to Asia, perhaps, what the WSL is to Europe.</p> <p>Because, for the most part, the current \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 of Matildas don\u2019t want to leave the W-League. As Katrina Gorry told Guardian Australia after Brisbane\u2019s game against Sydney: \u201cWe would love to stay home and play in our home country in front of our family and friends, and get more and more international [players] over \u2013 not just Americans, but from all over the world. I think [a professional women\u2019s league] would be awesome for Australia, especially with the bid coming on. It\u2019s something we should definitely think about doing in the next couple of years.\u201d The onus is now on football\u2019s decision-makers to be ambitious in this space, to catch this heaving wave or else watch it roll onwards without them.</p>",

The millennium drought, the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar all had some impact. But government policies, including the carbon price scheme introduced in partnership with the Greens and independents, had some effect.</p> <p>Emissions reductions stopped under the Coalition about the time the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014.</p> <p>The most recent quarterly greenhouse data found rising pollution in most parts of the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/29/not-something-to-celebrate-drought-and-flood-cause-drop-in-emissions\">were offset by a significant fall in emissions from agriculture due to drought and floods</a> \u2013 a shift that has nothing to do with the government.</p> <h2><strong>Are we \u201cmeeting and beating\u201d our emissions targets, as Scott Morrison says?</strong></h2> <p>This is where we risk getting buried in numbers, but bear with me.</p> <p>It makes sense for governments to set emissions targets. How else to assess whether countries are playing their part in addressing a dramatically escalating global problem?</p> <p>But the most important initial question about a government target, before asking whether it will be met, is whether it addresses the problem faced.</p> <p>As far back as 1990, <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2007/11/16/what-turned-the-liberal-party-off-climate-change-action/\">the Coalition went to an election under Andrew Peacock promising to cut emissions 20% by 2000</a>.</p> <p>But Australia\u2019s first target under the Kyoto protocol, the initial climate pact signed in 1997, allowed it to increase emissions by 8% above 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012.</p> <p>Put another way, the Howard government adopted a goal that allowed it to emit even more heat-trapping gas as part of an agreement under which developed countries were supposed to be cutting pollution.</p> <p>As has been well ventilated, it was no accident that 1990 was chosen as the baseline year.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister says the Coalition is acting on emissions, meeting its targets and doing more than Labor did when in power. What\u2019s the reality? Scott Morrison says Australia\u2019s emissions are coming down. Are they? No. National emissions peaked in 2007, the last year of the Howard government, came down each year under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, and have flatlined since the Coalition was elected in 2013. This graph by Nick Evershed, Guardian Australia\u2019s data and interactive editor, sets it out clearly. The prime minister also says emissions are lower under the Coalition than under the Rudd/Gillard Labor governments. Is that right? (Specifically, that they are on average 50m tonnes less each year under the Coalition than Labor.) This was not correct until last year, when the government released revised historic emissions data (as explained here). Since then, Morrison\u2019s claim is roughly accurate. But it is a meaningless statistic \u2013 a clear case of nonsense framing to mask what is happening. Labor can\u2019t be held responsible for the historically high emissions level it inherited when it came to office, and pollution fell about 14% in the nearly six years Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were prime minister. The ALP can\u2019t take all the credit for the decline. The millennium drought, the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar all had some impact. But government policies, including the carbon price scheme introduced in partnership with the Greens and independents, had some effect. Emissions reductions stopped under the Coalition about the time the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014. The most recent quarterly greenhouse data found rising pollution in most parts of the economy were offset by a significant fall in emissions from agriculture due to drought and floods \u2013 a shift that has nothing to do with the government. Are we \u201cmeeting and beating\u201d our emissions targets, as Scott Morrison says? This is where we risk getting buried in numbers, but bear with me. It makes sense for governments to set emissions targets. How else to assess whether countries are playing their part in addressing a dramatically escalating global problem? But the most important initial question about a government target, before asking whether it will be met, is whether it addresses the problem faced. As far back as 1990, the Coalition went to an election under Andrew Peacock promising to cut emissions 20% by 2000. But Australia\u2019s first target under the Kyoto protocol, the initial climate pact signed in 1997, allowed it to increase emissions by 8% above 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012. Put another way, the Howard government adopted a goal that allowed it to emit even more heat-trapping gas as part of an agreement under which developed countries were supposed to be cutting pollution. As has been well ventilated, it was no accident that 1990 was chosen as the baseline year. There was a hell of a lot of land-clearing and deforestation that year, releasing a stack of carbon dioxide. As the graph above shows, emissions plummeted after 1990, largely because land management in Queensland changed. It meant Australia had set itself a target that allowed it to not just increase pollution by 8%, but dramatically ramp up emissions from fossil fuels and other industry. As this graph shows, that\u2019s what happened. It leaves out emissions of what is known as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) \u2013 which are important, but have been used to muddy the picture \u2013 to show Australian pollution from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture and waste is up about 30% over three decades. So, yes, Australia \u201cbeat\u201d its first Kyoto target. If it had used any year after 1991 as the baseline it wouldn\u2019t have. And fossil fuel emissions \u2013 the primary driver of the climate crisis \u2013 have continued to rise. What about Australia\u2019s 2020 target? Australia\u2019s 2020 target is usually described as a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. As analysts and politicians have pointed out, it is neither meeting nor beating that goal. Government data shows emissions are expected to be just 0.3% lower this year than at the turn of the millennium. Given that, how can Morrison claim the government is beating its target? Again, the wonders of greenhouse accounting. As the ANU economist Stephen Howes explains, Australia\u2019s 2020 target was expressed in more than one way. It was also listed with the UN as a 0.5% cut below 1990 emissions levels \u2013 that baseline year again \u2013 for the average of the years 2013 and 2020. Under that complicated formulation, Australia will technically beat its 2020 target. But it will still be putting the same amount of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere this year as it was 20 years ago. What is expected to happen to Australia\u2019s emissions over the next decade? Not much. The Department of the Environment and Energy projects that pollution will be only 4% lower in 2030 than today. It expects that despite assuming that, due to the falling cost of solar panels and some state-based targets, renewable energy will rise to provide 51% of electricity in the national grid by then (a level that the government opposed as damaging to the economy at last year\u2019s election). If the department projections are correct, it means we will not have made a 5% emissions cut below 2000 levels by 2030, let alone 2020. What does that mean for Australia\u2019s next target under the Paris climate deal? That, despite Morrison claiming it will be met \u201cin a canter\u201d, the government is not on track to meet that either. Before getting to the specifics, it is worth considering what was agreed in Paris, and what it means for Australia. The headline goal of the 2015 pact was to limit global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels and trying to keep it as close to 1.5C as possible. Scientists say that means net zero emissions by about 2050. That this is the implicit target of the Paris agreement is now broadly accepted across the engaged community. More than 70 countries say they are working towards that goal. In Australia, a coalition of groups including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Energy Council issued a statement in December saying the country should adopting policies that put it on a path to net zero national emissions. Every state, whether run by the Coalition or Labor, has a net zero emissions goal. The Morrison government doesn\u2019t. Asked by 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell on Monday about a suggestion federal Labor would recommit to net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said he had \u201cno idea what the Labor party is talking about\u201d. Pressed further, he acknowledged the government promised at last year\u2019s Pacific Islands Forum, where Australia faced sustained criticism from island nations for its support of the coal industry, that it would consider it. But he stressed he was concerned that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be a good thing\u201d and did not think it should be adopted unless it was clear what it would mean for jobs. Australia disregarded scientific advice in setting its initial, medium-term target under the Paris agreement. The then Abbott government was advised by the Climate Change Authority that Australia\u2019s part under a meaningful global pact would be equivalent to a cut of between 45-63% below 2005 levels by 2030. It instead opted for a 26-28% reduction over that timeframe. Again, there was some fudging. Rather than stick with 1990 or 2000, the government opted for a baseline year that \u2013 as emissions were substantially higher in 2005 than in 2000 \u2013 made the proposed cut appear larger. If the government had stuck with 2000 as the baseline, its Paris target would be a 16-18% cut. Department data suggests national emissions are expected to instead be 16% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of the minimum 26% goal. The government plans to make up the difference through another accounting measure: claiming credit for \u201cbeating\u201d or, as it now describes it, \u201coverachieving\u201d its Kyoto targets. Using what are known as Kyoto \u201ccarryover credits\u201d is politically and legally contentious, and opposed by many countries at climate talks. Critics say Australia is still trying to claim credit for a 30-year-old land-clearing loophole that it used against targets that were already far lower than what scientists said was necessary. Is the Morrison government introducing new climate policies? Not so far. The government\u2019s main climate policy remains the $2bn climate solutions fund, under which taxpayers pay businesses and land-owners to limit pollution, mostly by planting or protecting vegetation. Recent evidence suggests it is struggling to find people to sign up. In October, the government quietly commissioned a review of the policy in what was seen as an acknowledgement that it was not delivering what was needed. The Coalition supports some energy projects, particularly pumped hydro storage, and is promising a long-delayed electric vehicle strategy and a \u201ctechnology investment roadmap\u201d. Morrison says Australia is leading the world on renewable energy, and emissions from the electricity sector have fallen while those from other sectors increase. But spending on clean power fell 56% last year, and the government has rejected calls for an overarching policy to drive private investment. How does Australia compare to other countries on emissions? Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of pollution, but has only 0.3% of the global population. It is one of the top 20 emitting nations, releasing more than G7 members Britain, France and Italy. It is also the third biggest exporter of fossil fuels and aims to expand the trade. Several analyses have found that, even by the inadequate standard of international action to address the climate crisis, Australia is performing poorly. Science and policy body Climate Analytics says it is expected to fall even further behind because, unlike comparable countries, it has no plan to introduce an effective national emissions reduction policy.",

The grants scheme also gave $50,000 for solar panels to the exclusive Royal Adelaide Golf Club, one of Australia\u2019s leading courses and a venue that recorded $5.3m revenue last year. The fresh revelations come as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, continues to defend the program, backing the handling of the $100m community sport infrastructure program by the Nationals\u2019 deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, who was sports minister at the time. McKenzie has faced pressure to resign after a blistering auditor general report last week found her office had largely ignored Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations on where the money should go and instead distributed it to further the Coalition\u2019s political interests. On Tuesday, Nationals minister David Littleproud defended McKenzie, saying he was confident successful applicants had all been approved within the guidelines. \u201cShe\u2019s doing a damn good job,\u201d Littleproud said. He said he was confident the program had been administered \u201cwell within the guidelines\u201d. The Applecross Tennis Club received a $500,000 grant just two weeks before the May election. The club is located in the safe Liberal seat of Tangney, held by the party\u2019s former state director, Ben Morton. Morton is a close confidant of Morrison and was seen as a key strategist in the Coalition\u2019s election campaign. The patron of the club is the state Liberal MP for the seat of Bateman, Dean Nalder. According to the tennis club\u2019s website, it is considered one of the \u201cbest located\u201d clubs in Australia, positioned on The Strand on the Swan River foreshore, with \u201cmillion dollar views of the river and city, 12 grass and two synthetic hard courts\u201d. \u201cOur attractive air conditioned clubhouse has amazing views of the Swan River and the city skyline \u2026 [and] a large patio on the river side for all year round enjoyment of the river views.\u201d According to the not-for-profit club, the $500,000 would be used to upgrade fencing and to convert four of its existing grass courts into hard courts. Announcing the grant, Morton said it would support \u201cthe hard-working volunteers and members at the Applecross Tennis Club to upgrade their courts\u201d. \u201cThe new courts will encourage new junior members to join the club and improve the skills of competitive and social players of all ages.\u201d The Applecross club president, Paul Miller, told Guardian Australia the organisation had just \u201cfilled in the forms\u201d as required and he had no concerns about the process. \u201cIt is only a rort if you are not in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is always a winner and a loser in every situation, there is always a left or a right, or a bad or a good or whatever you want to promote.\u201d Miller rejected suggestions that the club was \u201cwealthy\u201d, saying it struggled and relied on volunteers, but did not object to the characterisation the club had links to the Liberal party. \u201cThey [the Liberal party] have done a huge job for us over a lot of years,\u201d he said. The stated aim of the grants program is to increase community participation in sport and physical activity. But the Guardian has found a number of new cases where money has flowed to relatively wealthy golf clubs for projects that had questionable links to boosting community participation. The government awarded $190,000 to the Tea Tree Gully Golf Club, a picturesque course at the foot of the Adelaide Hills. The club\u2019s 2018 annual report says it planned to use the $190,000 to build a new foyer and install an access lift. The upgrades were, in part, designed to attract more functions, including weddings, which the club saw as key to its financial success. \u201cThe club is pursuing federal government grant funds to assist with a foyer upgrade and access lift installation,\u201d the 2018 annual report said. \u201cThe work is identified as a further key necessity in providing comfortable access to its members and assisting the club to attract functions/events and weddings. There have been too many occasions in recent years where prospective clients have declined to use the club\u2019s facilities due to inadequate access being available to persons with disabilities.\u201d In announcing its success in obtaining the grant last year, the club said the lift was primarily designed to \u201cimprove key services for people with disability, those with limited mobility, the elderly and members who use the club weekly to access facilities provided on the first floor, thus ensuring compliance with relevant disability and anti-discrimination legislation\u201d. Its general manager Dean Stanton said the income the club derived from functions helped to increase sporting participation, particularly for juniors. He said the club also organised and sponsored many community groups and charities and that federal and state MPs were well aware of the club\u2019s charitable contributions. The club is located in the safe Labor seat of Makin, held by Tony Zappia. The exclusive Royal Adelaide Golf Club also received $50,000 through the grant scheme. The money was used as part-payment for solar panels. The Royal Adelaide Golf Club is a wealthy and exclusive course that only allows members to play, and at a significant cost. Entrance fees range between $2,475 and $8,250 and annual subscriptions cost $1,264 to $4,339. The course is ranked as one of Australia\u2019s best and its patron is the South Australian governor, Hieu Van Le. Financial documents reveal $5.3m revenue in 2019 and an operating surplus of $323,000. The club\u2019s general manger, Andrew Gay, said the money saved on the solar panels would be used to help boost community participation. \u201cThe funds we saved on this installation are being directed towards our Junior and female development programs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese programs are open to the community if they wish to learn how to play the game.\u201d \u201cLike all other clubs we completed the lengthy application process outlining all the required items.\u201d The club is located in the seat of Hindmarsh, which Labor\u2019s Mark Butler retained at last year\u2019s election. Both the golf clubs are registered not-for-profits, making them eligible for the grants. The audit found that McKenzie\u2019s office ran a \u201cparallel assessment\u201d to that undertaken by Sports Australia, leading to hundreds of projects that were deemed to be more meritorious missing out in favour of those in Coalition \u201ctarget seats\u201d. Morrison has said the federal government will \u201cclarify\u201d legal issues raised in the audit questioning whether McKenzie had the legal authority to pay out the $100m in grants. Josh Wilson, the Labor MP for the seat of Fremantle where the Fremantle Tennis Club unsuccessfully applied for one of the grants, said the audit had found the \u201cgame was fixed\u201d from the start. \u201cI wish every sporting club well, but if we have a situation where decisions are being made through some kind of political patronage or overwhelmingly guided by partisan political considerations, then that is a kick in the guts to the hundreds of clubs Australia-wide that put dozens of hours into \u2026 what they would expect to be a fair process.\u201d",

They\u2019d been running on adrenaline for weeks, sleeping just four hours a night, protecting their home and orchard from wildfires encroaching from three directions while watching their paddocks burn.</p> <p>At one point, after preparing and then waiting for the fires, Baguley says, \u201cI just felt incredibly empty\u201d. He was also worried, because he had told his wife they could defend themselves. \u201cSo that was weighing on me because I was thinking, what if I\u2019m wrong? What if we both end up dead? What if she gets injured and basically it was my fault because I was the one who said we can do this?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/17/grief-frustration-guilt-the-bushfires-show-the-far-reaching-mental-health-impacts-of-climate-change\">Grief, frustration, guilt: the bushfires show the far-reaching mental health impacts of climate change | Fiona Charlson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They\u2019ve been comparatively lucky. People just a few kilometres down the road came closer to losing everything. \u201cThey survived but they lost a lot more and right at the last minute they thought they were going to die, they thought it was all over, and they just ended up holding each other in a corner while their [property] blows up.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, at least 28 people have died, more than 2,000 homes have gone up in flames and millions are spluttering on smoke fumes in Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/25/factcheck-why-australias-monster-2019-bushfires-are-unprecedented\">worst bushfire season</a> on record. Apart from physical losses, traumatic events such as bushfires can <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/bushfires-and-mental-health/\">impact</a> people\u2019s mental health, from common reactions such as shock, overwhelm, inability to focus or plan ahead, feeling tearful and obsessively replaying the event to serious long-term problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p> <p>There are several ways to tackle this.</p> <h2><strong>Community support</strong></h2> <p>In the short term, community and family support are most important, Prof <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/ian-hickie.html\">Ian Hickie</a> from the University of Sydney says. \u201cThe more communities can stay together, function together and resume their normal lives as quickly as possible and support each other, that\u2019s the main way to reduce the psychological impacts,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSo in the immediate term what\u2019s really important is supporting communities practically through infrastructure, like housing and accommodation and basic services, and then longer-term through support for employment, their businesses and schools so they can resume their normal community function. In certain communities it will be a sporting group, in others it\u2019ll be a church or wildlife sanctuary or some other thing to reconstruct their lives.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s vital to support existing services, Hickie adds, because sending in new charities, services and professionals who aren\u2019t part of the local fabric can make things worse. Community connections and local services help people retain a sense of normality \u2013 even starting small, like having a cup of tea with a neighbour, says Prof <a href=\"https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/deborah.turnbull\">Deborah Turnbull</a> from the University of Adelaide. Indeed, the Baguleys found comfort taking time out amid the chaos to do simple things like read a book or watch a DVD, even if just for half an hour.</p> <h2><strong>Be aware</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/summary/prevalence-and-policies\">Nearly half</a> of Australians suffer a mental health disorder at some stage in their lives and are potentially most vulnerable to bushfire trauma. However, Turnbull notes, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16255836\">survey of more than 2,000 young adults</a> after Black Saturday found their experience of the devastating fires was a greater predictor of their distress.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to be aware of your emotions, she says. That might be feeling scared, anxious, or even terrified. Then, \u201cthink through what triggers those kinds of feelings and try and manage it\u201d. She suggests \u201csome really simple techniques like just being aware of your body and how relaxed or otherwise you feel, doing some really simple breathing techniques and just giving yourself some really caring self-talk.\u201d</p> <p>Hickie stresses that no one really knows how they are going to respond, and warns that people shouldn\u2019t think they\u2019re weak if they feel anxious or fearful, a big problem with many males and first responders who believe they must be strong and resilient.</p> <p>Organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/bushfires-and-mental-health/\">Beyond Blue</a> and the APS offer online resources to help people identify and understand their emotions and possible solutions, both <a href=\"https://www.psychology.org.au/getmedia/82397cc9-63c1-4f8c-866c-db0c378b05ea/Psychological-preparedness-bushfires.pdf\">during</a> and after a <a href=\"https://www.psychology.org.au/for-the-public/Psychology-topics/Disasters/Bushfires/Recovering-from-bushfires\">crisis</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Problem solve</strong></h2> <p>Problem solving can be very helpful, identifying any feelings or challenges and breaking them down to small component parts and working out if there\u2019s a solution. Thousands of people in affected areas are faced with staying indoors, for instance, to avoid toxic smoke inhalation, which could be particularly difficult for people who have dogs or children or use outdoor exercise as a coping mechanism.

      "bodyText": "While Darren Baguley was stuffing the turkey on Christmas Day, his wife, Shireen, was putting out spot fires on their Nullo Mountain property in New South Wales. They\u2019d been running on adrenaline for weeks, sleeping just four hours a night, protecting their home and orchard from wildfires encroaching from three directions while watching their paddocks burn. At one point, after preparing and then waiting for the fires, Baguley says, \u201cI just felt incredibly empty\u201d. He was also worried, because he had told his wife they could defend themselves. \u201cSo that was weighing on me because I was thinking, what if I\u2019m wrong? What if we both end up dead? What if she gets injured and basically it was my fault because I was the one who said we can do this?\u201d They\u2019ve been comparatively lucky. People just a few kilometres down the road came closer to losing everything. \u201cThey survived but they lost a lot more and right at the last minute they thought they were going to die, they thought it was all over, and they just ended up holding each other in a corner while their [property] blows up.\u201d Meanwhile, at least 28 people have died, more than 2,000 homes have gone up in flames and millions are spluttering on smoke fumes in Australia\u2019s worst bushfire season on record. Apart from physical losses, traumatic events such as bushfires can impact people\u2019s mental health, from common reactions such as shock, overwhelm, inability to focus or plan ahead, feeling tearful and obsessively replaying the event to serious long-term problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There are several ways to tackle this. Community support In the short term, community and family support are most important, Prof Ian Hickie from the University of Sydney says. \u201cThe more communities can stay together, function together and resume their normal lives as quickly as possible and support each other, that\u2019s the main way to reduce the psychological impacts,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in the immediate term what\u2019s really important is supporting communities practically through infrastructure, like housing and accommodation and basic services, and then longer-term through support for employment, their businesses and schools so they can resume their normal community function. In certain communities it will be a sporting group, in others it\u2019ll be a church or wildlife sanctuary or some other thing to reconstruct their lives.\u201d It\u2019s vital to support existing services, Hickie adds, because sending in new charities, services and professionals who aren\u2019t part of the local fabric can make things worse. Community connections and local services help people retain a sense of normality \u2013 even starting small, like having a cup of tea with a neighbour, says Prof Deborah Turnbull from the University of Adelaide. Indeed, the Baguleys found comfort taking time out amid the chaos to do simple things like read a book or watch a DVD, even if just for half an hour. Be aware Nearly half of Australians suffer a mental health disorder at some stage in their lives and are potentially most vulnerable to bushfire trauma. However, Turnbull notes, a survey of more than 2,000 young adults after Black Saturday found their experience of the devastating fires was a greater predictor of their distress. It\u2019s important to be aware of your emotions, she says. That might be feeling scared, anxious, or even terrified. Then, \u201cthink through what triggers those kinds of feelings and try and manage it\u201d. She suggests \u201csome really simple techniques like just being aware of your body and how relaxed or otherwise you feel, doing some really simple breathing techniques and just giving yourself some really caring self-talk.\u201d Hickie stresses that no one really knows how they are going to respond, and warns that people shouldn\u2019t think they\u2019re weak if they feel anxious or fearful, a big problem with many males and first responders who believe they must be strong and resilient. Organisations such as Beyond Blue and the APS offer online resources to help people identify and understand their emotions and possible solutions, both during and after a crisis. Problem solve Problem solving can be very helpful, identifying any feelings or challenges and breaking them down to small component parts and working out if there\u2019s a solution. Thousands of people in affected areas are faced with staying indoors, for instance, to avoid toxic smoke inhalation, which could be particularly difficult for people who have dogs or children or use outdoor exercise as a coping mechanism. Turnbull suggests researching alternative activities that would be safe. \u201cThis might also give people back a sense of control,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is important for mental health and wellbeing.\u201d Don\u2019t forget nutrition Burgeoning research supports links between mental health, nutrition and diet. Adding to this, two clinical trials showed that micronutrient supplementation helped buffer the emotional after-effects of natural disasters \u2013 the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand and Alberta floods in Canada. Looking ahead Disasters such as Ash Wednesday have shown that serious mental health issues arising from traumatic events don\u2019t emerge for two or three years, says Prof Sandy McFarlane, a trauma expert from the University of Adelaide. Extremely intense events, like losing a home or witnessing someone lose their life, can be particularly overwhelming. \u201cIf you think about a computer, if you have too many programs open, you\u2019ve got too much information going in, the computer freezes,\u201d McFarlane says. \u201cThe human brain is very much the same, so essentially these events become unprocessed. And those memories sit in people\u2019s mind in an undigested manner and are constantly triggered by subtle things like smell, heat, sounds.\u201d Becoming aware of those unconscious triggers, then focusing on previous moments associated with feeling safe instead, can be a helpful coping mechanism. Seeking support is important, even starting with a trusted GP for physical symptoms, which often go hand-in-hand with conditions like depression, anxiety and PTSD. Medicare has a Better Access initiative, says Turnbull, that can help people access appropriately trained social workers and occupational therapists, which can be helpful for those who aren\u2019t ready or able to see a psychologist or psychiatrist. Apps and online resources are available too, like ifarmwell for farmers impacted by crises and an online Beyond Blue forum dedicated to coping with bushfires. For the rest of us Few Australians are immune to feelings of worry or despair from the bushfires and associated horrors, recognised as eco-anxiety. Turnbull says it can help to understand this response is normal, to be aware of the thoughts that are fuelling those emotions, and managing the feelings and thoughts with simple breathing and self-talk. It might also help to take a break from news and social media, and ultimately many say the best antidote is action.",

      "bodyText": "The closely watched case of Meng Wanzhou is due to start in Vancouver as the Huawei executive battles extradition amid growing tensions between Canada and China. The hearings, scheduled to begin on Monday and last five days at British Columbia\u2019s supreme court, will centre on \u201cdouble criminality\u201d \u2013 the legal notion that Meng\u2019s extradition to the US requires her alleged actions also be considered a crime in Canada. It marks the first phase in what is likely to be a protracted battle: Meng\u2019s team is also expected to argue US and Canadian authorities conspired against her, breaching her rights when Canadian border guards detained her for hours prior to her arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in December 2018 on suspicion of fraud and breaching US sanctions on Iran. Government lawyers in Canada allege Meng lied about her company\u2019s dealings with Iran when speaking to prospective investors at large banks, potentially putting them at risk of breaching the US sanctions. This deception, they say, amounts to fraud. The defence counters that Canada does not have the same sanctions against Iran, so any banks working with Meng would not have fallen foul of restrictions. If Justice Heather Holmes sides with the government, it increases the likelihood Meng could be sent to the US to face bank fraud and wire fraud charges. But if her lawyers are able to argue the threshold of double criminality has not been met, the extradition proceedings would in effect end. The Huawei chief financial officer was arrested more than a year ago as she travelled from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina, stopping briefly in Vancouver. Meng is currently living in Vancouver, under house arrest after securing a $10m bail. She is required to wear a GPS tracking device and has a curfew, but is able to travel freely around the city. Hours before the start of the hearings, China condemned the proceedings, highlighting tense relations between the two countries. \u201cWe urge the Canadian government again to take China\u2019s stance and concerns seriously, take tangible action to correct its mistakes, release Ms Meng without further delay and ensure her safe return to China,\u201d said foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang. Meng\u2019s court appearance comes amid growing concern in Canada over the detention of two Canadians in China, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were charged with espionage in May. The pair were arrested days after Canada executed the warrant for Meng \u2013 a move largely seen as retributive from China. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has long demanded the two be released, but the two remain in detention.",

And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 David Madden, who wins a copy of Death is a Laff Riot, by Fiver reader Robi Polgar. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS A charge against Stevenage first-team coach Mark Sampson that he made a racist remark towards a former colleague has been found not proven. Village Manchester FC, a team mainly comprised of gay players, has formally complained to the FA after alleging players were subjected to \u201ctoxic\u201d homophobic abuse by Chadderton Park Firsts at a match on 11 January. J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool fans can sing about winning the title all they want, but he isn\u2019t thinking about drinking Tin and getting wobbly on an open-top bus yet. \u201cThey are allowed to dream and sing whatever they want, and as long as they do their job in the moment we play, all fine,\u201d he grinned. \u201cBut we will not be part of that party yet.\u201d \u201cOn the pitch or not, Man United fans don\u2019t get much bigger than me. You best believe I\u2019ll be involved in team meetings, team huddles and team sessions\u201d \u2013 Marcus Rashford isn\u2019t going to let his two-month absence with back-knack stop him from becoming the best north-west vibes man since Bez shook his maracas at Elland Road with the Happy Mondays in 1991. Gary Neville, meanwhile, isn\u2019t best pleased with Ed Woodward. Remember Victor Moses? Apparently he\u2019s still a Chelsea player and closing on a loan move to Inter. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously coming back from his loan [at Fenerbahce] with a view to going elsewhere, and those talks are ongoing,\u201d said Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard, who also fancies a bit of Edinson Cavani. Who wouldn\u2019t? Pep Guardiola doesn\u2019t want fans to have miracle-working expectations of Aymeric Laporte when he plugs him back into Manchester City\u2019s dodgy defence. \u201cWe cannot expect Aymeric is going to solve all of the problems,\u201d he sniffed. Eddie Howe believes struggling Bournemouth need to adopt a siege mentality to stay up. \u201cWe have to become very internal,\u201d he roared, stacking furniture up against the stadium entrance. \u201cWe have to use all the negativity around us in a positive way to show we\u2019re still fighting.\u201d And Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has confirmed what all Arsenal fans think: the Emirates is a soulless place. \u201cWe built a new stadium but never found our soul \u2013 we left our soul at Highbury,\u201d sniffed the former Gunners boss. STILL WANT MORE? Rachel Brown-Finnis reviews the latest round of WSL games, including Chelsea\u2019s stonking 4-1 win at champions Arsenal. Yes, twiddling around on various social media disgraces and playing Fifa can harm footballers\u2019 decision-making, writes Sean Ingle. Sid Lowe was given a glimpse of the Seti\u00e9n manifesto during Barcelona\u2019s win over Granada \u2013 and it looked like a lot of passes.

Of Rebecca Long-Bailey, readers said she closely represents the socialist side of the party, whereas supporters of Jess Phillips said they felt she has \u2018a depth of experience in dealing with social injustices first-hand\u2019.</p> \n<p>Others said Lisa Nandy \u2018gives hope that the party could move away from the hard left\u2019 and Emily Thornberry\u2019s \u2018voting record is excellent and she\u2019s a great speaker\u2019.</p> \n<p>Some readers also expressed dislike for all candidates and said they were voting for the least worst option.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Starmer is the only candidate with the charisma to lead the party\u2019</h2> \n<p>I think Starmer is the only candidate with the charisma and proven track record to lead the party. His work as a lawyer often meant working pro bono for those who couldn\u2019t afford fees, yet he was prepared to do this instead of furthering his own income. He has integrity and although untested in the glare of press publicity I think he has the will and determination to state his case clearly.</p> \n<p>He can be relied upon to refine the last election offer whilst keeping to the basic premise of ensuring needs are met for all. Much of the last manifesto was excellent, it just wasn\u2019t delivered very well. My views coincide with Keir Starmer\u2019s and I can see positives in many of the other candidates, especially the outspoken Jess Phillips, but my choice is made. <strong>Dave Evans, 67, retired headteacher, Scarborough</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Long-Bailey is my preferred candidate based on policy\u2019</h2> \n<p>Cards on the table, I\u2019m a Corbyn supporter. I\u2019m not especially factional, but he did inspire me to join the party and donate to it. I\u2019ll be voting for my preferred candidate based on policy. In truth I haven\u2019t completely made up my mind yet but it\u2019ll likely be Rebecca Long-Bailey. Her support for McDonnell\u2019s transformative economic policies, a green new deal, constitutional changes to the structure of the UK itself (abolishing the House of Lords is a start), are all things that I support.</p> \n<p>My concern is she needs to really shed this falsehood that she\u2019s the \u201cCorbyn continuity candidate\u201d. She is her own woman and she no doubt has her own ideas, and she needs to get that across. I think she\u2019s the best of the bunch considering her values match my own and I don\u2019t consider any of the candidates to be particularly charismatic or statesmenlike. I only hope that although Johnson won this argument, he has not won the overall debate and we can keep fighting for the same principles and positive alternative outlook that did us proud in 2017. <strong>Thomas, 28, researcher, Lille, France</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Starmer is the best chance of convincing people to vote\u2019</h2> \n<p>Starmer is a plausible leader who stands the best chance of convincing people to vote Labour next time who didn\u2019t in 2019 and he is non-factional, which he has shown by his loyalty to Corbyn. I think he is a good candidate to bring the party together. He\u2019s also a real committed socialist, as his track record shows, and has actually helped workers with legal advice since the 80s. I also think he is very smart and forensically intelligent, and I trust him on strategy and policy. <strong>Emma, Brighton</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018I will be voting for Phillips due to her promise to make parliament better reflect votes cast\u2019</h2> \n<p>I will be voting for Jess Phillips due to her promise to make parliament better reflect votes cast. This country needs proportional representation, otherwise how can we call ourselves a true democracy? This is the most important issue for me, otherwise I would vote for Keir Starmer. He has hinted that he supports PR but if he committed fully then I would vote for him over Jess Phillips. <strong>Lawrie, 18, student, Hastings</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Both Phillips and Starmer have a depth of experience in dealing with social injustices\u2019</h2> \n<p>Jess Phillips or Sir Keir Starmer are realistically the only candidates with enough personality to rival Johnson, bombastic and erudite, respectively. It is a shame they do not take a leaf out of John Prescott\u2019s book in the 1994 leadership race and both go for the deputy position as well, as I see the two of them as an excellent pairing. Each have a depth of experience in dealing with social injustices first-hand, rather than enacting change at arms-length, protesting broad, often non-domestic issues, irrelevant to those they claim to represent, and end up giving the party a \u2018protest vote\u2019 visage as Corbyn has done. <strong>Ash, 23, software engineer, Nottingham</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018I think Thornberry can appeal to voters across the spectrum\u2019</h2> \n<p>Emily Thornberry\u2019s voting record is excellent and she\u2019s a great speaker. She has fought for the working class throughout her entire career as an MP. I think she can appeal to voters across the entire spectrum which is absolutely essential. While sticking to many of Corbyn\u2019s policies is important (as they\u2019re overwhelmingly popular in blind votes) we need someone with broad appeal that the media won\u2019t paint as a rabid anti-English communist (which is completely untrue of Corbyn, but is the reason he became unelectable). <strong>Natasha, 27, works in marketing, Newcastle</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018I think Starmer will win but will never be able to form a majority government\u2019</h2> \n<p>I doubt whether the Labour party will ever win a majority in England again. It is dead in Scotland and will probably end up being inched out of its hegemony in Wales but still be the largest party here by a whisker. I think Starmer will win but will never be able to form a majority government. He will have to accept that the only way forward is by working within a broad alliance with other parties. It\u2019s not that I support him just that he may be the most pragmatic candidate left. It\u2019s a pity that Clive Lewis didn\u2019t get very far. <strong>Ioan Talfryn, 62, run a company teaching Welsh to adults, Caernarfon</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Phillips can connect with people on an emotional level\u2019</h2> \n<p>Whether we like it or not, it\u2019s essential to have a leader who can connect with people on an emotional level. Jess Phillips seems to me to be the only candidate who can do that effectively. She seems to understand how people outside of the Westminster bubble view politics and what is important to them. Her message of needing to see those with whom we disagree as human beings is much needed and gives me hope. I see can her being a strong, compassionate leader who is really willing to listen. Put simply, she is the only one who is inspiring! Another reason for voting for her is to see an example of leadership that is not just white and male \u2013 it\u2019s high time we started widening our parameters in this respect. <strong>Imogen, 46, school chaplain, London</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Starmer cares about those less fortunate than himself\u2019</h2> \n<p>To me Starmer is a socialist in the true meaning of the word. He cares about people less fortunate than himself and demonstrated this by working as a human rights lawyer fighting injustice. Momentum has too strong a hold over the party and this hold must be relinquished. Too far to the left hasn\u2019t worked and we must present middle-of-the-road policies but with a socialist viewpoint. Labour was not trusted at the last election but in Starmer we have an excellent candidate. If elected the whole PLP must get behind him and show complete unity. We can then, and only then, move forward. <strong>Carol Palmer, 77, retired nurse, Troon, Scotland</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Nandy gives hope that the party could move away from the hard left\u2019</h2> \n<p>Lisa Nandy is the only one who fully acknowledges the disaster of Corbyn and his comrades and is willing to say so. She gives hope that the party could move away from the hard left and that she will actually listen to the people of this country. I\u2019ve had enough of the London, liberal elite telling everyone they\u2019re morally superior. The last few years has seen a rise in bullying, fear and racism. The Labour party under Corbyn has been a stain on this country.</p> \n<p>I believe in a government that works for all sections of society, as we are all connected, and that supports businesses and encourages entrepreneurship whilst policing the worst of capitalism. I want a party that provides high quality education for all and incentivises teachers to go into challenging schools. Society will always benefit if our children believe there is a future for them. An end to virtue signalling is also called for if Labour is to connect to its traditional voters. <strong>Julie, 59, self-employed, Sheffield</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Starmer will stop the Tories winning power in 2024\u2019</h2> \n<p>I\u2019m a former Labour member, who left because of Corbyn, and now support the Lib Dems. I can\u2019t vote but Starmer is by far the most capable candidate, as a human rights lawyer and ex DPP. Starmer is the only one who will deliver a strong opposition, holding Johnson and the Tories to account. As Labour leader, Starmer will stop the Tories winning power in 2024. I can see he\u2019s able to compromise and the possibility of a truly progressive government, probably with a Labour/Liberal coalition and introduction of PR which will ensure the Tories never win power ever again. Bring it on! <strong>Liz, 56, Wiltshire</strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Nandy or Starmer are the best candidates to beat Johnson in a future election\u2019</h2> \n<p>Perhaps a little unusually for a Guardian reader, I\u2019m not a Labour supporter. I usually align with the Lib Dems but given how unlikely they are to form a government any time soon, I sway to whoever happens to be the most centrist party. The question the Labour party voters need to ask themselves is not who aligns closest with my values but who is most likely to beat Boris. The left of the Labour party has been consistently rejected by Britain.</p> \n<p>In simple terms they need to reject Long-Bailey as quickly as possible. Putting LB in charge of the Labour party all but guarantees BJ another election win. Thornberry represents a wasted vote and while I like Phillips, she\u2019s not PM material. I believe Nandy or Starmer are the candidates best placed to beat BJ in a future election. I urge Labour members to cast your vote for who you believe could beat Boris, not who represents your values. Blair gave the Labour left an opportunity to influence government decisions, Corbyn did not give you the same opportunity. <strong>Owen, 28, self-employed, Northern Ireland</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Romantic \u201carrangements\u201d. Age: As old as romance itself. Appearance: George Orwell\u2019s wife letting him get off with his ex-girlfriend. That\u2019s grim. What is? The idea of a sexually aroused Orwell? Yes! Look, just because you happen to equate Orwell with damp, mould and misery doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t enjoy getting his leg over sometimes. Oh God. Stop! I can\u2019t stop, because Orwell\u2019s sex life is in the news, which makes it relevant. For heaven\u2019s sake, why? Because romantic letters that Orwell wrote to women outside of his marriage to Eileen O\u2019Shaughnessy have been unearthed. One of them was written the day after their wedding. Another suggests that he should have sex with the recipient on a biannual basis, with the approval of his wife. Really? It says of O\u2019Shaughnessy: \u201cShe wished I could sleep with you about twice a year, just to keep me happy.\u201d And did he sleep with her? It doesn\u2019t seem likely. Another letter whines: \u201cYou thought you would finally take a lover, and if so I don\u2019t see why it shouldn\u2019t be me.\u201d Not Orwell, too. Pardon? They make him sound \u2026 what\u2019s the word? Creepy. Yes, Orwell sounds creepy. Ah, but there was so much more to these letters than that. They are being hailed as transformational in our understanding of Orwell the man. He wasn\u2019t just pestering women for sex, you see, he was using them as a sounding board for his book ideas. And then pestering them for sex. Yes, but the book ideas. To think, without these letters there might not be a Nineteen Eighty-Four. Oh, I thought Nineteen Eighty-Four existed because Orwell took inspiration from his wife\u2019s poem End of the Century, 1984. O\u2019Shaughnessy wrote that? She sounds great, doesn\u2019t she? Indeed. Anyway, thank goodness these sort of arrangements are behind us now. Don\u2019t speak too soon. Why? You know what the hot horticultural trend is? Pampas grass. Is it? Apparently so. Millennials see it as an environmentally conscious alternative to cut flowers. Stacey Dooley is reportedly a big fan. But doesn\u2019t planting pampas grass in your front garden mean \u2026 That you are into swinging? That is correct. It is why no one has grown pampas grass for the past 40 years. But it is back. Does that mean that all millennials are swingers? No. If only Orwell were around to write us a horny letter explaining as much.

      "body": "<p>The saxophonist Jimmy Heath, who has died aged 93, flew the flag for bebop \u2013 that hyperactive, melodically cryptic, highwire-act of a jazz idiom \u2013 with grace, wit and originality throughout a seven-decade career. </p> <p>He worked with jazz modernisers as eminent as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miles-davis\" title=\"\">Miles Davis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-coltrane\" title=\"\">John Coltrane</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dizzy-gillespie\" title=\"\">Dizzy Gillespie</a>, and became both a sought-after saxophone improviser and an ingenious big-ensemble composer. He also helped to pioneer the breakthroughs in jazz education that would eventually put a marginalised music into the mainstream of college and conservatoire life.</p> <p>Heath was the middle member of a celebrated jazz family, and he often performed with his brothers, the bassist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/30/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">Percy</a> (a cornerstone of the Modern Jazz Quartet) and the drummer Albert \u201cTootie\u201d Heath. An elegant saxophonist with a light, clarinettish tone, Heath could nevertheless approach tunes with the muscular vigour of a bebop heavyweight such as Dexter Gordon, and the influence of the free-jazz innovator Coltrane could even be distantly audible too.</p> <p>In the jazz circles of late 1940s Philadelphia, Heath was nicknamed Little Bird for his small stature and his roots in the bebop-defining sax methods of Charlie \u201cBird\u201d Parker. He was a brilliant arranger, working the agile pirouettes, skewed sounds and earthy inflections of jazz into the fabric of complex pieces that fizzed with infectious energy. His own best known compositions, such as CTA, the blues waltz Gemini, Gingerbread Boy and When Sonny Is Blue, became jazz standards, adopted by players including Davis and the Adderley brothers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRe_eLjwJA0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WRe_eLjwJA0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jimmy Heath airs his thoughts</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Heath was born in Philadelphia, began playing the alto saxophone when he was 14, and was making his living with it five years later. His father, Percy Sr, was a car mechanic who played the clarinet in marching bands at weekends and introduced Jimmy to the instrument, and his mother, Arlethia, sang in the local church choir.</p> <p>Rejected for the second world war draft on account of his slightness, Heath toured with the New Orleans bassist and bandleader Nat Towles\u2019s group in 1945-46, but then formed his own local big band in Philadelphia, modelled on the audacious swing-to-bop chemistry of Gillespie\u2019s new orchestra. Heath\u2019s ensemble included several Philly players who were to become stars later, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/27/benny-golson-interview\" title=\"\">Benny Golson</a> and Coltrane.</p> <p>Heath moved to New York at 22, eventually landing a spot alongside Percy Jr in Gillespie\u2019s big band, and also in the trumpeter\u2019s sextet. During 1947-48, the brothers also played in the bebop trumpeter Howard McGhee\u2019s group, appearing with it at the first Festival International de Jazz in Paris.</p> <p>In 1950 Heath switched to tenor sax, and his musical identity quickly acquired a more distinctive strength. From 1952 to 1953 he was working with Davis\u2019s band \u2013 and though later in the decade arranging and composing took up an increasing proportion of his time, he did co-lead a bop-oriented quintet with another trumpet star, Kenny Dorham. The Davis connection was also periodically re-established, with Heath occasionally deputising for Coltrane in the famous first Davis quintet in 1959 and 1960.</p> <p>However, Heath\u2019s progress during the 50s was hampered, like that of a number of his jazz contemporaries at the time, by an addiction to heroin. He spent 1955-59 in the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, following convictions for dealing. He kicked the habit during that period, learning the flute, and smuggling compositions out of the institution that would turn up on jazz recordings of the era, such as the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/20/ethan-hawke-chet-baker-born-to-be-blue-interview\" title=\"\">Chet Baker</a>/Art Pepper cool-bop album Playboys.</p> <p>Probation stipulations following Heath\u2019s release initially stopped him returning to the road, but freelance arranging (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ray Charles</a>, among others) and studio recording and staff-arranging work for the Riverside label restored his profile.</p> <p>Heath was thus in his 30s before he recorded under his own name, and on his debut album The Thumper (1960), which featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/07/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\" title=\"\">Nat Adderley</a> on trumpet, he immediately impressed the jazz world with the warm authority of his composing on such striking tracks as For Minors Only.</p> <p>In his own groups during the 60s, Heath often appeared with his siblings, in ensembles that were sometimes augmented by Nat and Cannonball Adderley, and also by Sun Ra\u2019s saxophonist Pat Patrick. A signature Heath ensemble style began to evolve, built around sonorous, Gil Evans-like low-brass effects, and homages to 30s jazz-orchestral innovators including Jimmie Lunceford.</p> <p>Much of Heath\u2019s most trenchant tenor-sax improvising on disc was also captured in this period, sounding authoritative and surefooted even up against partners including the young trumpet firebrand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/05/obituary-freddie-hubbard\" title=\"\">Freddie Hubbard</a> and the pianist Wynton Kelly on 60s albums that included The Quota and On the Trail.</p> <p>In the following decade Heath worked extensively with the trumpeter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/07/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\" title=\"\">Art Farmer</a> and pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/20/stanley-cowell-no-illusions-review-bruce-williams-steeplechase\" title=\"\">Stanley Cowell</a>, with his brother Al on drums \u2013 his arranging talents continuing to make small bands sound much larger than they really were. Heath\u2019s son, the singer/percussionist James Mtume, appeared with his father\u2019s bands from the late 70s, as did the guitarist Tony Purrone. There continued to be occasional appearances with Gillespie, and after Gillespie\u2019s death in 1993, Heath celebrated his former employer\u2019s music in tribute concerts at such venues as Lincoln Center in New York.</p> <p>Writing and arranging occupied Heath extensively in the 80s, but he did sporadically record for the Muse label. His saxophone playing, full of character as ever, became increasing economical and unusual, with as much being said in the pacing and spaces as any note-rammed stream of jazz virtuosity.</p> <p>In the mid-80s Heath also began expanding the educational work he had begun with the New York jazz-outreach organisation Jazzmobile in 1964. He pioneered a jazz course as a professor at Queens College, City University of New York, remaining in that role until 1998.</p> <p>His big band continued to perform into the 90s \u2013 his composing achievements in that field having included the fine orchestral works Afro-American Suite of Evolution (1975), Smilin\u2019Billy (1976, written with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/11/ornette-coleman\" title=\"\">Ornette Coleman</a>\u2019s drummer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/07/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\" title=\"\">Billy Higgins</a> in mind) and Praise (1994).</p> <p>Heath was nominated for Grammy awards three times, and was presented with the National Endowment for the Arts\u2019 Jazz Masters award in 2003. His autobiography, I Walked With Giants, was published in 2010.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Mona Brown, and their daughter Roslyn; and by James, from his first marriage, seven grandchildren seven great-grandchildren and his brother Albert.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>James Edward Heath, saxophonist, born 25 October 1926; died 19 January 2020</p>",

      "bodyText": "The saxophonist Jimmy Heath, who has died aged 93, flew the flag for bebop \u2013 that hyperactive, melodically cryptic, highwire-act of a jazz idiom \u2013 with grace, wit and originality throughout a seven-decade career. He worked with jazz modernisers as eminent as Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Dizzy Gillespie, and became both a sought-after saxophone improviser and an ingenious big-ensemble composer. He also helped to pioneer the breakthroughs in jazz education that would eventually put a marginalised music into the mainstream of college and conservatoire life. Heath was the middle member of a celebrated jazz family, and he often performed with his brothers, the bassist Percy (a cornerstone of the Modern Jazz Quartet) and the drummer Albert \u201cTootie\u201d Heath. An elegant saxophonist with a light, clarinettish tone, Heath could nevertheless approach tunes with the muscular vigour of a bebop heavyweight such as Dexter Gordon, and the influence of the free-jazz innovator Coltrane could even be distantly audible too. In the jazz circles of late 1940s Philadelphia, Heath was nicknamed Little Bird for his small stature and his roots in the bebop-defining sax methods of Charlie \u201cBird\u201d Parker. He was a brilliant arranger, working the agile pirouettes, skewed sounds and earthy inflections of jazz into the fabric of complex pieces that fizzed with infectious energy. His own best known compositions, such as CTA, the blues waltz Gemini, Gingerbread Boy and When Sonny Is Blue, became jazz standards, adopted by players including Davis and the Adderley brothers. Heath was born in Philadelphia, began playing the alto saxophone when he was 14, and was making his living with it five years later. His father, Percy Sr, was a car mechanic who played the clarinet in marching bands at weekends and introduced Jimmy to the instrument, and his mother, Arlethia, sang in the local church choir. Rejected for the second world war draft on account of his slightness, Heath toured with the New Orleans bassist and bandleader Nat Towles\u2019s group in 1945-46, but then formed his own local big band in Philadelphia, modelled on the audacious swing-to-bop chemistry of Gillespie\u2019s new orchestra. Heath\u2019s ensemble included several Philly players who were to become stars later, including Benny Golson and Coltrane. Heath moved to New York at 22, eventually landing a spot alongside Percy Jr in Gillespie\u2019s big band, and also in the trumpeter\u2019s sextet. During 1947-48, the brothers also played in the bebop trumpeter Howard McGhee\u2019s group, appearing with it at the first Festival International de Jazz in Paris. In 1950 Heath switched to tenor sax, and his musical identity quickly acquired a more distinctive strength. From 1952 to 1953 he was working with Davis\u2019s band \u2013 and though later in the decade arranging and composing took up an increasing proportion of his time, he did co-lead a bop-oriented quintet with another trumpet star, Kenny Dorham. The Davis connection was also periodically re-established, with Heath occasionally deputising for Coltrane in the famous first Davis quintet in 1959 and 1960. However, Heath\u2019s progress during the 50s was hampered, like that of a number of his jazz contemporaries at the time, by an addiction to heroin. He spent 1955-59 in the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, following convictions for dealing. He kicked the habit during that period, learning the flute, and smuggling compositions out of the institution that would turn up on jazz recordings of the era, such as the famous Chet Baker/Art Pepper cool-bop album Playboys. Probation stipulations following Heath\u2019s release initially stopped him returning to the road, but freelance arranging (for Ray Charles, among others) and studio recording and staff-arranging work for the Riverside label restored his profile. Heath was thus in his 30s before he recorded under his own name, and on his debut album The Thumper (1960), which featured Nat Adderley on trumpet, he immediately impressed the jazz world with the warm authority of his composing on such striking tracks as For Minors Only. In his own groups during the 60s, Heath often appeared with his siblings, in ensembles that were sometimes augmented by Nat and Cannonball Adderley, and also by Sun Ra\u2019s saxophonist Pat Patrick. A signature Heath ensemble style began to evolve, built around sonorous, Gil Evans-like low-brass effects, and homages to 30s jazz-orchestral innovators including Jimmie Lunceford. Much of Heath\u2019s most trenchant tenor-sax improvising on disc was also captured in this period, sounding authoritative and surefooted even up against partners including the young trumpet firebrand Freddie Hubbard and the pianist Wynton Kelly on 60s albums that included The Quota and On the Trail. In the following decade Heath worked extensively with the trumpeter Art Farmer and pianist Stanley Cowell, with his brother Al on drums \u2013 his arranging talents continuing to make small bands sound much larger than they really were. Heath\u2019s son, the singer/percussionist James Mtume, appeared with his father\u2019s bands from the late 70s, as did the guitarist Tony Purrone. There continued to be occasional appearances with Gillespie, and after Gillespie\u2019s death in 1993, Heath celebrated his former employer\u2019s music in tribute concerts at such venues as Lincoln Center in New York. Writing and arranging occupied Heath extensively in the 80s, but he did sporadically record for the Muse label. His saxophone playing, full of character as ever, became increasing economical and unusual, with as much being said in the pacing and spaces as any note-rammed stream of jazz virtuosity. In the mid-80s Heath also began expanding the educational work he had begun with the New York jazz-outreach organisation Jazzmobile in 1964. He pioneered a jazz course as a professor at Queens College, City University of New York, remaining in that role until 1998. His big band continued to perform into the 90s \u2013 his composing achievements in that field having included the fine orchestral works Afro-American Suite of Evolution (1975), Smilin\u2019Billy (1976, written with Ornette Coleman\u2019s drummer Billy Higgins in mind) and Praise (1994). Heath was nominated for Grammy awards three times, and was presented with the National Endowment for the Arts\u2019 Jazz Masters award in 2003. His autobiography, I Walked With Giants, was published in 2010. He is survived by his second wife, Mona Brown, and their daughter Roslyn; and by James, from his first marriage, seven grandchildren seven great-grandchildren and his brother Albert. \u2022 James Edward Heath, saxophonist, born 25 October 1926; died 19 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "Norway\u2019s anti-immigration Progress party has resigned from the ruling coalition over a cabinet decision to repatriate a woman suspected of belonging to Islamic State from Syria so one of her young children could receive medical treatment. The departure of the populist, rightwing party means the prime minister, Erna Solberg, no longer has a parliamentary majority, but she said she would stay on at the head of a minority government with her two remaining coalition partners. The Progress party leader and finance minister, Siv Jensen, told a press conference on Monday that there had been \u201ctoo many compromises\u201d and it had become too difficult to get her party\u2019s policies adopted by the four-party government. \u201cI brought us into government, and I\u2019m now bringing the party out,\u201d Jensen said, adding that she nonetheless thought Solberg was the right person to be prime minister and she wanted to maintain a close dialogue with her in the future. Solberg said the decision to help bring the unnamed 29-year-old woman \u2013 who denies allegations she was a member of the Islamist terror group \u2013 and her two children back to Norway so her five-year-old son could receive medical treatment was \u201ccorrect\u201d. The government had originally wanted to repatriate just the sick child, she said, but could not separate him from his mother. \u201cOur dilemma was therefore whether to bring home a child with his mother, or risk a sick five-year-old dying,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, it was important the boy came home to Norway.\u201d The Progress party had said it was willing to help the two children return, but tried to block the government from helping any adult seeking to return to Norway after having married a foreign fighter or joined an Islamist group abroad, prompting a national debate about what the foreign ministry called \u201ca difficult consular case\u201d. The cabinet decided last week to help the woman, who left Norway in 2013 and married twice in Syria, travel home from a Kurdish-controlled detention camp in Syria with her son and three-year-old daughter. She was arrested on her return on Saturday on suspicion of being a member of Isis. Decisions on whether to allow women with links to Isis to return from Syria have caused controversy across Europe, including in neighbouring Finland, whose newly appointed government recently settled on deciding each case individually. About 12,300 foreigners were detained in camps in Syria at the end of 2018, according to reports, including more than 8,700 children from more than 40 countries. Solberg, who now needs to fill a total of seven cabinet posts, thanked the Progress party for its cooperation but said it was \u201cnatural\u201d for her Conservative party to move forward with the Liberal and Christian Democratic parties. Most of Norway\u2019s governments since the 1970s have ruled with a minority and under its constitution the next election cannot be held until September 2021.",

She has refused requests for mediation; they are awaiting their second hearing. \u201cI have found the process time-consuming, wasteful, expensive, traumatic and adversarial, including with my own lawyers,\u201d says Jonathan. \u201cMy advice to anyone would be along the lines of \u2018don\u2019t bother to get married\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But those in unhappy marriages should not be discouraged from ending them by the fear of a legal fight, says Steve Kane, an entrepreneur and the author of <a href=\"http://gethappy.life/\" title=\"\">F\u2026 It. Get a Divorce: The Guide for Optimists</a>. \u201cThere is still some social stigma to divorce, so people linger in sometimes torturous relationships. In a world where we can forgive ourselves for needing to move on from a marriage, it\u2019s a tiny, tiny additional step to forgive your spouse.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, the blame game will be alleviated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/apr/09/no-fault-divorce-lawyers-england-wales\" title=\"\">the introduction of \u201cno-fault divorce\u201d</a>. The proposed law is in a bill before parliament and will, the government promises, speed up the process and remove \u201cneedless antagonism\u201d.</p> <p>At present, in English law, even the smoothest, speediest route usually requires two years of separation (if both parties consent; five years if they don\u2019t. In Scotland, the requirement is one and two years respectively). Simon Blain, a family law partner at <a href=\"https://www.forsters.co.uk/people/simon-blain\" title=\"\">Forsters</a>, says this \u201cthrows people off balance quite early on ... I don\u2019t think people understand how intertwined your lives become as a married couple, and how hard it is unpacking those arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel, 42, from Staffordshire, remembers having to keep track of the date she officially separated from her spouse before their divorce was finalised in 2012 \u2013 \u201cnot the nicest thing to have on your calendar ... The whole thing seemed designed to be miserable and difficult. By the end of it, we were still friends-ish, but I think our friendship would have survived in a more robust way if we had been done and dusted quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Claire\u2019s divorce was finalised only this month, after what she characterises as a \u201c20-month emotional meltdown\u201d from her newly ex-husband. The work of moving on from the marriage is ongoing; she is seeing a counsellor. Claire saw Marriage Story, but \u201cdidn\u2019t love it\u201d, she says. \u201cMaybe the subject matter is too close to the bone for me at the moment.

Frankly, that\u2019s part of what they\u2019re paying for.\u201d Jonathan, a 63-year-old Londoner, estimates that he has already spent \u00a312,000 on legal fees in attempting to end his marriage of 24 years, at his wife\u2019s instigation. She has refused requests for mediation; they are awaiting their second hearing. \u201cI have found the process time-consuming, wasteful, expensive, traumatic and adversarial, including with my own lawyers,\u201d says Jonathan. \u201cMy advice to anyone would be along the lines of \u2018don\u2019t bother to get married\u2019.\u201d But those in unhappy marriages should not be discouraged from ending them by the fear of a legal fight, says Steve Kane, an entrepreneur and the author of F\u2026 It. Get a Divorce: The Guide for Optimists. \u201cThere is still some social stigma to divorce, so people linger in sometimes torturous relationships. In a world where we can forgive ourselves for needing to move on from a marriage, it\u2019s a tiny, tiny additional step to forgive your spouse.\u201d In the UK, the blame game will be alleviated by the introduction of \u201cno-fault divorce\u201d. The proposed law is in a bill before parliament and will, the government promises, speed up the process and remove \u201cneedless antagonism\u201d. At present, in English law, even the smoothest, speediest route usually requires two years of separation (if both parties consent; five years if they don\u2019t. In Scotland, the requirement is one and two years respectively). Simon Blain, a family law partner at Forsters, says this \u201cthrows people off balance quite early on ... I don\u2019t think people understand how intertwined your lives become as a married couple, and how hard it is unpacking those arrangements.\u201d Rachel, 42, from Staffordshire, remembers having to keep track of the date she officially separated from her spouse before their divorce was finalised in 2012 \u2013 \u201cnot the nicest thing to have on your calendar ... The whole thing seemed designed to be miserable and difficult. By the end of it, we were still friends-ish, but I think our friendship would have survived in a more robust way if we had been done and dusted quickly.\u201d Claire\u2019s divorce was finalised only this month, after what she characterises as a \u201c20-month emotional meltdown\u201d from her newly ex-husband. The work of moving on from the marriage is ongoing; she is seeing a counsellor. Claire saw Marriage Story, but \u201cdidn\u2019t love it\u201d, she says. \u201cMaybe the subject matter is too close to the bone for me at the moment. I did envy the scene where they let rip at each other, as I never really had that moment of catharsis with my ex and now probably never will.\u201d Some names have been changed",

Its population has expanded from 1 million in the 1980s to 8 million today, and is projected to reach 13 million over the next decade. During the oil boom that followed the end of the civil war in 2002, it became one of the most expensive places on Earth.</p> \n<p>On the outskirts, shanty towns sprawled.

Drawing inspiration from Dubai, the proposed development involved a string of new manmade islands, linked to each other, and to existing peninsulas, by a coastal highway built on land reclaimed from the sea. There would be luxury homes, a new fishing port, commercial districts and parks. Dos Santos says she started working on the idea in 2012, through her real estate and construction company, Urbinveste. Early the following year, a team assembled to turn her vision into reality.</p> \n<p>In 2013, Urbinveste recruited the British architects Broadway Malyan, whose St George Wharf development in London towers over the Thames at Vauxhall, and the Dutch company Van Oord, which had just finished building Dubai\u2019s iconic palm tree-shaped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/08/fake-lakes-the-cities-transformed-by-artificial-natural-attractions\">Palm Jumeirah island</a>.</p> \n<p>In April, the architects produced their first high-level sketch. The proposed development zone for the Corimba concept is clear from the drawing: it begins at Areia Branca and extends southwards over several kilometres.</p> \n<p>Urbinveste\u2019s plan was not the only idea in play for this stretch of coast. Another government-backed project had involved building a highway called Marginal Sudoeste. This proposal involved a road skirting the Areia Branca settlement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5574e67b5cffa06fb366cddaf22d56c5ac28ca6b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5574e67b5cffa06fb366cddaf22d56c5ac28ca6b/0_0_1205_947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plan for the redevelopment of Areia Branca, commissioned by Urbinveste\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plan for the redevelopment of the Areia Branca peninsula, commissioned by Urbinveste.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urbinveste</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 10 May 2013, the plans drawn up by Urbinveste and its partners were pitched to President Dos Santos himself, according to a report produced by the local development agency.

      "bodyText": "Drive out of the centre of Luanda, down the coastal highway heading south from the Angolan capital. Swing past the fort built by Portuguese colonialists on the hill above, and beyond the luxury shopping mall. Just before the road heads inland there is a lagoon, separated from the sea by a long spit of land. This is Areia Branca, named for its white sands. Until the summer of 2013, it was home to a thriving fishing community of 3,000 families. Now there is no trace of their houses, only sand, a pile of gravel, egrets, a bulldozer and a police post. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone. Nothing is left,\u201d said Pedro Alexandrino, standing near the site of his former home. \u201cNow we are living in horrible conditions.\u201d Many of Areia Branca\u2019s former residents have moved to the other side of the lagoon, packed on to a tiny patch of land, known as Povoado. Previously a waste dump through which two sewage channels flowed, it has become home to 500 families sharing tiny shacks made of corrugated tin. Children play among piles of rotting rubbish. Infectious diseases \u2013 malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis \u2013 are rife. Alexandrino and his neighbours say they did not move voluntarily. They claim they were evicted in June 2013 by police, local officials and, some say, members of the presidential guard. Their homes were bulldozed amid violent scenes as some inhabitants resisted. The Luanda Leaks investigation, based on a huge cache of financial records belonging to Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola\u2019s former president Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, suggest her company stood to benefit from a redevelopment of the vacated land. She disputes this, saying her grand redevelopment plans, which were backed by her father, did not require evictions. Dos Santos also insists her business relationship with her father\u2019s government was \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d, and that she was \u201cnot financed by any state money or any state funds\u201d. The documents, seen by the Guardian and other media partners in the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), suggest as much as $500m of state payments were earmarked for Dos Santos companies and their subcontractors, after they signed deals to lead what became known as the Marginal da Corimba project, a multibillion-dollar real estate and highway development along Luanda\u2019s coastline. The project was cancelled by Angola\u2019s new president two years ago, before construction work had begun. It was one of many ventures critics say allowed Dos Santos and her husband the opportunity to profit from the state in sectors as diverse as construction, telecoms, oil and gas and diamonds while her father was in power. The couple steadfastly deny any allegations of nepotism or corruption, and say the recent moves by the Angolan government to freeze their assets in the country, over matters unrelated to the Luanda development project, are nothing more than a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. In a recent interview with BBC News, Dos Santos said these criticisms were \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d and part of an \u201corchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated\u201d. She says the couple\u2019s companies are privately funded. \u201cI can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds,\u201d she told the BBC. Reshaping the city Luanda is a fast-growing city. Its population has expanded from 1 million in the 1980s to 8 million today, and is projected to reach 13 million over the next decade. During the oil boom that followed the end of the civil war in 2002, it became one of the most expensive places on Earth. On the outskirts, shanty towns sprawled. In the centre, rival development plans competed for land and finance. The president\u2019s daughter saw an opportunity to bring some order with what came to be known as the Luanda masterplan. \u201cI was fortunate enough to be a leading consultant in the Luanda masterplan,\u201d she said in a lecture at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal issue for me.\u201d Dos Santos talks proudly about her work, but many aspects of how the project was managed, and who stood to benefit, have remained unclear \u2013 until now. Marginal da Corimba was a centrepiece of her vision for Luanda. Drawing inspiration from Dubai, the proposed development involved a string of new manmade islands, linked to each other, and to existing peninsulas, by a coastal highway built on land reclaimed from the sea. There would be luxury homes, a new fishing port, commercial districts and parks. Dos Santos says she started working on the idea in 2012, through her real estate and construction company, Urbinveste. Early the following year, a team assembled to turn her vision into reality. In 2013, Urbinveste recruited the British architects Broadway Malyan, whose St George Wharf development in London towers over the Thames at Vauxhall, and the Dutch company Van Oord, which had just finished building Dubai\u2019s iconic palm tree-shaped Palm Jumeirah island. In April, the architects produced their first high-level sketch. The proposed development zone for the Corimba concept is clear from the drawing: it begins at Areia Branca and extends southwards over several kilometres. Urbinveste\u2019s plan was not the only idea in play for this stretch of coast. Another government-backed project had involved building a highway called Marginal Sudoeste. This proposal involved a road skirting the Areia Branca settlement. On 10 May 2013, the plans drawn up by Urbinveste and its partners were pitched to President Dos Santos himself, according to a report produced by the local development agency. At the end of the meeting, the report states, \u201cauthorisation was obtained for the elaboration of the new execution project\u201d. Three weeks later, on 1 June, the bulldozers rolled into Areia Branca. It is not clear if this was a direct result of the president\u2019s decision. What is indisputable is that the entire community was evicted. \u201cWe had no warning at all of what was going to happen,\u201d says Alexandrino. \u201cNo notice, no announcement, nothing.\u201d The 49-year-old community leader had built his two-bedroom home in Areia Branca. He had four children and a job on a mining project run by Sodiam, the state-owned diamond company. \u201cI\u2019d come home, it was a Friday, I went to bed around 11pm. I saw bulldozers on trucks on the road when I came in and wondered what they were for. At 2am I heard noise and saw the soldiers and police and then I understood that the bulldozers were there to destroy the houses.\u201d Interviews with those displaced, and material gathered by the charity SOS Habitat for an ongoing legal challenge, describe the alleged abuses that followed: the road to the mainland was blocked and the electricity and telephone cables were cut; identity documents were seized and thrown into the sea. Those who resisted were allegedly handcuffed, taken to the bridge and beaten. Two youths are reported to have died after being run over. One fell under the wheels of a truck allegedly after being beaten with a club. His body was taken away by police and his family say it was never returned to them. Residents boarded trucks after being told they would be driven to new homes. But they say they were dumped on the roadside. Those who refused to leave were allegedly driven from the island with teargas. Unable to get to work for a week, Alexandrino lost his job. His neighbour Talitha Miguel, 41, recalls how, after they had sought refuge in churches and a hospital, the police chief told the community about Povoado. \u201cAnd living here everything is a problem.\u201d \u2018Everything was demolished\u2019 Their former home remains an empty space. To this day, no developer has built on the land or claimed responsibility for the clearance. An impact study produced some time later for Urbinveste points the finger at the ministry of construction, saying the \u201cslum\u201d was cleared to \u201cpave the way for the ongoing construction work of expansion of Marginal Sudoeste\u201d. Broadway Malyan told the Guardian it was not previously aware of the allegations of forced evictions and that its work did not include any plans for clearances. At the time the evictions took place, the company said, it had only produced one preliminary drawing. \u201cBroadway Malyan is committed to operating in a responsible and ethical manner in all work that it does,\u201d the firm said. \u201cWe would never propose or facilitate any such unlawful eviction of residents and we do not condone such behaviour in any way nor want to work with any party who does so.\u201d Van Oord told the Dutch newspaper Trouw, an ICIJ partner, that it was previously unaware of the alleged abuses, but that after making inquiries it believed they were related to the Sudoeste project. The company, which is negotiating a new contract with the government on a revised plan for the Luanda coastline, says it has contacted the Angolan construction minister about the issue of reparations for those displaced. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to use our influence, we think it\u2019s an unpleasant situation,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cIf others don\u2019t do it, we\u2019re going to make our own arrangements for compensation.\u201d The Dutch ambassador to Luanda, Anne van Leeuwen, visited the slum, and was given a tour by Laura Macedo, an organiser at SOS Habitat. \u201cHe saw the conditions people are living in. I don\u2019t call it living, it\u2019s survival. He said he would talk to his foreign ministry.\u201d Dos Santos vehemently rejects any involvement in oppression or displacement of Angolan citizens. Through her lawyers, she said \u201cthere were never any evictions related to Marginal\u201d, whether in Areia Branca or any other part of the city. She says her development, designed to ease traffic congestion in the capital, would have avoided the need for evictions because it was going to be built on land reclaimed from the sea. She told the BBC that reclaimed land was \u201crelatively cheap\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than to have to expropriate people, so one of the concerns was to make sure that there would be no expropriations.\u201d Green light from the president Reclaimed land may be relatively cheap, but involvement in such infrastructure projects can be profitable for companies that receive government contracts in countries such as Angola, where much depends on presidential decree. In January 2016, after several years of planning and negotiations on financing, a decree from President Dos Santos greenlit about $1.3bn of public spending, with the award of two contracts. Under procurement laws in force at the time, public tenders were not always required for state spending. Urbinveste was partnered with Van Oord for dredging and building the islands, and Landscape, another company controlled by Dos Santos, had teamed up with a Chinese group to build the highway and a fishing port. A consortium agreement for the dredging stated that in exchange for tasks including the obtaining of work permits, providing security and government liaison, Urbinveste and its subcontractors would keep 30% of the contract \u2013 or $189m (\u00a3145m). The road building was potentially even more lucrative: balance sheets and a draft contract indicate Landscape and its subcontractors would claim as much as 50% of the total value, or $328m. Challenged about how she has apparently benefited from her father\u2019s decrees, Dos Santos told Portugal\u2019s Observador newspaper: \u201cOur law makes the president of the republic \u2026 effectively the last person in the government who ratifies all the concessions or licences or other type of contracts \u2026 as an Angolan, it would be impossible to work in Angola and find myself in a situation where [the president], at one time or another, would not sign a decree in which one of my companies was working.\u201d On 15 May 2019, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos\u2019s successor as president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, used his own presidential decree to tear up the dredging and road building contracts, citing \u201cover-invoicing\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate compensation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s determination to pursue legal actions against the media may be a high-risk public relations strategy but it emphasises their disenchantment with the British press. Within the space of a few days last autumn, Harry and Meghan launched two separate claims over alleged phone hacking and invasion of privacy. The death in 1997 of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris after being hounded by the paparazzi, may have created a legacy of distrust of the tabloids. In a BBC interview three years ago, Harry said: \u201cThe people that chased her into the tunnel were the same people taking photographs of her dying on the backseat of the car.\u201d Harry and Meghan are not the only royals to resort to suing newspapers. Prince Charles, for example, won a judgment against the Mail on Sunday in 2006 over publication of extracts from his private diaries. The couple\u2019s court actions include: \u2022 Lawyers for Meghan lodging claims against the Mail on Sunday alleging breach of copyright, invasion of privacy and misuse of personal data after the newspaper published excerpts from a letter she sent to her father complaining about his treatment of her. In its defence, Associated Newspapers, which publishes the paper, has argued that she \u201cdid not have a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d for the letter\u2019s contents because there was \u201cno mutual understanding\u201d between the duchess and her father that the correspondence should remain secret. The Mail on Sunday has warned it will seek disclosure from Meghan of her exchanges with her Canadian friend Jessica Mulroney about allegedly providing information to the media to influence what was published. Schillings, a law firm specialising in libel and \u201creputation management\u201d, launched the legal action for Meghan in September. There have been no public hearings in the action so far. \u2022 Harry is separately suing the publishers of the Mirror, the Sun and the now defunct News of the World, over claims that evidence of misconduct involving phone hacking has been concealed and destroyed. The prince has joined a group litigation launched by others who have said they were victims of having their private phone messages intercepted and published. Because there are so many claims against Newsgroup Newspapers and Mirror Group Newspapers the cases have been joined together and are being heard in regular batches. Most are settled out of court through payments; Harry\u2019s claims are not expected to come to trial, if they reach court, until late this year at the earliest. The claims may refer to historical interference. Harry and his brother, Prince William, were at the centre of a series of hacking allegations after it emerged in the early 2000s that tabloid journalists were routinely accessing public figures\u2019 voicemails to find stories. \u2022 Last spring, Harry and Meghan accepted substantial damages and an apology from a news agency that took aerial photographs of his Cotswolds home, forcing him and his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, to move out. Lawyers for Harry maintained that the photographs taken by Splash News and Picture Agency amounted to misuse of private information that breached his privacy. The prince applied for permission to have a statement announcing the terms of the out-of-court settlement read in court, laying down a firm marker in his fight to protect the privacy of his family. In 2017 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were separately awarded \u20ac100,000 (\u00a391,000) in damages and interest against the French celebrity magazine Closer and two photographers.",

Child said: \u201cFor years I thought about different ways of killing Reacher off.

Jo Nesb\u00f8 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/11/jo-nesbo-interview-knife-harry-hole\">recently told me</a> there was no way his own super-tough detective Harry Hole would continue after his death \u2013 and that he had plans in place to bring about his demise. \u201cHe will not have eternal life. He probably won\u2019t die from old age. But then again, who knows?\u201d said Nesb\u00f8, adding that he wouldn\u2019t be handing the franchise on to anyone else. \u201cDefinitely not. I\u2019m telling you right now \u2013 if that should happen, if you see somebody trying, you can quote me on this.\u201d</p> <p>The late Italian detective novelist Andrea Camilleri always had an end in sight for Inspector Montalbano, writing the final novel in the series 14 years ago, and keeping it in his publisher\u2019s offices in Palermo. \u201cWhen I get fed up with him or am not able to write any more, I\u2019ll tell the publisher: publish that book.

In taking on a co-author role with his brother, Child follows in the large footsteps of writers such as James Patterson, who works with a handful of co-authors on bestselling lines including the Alex Cross books and Women\u2019s Murder Club series. He\u2019ll <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/magazine/24patterson-t.html\">write a 50-page outline for his team</a>, who will draft chapters that Patterson will read, revise, and rewrite where he needs to, paying them out of his own pocket.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/bonnier-zaffre-announces-eight-figure-deal-wilbur-smith-572136\">Wilbur Smith</a> has also gladly collaborated with co-authors in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/corporate/press-releases/wilbur-smith-moves-to-harpercollins/\">saying that</a> \u201cmy fans have made it very clear that they would like to read my novels and revisit my family of characters faster than I can write them.

David Lagercrantz\u2019s thrillers might be classy enough \u2013 but Larsson\u2019s partner Eva Gabrielsson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/31/stieg-larsson-millennium-novels-sequel-the-girl-in-the-spiders-web\">has been stingingly critical</a> of the continuation. \u201cThe worst thing is how saddened Stieg would have been.

Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

      "bodyText": "Senate Democrats were ramping up pressure for witnesses to be called in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump before the historic process gets fully under way on Capitol Hill on Tuesday \u2013 even as the president plans to be away at the elite economic and political forum in Davos, Switzerland, during opening arguments. Trump already has no plans to appear at his own Senate trial and will be represented by a legal team that includes some controversial figures. But the symbolism of his being out of the country at a very see-and-be-seen annual event that draws global leaders while he stands accused back home of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress during its investigation into his conduct with Ukraine is telling. He is due to give a keynote speech at the forum as the drama unfolds in Washington. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that he aims to compel the chamber as early as Tuesday to hold a vote on whether witnesses and extra evidence can be brought before the impeachment trial, and he turned up the pressure on moderate Republicans to side with the minority to achieve that. In a press conference in New York on Sunday evening, Schumer said he stood ready to \u201cforce votes for witnesses and documents\u201d at the trial if the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell \u2013 who has yet to set out the exact details of how he proposes that the trial will proceed \u2013 does not call for such a vote. \u201cWe have the right to do it, we are going to do it and we are going to do it at the beginning on Tuesday if leader McConnell doesn\u2019t call for these witnesses in his proposal,\u201d Schumer said. Trump has been keen for the Senate to dismiss the charges against him without even going through the motions of a trial. McConnell intends to proceed with a trial but there has been no agreement to call any outside witnesses, such as the former national security adviser John Bolton or the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who could shed even more light on the president\u2019s dealing with the Ukrainians and the pivotal role of Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The case hinges on a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked his counterpart to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate both a conspiracy theory concerning election interference and ties between the former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter and the eastern European country. Trump\u2019s team is entitled to file a detailed legal brief in the case before midday on Monday. An initial brief on Saturday argued fiercely against the impeachment charges. \u201cThis is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election, now just months away,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers said, also claiming the charges against the president were invalid as they did not concern a crime.

Culture secretary Nicky Morgan has also said that she is \u201copen-minded\u201d about replacing the licence fee with a Netflix-style subscription service.</p> <p>The licence fee is secure until at least 2027, when the BBC\u2019s royal charter is up for renewal. It would require parliament to pass new legislation to scrap it, which would prove difficult. However, the bigger risk for the BBC is the cost of the licence fee between 2022 and 2027, which comes up for discussion at the mid-term review of the royal charter set for spring 2022.</p> <h2><strong>2. Unequal pay</strong></h2> <p>Journalist Samira Ahmed\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/10/samira-ahmed-wins-equal-pay-claim-against-bbc\">landmark \u00a3700,000 employment tribunal victory against the BBC</a> continues to keep the issue of unequal pay at the corporation in the spotlight. The unanimous decision by the tribunal that the only reason she was paid less than colleague Jeremy Vine for hosting a similar show was gender discrimination has opened the door to a flood of claims.</p> <p>During the hearings the BBC inadvertently revealed the names of 120 female employees who had pursued gender pay complaints against the corporation. It has also emerged that radio presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/sarah-montague-wins-400000-settlement-from-bbc-for-unequal-treatment\">Sarah Montague won a \u00a3400,000 settlement</a> and apology from the BBC over unequal pay on the Today programme. The BBC has been embroiled in a row over its gender pay gap since 2017, when it was forced to publish a list of its on-air staff earning \u00a3150,000 or more \u2013 only a third were women.</p> <p>The BBC reported a median gender pay gap of 6.7% across its almost 20,000 employees last year, down from 9.3% in 2017. Hall has pledged to close the gap completely by the end of 2020. This compares to the national average of 17.9%.</p> <h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Netflix</strong></h2> <p>As with other broadcasters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/11/bbc-licence-fee-streaming-competition-netflix\">the BBC is facing a crisis in the streaming era</a> as audiences turn to well-funded rivals such as Netflix and Amazon to watch shows and films. The issue is particularly acute among younger audiences, with the BBC admitting that under-24-year-olds spend more time on Netflix in a week than all of BBC TV, including iPlayer, despite the latter\u2019s relative popularity with younger viewers.</p> <p>Similarly, younger generations are listening to more music on streaming services such as Spotify than BBC radio stations. The corporation is making moves to secure its future, such as gaining approval from regulator Ofcom to keep shows on the iPlayer for a year, up from just 30 days, and joining forces with ITV to launch domestic Netflix rival BritBox late last year.</p> <h2><strong>4. Over-75s and licence fee payment</strong></h2> <p>In 2015, the government announced that the BBC would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\">take over the \u00a3745m annual cost of providing free licences for over-75s</a> in June 2020 as part of the licence fee deal. The corporation warned that shouldering that cost would result in \u201cunprecedented closures\u201d of services, including TV channels and radio stations such as BBC2 and Radio 5 Live.</p> <p>The BBC has moved to make most over-75s pay the TV licence, with only those that can provide evidence they claim pension credit still eligible to get it free. In August Boris Johnson reignited the row, urging the BBC to \u201ccough up\u201d and pay the licence fee for all over-75s. In October, a report from the House of Commons culture select committee urged the government to find a way to help ensure that all over-75s continue to receive a free TV licence.</p> <p>The 2017 Conservative manifesto unexpectedly pledged to ensure TV licences continued to be free for over-75s, although Tory sources have since suggested this was due to a copy-and-paste error made during the rushed general election campaign.</p>",

The BBC reported a median gender pay gap of 6.7% across its almost 20,000 employees last year, down from 9.3% in 2017. Hall has pledged to close the gap completely by the end of 2020. This compares to the national average of 17.9%. 3. Netflix As with other broadcasters the BBC is facing a crisis in the streaming era as audiences turn to well-funded rivals such as Netflix and Amazon to watch shows and films. The issue is particularly acute among younger audiences, with the BBC admitting that under-24-year-olds spend more time on Netflix in a week than all of BBC TV, including iPlayer, despite the latter\u2019s relative popularity with younger viewers. Similarly, younger generations are listening to more music on streaming services such as Spotify than BBC radio stations. The corporation is making moves to secure its future, such as gaining approval from regulator Ofcom to keep shows on the iPlayer for a year, up from just 30 days, and joining forces with ITV to launch domestic Netflix rival BritBox late last year. 4. Over-75s and licence fee payment In 2015, the government announced that the BBC would take over the \u00a3745m annual cost of providing free licences for over-75s in June 2020 as part of the licence fee deal. The corporation warned that shouldering that cost would result in \u201cunprecedented closures\u201d of services, including TV channels and radio stations such as BBC2 and Radio 5 Live. The BBC has moved to make most over-75s pay the TV licence, with only those that can provide evidence they claim pension credit still eligible to get it free. In August Boris Johnson reignited the row, urging the BBC to \u201ccough up\u201d and pay the licence fee for all over-75s. In October, a report from the House of Commons culture select committee urged the government to find a way to help ensure that all over-75s continue to receive a free TV licence. The 2017 Conservative manifesto unexpectedly pledged to ensure TV licences continued to be free for over-75s, although Tory sources have since suggested this was due to a copy-and-paste error made during the rushed general election campaign.",

      "body": "<p>Nine hundred and ninety-eight \u2026 999\u2026 1,000. And still it went. Jordi Alba played the ball to Riqui Puig, who played it to Sergi Busquets, who played it to Arthur Melo, who played it to Sergi Roberto, who played it to Gerard Piqu\u00e9. Who, finally halted on 100, didn\u2019t get the chance to play it to anyone else. Half an hour before his first game as coach of Barcelona, Quique Seti\u00e9n had sat on the bench alongside his assistant \u00c9der Sarabia, empty seats rising around them, still barely able to believe they were here, and silently contemplated the players \u2013 <em>his</em> players \u2013 warming up with a ball at their feet. Two and a half hours later, standing now, collar turned up against the cold, when the final whistle went it was still there.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the things I wanted,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said afterwards and others had too, although not all of them. Above all, he had seen the thing he says all players want and always have, right back to the playground: the ball. Barcelona won 1-0 on his debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/19/barcelona-granada-la-liga-match-report\">against Granada</a> but there were other numbers that occupied everyone. Piqu\u00e9 was one of four players to reach 100 passes, 98 of them accurate. Rakitic had only been two away from making it five; Lionel Messi was seven away. Puig had played more passes than all of Granada\u2019s players \u2013 and he had only been on the pitch 22 minutes. Busquets had played more than all of them put together. His 157 was a record this season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/04/which-football-team-have-completed-the-most-passes-in-a-match\">Which football team have completed the most passes in a match? | The Knowledge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Barcelona had attempted 1,005 passes. They had 82.6% possession, just ahead of last season\u2019s high: 82.5% from Betis. That\u2019s Seti\u00e9n\u2019s Betis and that\u2019s also pretty much the point. If this was very Seti\u00e9n, it was also very \u201cBarcelona\u201d, which is what it\u2019s supposed to be. Only two teams had ever attempted more passes in La Liga \u2013 Barcelona in 2011 and 2012, under Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. Only two had registered a higher percentage since Opta started counting in 2005, both of them Barcelona under Guardiola: 84% against Racing Santander and, more recently, 83.9% against Levante in May 2011. They had played 326 league games since then. If this move was driven by nostalgia, and in part it was, there was a shot of it here, a glimpse of the future coming with it.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a nostalgia that goes back a long way now; that sense of loss is long-standing and easily evoked. In September 2013, Barcelona beat Rayo Vallecano 4-0 but what remained was that they lost possession, their religion, for the first time in 315 games, since the pre-Guardiola era. Last season they had just 44% of the possession against Sevilla \u2013 they won that, too \u2013 and that didn\u2019t go unnoticed, including among Seti\u00e9n\u2019s staff. Much of the response was exaggerated: there was a puritanical edge to it, a touch of mythology. Sevilla was one of just five games in which they had \u201clost\u201d possession in 410 games, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2010misterchip/status/1107420485292179457\">according to Spain\u2019s best football statistician</a>. Yet, many agreed with El Mundo\u2019s judgement that \u201cthe ball had become a foreign element\u201d, Valverde\u2019s team reaching a season high of 791 passes, and if there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/19/quique-setien-spirit-of-johan-cruyff-barcelona-new-manager\">a reason Barcelona turned to Seti\u00e9n</a>, it was this. It was also because they were stuck, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/13/barcelona-ernesto-valverde-manager-job-xavi\">of course</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have winners\u2019 medals or a huge CV, just a commitment to an idea,\u201d he had said, and that idea was their idea, or so it goes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762ca2a2f1fb179e88dbb4dc0a8085751658b644\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762ca2a2f1fb179e88dbb4dc0a8085751658b644/190_115_2110_1429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seti\u00e9n watches on from the touchline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seti\u00e9n watches on from the touchline.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Here, he expressed it. \u201cThese are just words,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/14/quique-setien-barcelona-job-cows-new-manager\">he had said on Tuesday</a>; by Sunday, they were actions too. At the end of a week in which the question was <em>how</em> Barcelona would play, not the result \u2013 not least because most took that for granted \u2013 and when the talk was of identity and philosophy, Sunday brought some answers. It was too early for conclusions, Seti\u00e9n insisting he didn\u2019t really know how to judge his team until he had the chance to watch the game back and analyse it properly. It was a single game and against Granada, unlikely to be replicated often. And his commitment to an idea doesn\u2019t, despite easy assumptions, preclude variety and the search for specific solutions. And yet this was a first view of what might be, a statement of intent.</p> \n<p>A Barcelona that lined up in something like a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2, that put Messi central. One that positioned Alba as high as Ansu Fati, at least with the ball, leaving the wing to him. \u201cIf you look at the data, I would bet that Alba\u2019s not running more; it\u2019s mostly in the midfield,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said when asked about the demands made of the full-back. \u201cIt\u2019s better to make an effort for 10 meters to win the ball than to have the team running back 40, 50 metres.\u201d A Barcelona that was, Seti\u00e9n insisted, \u201cbrave\u201d, trying to rob the ball high, stepping up to tackles, not turned back to make them. One with a system that may revive Busquets, the last midfield survivor of 2009, a symbol of their identity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/nov/12/real-betiss-barcelona-tribute-act-is-even-better-than-the-real-thing\">and an admirer of Seti\u00e9n</a> who noted afterwards: \u201cThe feelings are good. It\u2019s better to do your running forwards.\u201d Seti\u00e9n said: \u201cSergio has that idea in his head: he\u2019s the player that best understands his position and reads that part of the game.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1219209609858207744\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lovely team goal finished off by Messi to grab all 3 points for Barca \ud83d\ude4c<br><br>Leo Messi has now scored the first goal of Tito Villanova, Tata Martino, Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde &amp; Quique Setien's tenures. <br><br>A sign of things to come? \ud83e\udd14 <a href=\"https://t.co/px2ZMgoLUh\">pic.twitter.com/px2ZMgoLUh</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1219209609858207744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 20, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>This was a Barcelona in which B-teamer Puig came on to play a significant part and Arturo Vidal, a player the coaching staff believe is better than people think, was decisive again. One that never went long, building every move from the back. One where he insisted on \u201crigour,\u201d \u201cmental discipline\u201d, \u201c90 minutes\u201d of focus, and a collective \u201cmechanism\u201d to prevent them being exposed on the break. One he also explicitly linked to their performance against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, before he arrived \u2013 the game that finally cost Ernesto Valverde his job. One that, swiftly, maybe a little too swiftly, brought excitement, recognition, a sense of belonging. For some, at least. \u201cSeti\u00e9n makes himself felt,\u201d declared the cover of El Mundo Deportivo. \u201cGreat hopes,\u201d cheered Sport. His \u201cmanifesto\u201d, they said, was clear: \u201cPossession.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/20/erling-braut-haaland-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-gatecrashes-again\">Erling Braut Haaland gatecrashes again to haul Dortmund out of mire | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was also, though, a Barcelona that struggled to find a way through; that only scored once at home \u2013 where there have been a 5-0, three 5-2s, a 4-0 and two 4-1s in the league this season \u2013 and against Granada. That didn\u2019t get the breakthrough until the last 20 minutes, just after their opponents had been reduced to 10 men for a second yellow that Granada manager Diego Mart\u00ednez rightly considered harsh. And not long after Granada had hit the post. A Bar\u00e7a that only had six shots on target. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when a team defends very deep,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said, although that does make it easier to keep possession, so those stats too have to be contextualised: Granada didn\u2019t press Barcelona high as many have done to great effect, especially away.</p> \n<p>It is also not easy without Luis Su\u00e1rez \u2013 the kind of player they\u2019d wished they had towards the end at Betis when they struggled to turn possession into goals. Of Barcelona\u2019s 921 completed passes, only a fifth went forward and, on a windy night and a dry pitch, the ball didn\u2019t circulate as fast as Seti\u00e9n wanted. It was theirs, though. Sometimes people ask: yeah, but how many of those passes were relevant? The answer, while smartarsed, is: all of them. It is a debate that Guardiola faced too, and so did the Spain team that won the World Cup. Possession is not just about creativity; it is about control, a word Seti\u00e9n used pointedlyhere, about conditioning the game. Keeping the ball is a defensive approach too, denying the opposition oxygen. For Seti\u00e9n, it is also almost an ethical question, something deep inside him.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just about the result, he says, but it <em>is</em> about the result. And that came from a familiar place, Messi scoring the only goal when he finished off a lovely move involving Puig, Busquets, Antoine Griezmann and Vidal. Whatever else changes, that doesn\u2019t, just as Seti\u00e9n suspected; just as he wished. He\u2019s watched Messi from the other side, seen his own fans applaud him, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/mar/18/oh-my-god-lionel-messi-hat-trick-stadium-left-in-suspended-animation-barcelona\">almost honoured to have been beaten by him</a>, and admitted that he felt like doing the same. On Sunday night, he watched Messi and his teammates warm up, the ball at their feet: players he has long admired, <em>his</em> players now. \u201cIt gives you peace of mind to have Messi,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \u201cHe did what he\u2019s done his whole life.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 When Casemiro missed the chance to score a hat-trick, he headed back to the halfway line with a grin on his face.

Two goals were enough to beat Sevilla; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/real-madrid-sevilla-la-liga-match-report\">his work was done</a>.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Diego Simeone did the sleeping gesture and tried to shake them awake. \u201cYou\u2019re asleep! You\u2019re asleep! You\u2019re asleep,\u201d he shouted, but it was no good. \u201cWe used to gift opponents a half back in October, now we\u2019ve done it again; we have to realise that the game starts when it starts,\u201d he said after Atl\u00e9tico were defeated 2-0 at Eibar, leaving them eight points off the top.

And they give us this. This is for them.\u201d Behind him, players were throwing shirts into the crowd, embracing and overcome with emotion. \u201cYes, we can!\u201d they chanted, which they had chanted when the bus arrived too, but now they really believed they can. Especially with RDT, a goalscorer here, and new manager Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez, who has picked up four points from six games, which is just one less than the two men who preceded him \u2013 and they had 20 games between them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/06/espanyol-barcelona-draw-offers-hope-aberlardo-fernandez-la-liga\">That hope</a> is for real.

      "bodyText": "Nine hundred and ninety-eight \u2026 999\u2026 1,000. And still it went. Jordi Alba played the ball to Riqui Puig, who played it to Sergi Busquets, who played it to Arthur Melo, who played it to Sergi Roberto, who played it to Gerard Piqu\u00e9. Who, finally halted on 100, didn\u2019t get the chance to play it to anyone else. Half an hour before his first game as coach of Barcelona, Quique Seti\u00e9n had sat on the bench alongside his assistant \u00c9der Sarabia, empty seats rising around them, still barely able to believe they were here, and silently contemplated the players \u2013 his players \u2013 warming up with a ball at their feet. Two and a half hours later, standing now, collar turned up against the cold, when the final whistle went it was still there. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the things I wanted,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said afterwards and others had too, although not all of them. Above all, he had seen the thing he says all players want and always have, right back to the playground: the ball. Barcelona won 1-0 on his debut against Granada but there were other numbers that occupied everyone. Piqu\u00e9 was one of four players to reach 100 passes, 98 of them accurate. Rakitic had only been two away from making it five; Lionel Messi was seven away. Puig had played more passes than all of Granada\u2019s players \u2013 and he had only been on the pitch 22 minutes. Busquets had played more than all of them put together. His 157 was a record this season. Barcelona had attempted 1,005 passes. They had 82.6% possession, just ahead of last season\u2019s high: 82.5% from Betis. That\u2019s Seti\u00e9n\u2019s Betis and that\u2019s also pretty much the point. If this was very Seti\u00e9n, it was also very \u201cBarcelona\u201d, which is what it\u2019s supposed to be. Only two teams had ever attempted more passes in La Liga \u2013 Barcelona in 2011 and 2012, under Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. Only two had registered a higher percentage since Opta started counting in 2005, both of them Barcelona under Guardiola: 84% against Racing Santander and, more recently, 83.9% against Levante in May 2011. They had played 326 league games since then. If this move was driven by nostalgia, and in part it was, there was a shot of it here, a glimpse of the future coming with it. It\u2019s a nostalgia that goes back a long way now; that sense of loss is long-standing and easily evoked. In September 2013, Barcelona beat Rayo Vallecano 4-0 but what remained was that they lost possession, their religion, for the first time in 315 games, since the pre-Guardiola era. Last season they had just 44% of the possession against Sevilla \u2013 they won that, too \u2013 and that didn\u2019t go unnoticed, including among Seti\u00e9n\u2019s staff. Much of the response was exaggerated: there was a puritanical edge to it, a touch of mythology. Sevilla was one of just five games in which they had \u201clost\u201d possession in 410 games, according to Spain\u2019s best football statistician. Yet, many agreed with El Mundo\u2019s judgement that \u201cthe ball had become a foreign element\u201d, Valverde\u2019s team reaching a season high of 791 passes, and if there was a reason Barcelona turned to Seti\u00e9n, it was this. It was also because they were stuck, of course. \u201cI don\u2019t have winners\u2019 medals or a huge CV, just a commitment to an idea,\u201d he had said, and that idea was their idea, or so it goes. Here, he expressed it. \u201cThese are just words,\u201d he had said on Tuesday; by Sunday, they were actions too. At the end of a week in which the question was how Barcelona would play, not the result \u2013 not least because most took that for granted \u2013 and when the talk was of identity and philosophy, Sunday brought some answers. It was too early for conclusions, Seti\u00e9n insisting he didn\u2019t really know how to judge his team until he had the chance to watch the game back and analyse it properly. It was a single game and against Granada, unlikely to be replicated often. And his commitment to an idea doesn\u2019t, despite easy assumptions, preclude variety and the search for specific solutions. And yet this was a first view of what might be, a statement of intent. A Barcelona that lined up in something like a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2, that put Messi central. One that positioned Alba as high as Ansu Fati, at least with the ball, leaving the wing to him. \u201cIf you look at the data, I would bet that Alba\u2019s not running more; it\u2019s mostly in the midfield,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said when asked about the demands made of the full-back. \u201cIt\u2019s better to make an effort for 10 meters to win the ball than to have the team running back 40, 50 metres.\u201d A Barcelona that was, Seti\u00e9n insisted, \u201cbrave\u201d, trying to rob the ball high, stepping up to tackles, not turned back to make them. One with a system that may revive Busquets, the last midfield survivor of 2009, a symbol of their identity and an admirer of Seti\u00e9n who noted afterwards: \u201cThe feelings are good. It\u2019s better to do your running forwards.\u201d Seti\u00e9n said: \u201cSergio has that idea in his head: he\u2019s the player that best understands his position and reads that part of the game.\u201d This was a Barcelona in which B-teamer Puig came on to play a significant part and Arturo Vidal, a player the coaching staff believe is better than people think, was decisive again. One that never went long, building every move from the back. One where he insisted on \u201crigour,\u201d \u201cmental discipline\u201d, \u201c90 minutes\u201d of focus, and a collective \u201cmechanism\u201d to prevent them being exposed on the break. One he also explicitly linked to their performance against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, before he arrived \u2013 the game that finally cost Ernesto Valverde his job. One that, swiftly, maybe a little too swiftly, brought excitement, recognition, a sense of belonging. For some, at least. \u201cSeti\u00e9n makes himself felt,\u201d declared the cover of El Mundo Deportivo. \u201cGreat hopes,\u201d cheered Sport. His \u201cmanifesto\u201d, they said, was clear: \u201cPossession.\u201d It was also, though, a Barcelona that struggled to find a way through; that only scored once at home \u2013 where there have been a 5-0, three 5-2s, a 4-0 and two 4-1s in the league this season \u2013 and against Granada. That didn\u2019t get the breakthrough until the last 20 minutes, just after their opponents had been reduced to 10 men for a second yellow that Granada manager Diego Mart\u00ednez rightly considered harsh. And not long after Granada had hit the post. A Bar\u00e7a that only had six shots on target. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when a team defends very deep,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said, although that does make it easier to keep possession, so those stats too have to be contextualised: Granada didn\u2019t press Barcelona high as many have done to great effect, especially away. It is also not easy without Luis Su\u00e1rez \u2013 the kind of player they\u2019d wished they had towards the end at Betis when they struggled to turn possession into goals. Of Barcelona\u2019s 921 completed passes, only a fifth went forward and, on a windy night and a dry pitch, the ball didn\u2019t circulate as fast as Seti\u00e9n wanted. It was theirs, though. Sometimes people ask: yeah, but how many of those passes were relevant? The answer, while smartarsed, is: all of them. It is a debate that Guardiola faced too, and so did the Spain team that won the World Cup. Possession is not just about creativity; it is about control, a word Seti\u00e9n used pointedlyhere, about conditioning the game. Keeping the ball is a defensive approach too, denying the opposition oxygen. For Seti\u00e9n, it is also almost an ethical question, something deep inside him. It\u2019s not just about the result, he says, but it is about the result. And that came from a familiar place, Messi scoring the only goal when he finished off a lovely move involving Puig, Busquets, Antoine Griezmann and Vidal. Whatever else changes, that doesn\u2019t, just as Seti\u00e9n suspected; just as he wished. He\u2019s watched Messi from the other side, seen his own fans applaud him, almost honoured to have been beaten by him, and admitted that he felt like doing the same. On Sunday night, he watched Messi and his teammates warm up, the ball at their feet: players he has long admired, his players now. \u201cIt gives you peace of mind to have Messi,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \u201cHe did what he\u2019s done his whole life.\u201d Talking points \u2022 When Casemiro missed the chance to score a hat-trick, he headed back to the halfway line with a grin on his face. That would have been too much, even for him. Two goals were enough to beat Sevilla; his work was done. \u2022 Diego Simeone did the sleeping gesture and tried to shake them awake. \u201cYou\u2019re asleep! You\u2019re asleep! You\u2019re asleep,\u201d he shouted, but it was no good. \u201cWe used to gift opponents a half back in October, now we\u2019ve done it again; we have to realise that the game starts when it starts,\u201d he said after Atl\u00e9tico were defeated 2-0 at Eibar, leaving them eight points off the top. This is their worst start under Simeone. \u2022 David L\u00f3pez could hardly get his words out, his voice breaking and tears appearing n his eyes. \u201cLook at them,\u201d he said, gesturing to the 3,000 Espanyol fans who had made the trip to Villarreal to see their team win 2-1. \u201cLook at our first half of the season. And they give us this. This is for them.\u201d Behind him, players were throwing shirts into the crowd, embracing and overcome with emotion. \u201cYes, we can!\u201d they chanted, which they had chanted when the bus arrived too, but now they really believed they can. Especially with RDT, a goalscorer here, and new manager Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez, who has picked up four points from six games, which is just one less than the two men who preceded him \u2013 and they had 20 games between them. That hope is for real. It\u2019s also not theirs alone after a weekend in which Alav\u00e9s and Mallorca (4-1 against Valencia!) won, Celta drew at San Mam\u00e9s and Valladolid got a point at Osasuna. Of the teams near the bottom, only Legan\u00e9s lost \u2013 they have also lost En Nesyri. Their hope, revived by Javier Aguirre, has taken quite a hit.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Hall\u2019s decision to step down as BBC director general could pave the way for the corporation to appoint its first female to the top job. Here are five of the contenders: As chief executive of Channel 4, Alex Mahon has experience of leading a public service broadcaster under pressure from the government. Mahon, the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5, is currently overseeing the relocation of Channel 4\u2019s operation out of London. She has said Britain\u2019s public service broadcasters play a vital role in the \u201cnational conversation\u201d that Silicon Valley players have no interest in. Charlotte Moore is the BBC director of content, responsible for a budget of more than \u00a31bn. She has shown a willingness to stand up to the government in the past, defending the corporation\u2019s \u201cunashamedly popular\u201d and distinctive television, and warning over future erosion of its independence. She has also taken a swipe at the BBC\u2019s modern-day rivals, warning that Netflix and Amazon are motivated by profit rather than what is good for audiences. Gail Rebuck is the chair of Penguin Random House UK. She has worked in publishing for more than four decades and was formerly a member of the government\u2019s creative industries taskforce. In 1998, she founded the World Book Day charity. Rebuck, who sits as a Labour peer in the House of Lords, has been linked with a top job at the BBC for decades. Jay Hunt was once considered a likely contender to be the first female director general, having held a series of senior jobs including director of programmes at Channel 5, controller of BBC One, and chief creative officer of Channel 4 \u2013 where she poached the Great British Bake Off. She had also been mentioned as a strong candidate to become chief executive of Channel 4 but missed out in 2017, with some claiming that her abrasive personality was a factor in the decision. Now overseeing European video at Apple, she may have moved into a different arena \u2013 but her experience in online content could make her an attractive candidate to the corporation. Sharon White was the former chief executive of Ofcom from 2015 until June last year when she was appointed chair of John Lewis. White has a background in economics, and before Ofcom worked as second permanent secretary to the Treasury where she was in charge of public finances. She has previously criticised the BBC for a lack of diversity and on leaving Ofcom said the broadcaster had \u201cfailed to come to terms\u201d with external regulation. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2020 because an earlier version gave the wrong name for the second byline as Polly Evans. That should have been Polly Bindman.",

What else are they going to be? Harry and Meghan Windsor?\u201d said Mark Borkowski.</p> \n<p>Changing it would be \u201cexpensive and incredibly complicated\u201d, he said. \u201cThere will be a lot of entrepreneurs out there who have been looking at variations of that name and who have been creating land grabs for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>While keeping the name might attract criticism, not keeping it would not avoid future intense scrutiny of the couple. \u201cNothing is going to stop the level of scrutiny, whatever they do\u201d Borkowski said.</p> \n<p>One possible solution would be to use Sussex Royal for charitable endeavours only, said David Haigh, the chief executive of <a href=\"https://brandfinance.com/\">Brand Finance</a>, a brand valuation consultancy.</p> \n<p>\u201cPersonally, I think they would be well advised to do that. They could have different trademarks for their commercial activities and that would make it clear to everyone they are not trying to trade on their royal heritage, at least not so obviously.\u201d</p> \n<p>There remains confusion over the exact titles Harry and Meghan will be given after they step down from royal duties.</p> \n<p>Following the Queen\u2019s announcement of the deal struck with the couple, sources indicated the official titles would change to Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.</p> \n<p>Royal commentators have expressed surprise, as placing the forename before the title has usually been reserved for divorced or widowed titled women. The ex-wife of the Duke of York , for example, became Sarah, Duchess of York following divorce. This is to distinguish them from the current holders of the same title. </p> \n<p>The couple have made applications to register Sussex Royal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/12/harry-and-meghan-seek-global-trademark-sussex-royal-brand\">as a global trademark</a> for a range of items and activities, including clothing, stationery and the running of \u201cemotional support groups\u201d, international filings suggest.</p> \n<p>Applications to trademark Sussex Royal for various goods and activities were lodged with UK intellectual property authorities last June by the couple\u2019s advisers, and ownership switched to the pair in December.</p> \n<p>Haigh said using \u201croyal\u201d in a trademark was difficult as it was a reserved word, closely guarded, and anyone trademarking it may need official permission.</p> \n<p>He said the couple had registered it in six out of 45 classes and in categories linked to charitable endeavours. If it was to change, it was better to happen at this early stage.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only problematic when it is well established and everyone is fully aware of what it is,\u201d Haigh said. \u201cAt the moment everyone knows them, but I don\u2019t think Sussex Royal is that well-known a brand. Personally, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a very good brand. I think they should get a different one.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would think more people would probably think it is more logical to have a trademark saying Harry and Meghan . The real thing is having their pulling power behind it.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said they faced the \u201cmother-of-all punch-ups\u201d protecting it in a global markets, with others snapping up domain names to cash in. \u201cThe fact is, it\u2019s a minefield. They are going to have real problems.\u201d</p> \n<p>Borkowski said: \u201cIf they haven\u2019t thought this through, which they might not have, they have got some massive challenges ahead of them.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was amended on 23 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex face an expensive and complicated battle if forced to change their Sussex Royal brand, experts have said. The future of the brand name is in doubt after the Queen banned Harry and Meghan from using their HRH styles and announced they would no longer act as official representatives of the royal family. The couple sacrificed their royal status in return for \u201ccomplete and absolute\u201d freedom from any financial constraints by Buckingham Palace over future commercial deals, sources said. The hardline move by Buckingham Palace is an unwelcome blow to the pair, who had hoped to run business ventures alongside performing some royal duties. In a passionate speech on Sunday, Harry said the couple felt they had \u201cno other option\u201d but to step away. The BBC reported on Tuesday night that he had flown out to Canada, where he, Meghan and their baby son Archie will spend the majority of their time as they begin a one-year transition period. The Sussex Royal name, featuring a monogram of H and M entwined and topped off with a crown, is at the centre of the couple\u2019s social media presence, including their new website and Instagram account, and future charitable foundation. Whether they can continue to use it is one of the many issues to be worked through, with a final decision yet to be made. Critics claim the title is not sustainable given the clear message from the Queen that the couple will not be trading on their royal credentials. One leading PR said the pair should fight tooth and nail to keep it. \u201cThey have to fight for it. What else are they going to be? Harry and Meghan Windsor?\u201d said Mark Borkowski. Changing it would be \u201cexpensive and incredibly complicated\u201d, he said. \u201cThere will be a lot of entrepreneurs out there who have been looking at variations of that name and who have been creating land grabs for it.\u201d While keeping the name might attract criticism, not keeping it would not avoid future intense scrutiny of the couple. \u201cNothing is going to stop the level of scrutiny, whatever they do\u201d Borkowski said. One possible solution would be to use Sussex Royal for charitable endeavours only, said David Haigh, the chief executive of Brand Finance, a brand valuation consultancy. \u201cPersonally, I think they would be well advised to do that. They could have different trademarks for their commercial activities and that would make it clear to everyone they are not trying to trade on their royal heritage, at least not so obviously.\u201d There remains confusion over the exact titles Harry and Meghan will be given after they step down from royal duties. Following the Queen\u2019s announcement of the deal struck with the couple, sources indicated the official titles would change to Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Royal commentators have expressed surprise, as placing the forename before the title has usually been reserved for divorced or widowed titled women. The ex-wife of the Duke of York , for example, became Sarah, Duchess of York following divorce. This is to distinguish them from the current holders of the same title. The couple have made applications to register Sussex Royal as a global trademark for a range of items and activities, including clothing, stationery and the running of \u201cemotional support groups\u201d, international filings suggest. Applications to trademark Sussex Royal for various goods and activities were lodged with UK intellectual property authorities last June by the couple\u2019s advisers, and ownership switched to the pair in December. Haigh said using \u201croyal\u201d in a trademark was difficult as it was a reserved word, closely guarded, and anyone trademarking it may need official permission. He said the couple had registered it in six out of 45 classes and in categories linked to charitable endeavours. If it was to change, it was better to happen at this early stage. \u201cIt\u2019s only problematic when it is well established and everyone is fully aware of what it is,\u201d Haigh said. \u201cAt the moment everyone knows them, but I don\u2019t think Sussex Royal is that well-known a brand. Personally, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a very good brand. I think they should get a different one. \u201cI would think more people would probably think it is more logical to have a trademark saying Harry and Meghan . The real thing is having their pulling power behind it.\u201d He said they faced the \u201cmother-of-all punch-ups\u201d protecting it in a global markets, with others snapping up domain names to cash in. \u201cThe fact is, it\u2019s a minefield. They are going to have real problems.\u201d Borkowski said: \u201cIf they haven\u2019t thought this through, which they might not have, they have got some massive challenges ahead of them.\u201d This article was amended on 23 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "Among the gifts the Sardines \u2013 the Italian movement facing off against the far-right politics of Matteo Salvini \u2013 received in recent weeks were six works of art by the late Aldo Borgonzoni, a painter and anti-fascist resistance fighter. Borgonzoni\u2019s granddaughter is Lucia Borgonzoni, the far-right candidate seeking to bring an end to 70 years of leftwing rule in Emilia-Romagna on Sunday in regional elections that will prove an important test for the stability of the national government coalition between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S), and may decide whether Salvini and the far-right League return to power. The paintings were donated by her father, Giambattista, a self-described \u201cveteran communist\u201d who said last week \u201cthe Sardines are better than my daughter\u2019s party\u201d. \u201cHe gave us another painting today,\u201d Mattia Santori, one of the young founders of the Sardines, told the Guardian on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to sell them to raise money for the movement.\u201d Lucia Borgonzoni, 43, is among the crop of Emilia-Romagna natives who have jettisoned the leftwing ideals of their parents and grandparents and helped bolster support for Salvini\u2019s League, in the region that gave birth to Italian socialism. The Sardines sprang up in mid-November to counteract the rising popularity of the League, which, together with its allies, the fellow far-right Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia, triumphed in Emilia-Romagna in the 2018 national elections and again in last year\u2019s European parliamentary ballot. The Sardines \u2013 so-called because they have packed out city squares for demonstrations \u2013 have managed to galvanise support across the country in recent months, bringing an estimated 40,000 people together in Bologna\u2019s Piazza VIII Agosto on Sunday in the final major show of strength before the Emilia-Romagna local election. Many believe that a defeat for the PD in Emilia-Romagna could lead to a government collapse as it would increase tensions between the PD and its coalition partner M5S, with more MPs from both absconding as their faith in the alliance dwindles further. The outcome of the vote will also dictate the future of the Sardines. \u201cWe\u2019ll know what kind of impact this experiment has had after that,\u201d said Santori. \u201cBut what we have understood is that, for many people, we are the first real alternative to the populism of the right.\u201d Final polls before the blackout period began on 11 January put Borgonzoni and the League slightly behind Stefano Bonaccini, the incumbent Emilia-Romagna president from the PD. Bonaccini, elected president in 2014, has distanced himself from his party\u2019s troubles at national level, focusing his campaign on local issues. Holding a placard at Sunday\u2019s Sardines demonstration that read, \u201cSalvini you have the delusion of omnipotence\u201d, Giulia Martelli, 29, said: \u201cI really hope we can avoid the worst. I have always supported the PD, even though it has made a lot of mistakes as a party. In Bologna we have a wonderful administration, and that is why I still trust them.\u201d The PD is counting on its good track record in governing Emilia-Romagna to help it cling to power. The region, home to parmesan cheese and Parma ham, is the second richest in Italy and boasts a rich cultural history as well as an enviable standard of social care. But that has not prevented a rebellion in towns and villages beyond the defiantly leftwing hubs of cities such as Bologna and Modena. The first inkling that change was afoot came in 2009, when the League, at the time called the Northern League, captured Bondeno, a small town close to Ferrara. \u201cThe problem with the left is that they destroyed all our resources \u2013 they closed our hospital and factories,\u201d said Roberto Palazzi, who owns a tyre business in Bondeno. \u201cLife is better under the League \u2013 they are bringing back health services and help businesses like mine. The mayor is also close to citizens, he is not someone who hides away. We all have his mobile number.\u201d To prove it he calls Fabio Bergamini, elected mayor in 2015, and tells him an English journalist would like to speak to him. Bergamini, who also hails from a leftwing family background, arrives within minutes. He is friends with Alan Fabbri, the former Bondeno mayor who leads Ferrara, the first major Emilia-Romagna city seized by the League last June. \u201cWhat the left did in the decades after the war was wonderful,\u201d Bergamini said. \u201cSchools for everyone, healthcare for everyone, jobs for everyone \u2013 that was the historical left. Then they forgot the working class \u2013 the farmers, the factory workers \u2013 and started to serve the banks and Brussels. When you think about it, the real left is us.\u201d Salvini, whose party is the biggest in Italy, has been touring every nook of the region, pledging to banish communism while sharing photos of himself eating tagliatelle bolognese and kissing blocks of parmesan cheese. \u201cSalvini has been engaging people in forgotten places as he tries to nationalise these elections,\u201d said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Rome\u2019s Sapienza university. \u201cWhereas the PD has done nothing to engage society in a different way; they have been in power for so long that they believe they are immortal. But if they lose in a place like Emilia-Romagna then this shows the rage against the political class is stronger than we thought.\u201d As for the Sardines, Diletti said: \u201cIf Bonaccini loses, they lose too.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has hinted Boris Johnson could try to block a peerage for John Bercow if the former Speaker is nominated by Jeremy Corbyn. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said it would be a break in convention if reports are true that Labour is preparing to put Bercow\u2019s name forward for the dissolution honours list. It is usual for former Speakers to be nominated for entry to the House of Lords by their own party, and Bercow originally joined the House of Commons as a Conservative MP. However, Johnson is not expected to offer a peerage to Bercow, who was instrumental in giving parliamentary time to MPs opposed to Brexit. There were reports over the weekend \u2013 not denied by Labour \u2013 that Corbyn has included Bercow\u2019s name on a list of nominations by the Labour party. But No 10 suggested Bercow may have to join Labour if he wants a peerage based on the party\u2019s nomination. The spokesman said: \u201cIt is a long-standing convention for the leader of the opposition to nominate members of their party for a peerage.\u201d Bercow\u2019s possible nomination has been the subject of controversy, with former Black Rod, Lt Gen David Leakey, telling the LBC radio station it would not be a good idea. He highlighted criticism of Bercow over his record on tackling bullying in the House of Commons. An independent report by Dame Laura Cox in October 2018 said there was a tradition of \u201cdeference and silence\u201d that \u201cactively sought to cover up abusive conduct\u201d and gave no protection to those reporting bullying or sexual harassment. It found that parliament\u2019s current leadership was incapable of changing a widespread culture of bullying and harassment, and suggested officials including Bercow should consider standing down. Labour\u2019s nominations for the House of Lords were also expected to include Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff Karie Murphy, despite the current inquiry into how the party has dealt with alleged antisemitism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The Jewish Labour Movement said Murphy\u2019s nomination was \u201cdeeply inappropriate and must be rescinded immediately\u201d. \u201cJeremy Corbyn is using his final weeks in office to reward failure,\u201d the group added.

Together we must continue to work towards our future with redoubled effort, building bridges and joint initiatives. The British people who mobilised against Brexit showed us the way. Never in the history of the EU have we seen such popular demonstrations in favour of Europe. Nor should we resign ourselves to the notion that the EU without the UK is set in stone for ever.

We must demand that citizens and associations from the UK (as well as from Ukraine and the Balkans) are allowed to participate in one way or another. I will confess to something else. For a long time, the supremacy of English as the de facto European lingua franca seemed excessive to me. The dominance of English seemed to challenge the European motto \u201cunited in diversity\u201d. Now I think that after Brexit, we should fight to keep English on the European stage, including in the EU institutions \u2013 as a reminder of an absence, and the promise of a return.</p> <p>\u2022 Eric Jozsef is a French journalist based in Rome and co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.europanow.eu/?lang=en\" title=\"\">EuropaNow!</a> civic association</p>",

We forgot that the roots of the European Union \u2013 which should not, of course, be confused with the roots of Europe \u2013 lie in the memory of the 20th century, in the desire to overcome two world wars and in the fight against totalitarianism, and that the UK, with its famous democratic tradition, played a decisive and essential part in this fight. We ignored the threat that the Brexiters\u2019 victory poses to all European democracies by the success it represents for the forces of extremism. All this to the great satisfaction of Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump who, in their geopolitical ambitions, want nothing more than divided Europeans and the disintegration of the EU, and are working daily to achieve it. Difficult times lie ahead for our fragile democracies. Beyond Brexit we must remain united, and not abandon the idea of the UK formally returning to the European family in due course. In the meantime, we must continue to reimagine the EU and to act in concert with the British people. All the more so since the UK general election on 12 December showed that opponents of Brexit are in the majority (since the \u201cremain\u201d or second-referendum-backing parties won more votes than the Tories and Brexit party), voters in the big cities and, above all, among younger people in Britain reject a narrow, isolationist future. Together we must continue to work towards our future with redoubled effort, building bridges and joint initiatives. The British people who mobilised against Brexit showed us the way. Never in the history of the EU have we seen such popular demonstrations in favour of Europe. Nor should we resign ourselves to the notion that the EU without the UK is set in stone for ever. Is it not the hallmark of democracies, unlike authoritarian regimes, that voters reserve the right to change their minds? The new president of the commission, Ursula von der Leyen, wants to involve civil society in a new initiative to discuss the future of Europe. We must demand that citizens and associations from the UK (as well as from Ukraine and the Balkans) are allowed to participate in one way or another. I will confess to something else. For a long time, the supremacy of English as the de facto European lingua franca seemed excessive to me. The dominance of English seemed to challenge the European motto \u201cunited in diversity\u201d. Now I think that after Brexit, we should fight to keep English on the European stage, including in the EU institutions \u2013 as a reminder of an absence, and the promise of a return. \u2022 Eric Jozsef is a French journalist based in Rome and co-founder of the EuropaNow! civic association",

All novels are or should be written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.\u201d ~Anne Bront\u00eb, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall . Today is the 200th anniversary of Anne Bronte\u2019s birth; frequently overshadowed by her sisters works, her writing is every bit as skilful and passionate as theirs. Agnes Grey is, admittedly, not as accomplished as The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall; it errs towards formula and lacks passion. If you have t read The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall however, I\u2019d certainly recommend it. Strikingly, it\u2019s arguably the most feminist Bronte novel. . . #bookstagram #bookphotography #booksbooksbooks #otd #onthisday #annebronte #annebronte200 #bronte #thetenantofwildfellhall #agnesgrey #beautifulbooks #bookcovers #penguinenglishlibrary #classicliterature #protofeminism #earlyfeminism #feministfriday #guardianbooks #sarahs89reads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sarahs89reads/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Sarah&lt;/a&gt; (@sarahs89reads) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-01-17T16:34:33+00:00&quot;&gt;Jan 17, 2020 at 8:34am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Anne Bronte books</figcaption> </figure>",

It\u2019s pretty much what I thought it would be, only much better. Where has he been all my life? Wodehouse\u2019s writing style was clearly a major influence on Terry Pratchett, but it\u2019s one of those rare occasions when you can accuse one author of being similar to another, while meaning nothing but praise for both of them. Fantastic stuff.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Day of the Owl by Patricia Highsmith has enthralled <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The narrative centres on 29-year-old Robert Forester who has recently moved to a small town in Pennsylvania to escape his former partner, Nickie, a woman who continues to give him a hard time on the phone, out of what seems sheer malice. Battling loneliness and depression, he has picked up the odd habit of watching an unknown young woman as she goes about her life at home. He isn\u2019t a conventional Peeping Tom, there is nothing sexual about his behaviour, rather the tranquility he gets from her daily routine.</p> <p>But rather like a Simenon <em>romans durs</em>, which I was often reminded of, we know Highsmith, and despite Forester\u2019s apparent innocence, there is bleakness here, and it isn\u2019t long until the story becomes much darker. Again like Simenon, there is that enthralling sense of destruction and despair as the story edges closer to its denouement. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of dark and twisted fiction.</p> </blockquote> <p>James Baldwin\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk has shocked <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17381240\">greenmill</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My, this is an angry novel, which portrays the injustices and humiliations heaped upon black Americans in the pre-civil rights era, wrapped up in a love story that is carried on in the worst imaginable circumstances. The writing is superb, the plot and characters all too believable, and the polemical style and frequently obscene language are wholly justified by the social context. Shocking and highly recommended.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101979368\">JoannieLuvsBocce</a> has been enjoying a reread of Mervyn Peake\u2019s Gormenghast trilogy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had read these all at once when home from college on Christmas break back in 1973, so my memory of the story pretty much runs together in my mind, but I am pleasantly surprised at how much I remember. The thing that stands out in my reread is the rich atmosphere created by the slow, ponderous pace of the storytelling &#xa0;\u2013 blatantly out of step with my 21st-century sensibility. But Mervyn Peake sure does know how to tell a story \u2013&#xa0;an old-fashioned master craftsman at work.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Eighth Life by Nino Haratischvili (translated by Charlotte Collins and Ruth Martin) has proved \u201cutterly convincing\u201d for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101959678\">ZorbaHeather</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The novel demonstrates how women suffered during 20th-century Russia. It is taking a while, but each time I pick the book up, I am back with characters in whom I am deeply invested. What a writer Ms Haratischvili is ... There was an article a while back about toxic masculinity in literature, as if there were no grey. Well here you\u2019ve got it black, white, grey, both sexes and you\u2019ve got the context of time (Siberia, purges, mass exterminations, neighbour reporting neighbour) and yet the humanity is what stands out. Human beings striving to survive. But I\u2019m preaching. The stories are connected, and it is like joining old friends when I pick up the book. And I love that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lost Time \u2013 Lectures on Proust in a Soviet Prison Camp by J\u00f3zef Czapski (translated by Eric Karpeles) has similarly impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This beautiful little book, with its horrible origins, is an inspiring addition to the shelf of prison literature.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101510359\">CCCubbon </a>recommends Echoes of the City by Lars Saabye Christensen (translated by Don Bartlett):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am delighted. It\u2019s a tale about Oslo emerging from the constraints of the second world war. I have bought the book in print form for I wish to savour it slowly, armed with my magnifying glass, which has a built-in light, to help. I read the first pages and there was a description of Frogner Park with its regiment of statues gleaming white \u2026 We spent time there last year, wandering among those cool figures, marvelling at the feel of them and gazing at their sightless eyes looking into the distance. I loved Oslo. Recently I read a phrase something like, \u201cIs this all I am, can I not transform myself into something else? I am limited only by myself.\u201d Something like that. Could I transform myself into a citizen of that wonderful city? Maybe not, but I may lose myself in the book.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sounds like a good place to get lost.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>The New York Public Library has released the titles of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/new-york-public-librarys-most-checked-out-books-say-a-lot-about-what-we-read-and-why/2020/01/11/c8578174-33d9-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html?utm_campaign=book_club&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=Newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_books&amp;wpmm=1\">10 most checked-out books in its 125-year history.</a></p></li> <li><p>It turns out that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/books/review/help-desk-judith-newman.html?te=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=edit_bk_20200117?campaign_id=69&amp;instance_id=15286&amp;segment_id=20437&amp;user_id=de58d5d545b07b9e09939e21818c932a&amp;regi_id=4174067420200117\">being kind might not be a problem after all</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Celebrating the<a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/a-quiet-roar/\"> 200th birthday of Anne Bront\u00eb</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The Atlantic has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2020/01/original-fiction-atlantic/604879/\">re-committed to publishing short fiction</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The best 18th-century toilets were designed to look like books <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/book-toilets\">says Jessica Leigh Hester</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Christopher Priest\u2019s 100 \u201c<a href=\"https://christopher-priest.co.uk/a-hundred-books\">key books</a>\u201d.

Human beings striving to survive. But I\u2019m preaching. The stories are connected, and it is like joining old friends when I pick up the book. And I love that. Lost Time \u2013 Lectures on Proust in a Soviet Prison Camp by J\u00f3zef Czapski (translated by Eric Karpeles) has similarly impressed vermontlogger: This beautiful little book, with its horrible origins, is an inspiring addition to the shelf of prison literature. Finally, CCCubbon recommends Echoes of the City by Lars Saabye Christensen (translated by Don Bartlett): I am delighted. It\u2019s a tale about Oslo emerging from the constraints of the second world war. I have bought the book in print form for I wish to savour it slowly, armed with my magnifying glass, which has a built-in light, to help. I read the first pages and there was a description of Frogner Park with its regiment of statues gleaming white \u2026 We spent time there last year, wandering among those cool figures, marvelling at the feel of them and gazing at their sightless eyes looking into the distance. I loved Oslo. Recently I read a phrase something like, \u201cIs this all I am, can I not transform myself into something else? I am limited only by myself.\u201d Something like that. Could I transform myself into a citizen of that wonderful city? Maybe not, but I may lose myself in the book. Sounds like a good place to get lost.

      "body": "<p>It felt like a regular, gentle Sunday morning in Brackel, the district to the east of the centre where Borussia Dortmund train. The reserve team trained and senior squad strikers Paco Alc\u00e1cer and Erling Braut Haaland joined them, to get an extra few miles in their legs. Midfielder Julian Weigl, who recently joined Benfica, dropped in to say hello, bringing a gift of his shirt from his new club for his friend Axel Witsel, with the former now wearing the No 28 that the latter also wore in his own spell at Est\u00e1dio da Luz nine years back.</p> \n<p>Just as Weigl had gone from tempest to tranquillity, stepping out of his first Lisbon derby on Friday night, so had his old teammates. Their Sunday morning might have felt like a slightly jarring change of gear, but then again very little about Dortmund\u2019s first game back after the <em>Winterpause</em> made sense.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/20/ciro-immobile-makes-sampdoria-suffer-as-lazio-join-serie-a-title-race\">Ciro Immobile makes Sampdoria suffer as Lazio join Serie A title race | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Saturday\u2019s return had seen Lucien Favre\u2019s best-laid plans fly out of the window as Augsburg picked familiar holes in BVB, and their travelling fans were left to ask why it was all happening again? Why did their coach choose to go into the game with such an uneven back three of Lukasz Piszczek, Mats Hummels and Manuel Akanji, with their varying states of mobility, who ended up playing with about as much cohesion as a unit as those initial fears would suggest?</p> \n<p>What they ended up with, 11 minutes into the second half and with Dortmund 3-1 down, was a back four as Haaland replaced Piszczek and any semblance of caution was thrown to the wind. Favre and company were busking it again, after the careless shelling of points from dominant positions in the final week before Christmas left them with plenty of work to do in 2020. It had all been worryingly familiar as they frittered chances aplenty \u2013 especially Marco Reus, with the skipper having an off day \u2013 while offering them back to the hosts with interest. Marco Richter\u2019s arrow of a strike, the goal of the game which put Augsburg two-up just 19 seconds into the second half, showed that Martin Schmidt\u2019s team weren\u2019t necessarily in need of favours.</p> \n<p>What they got afterwards, however, was a whirlwind. Haaland gatecrashed the Bundesliga just as he had done the Champions League with Salzburg back in September. One hundred and eighty-three seconds after coming on he opened his Dortmund account with a precise finish from Jadon Sancho\u2019s pass. After a sublime equaliser from the Englishman there was more from his fellow teenager; a second tapped in after Thorgan Hazard took goalkeeper Tomas Koubek out of the picture, belatedly ratified after it was incorrectly flagged as offside in the first instance, and a third that was all his own, galloping from the halfway line after Reus\u2019s pass released him and refusing to concede as the disobedient ball peeled back towards him off the pitch, carrying on to tuck a composed finish into the corner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1219174635440365568\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Erling Braut H\u00e5land is a real talent \ud83d\udd25<br><br>The 19-year-old scored a stunning 23-minute hat-trick on his Borussia Dortmund debut \ud83d\udc4f<a href=\"https://t.co/ItNuFtRk0U\">pic.twitter.com/ItNuFtRk0U</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1219174635440365568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 20, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had that kind of striker since Robert Lewandowski,\u201d Reus had told Sky during the club\u2019s traditional winter training in Mallorca, a quote which had barely left his mouth before it was twisted into the club captain hailing the 19-year-old as the new Lewandowski, trimming off the inconvenience of Reus going on to elaborate on Haaland\u2019s physical profile and out-and-out goalscoring instincts. All of a sudden nobody was arguing, whether they were surveying the quote\u2019s true sentiment or the mischievously reinvented alternative.</p> \n<p>The battle now was to find a way of framing such a feat. Haaland was already the second-youngest hat-trick scorer in the Bundesliga, and the first substitute to score three times in the competition. In terms of framing him in Dortmund iconography, he followed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in scoring a hat-trick on his debut which, unusually, the now-Arsenal striker also did at Augsburg, on the first day of the 2013-14 season. \u201cIf Haaland has the same success,\u201d reflected Reus, \u201cI\u2019d sign up for that right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was left to the assembled media to gently tease the new hero over whether his fitness was good enough to start against K\u00f6ln on Friday (\u201chow did it look to you?\u201d the Norwegian replied with an arch grin). Favre has played it smartly thus far with Haaland, recognising a rustiness in his game after a recent muscle injury, but even if he wanted to take it slowly with him, he may not have the option now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Alc\u00e1cer, the squad\u2019s one authentic penalty-box presence beyond Haaland, could well be on his way out after a frustrating first half of the season, beset by fitness problems and in a situation now where trust has been gently eroded on both sides of the relationship \u2013 he has been frustrated not to play more, and the staff have not been satisfied enough with his efforts in training.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of other things to think about. \u201cIf BVB want to play for the title,\u201d wrote Ruhr Nachrichten\u2019s Florian Groeger with some understatement, \u201cthey must get their defensive weaknesses under control as quickly as possible.\u201d For now, though, it would seem rude not to simply bask in the glow of their new superhero.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Leaders Leipzig began in sluggish fashion, trailing and toiling against Union at the half. They ended up firing in the second 45 minutes \u2013 and who needs a tactical rethink when you have finishing like Timo Werner\u2019s, whose rocket of an equaliser brought them level? He went on to score again after Marcel Sabitzer put Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side in front, to make it 14 in nine Bundesliga games. \u201cOur first half was nothing,\u201d Werner chided. \u201cIt could have been worse.\u201d Even if they hope for January reinforcement, their direction for the coming months is already clear.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1218864773149970432\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How good is this from Timo Werner?! \ud83e\udd2f<br><br>A special player having a special season \ud83d\udd25<br><br>What a strike! <a href=\"https://t.co/Dc8DNTZI13\">pic.twitter.com/Dc8DNTZI13</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1218864773149970432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 19, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Bayern trimmed that lead to four points \u2013 and do we say Leipzig are Bayern\u2019s most realistic challenger, or vice versa now? \u2013 with their win at Hertha, which also began slowly before the grind commuted itself to a stroll in the latter stages after Thomas M\u00fcller broke the deadlock just before the hour. Hertha, who were allowed to have J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann on the bench after providing the DfB with a photocopy of his coaching licence which is at home in California, remain a long way from their ambitions, still trying to persuade big names to join them after this <em>Klinsi-Klatsche</em> (hammering), as Bild called it.</p> \n<p>\u2022 There\u2019s no doubt about Peter Bosz\u2019s status, after he extended his contract with Leverkusen to 2022 on Friday. They celebrated with a fine 4-1 win at Paderborn, with two goals from Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz\u2019s first since September.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Hats off again too to David Wagner, who guided Schalke to a 2-0 over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, showing every bit of his trademark grit. \u201cThe manner was just as important to me as the result,\u201d he said, with a trip to Bayern on the menu next

      "bodyText": "It felt like a regular, gentle Sunday morning in Brackel, the district to the east of the centre where Borussia Dortmund train. The reserve team trained and senior squad strikers Paco Alc\u00e1cer and Erling Braut Haaland joined them, to get an extra few miles in their legs. Midfielder Julian Weigl, who recently joined Benfica, dropped in to say hello, bringing a gift of his shirt from his new club for his friend Axel Witsel, with the former now wearing the No 28 that the latter also wore in his own spell at Est\u00e1dio da Luz nine years back. Just as Weigl had gone from tempest to tranquillity, stepping out of his first Lisbon derby on Friday night, so had his old teammates. Their Sunday morning might have felt like a slightly jarring change of gear, but then again very little about Dortmund\u2019s first game back after the Winterpause made sense. Saturday\u2019s return had seen Lucien Favre\u2019s best-laid plans fly out of the window as Augsburg picked familiar holes in BVB, and their travelling fans were left to ask why it was all happening again? Why did their coach choose to go into the game with such an uneven back three of Lukasz Piszczek, Mats Hummels and Manuel Akanji, with their varying states of mobility, who ended up playing with about as much cohesion as a unit as those initial fears would suggest? What they ended up with, 11 minutes into the second half and with Dortmund 3-1 down, was a back four as Haaland replaced Piszczek and any semblance of caution was thrown to the wind. Favre and company were busking it again, after the careless shelling of points from dominant positions in the final week before Christmas left them with plenty of work to do in 2020. It had all been worryingly familiar as they frittered chances aplenty \u2013 especially Marco Reus, with the skipper having an off day \u2013 while offering them back to the hosts with interest. Marco Richter\u2019s arrow of a strike, the goal of the game which put Augsburg two-up just 19 seconds into the second half, showed that Martin Schmidt\u2019s team weren\u2019t necessarily in need of favours. What they got afterwards, however, was a whirlwind. Haaland gatecrashed the Bundesliga just as he had done the Champions League with Salzburg back in September. One hundred and eighty-three seconds after coming on he opened his Dortmund account with a precise finish from Jadon Sancho\u2019s pass. After a sublime equaliser from the Englishman there was more from his fellow teenager; a second tapped in after Thorgan Hazard took goalkeeper Tomas Koubek out of the picture, belatedly ratified after it was incorrectly flagged as offside in the first instance, and a third that was all his own, galloping from the halfway line after Reus\u2019s pass released him and refusing to concede as the disobedient ball peeled back towards him off the pitch, carrying on to tuck a composed finish into the corner. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had that kind of striker since Robert Lewandowski,\u201d Reus had told Sky during the club\u2019s traditional winter training in Mallorca, a quote which had barely left his mouth before it was twisted into the club captain hailing the 19-year-old as the new Lewandowski, trimming off the inconvenience of Reus going on to elaborate on Haaland\u2019s physical profile and out-and-out goalscoring instincts. All of a sudden nobody was arguing, whether they were surveying the quote\u2019s true sentiment or the mischievously reinvented alternative. The battle now was to find a way of framing such a feat. Haaland was already the second-youngest hat-trick scorer in the Bundesliga, and the first substitute to score three times in the competition. In terms of framing him in Dortmund iconography, he followed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in scoring a hat-trick on his debut which, unusually, the now-Arsenal striker also did at Augsburg, on the first day of the 2013-14 season. \u201cIf Haaland has the same success,\u201d reflected Reus, \u201cI\u2019d sign up for that right now.\u201d It was left to the assembled media to gently tease the new hero over whether his fitness was good enough to start against K\u00f6ln on Friday (\u201chow did it look to you?\u201d the Norwegian replied with an arch grin). Favre has played it smartly thus far with Haaland, recognising a rustiness in his game after a recent muscle injury, but even if he wanted to take it slowly with him, he may not have the option now. Alc\u00e1cer, the squad\u2019s one authentic penalty-box presence beyond Haaland, could well be on his way out after a frustrating first half of the season, beset by fitness problems and in a situation now where trust has been gently eroded on both sides of the relationship \u2013 he has been frustrated not to play more, and the staff have not been satisfied enough with his efforts in training. There are plenty of other things to think about. \u201cIf BVB want to play for the title,\u201d wrote Ruhr Nachrichten\u2019s Florian Groeger with some understatement, \u201cthey must get their defensive weaknesses under control as quickly as possible.\u201d For now, though, it would seem rude not to simply bask in the glow of their new superhero. Talking points \u2022 Leaders Leipzig began in sluggish fashion, trailing and toiling against Union at the half. They ended up firing in the second 45 minutes \u2013 and who needs a tactical rethink when you have finishing like Timo Werner\u2019s, whose rocket of an equaliser brought them level? He went on to score again after Marcel Sabitzer put Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side in front, to make it 14 in nine Bundesliga games. \u201cOur first half was nothing,\u201d Werner chided. \u201cIt could have been worse.\u201d Even if they hope for January reinforcement, their direction for the coming months is already clear. \u2022 Bayern trimmed that lead to four points \u2013 and do we say Leipzig are Bayern\u2019s most realistic challenger, or vice versa now? \u2013 with their win at Hertha, which also began slowly before the grind commuted itself to a stroll in the latter stages after Thomas M\u00fcller broke the deadlock just before the hour. Hertha, who were allowed to have J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann on the bench after providing the DfB with a photocopy of his coaching licence which is at home in California, remain a long way from their ambitions, still trying to persuade big names to join them after this Klinsi-Klatsche (hammering), as Bild called it. \u2022 There\u2019s no doubt about Peter Bosz\u2019s status, after he extended his contract with Leverkusen to 2022 on Friday. They celebrated with a fine 4-1 win at Paderborn, with two goals from Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz\u2019s first since September. \u2022 Hats off again too to David Wagner, who guided Schalke to a 2-0 over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, showing every bit of his trademark grit. \u201cThe manner was just as important to me as the result,\u201d he said, with a trip to Bayern on the menu next weekend.",

      "body": "<p>For Ciro Immobile, football is simple: either he scores, or he suffers. Speaking to Corriere della Sera in 2017, the Lazio striker insisted he would always do whatever a manager required of him. But when his interviewer asked if it hurt to finish a game without a goal, he replied honestly: \u201cYes. Without that I feel incomplete.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is an unfamiliar sensation these days. A hat-trick against Sampdoria on Saturday brought Immobile\u2019s Serie A tally for this season to 23 goals in 19 appearances. He has netted more on his own than seven of the division\u2019s 20 teams.</p> \n<p>This is no one-man band. Immobile is the focal point for a Lazio side that plays unsparing vertical football, with players such as Luis Alberto and Sergej <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/09/sergej-milinkovic-savic-and-luis-alberto-are-leading-lazios-surge\">Milinkovic-Savic thriving in the support roles</a>. Two of Immobile\u2019s goals this weekend came from penalties. Lazio have won 13 already this season \u2013 five more than any other team \u2013 a testament to the panic they instil in opposing defences.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, carving out opportunities and converting them are two different things. Immobile\u2019s ruthlessness allowed Lazio to glide to a 5-1 victory over Samp \u2013 extending their winning run to 11 consecutive league games. One day later, Inter drew 1-1 at Lecce despite taking 24 shots.</p> \n<p>The <em>Nerazzurri</em> are not typically so shy. Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez sit third and fifth in scoring charts, respectively. Sometimes it is just not your day, although Inter have had a few such experiences lately. Four draws in six games have allowed Juventus to pull four points clear at the top. Lazio, too, can move ahead if they win their game in hand.</p> \n<p>Are the <em>Biancocelesti</em> title contenders? Immobile insisted that he and his teammates will only start taking that idea seriously if they find themselves in a similar position come spring. \u201c[For now] my eyes are fixed on the 10-point advantage we have over Roma and Atalanta [in the race for a Champions League berth].\u201d</p> \n<p>It was telling that he did not mention Milan. This was supposed to be the season when the <em>Rossoneri</em> muscled back into the top four after seven years away. After falling one point short under Gennaro Gattuso last season, the appointment of Marco Giampaolo was supposed to help them take the final step.</p> \n<p>The manager lasted seven games, four of them defeats. Although performances initially improved under his successor, Stefano Pioli, a 5-0 obliteration by Atalanta before Christmas showed how far Milan still had to go. The signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic this January felt like an attempt to mend a burst artery with a plaster. Milan finished 2019 joint-10th. A 38-year-old striker was hardly going to fire them back into Champions League contention.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df4217be4927ddbac5c390affe1a185dc7f3a434\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df4217be4927ddbac5c390affe1a185dc7f3a434/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Around 60,000 fans flocked to San Siro to watch Milan v Udinese after Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s goalscoring display against Cagliari.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around 60,000 fans flocked to San Siro to watch Milan v Udinese after Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s goalscoring display against Cagliari.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RemotePhotoPress/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What Ibrahimovic could do, though, was galvanise a group whose morale was on the floor. Almost 60,000 turned out for his first game back, at home to Sampdoria. It finished 0-0, but after the Swede scored in a 2-0 win at Cagliari, a similar crowd flocked back to San Siro for Sunday\u2019s game against Udinese.</p> \n<p>They were treated to a helter-skelter match, the tone for which was set when Gianluigi Donnarumma came hurtling out of his box in the sixth minute, colliding with Kevin Lasagna. Jens Larsen seized on the loose ball and swept it home from an acute angle.</p> \n<p>Donnarumma redeemed himself with important saves thereafter, providing the platform for his team to equalise through Ante Rebic and then take the lead through a glorious Theo Hern\u00e1ndez volley from 20 yards. Udinese thought they had rescued a draw with Lasagna\u2019s late header, but Milan snatched the points in injury time, Rebic evading a challenge on the edge of the box before picking out the bottom corner.</p> \n<p>Here was an unlikely hero. Rebic entered the game as a half-time substitute, having previously played a total of 180 minutes since joining on loan from Eintracht Frankfurt. His arrival was emblematic of the club\u2019s lack of strategic vision, a panic move at the end of a window spent in fruitless pursuit of \u00c1ngel Correa. There was no obvious home for Rebic, a winger, in Giampaolo\u2019s 4-3-1-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1218882844958822400\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude31 WHAT A HIT!<br><br>\ud83d\udd34\u26ab Theo Hern\u00e1ndez fires Milan into the lead with a brilliant volley from the corner<br><br>\ud83d\udd25 The French defender has been a goalscoring revelation at the San Siro this season <a href=\"https://t.co/GWH9dP37jo\">pic.twitter.com/GWH9dP37jo</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1218882844958822400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 19, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Even his goals this weekend served to highlight another flaw in Milan\u2019s transfer strategy: the glaring lack of depth up front. The club has been badly let down by Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek \u2013 a pale imitation of the penalty-box menace we saw last season \u2013 yet by sending Andr\u00e9 Silva to Frankfurt in exchange, and selling Patrick Cutrone, Milan left themselves with only one alternative at centre-forward: Rafael Le\u00e3o, a 20-year-old new arrival from Lille. Thus far, Pi\u0105tek and Le\u00e3o have six goals between them.</p> \n<p>Milan\u2019s problems run deeper, though. Their net spend on transfers since summer 2017 is second only to that of Manchester City, <a href=\"https://www.transfermarkt.com/transfers/einnahmenausgaben/statistik/plus/0?ids=a&amp;sa=&amp;saison_id=2017&amp;saison_id_bis=2019&amp;land_id=&amp;nat=&amp;pos=&amp;altersklasse=&amp;w_s=&amp;leihe=&amp;intern=0\">according to Transfermarkt.com</a>. It is shocking how little they have to show.</p> \n<p>At the same time, this squad is not devoid of talent. Donnarumma is established as Italy\u2019s first-choice keeper at 20 years old. Alessio Romagnoli is a fine central defender. In midfield, Ismael Bennacer is starting to show the form that led to him being voted as player of the tournament at the Africa Cup of Nations.</p> \n<p>And then there is Hern\u00e1ndez. Where Lazio have a striker who would fill in at left-back if asked, Milan have a left-back who scores more consistently than any of their strikers. Sunday\u2019s goal was his fifth of the season \u2013 most on the team.</p> \n<p>The gaps in this squad are obvious. Yet there is still enough here to compete at a higher level than they have thus far. Ibrahimovic will not transform Milan from a footballing perspective \u2013 his was a plodding performance, punctuated with one or two defence-opening flicks \u2013 yet he has at least lifted the mood. Le\u00e3o has described him as a \u201cbig brother\u201d.</p> \n<p>Time will tell if that is enough to transform their season, pulling them up into the Europa League places, at least. Sometimes football really is as simple as Immobile describes it: either you score, or you suffer. Milan are a long way from where they were meant to be this season. Yet there is still a sense of relief in a team that have found their shooting boots at last.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 If the theme of the week is goalscorers, then Juventus are finding life much easier now that Ronaldo is in form, too. His brace against Parma means that he has now scored in seven consecutive games \u2013 becoming the first to do so for the Bianconeri since David Trezeguet in 2005.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Four defeats in five games for Gennaro Gattuso at Napoli. It\u2019s almost as though Carlo Ancelotti was not the thing holding them back. Still, very encouraging signs for Fiorentina, who have won three out of four since Beppe Iachini took over as manager \u2013 including the Coppa Italia elimination of Atalanta.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Stat of the round: Lecce have now taken five points at home this season. Two of them were against Inter and Juventus.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Facial expression of the round: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattiafontana83/status/1218537542464811009\">Claudio Ranieri.</a></p>

      "bodyText": "For Ciro Immobile, football is simple: either he scores, or he suffers. Speaking to Corriere della Sera in 2017, the Lazio striker insisted he would always do whatever a manager required of him. But when his interviewer asked if it hurt to finish a game without a goal, he replied honestly: \u201cYes. Without that I feel incomplete.\u201d It is an unfamiliar sensation these days. A hat-trick against Sampdoria on Saturday brought Immobile\u2019s Serie A tally for this season to 23 goals in 19 appearances. He has netted more on his own than seven of the division\u2019s 20 teams. This is no one-man band. Immobile is the focal point for a Lazio side that plays unsparing vertical football, with players such as Luis Alberto and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic thriving in the support roles. Two of Immobile\u2019s goals this weekend came from penalties. Lazio have won 13 already this season \u2013 five more than any other team \u2013 a testament to the panic they instil in opposing defences. Still, carving out opportunities and converting them are two different things. Immobile\u2019s ruthlessness allowed Lazio to glide to a 5-1 victory over Samp \u2013 extending their winning run to 11 consecutive league games. One day later, Inter drew 1-1 at Lecce despite taking 24 shots. The Nerazzurri are not typically so shy. Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez sit third and fifth in scoring charts, respectively. Sometimes it is just not your day, although Inter have had a few such experiences lately. Four draws in six games have allowed Juventus to pull four points clear at the top. Lazio, too, can move ahead if they win their game in hand. Are the Biancocelesti title contenders? Immobile insisted that he and his teammates will only start taking that idea seriously if they find themselves in a similar position come spring. \u201c[For now] my eyes are fixed on the 10-point advantage we have over Roma and Atalanta [in the race for a Champions League berth].\u201d It was telling that he did not mention Milan. This was supposed to be the season when the Rossoneri muscled back into the top four after seven years away. After falling one point short under Gennaro Gattuso last season, the appointment of Marco Giampaolo was supposed to help them take the final step. The manager lasted seven games, four of them defeats. Although performances initially improved under his successor, Stefano Pioli, a 5-0 obliteration by Atalanta before Christmas showed how far Milan still had to go. The signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic this January felt like an attempt to mend a burst artery with a plaster. Milan finished 2019 joint-10th. A 38-year-old striker was hardly going to fire them back into Champions League contention. What Ibrahimovic could do, though, was galvanise a group whose morale was on the floor. Almost 60,000 turned out for his first game back, at home to Sampdoria. It finished 0-0, but after the Swede scored in a 2-0 win at Cagliari, a similar crowd flocked back to San Siro for Sunday\u2019s game against Udinese. They were treated to a helter-skelter match, the tone for which was set when Gianluigi Donnarumma came hurtling out of his box in the sixth minute, colliding with Kevin Lasagna. Jens Larsen seized on the loose ball and swept it home from an acute angle. Donnarumma redeemed himself with important saves thereafter, providing the platform for his team to equalise through Ante Rebic and then take the lead through a glorious Theo Hern\u00e1ndez volley from 20 yards. Udinese thought they had rescued a draw with Lasagna\u2019s late header, but Milan snatched the points in injury time, Rebic evading a challenge on the edge of the box before picking out the bottom corner. Here was an unlikely hero. Rebic entered the game as a half-time substitute, having previously played a total of 180 minutes since joining on loan from Eintracht Frankfurt. His arrival was emblematic of the club\u2019s lack of strategic vision, a panic move at the end of a window spent in fruitless pursuit of \u00c1ngel Correa. There was no obvious home for Rebic, a winger, in Giampaolo\u2019s 4-3-1-2. Even his goals this weekend served to highlight another flaw in Milan\u2019s transfer strategy: the glaring lack of depth up front. The club has been badly let down by Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek \u2013 a pale imitation of the penalty-box menace we saw last season \u2013 yet by sending Andr\u00e9 Silva to Frankfurt in exchange, and selling Patrick Cutrone, Milan left themselves with only one alternative at centre-forward: Rafael Le\u00e3o, a 20-year-old new arrival from Lille. Thus far, Pi\u0105tek and Le\u00e3o have six goals between them. Milan\u2019s problems run deeper, though. Their net spend on transfers since summer 2017 is second only to that of Manchester City, according to Transfermarkt.com. It is shocking how little they have to show. At the same time, this squad is not devoid of talent. Donnarumma is established as Italy\u2019s first-choice keeper at 20 years old. Alessio Romagnoli is a fine central defender. In midfield, Ismael Bennacer is starting to show the form that led to him being voted as player of the tournament at the Africa Cup of Nations. And then there is Hern\u00e1ndez. Where Lazio have a striker who would fill in at left-back if asked, Milan have a left-back who scores more consistently than any of their strikers. Sunday\u2019s goal was his fifth of the season \u2013 most on the team. The gaps in this squad are obvious. Yet there is still enough here to compete at a higher level than they have thus far. Ibrahimovic will not transform Milan from a footballing perspective \u2013 his was a plodding performance, punctuated with one or two defence-opening flicks \u2013 yet he has at least lifted the mood. Le\u00e3o has described him as a \u201cbig brother\u201d. Time will tell if that is enough to transform their season, pulling them up into the Europa League places, at least. Sometimes football really is as simple as Immobile describes it: either you score, or you suffer. Milan are a long way from where they were meant to be this season. Yet there is still a sense of relief in a team that have found their shooting boots at last. Talking points \u2022 If the theme of the week is goalscorers, then Juventus are finding life much easier now that Ronaldo is in form, too. His brace against Parma means that he has now scored in seven consecutive games \u2013 becoming the first to do so for the Bianconeri since David Trezeguet in 2005. \u2022 Four defeats in five games for Gennaro Gattuso at Napoli. It\u2019s almost as though Carlo Ancelotti was not the thing holding them back. Still, very encouraging signs for Fiorentina, who have won three out of four since Beppe Iachini took over as manager \u2013 including the Coppa Italia elimination of Atalanta. \u2022 Stat of the round: Lecce have now taken five points at home this season. Two of them were against Inter and Juventus. \u2022 Facial expression of the round: Claudio Ranieri.",

Sirius attracted thousands of investors from the Yorkshire area who supported ambitious plans to develop the multibillion-pound Woodsmith potash mine to become the world\u2019s biggest producer of a potent fertiliser called polyhalite. Sirius has already raised $1.2bn (\u00a3920m) to develop the Woodsmith mine but needs a further $3.8bn to complete the plans, which include two mineshafts drilled just under a mile (1.5km) into the ground and a 23-mile underground conveyor belt to transport the mineral from the Yorkshire mine to Teesside for export.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s coalition government has vowed to overturn an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d initiative by the far-right Vox party that allows parents to stop their children attending talks, workshops or classes during school hours whose content \u201cgoes against their moral principles\u201d. According to Vox, the policy \u2013 referred to as the \u201cparental pin\u201d \u2013 is designed to protect children by requiring parental permission for exposure to content relating to \u201cethical or social values or civic or sexual morals\u201d. But critics claim it will shut down debate on gender, sexual orientation, feminism and the environment as the scheme also requires parental consent for any activity relating to \u201csocially controversial moral questions or sexuality\u201d. Although the initiative featured in Vox\u2019s manifesto for last April\u2019s general election, and has been in effect since last September in the south-eastern region of Murcia \u2013 where Vox props up a regional government between the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party \u2013 it has only recently become a topic of fierce debate. Last week, Vox threatened to veto the Murcia government\u2019s annual budget unless the PP and Citizens adopted the parental pin as part of the regional education programme. Although the pin was not signed into law, the regional budget was agreed after a deal was reached to allow \u201cfamilies to educate their children freely, without any kind of impositions, through the express permission of families when it comes to their children\u2019s participation\u201d in extracurricular classes and activities. The debate could have more national consequences as Vox has also played kingmaker to PP-Citizens coalition regional governments in Madrid and Andaluc\u00eda. The new central government of the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) and the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance, said last week that it would work to have the scheme overturned \u2013 by legal means if necessary \u2013 as it \u201cgoes against constitutional values\u201d. Spain\u2019s new equalities minister, Irene Montero, described the measure as an attempt at educational censorship. \u201cThe sons and daughters of homophobic parents have the same right as everyone else to be educated about respect, the promotion of human rights and being able to love whoever they want,\u201d she said last week. \u201cThe sons and daughters of sexist parents also have the same right to be educated about equality and feminism.\u201d On Monday, eight regional education ministers from the PSOE published an open letter decrying the parental pin as a measure that would \u201crupture school harmony and the culture of dialogue and reflection and impose a blind and uncritical authoritarianism\u201d. Pablo Casado, leader of the PP, said a balance needed to be found between freedom of choice and information for parents, adding that he thought most \u201csensible\u201d Spaniards wanted to decide what kind of education their children receive. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in a country where parents have to be subject to the whims of what a politician or bureaucrat says,\u201d Casado said on Monday. He also renewed his attack on the new government\u2019s decision to appoint a former justice minister, Dolores Delgado, as the new attorney general, saying the outrage over the parental pin was a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to distract from criticisms of the move.

This has been by far my most successful court in my career. I love coming back to Australia; the land of tennis. I want to thank everybody for staying almost until midnight and supporting both players.</p> <p>I thought I started off well. I was great up in the first set, he came back, it was a close tiebreaker. Second set I played really well, high percentage of first serves in. Then he turned it around, he was not missing much and putting a lot of first serves in in the third set. Credit to him for fighting. He\u2019s a very powerful player, brings a lot of strength in his shots on the court, so congratulations for a great match from him.</p> <p>[On his 900th win] I\u2019m just starting. I\u2019m obviously very proud of all the achievements but at the same time, I try to remind myself how grateful I have to be. I\u2019m still playing at a very high level at the sport that I love. I was a four year old, grabbed a tennis racquet for the first time. Saw it on the TV. Serbia doesn\u2019t really have a tennis tradition, at least at the time. Everything seemed quite impossible at the time but here we are, 25 years later and I can\u2019t take things for granted. I\u2019m just trying to enjoy every moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11cffb275cdc0af37eb72294bc4a3c898a5846d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cffb275cdc0af37eb72294bc4a3c898a5846d8/0_114_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic celebrates after winning his match against Germany\u2019s Jan-Lennard Struff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic celebrates after winning his match against Germany\u2019s Jan-Lennard Struff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-20T13:04:41.844Z\">at 1.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e259d7a8f08a6950eb45549\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-20T12:33:25.968Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Novak Djokovic defeats Jan-Lennard Struff 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 6-1</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Novak Djokovic moves into the second round with only minimal issues.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. Thanks for following and we will be back tomorrow for day two of the Australian Open. You can find tomorrow\u2019s full order of play here. Here is Kevin Mitchell on another Coco Gauff win against Venus Williams at another slam. First of all, it\u2019s great to be back in this arena that has a very special place in my heart. This has been by far my most successful court in my career. I love coming back to Australia; the land of tennis. I want to thank everybody for staying almost until midnight and supporting both players. I thought I started off well. I was great up in the first set, he came back, it was a close tiebreaker. Second set I played really well, high percentage of first serves in. Then he turned it around, he was not missing much and putting a lot of first serves in in the third set. Credit to him for fighting. He\u2019s a very powerful player, brings a lot of strength in his shots on the court, so congratulations for a great match from him. [On his 900th win] I\u2019m just starting. I\u2019m obviously very proud of all the achievements but at the same time, I try to remind myself how grateful I have to be. I\u2019m still playing at a very high level at the sport that I love. I was a four year old, grabbed a tennis racquet for the first time. Saw it on the TV. Serbia doesn\u2019t really have a tennis tradition, at least at the time. Everything seemed quite impossible at the time but here we are, 25 years later and I can\u2019t take things for granted. I\u2019m just trying to enjoy every moment. Novak Djokovic moves into the second round with only minimal issues. He did so in style: an incredible angled forehand return passing shot winner brought up triple match point point, then another great return sealed the win. That is Djokovic\u2019s 69th victory at the Australian Open as he chases his 8th title. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 5-1* Jan-Lennard Struff: No problems for Djokovic in his own service game. With the help of some big serving and then a crushing inside out forehand at the close, he moves to within a game of victory. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 *4-1 Jan-Lennard Struff: Djokovic secures the double break, this time with plenty of help from Struff. The German dumped a forehand into the net at 30-30 and then double faulted on break point to meekly hand over his service game. The energy Struff demonstrated for three sets looks all but kaputt now and the defending champion is well on his way to victory. What a formidable performance from Shuai Zhang. Stephens served for the match at 6-2 5-4 after an incredible hour of tennis, then Zhang responded with a flurry of winners to break back before rolling all the way to victory. That will be tough to take for Stephens, who could have secured a victory that set her back on the right track. Instead, a bitter three set loss. Third set: Sloane Stephens 6-2 5-7 *2-5 Shuai Zhang: After Stephens stepped up and pegged back two consecutive games, Zhang responded with a brilliant hold to move to within a game of victory. Despite holding the lead and having all to lose, Zhang continues to take the ball on off both wings and take Stephens on. Impressive. Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 2-0* Jan-Lennard Struff: After the three double faults in his previous service game, it seems that Djokovic is back to serving from the skies. He broke Struff to open the fourth set, then he slammed down four big serves, including an ace and an unreturned serve, to consolidate his opening break. 9 of the first 8 points of the set have fallen his way. Third set: Sloane Stephens 6-2 5-7 *1-4 Shuai Zhang: Astonishingly, Sloane Stephens just won her first game since serving for the match at 6-2 *5-4 25 minutes ago. That was seven games in a row for the Chinese number two, who has flipped this match quite spectacularly. Third set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 2-6 Jan-Lennard Struff: Oh dear. Novak Djokovic serves three double faults in one game and two in a row to hand Struff the set on a platter. A well deserved first set against Djokovic for Struff, but quite a strange set from the Serb. He will surely improve in the fourth. Here is the report on Ashleigh Barty\u2019s handy comeback a couple of hours ago. Third set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 *2-5 Jan-Lennard Struff: Struff steals his third consecutive game and in some style. Djokovic held a break point and looked to have the point in his pocket as the German stumbled towards the net on a poor approach shot, but Djokovic\u2019s brilliant angled backhand passing shot was met by an even more stunning drop volley that the defending champ could only applaud. Djokovic then came up with his own magic on an important point, slipping a glorious lob over the German\u2019s head on his first game point. However, Struff fought hard and then slammed down an ace to hold from deuce. He is now one game away from his first set over Djokovic. Third set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 2-4* Jan-Lennard Struff: Struff breaks Djokovic for the second time in the set, this time landing a brilliant backhand return at the Serb\u2019s feet. Djokovic\u2019s level and intensity has dropped just a little in this third set, while Struff continues to fight hard and he is reaping the rewards. Can he steal a set and make this interesting? Third set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 *2-3 Jan-Lennard Struff: Struff brushes himself off to retain the hold with some big serving, punctuated by a swinger out wide to the deuce side. The German is two sets down to one of the greatest players of all time but he is still pumping himself up and talking to himself at the change of ends. This is not always the case. Third set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 2-2* Jan-Lennard Struff: Djokovic holds to level the third set with some huge serving, sealed with a series of heavy forehand blows directed at the Struff forehand. Struff opened the third set by breaking Djokovic\u2019s serve, but it was just a small lull from Djokovic who responded in the blink of an eye to level the set. Struff may not get another chance. Second set: Sloane Stephens 6-2 5-5* Shuai Zhang: Stephens just attempted to serve for the match, only for Zhang to respond with some astonishing hitting at the death, breaking back with a whistling backhand down the line return winner. Stephens desperately needs this win to kick herself into gear but Zhang is still making life extremely difficult for her. Second set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 6-2 Jan-Lennard Struff: Novak Djokovic holds with ease to take a two sets lead. He is firing on all cylinders now, playing at such a high level that he is laughing after his own winners. Most notably, he pulled off an incredible curling forehand down the line winner at 30-15 after an immense long point. This is all going to be extremely difficult to beat over the next two weeks. Second set: Sloane Stephens 6-2 *3-4 Shuai Zhang: On Margaret Court Arena, Stephens and Zhang has evolved into a tense duel. Plenty of gripping, long rallies and plenty of winners with both players picking their moments to wrestle control of the point. Zhang is competing extremely well and she could easily nab a break to take this to three. Second set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) *5-2 Jan-Lennard Struff: Goodness. Novak Djokovic just broke serve to love with one of the best exhibitions of defence that will be seen all week. He chased down an almost perfect huge, angled backhand from Struff, then he immediately tracked down Struff\u2019s following overhead from the other flank, curling his response past a helpless Struff at the net. Needless to say, Novak Djokovic means business here. He will serve for the second set. Second set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 3-1* Jan-Lennard Struff: Djokovic digs out his first tough hold of the set, this time form 0-30 down courtesy of some more great defence from Struff and then an incredible backhand overhead. However, Djokovic remained calm and served exceptionally off both first and second serves to eradicate the danger. Another hold on the board. Second set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) *2-1 Jan-Lennard Struff: Djokovic was on the prowl for a second consecutive break, but Struff holds on from 15-30 with two consecutive huge serves and then a brilliant backhand down the line. Another loud \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019 from the German to punctuate the hold - he is certainly fighting hard. Second set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) 2-0* Jan-Lennard Struff: Novak Djokovic is rolling here. After breaking in the opening game to 15, he pieced together a great hold to love, sealed with a magnificent combination of volleys at the net. Djokovic\u2019s level hasn\u2019t drastically changed - it is just so difficult for a player like Struff to maintain such a high level. First set: Novak Djokovic 7-6(5) Jan-Lennard Struff: Novak Djokovic finally takes the first set with an unreturned first serve. It sure wasn\u2019t easy, but Djokovic served just well enough to keep himself ahead. The good news for Struff is that he has been outstanding today. The bad news is that he still lost the set and he has to sustain this level against one of the best returners in the world. Good luck with that. First set: Novak Djokovic 6-6 (5-4*) Jan-Lennard Struff: This seemed to be Djokovic\u2019s tiebreak at 4-1, but Struff\u2019s movement has been exceptional and, to an extent, he has given Djokvoic a taste of his own medicine by defending well and flipping points with random bursts of aggression. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s set... First set: Novak Djokovic 6-6 Jan-Lennard Struff: On Rod Laver Arena, both Djokovic and Struff did their jobs on serve and we\u2019re heading to a tiebreak. First set: Sloane Stephens 6-2 Shuai Zhang: What a clean set of tennis from Sloane Stephens, who takes it 6-2 after countless booming forehands. She finished with two consecutive forehand winners, bringing her total to 9 winners, 4 unforced errors and not a break point conceded. A win here would be huge for the 2017 US Open champion\u2019s confidence. First set: Novak Djokovic *5-5 Jan-Lennard Struff: Struff responds immediately with a love hold filled with booming serves to pile the pressure back on Djokovic\u2019s shoulders. First set: Novak Djokovic 5-4* Jan-Lennard Struff: Just as Djokovic seemed to have full control of the set, he loses his serve at the last moment. All credit to Struff who hasn\u2019t stopped cheering and pumping his fist. He opened the game with an incredible backhand passing shot at full stretch, demonstrating his immense athleticism. He finished by putting pressure on Djokovic with heavy, deep groundstrokes, eventually drawing out a backhand error. Great work. First set: Novak Djokovic *5-3 Jan-Lennard Struff: It is always entertaining to watch Djokovic against a big hitter. He is mixing up the pace, constantly moving the ball around and being so disciplined with his depth. He may not be able to match Struff\u2019s power, but he can make life so uncomfortable for the German. This time, Struff survives to land a after facing set point. Struff\u2019s sequence from set point down: ace, serve and volley concluding in an overhead winner, ace. That is how good it has to be. First set: Novak Djokovic 5-2* Jan-Lennard Struff: Djokovic is being relentless in his own service games. He holds to 15 with more great serving. When Struff does land a return, Djokovic is smothering him by moving the ball around and keeping him on the run. With a brilliant forehand down the line, he holds to consolidate the break. First set: Novak Djokovic *4-2 Jan-Lennard Struff: After a series of opening holds, Novak Djokovic is starting to get stuck in as he takes the first break with ease. First there was an incredible crosscourt forehand return at 15-15, then Djokovic soaked up all the biggest blows the German could land, grinding out two successive errors to break first. He looks incredibly sharp. First set: Sloane Stephens *2-1 Shuai Zhang: Meanwhile, on Margaret Court Arena Sloane Stephens is just opening her Australian Open against Zhang Shuai. These are tough times for Stephens, who is currently seeded 24th and is really struggling with form. She is 0-2 this year, with both losses to sub top 100 players. This draw is no help whatsoever. Zhang is an excellent player and, with her ranking of 35, she is the second highest ranked player a seed could face. A lot of people expect Zhang to take this one, but Stephens has started well. She takes the first break with a searing backhand down the line winner. First set: Novak Djokovic 2-1* Jan-Lennard Struff: The most underrated part of Djokovic\u2019s game in recent years has been his serve - he can now go serve to serve with many of the biggest servers in the game. He strolls through an easy hold with plenty of accurate, smart serving. First set: Novak Djokovic *1-1 Jan-Lennard Struff: After a solid hold with ample good serving from Djokovic, Struff pulls out an impressive opening hold. Djokovic is already putting immense pressure on the Stuff second serve, taking it early and crushing the ball at his feet whenever he can. Struff responded with a great backhand crosscourt winner from a big serve, then he held with a big ace down the T. Plenty of loud barks of \u2018c\u2019mon!\u2019 from the German. He is here to play and he wants the defending champion to know. It is now time for the defending champion. The last time Novak Djokovic competed on this court, he played one of the great matches of his career as he eviscerated Rafael Nadal in last year\u2019s final. Jan-Lennard Struff is not quite Nadal, but he is about as tough a first round opponent as a top seed can get. 32 players are seeded at the Australian Open and Struff is ranked 37th. Struff, 29, is a tall, huge server with a big forehand and he is coming off the best year of his career. He sits just four spots from his career high ranking of 34th. The German will have to serve out of his mind and overwhelm Djokovic with his power. At the very least, he is more than capable of taking a set or giving Djokovic something to think about. Stefanos Tsitsipas on last year\u2019s incredible semi-final run: Tsitsipas: \u201cWhat I really remember is winning every single match in four sets. I don\u2019t know, I feel like number four was my favourite number at the time. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to go four sets today. The whole experience last year was outstanding. I get goosebumps when I just think about what I went through last year in Melbourne. I really hope for something similar this year.\u201d A Fan: \u201cEven better!\u201d Tsitsipas: \u201cEven better, even better.\u201d Ash Barty speaks: It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s amazing to be back out here. It\u2019s a tight turnaround from Adelaide but really nice to sort it out a little bit more in the second set there, sharpen up and do what I needed to do. Absolutely incredible. This is probably the moment I\u2019ve been looking forward to the most through the off-season. I couldn\u2019t wait to walk out here on this beautiful court to play in front of so many people that give me so much love and support. It\u2019s incredible. In the first set, it was still in my control, it was just a little bit of execution and I was just rushing a little bit, trying to finish off points too early. Once I got my physicality into it, I felt a lot more comfortable and I was able to look after my service games a little better and not get behind in the set, which was important. Stefanos Tsitsipas completes an excellent performance with a 6-0 6-2 6-3 win to move on. That was quite a statement performance from the Greek, who reached the semis last year and may well have the loudest contingent of fans in Melbourne. This will be a very interesting and instructive event for the 21 year old. After an extremely nervy start, Ashleigh Barty comes through, fittingly sealed with a double fault by Tsurenko. The most important thing about the first round is the win and the world number one has done the job. Third set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 6-1 5-1* Lesia Tsurenko: A lovely hold from Ashleigh Barty, who produced a gorgeous drop shot to bring up game point before flicking an angled forehand crosscourt passing shot to hold. One game away. Third set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 6-1 *4-1 Lesia Tsurenko: Tsurenko finally stops the run of seven successive games against her with a hold. Some good tennis at last from the 30 year-old on game point, dragging Barty from side to side with a nice combination of forehands. Barty will be looking to continue her solid serving in this final set. Third set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 6-1 4-0* Lesia Tsurenko: Barty is speeding towards the finishing line as she pieces together another decent hold. At 30-30, Tsurenko helped again with a messy forehand error but Barty found a really nice serve on game point, slotting away the short ball it elicited. Two games away. Third set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 6-1 *3-0 Lesia Tsurenko: Sadly for Tsurenko, she doesn\u2019t seem to have much left to give here. At 0-15, she double faulted. At 0-30, she tentatively strolled into the net on a dreadful approach shot and was easily passed. Down break point, she sprayed a forehand well wide to hand over the double break. Barty is having plenty of help to the finish line here but to her credit, she is giving nothing away so far in the third set. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-0 6-2 *3-1 Salvatore Caruso: Meanwhile, Stefanos Tsitsipas continues to ease through his opening match. The Greeks are chanting at every opportunity, Tsitsipas is crushing forehands and life is good. Tsitsipas now has 21 winners and 13 unforced errors, having lost only one point on his serve so far today. Caruso seems to be having a problem with his blisters and he has the trainer on to deal with the plasters wrapped across almost every finger. Third set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 6-1 *1-0 Lesia Tsurenko: Barty gets the perfect start with an easy break to open the third set. Barty missed her first two opportunities from 0-40, but then Tsurenko very helpfully provided a double fault on the third. Finally, Barty is back in the lead. That was a very good recovery from Barty, who slowly shook off the nerves and, by the end, was playing her tennis with something approaching freedom. She held in spectacular fashion with a wicked second serve that forced the Ukrainian to duck out of the way. Just 5 unforced errors in this set from Barty after 19 in the first. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 *5-1 Lesia Tsurenko: Ashleigh Barty breaks again! After a brilliant backhand passing shot forced a hopeless backhand volley from Tsurenko at 30-30, Barty made her move on break point with the most brilliant rally of the match: a long lung-busting exchange, in which Barty calmly worked the Ukrainian off the court before forcing a forehand error. She stands one game away from levelling the match. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 4-1* Lesia Tsurenko: Much better work from Barty to retain the break by holding with style and guile. At 30-15, she froze time with a floating sliced backhand, forcing an error from Tsurenko. At 40-15, she hooked a beautiful angled forehand crosscourt, dragging Tsurenko well out of the court before slicing an easy backhand into the open court. Lovely. It appears that Serena Williams had an amusing press conference today after her breezy 6-0 6-3 win over Anastasia Potapova. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 *3-1 Lesia Tsurenko: Tsurenko drags herself into the second set with an important hold. Barty is certainly playing better in the second set but the nerves are still clear: at 30-30, with the possibility of a break point looming, Barty sprayed a poor backhand well wide and then she handed over the game another forehand error. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 3-0* Lesia Tsurenko: Barty does indeed serve well, sealing a second consecutive hold with an unreturned first serve. For the first time today she has consolidated a break and is firmly in the lead in set two. Now let\u2019s see if she can keep it. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 *2-0 Lesia Tsurenko: Tsurenko has officially gone off the boil again. With a double fault at 15-15, then two bad forehand errors, she hands over the opening break. Based on the first set, Tsurenko will surely find her range again. Barty needs to take advantage while she can by serving well here. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 1-0* Lesia Tsurenko: A much better start from Barty in set two. She finds her first serve and then slots a forehand down the line winner in to open with a calm, solid hold. She needs to build on this. The nerves! Tsurenko opened with a double fault, and then at 15-30 she hit a second horrific double fault that flew well wide of the tram lines. But Barty just couldn\u2019t keep her forehand in the court, closing off the set with her 19th unforced error so far today. The quality may not be high, but this is certainly gripping. A huge upset is officially on the cards. It\u2019s not to be for the former Australian number one, who falls in another first round yet again. Keep an eye out for 18 year old qualifier McNally, who plays such a great all-court game and loves the net. A great future prospect. Stosur will shift to the doubles, where she is defending champion. First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-6* Lesia Tsurenko: Oh dear. The momentum swings away from Barty once more as Tsurenko wins two successive games. Tsurenko put genuine pressure on Barty\u2019s serve with deep, consistent returning, and in the return game she continued to step into and take risks when she can, but across the net there are just too many errors from the world number one. The Ukrainian will serve for the set. First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-4* Lesia Tsurenko: This is turning into a bit of a breakathon as Barty breaks back to love. As expected, Tsurenko can play well for periods but she\u2019s struggling to maintain a consistent level. After a series of errors to give up her own service game, Tsurenko struggled to get her racquet on any Barty serve. 8 points in a row and Barty is back in the lead. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-0 1-0* Salvatore Caruso: Meanwhile, Tsitsipas has begun his Australian Open perfectly, snatching the opening set with a bagel. He is serving extremely well, sweeping forward to the net when he can and playing such flowing attacking tennis. First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-4* Lesia Tsurenko: A great response from Tsurenko after Barty looked to be elevating to another level. She took more risks in her return game, crushing a backhand return winner and then finishing a really nice point at the net. After a netted forehand from Barty, she breaks again. This is tough! First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 5-0* Salvatore Caruso: The Greek fans are chanting loud and Tsitsipas is giving them plenty to sing about as he chases a first set bagel. Tsitsipas is 10/10 on first serve points won with 7 winners and 4 errors. Mostly flawless. First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-2* Lesia Tsurenko: Not surprisingly, the world number one has settled down after collecting her first game. She has found her range on her forehand, she is moving better and she is serving incredibly well today. After breaking back to love, she then held to love with her 5th(!) ace of the day. 10 points in a row for Barty. It\u2019s official: all matches on outside courts have been cancelled due to rain. That includes Kyle Edmund, who lead Dusan Lajovic 5-2 before the rain came. Johanna Konta\u2019s match was rescheduled earlier. First set: Ashleigh Barty 1-2* Lesia Tsurenko: Barty finally gets on the board, but this is far from easy at the moment. The world number one looks extremely nervous and she is missing plenty of routine shots early on. Thankfully, her serve is already firing and she produced a timely ace at 30-30 before showcasing her delicate hands with some deft touch to hold. That should calm some nerves. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *2-0 Salvatore Caruso: Last year\u2019s breakout Australian Open semi-finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas is also on the court against Salvatore Caruso of Italy and he opens with a solid hold and immediate break. It seems like the general consensus is that the younger generation will have some big opportunities to challenge for slams this year. After his brilliant win at the ATP finals in London at the end of last season, the question is whether it will be him. The Greek-Australian crowd has once again shown out in force for Tsitsipas. First set: Ashleigh Barty 0-1* Lesia Tsurenko: Quite the cagey start by Barty as the Aussie sprayed a series of errors to immediately fall down 15-40. She saved the first break point with a service winner and the second with an ace, but then a wayward slice error followed by a forehand error hand the Ukrainian the opening break. The rallies are already pretty long, just how Tsurenko likes it. Here is the report on another win for Coco Gauff against Venus Williams. This could be an interesting test for Barty, but it is difficult to tell. Lesia Tsurenko is an extremely capable player who rose to a career high of 23rd last year. She is a counterpuncher with a wicked two-handed backhand (the less said about her forehand, the better) and she should be able force Barty into lengthier rallies while pressing when she can. Her problem is that she has only competed one match since July after a serious right elbow injury ruined much of her 2019 season and it will be difficult to consistently match the world number one. First round matches are always a challenge, and this will be a completely new experience for Barty as she competes at her home slam for the first time as number one, but she arrives in Melbourne filled with confidence after she won her first title on home soil in Adelaide last week. The head to head stands at 2-2, with Tsurenko actually winning the most recent match 6-3 6-2 when they played in Brisbane two years ago. The world number one\u2019s life has dramatically transformed since 2018 when she was still tentatively making her return to the top of the sport. We\u2019ll soon see just how much she has changed. Not a great evening for Australian slam champions so far. Sam Stosur just lost the first set 6-1 to American youngster Caty McNally who is eviscerating the 2011 Wimbledon champion\u2019s serve and playing some vicious attacking tennis. Stosur has famously struggled on home soil and she hasn\u2019t actually won a match in Melbourne since 2015. We\u2019ll see what she can do in the second set. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Melbourne after Dan Evans recovered from two sets down to defeat Mackenzie McDonald and seal his very first slam win as a seeded player. Evans will hope that there is more to come. Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the first night session of the 2020 Australian Open. It has already been a busy day with wins for Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Caroline Wozniacki and more, another victory for Coco Gauff over Venus Williams, one significant upset in 13th seed Denis Shapovalov\u2019s four set loss to Marton Fucsovics and rain washing out most of the day session. But now it is time for the main event as Australia\u2019s Ashleigh Barty finally returns to her home slam as French Open champion and world number one. She will face a difficult first round against Ukraine\u2019s Lesia Tsurenko, whose current ranking of 120, largely thanks to a long injury layoff, belies the fact that she was ranked in the top 25 this time last year. Novak Djokovic will follow her on Rod Laver Arena against Jan-Lennard Struff, another capable opponent. Elsewhere, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Sloane Stephens and Samantha Stosur are also in action. We are all very thankful for those three roofs.",

Prep 20 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6-8 700g crown prince, kabocha or butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm chunks 500g celeriac, peeled and cut into 3cm chunks 6 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil Salt and pepper 2 chipotle chillies, deseeded and opened like a book 1 ancho chilli, deseeded and opened like a book 2 onions, peeled and chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 2 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 heaped tsp dried oregano (preferably Mexican) 2 x 400g tins black beans, drained and rinsed 2 x 400g tins plum tomatoes 1-2 tbsp soft brown sugar, to taste 30g dark chocolate (at least 70% solids), grated 1 small bunch coriander, leaves picked To serve Guacamole Rice Soured cream Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7. Put the squash and celeriac on a baking tray, drizzle over half the oil and season generously. Toss everything together with your hands, spread out and roast for 30-35 minutes, until the veg is tender, and crisp and golden around the edges. Toast the dried chillies in a small, dry frying pan for a minute on both sides, then cover with boiling water and set aside. Meanwhile, pour the remaining oil into a large saucepan, add the onions and sweat over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until they begin to soften. Season generously, add the garlic and cook for another five to seven minutes. Drain the chillies, chop them finely, add half to the onions, along with the spices and oregano. Fry for a minute, then add the beans, tomatoes, sugar and chocolate. Fill the tomato tin with hot water and add to the pan. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes until reduced. Stir in the roast vegetables and check the taste \u2013 if you want more spice, add the rest of the chillies. Simmer for another 15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened, check the seasoning, then sprinkle over the coriander and serve with guacamole, rice and soured cream. And for the rest of the week Consider doubling this recipe \u2013 it freezes beautifully and you will have a few suppers stashed in the freezer for nights you are too tired to cook. Cut batons from leftover celeriac with a shredding peeler to add to winter salads, and use leftover squash in velvety, warming soups.",

      "body": "<p>Which is Chekhov\u2019s greatest play? It tends to be the one you\u2019ve seen most recently. But my own personal favourite is Uncle Vanya. It may not have the symphonic richness of Three Sisters or The Cherry Orchard but it confronts personal failure unflinchingly and, because of its awareness of climate crisis, currently seems the most topical. That may explain why it is on view in two theatrical capitals. Ian Rickson\u2019s production of Conor McPherson\u2019s new version opens this week at London\u2019s Harold Pinter theatre. Meanwhile, Channel-hoppers can still catch St\u00e9phane Braunschweig\u2019s extraordinary production \u2013 played in Russian with French and, on certain dates, English surtitles \u2013 at the Odeon, Paris.</p> <p>Braunschweig, who has directed all the major Chekhov plays, is explicit about why he was drawn to Uncle Vanya: he sees the characters\u2019 destruction of each other as a \u201cmini ecosystem\u201d that symbolises the wilful ruination of nature. Played against a curved wooden wall \u2013 sadly, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/19/paris-transport-set-to-return-to-normal-as-rail-union-suspends-strike\">current strikes</a> deprived us of the forest that was part of the design when the show premiered in Moscow \u2013 the production leaves us in no doubt about the tangible despair of Chekhov\u2019s people. Elisaveta Boyarskaya\u2019s magnetic Yelena \u2013 the pivotal performance of the evening \u2013 is both destructive and herself destroyed. Her beauty hypnotises both Vanya and the climate-conscious doctor, Astrov. Yet she is chained by marriage to a gouty Professor whose very touch causes her to shiver with revulsion. This Yelena is clearly a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc960d04ec8e86e3e3eb51fefa0d457021518f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc960d04ec8e86e3e3eb51fefa0d457021518f6f/0_197_2953_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oncle Vania at the Odeon in Paris, directed by St\u00e9phane Braunschweig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despair and destruction ... Oncle Vania at the Odeon in Paris, directed by St\u00e9phane Braunschweig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth Carecchio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Braunschweig\u2019s modern-dress production never lets us forget that personal agonies are linked to climactic crisis. There is a large circular pool on stage into which the characters periodically plunge to escape the insufferable heat. At one point Evgueni Mironov\u2019s Vanya joyfully exposes himself to a rainstorm. Anatoli Beliy\u2019s Astrov delivers his homily about the disasters of deforestation while absorbed in his laptop, barely noticing Yelena\u2019s boredom. Yet it\u2019s a mark of the production\u2019s \u2013 and Chekhov\u2019s \u2013 subtlety that even this passionate ecologist has allowed his newly planted trees to be ruined because of his erotic obsession with Yelena.</p> <p>So fierce is Braunschweig\u2019s focus on destruction that I missed some of Chekhov\u2019s faith in people\u2019s capacity for endurance: Sonya\u2019s famous final speech to Vanya, in which she tells him, \u201cWe must go on living\u201d, is overshadowed by despair. But this is a production that combines metaphorical resonance with psychological detail. I shan\u2019t soon forget the look of weary resignation Sonya gives Astrov when he takes a nip of vodka, having earlier forsworn drinking. And it speaks volumes that the old nurse, who remembers a world of pre-crisis stability, pointedly snubs the departing Yelena whom she sees as the source of destruction. Braunschweig may have seized on one aspect of Uncle Vanya. But, strolling in the Luxembourg Gardens on an unseasonably warm January afternoon, I felt he was entirely justified in highlighting Chekhov\u2019s fears of environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>The Russian actors perform Chekhov with a reckless emotionalism that borders on the neurasthenic. But, while I admired that, it would be wrong to say this is the only way to play Chekhov: it is right for these actors at this moment in time. Reflecting on the nearly two dozen productions of Vanya I have seen, it struck me that the play not only yields up new meanings at each viewing but that its performance reflects different cultures. Dostoyevsky once said that he pushed things to extremes where other people went only halfway: something of that same spirit invades Russian Chekhov.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cad5bb1069702dbf033462e4277332565d8abae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cad5bb1069702dbf033462e4277332565d8abae/0_0_2189_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Russell Beale and Helen McCrory in Uncle Vanya at Donmar Warehouse, London, in 2002\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exceptionally fine performances ...

The Paris Vanya sees a French director working with Russian actors. One of my favourite past productions \u2013 staged in Rome in 1996 and later at the Edinburgh festival \u2013 showed Peter Stein directing a largely Italian cast: Stein\u2019s Germanic meticulousness blended perfectly with Italian volatility. In particular, Stein highlighted the play\u2019s rural setting and the passage of the seasons: birch trees in full flower finally acquired the coppery tints of autumn, echoing the emotional trajectory of the characters. But Stein also exploited the Italianate qualities of his cast. You saw this specifically in Elisabetta Pozzi\u2019s Sonya. Instead of playing her as a dowdy drudge, Pozzi lent her a rapt devotion and burning ecstasy that made you realise that Astrov, in rejecting her in favour of Yelena, was destroying his own chance of happiness as well as hers.</p> <p>But what of British Uncle Vanyas? I have seen many fine productions over the years and think we should shed our inferiority complex about Chekhov: the notion that, as the late Caryl Brahms once wrote, the British perform Chekhov with the gloves on. It\u2019s often argued that we see all his plays through a haze of semi-aristocratic nostalgia. In my experience, the best productions invest him with a localised sense of irony and an awareness that his characters, while tragic to themselves, are often comic when viewed objectively.</p> <p>That came out strongly in Sam Mendes\u2019s 2002 revival at London\u2019s Donmar Warehouse. It boasted exceptionally fine performances from Helen McCrory as Yelena and Emily Watson as, like the Roman Pozzi, a passionate Sonya. Simon Russell Beale also caught perfectly the duality of Vanya. Gazing at Yelena with the rapt fervour of a moonstruck adolescent, he seemed totally absurd. Yet, in the great scene where the Professor announces his plan to sell the estate, he became a different figure, painfully aware of the futility of his self-denying existence. That was great Chekhov acting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45afcf2d36e353ad95aa597e16fde10657b0fe9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45afcf2d36e353ad95aa597e16fde10657b0fe9d/0_330_5453_3274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Jones in rehearsals for Uncle Vanya at the Harold Pinter theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Jones in rehearsals for Uncle Vanya at the Harold Pinter theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each production, however, yields fresh insights. From a 1988 Michael Blakemore production, I recall the tortured sensibility of Jonathan Pryce\u2019s Astrov, reaching for the vodka to bury the painful memory of a patient who died under chloroform. From a 1974 production at Stratford\u2019s The Other Place, I remember Nicol Williamson\u2019s Vanya essaying aimless kicks at the hated Professor like a thwarted child. And, going back into the mists of time, there was Laurence Olivier\u2019s celebrated production which played at the initial Chichester festival seasons in 1962-63 before becoming part of the National Theatre repertoire.</p> <p>You can still find that production on DVD and, watching it again recently, I was struck by Olivier\u2019s grasp of physical and psychological detail. You see it in the pathetic gratitude of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/18/great-performances-michael-redgrave-uncle-vanya-chichester\">Michael Redgrave\u2019s Vanya</a> for a farewell kiss on the forehead from Yelena and in the way Olivier\u2019s Astrov glances fleetingly at himself in the mirror while explaining the curse of deforestation: ecological passion suddenly seemed an extension of sexual vanity. But that was before we all became acutely aware of climate catastrophe. Today Chekhov\u2019s play, which broke so many of the rules of drama, has acquired new resonances. As a veteran Vanya lover, I wait eagerly to see what Ian Rickson and his team have discovered in a work that moves one deeply and yields fresh meanings at each encounter.</p> <ul> <li><p>Oncle Vania is at the <a href=\"https://www.theatre-odeon.eu/fr/saison-2019-2020/spectacles-19-20/oncle-vania-2020\">Odeon, Paris</a>, until 26 January.

      "bodyText": "The Italian film-maker and author Lorenza Mazzetti, who has died aged 91, declared herself to be a genius on her first day at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, and she made good on her promise. She unleashed a capacity to tell stories in film and literature that evoked a childhood trauma in Italy that she found too painful to discuss in person. Living in Britain after the second world war, she became a founding member of the British Free Cinema movement alongside Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson. Her most acclaimed movie, made in 1956 with the support of the BFI\u2019s Experimental Film Fund, was Together, a heartbreaking depiction of urban isolation. In this largely dialogue-free film, the painter Michael Andrews and the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi appear as two brothers, both deaf and without speech, working as dockers in the blitz-struck East End of London, who are snubbed and taunted by locals, with terrible consequences. Mazzetti\u2019s experiences as a stranger in London, and of her own close sibling bond with her twin sister, are beautifully expressed in this film, which was shot on eerily bomb-ravaged streets that evoke the psychological suffering of the vulnerable brothers. Together had its premiere, alongside Anderson\u2019s O Dreamland and Reisz and Richardson\u2019s Momma Don\u2019t Allow, at the National Film Theatre in London in February 1956 as part of a programme called Free Cinema. This was the genesis of a brief movement, an invigorating precursor to the kitchen-sink realism of the British New Wave in the 1960s. Mazzetti and Anderson, who were close friends, collaborated on an accompanying manifesto. Their idea of cinema rejected expensive effects in favour of a documentary-style authenticity: \u201cNo film can be too personal,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe image speaks. Sound amplifies and comments. Size is irrelevant. Perfection is not an aim. An attitude means a style. A style means an attitude.\u201d Mazzetti was born in Rome, the daughter of Olga Liberati and Corrado Mazzetti.

The third part of this autobiographical trilogy, London Diaries, was published in 2014, and described her life after the war in Britain and her film-making.

For the St David\u2019s Hall audience, the buzz came from being part of something where history was being relived, giving substance to the Beethoven 250th celebrations. Here, it took two each of orchestras, conductors and pianists to realise what Beethoven \u2013 composer, fixer, conductor and soloist \u2013 effectively achieved alone.</p> <p>Beginning with the Pastoral Symphony No 6 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/21/arts.artsnews\">Carlo Rizzi</a> conducting a storm in its thunderous 4th movement with the Welsh National Opera Orchestra \u2013 the programme\u2019s faithfulness to the original happily didn\u2019t extend to replicating the many inaccuracies that Beethoven grumbled about.

      "bodyText": "Beethoven\u2019s 1808 benefit concert was one of classical music\u2019s most remarkable evenings: it featured four premieres, including the 5th and 6th symphonies and the 4th piano concerto, and lasted four hours. Yet, in this recreation of that freezing December night in Vienna\u2019s Theater an der Wien \u2013 six months before Napoleon invaded the city for the second time \u2013 it was not just the event\u2019s scale that created the impact, but the sense it engendered of a genius at work. For the St David\u2019s Hall audience, the buzz came from being part of something where history was being relived, giving substance to the Beethoven 250th celebrations. Here, it took two each of orchestras, conductors and pianists to realise what Beethoven \u2013 composer, fixer, conductor and soloist \u2013 effectively achieved alone. Beginning with the Pastoral Symphony No 6 \u2013 Carlo Rizzi conducting a storm in its thunderous 4th movement with the Welsh National Opera Orchestra \u2013 the programme\u2019s faithfulness to the original happily didn\u2019t extend to replicating the many inaccuracies that Beethoven grumbled about. Soprano Alwyn Mellor brought heft to the high tessitura of the concert aria Ah, Perfido! In the 4th piano concerto, soloist Steven Osborne balanced transcendent calm with fierce energy and elan. Osborne also gave due attention to the repeated notes which, in the concert\u2019s second half, then emerged with maximum force in Jaime Mart\u00edn\u2019s reading of the 5th symphony with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. Mart\u00edn\u2019s passionate gestures lent a touch of Beethoven the conductor. Ll\u0177r Williams was the second pianist to embody Beethoven the soloist: bringing every phrase wonderfully alive, he made the Op 77 Fantasia in G minor and the Choral Fantasy sound better works than they actually are. The BBC National Chorus of Wales, with a quartet of solo singers, had made glorious sounds in movements from the Mass in C major, but it was in this finale with its portent of the Choral Symphony that Beethoven the humanitarian came through. In his music, he aspired to make the world a better place and, for these few hours, he did so. \u2022 Available until 18 February on BBC Sounds.",

While at the College Football National Championship, former LSU star Beckham was seen handing out wads of cash to Tigers players after they defeated Clemson. Minutes later Beckham was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/odell-beckham-jr-new-orleans-police-buttock-slap-warrant-dropped\">caught on camera</a> slapping the butt of a security guard in the LSU locker room. New Orleans police pressed charges - charges that were later dropped - but Beckham\u2019s butt slap was viewed anywhere from weird to highly inappropriate. Handing college players a sliver of cash when the NCAA brings in billion dollars for itself every year is a far more layered situation.</p> <p>-- Speaking of Beckham, the Browns <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-ownership-expects-big-improvement-in-kevin-stefanskis-first-year-as-coach/\">quickly hired</a> Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski to become the franchise\u2019s fifth head coach in five seasons. Stefanski, along with a general manager who has yet to be hired, will be tasked with implementing a culture overhaul.

While Kuechly cited overall injuries and an uncertainty if he could still <a href=\"https://www.panthers.com/news/transcript-of-luke-kuechly-s-retirement-announcement\">\u201cplay fast and play physical and play strong,\u201d</a> he did suffer three known concussions in three years.

After Sunday\u2019s win over the Titans, Reid showcased his sense of humor when he told reporters, \u201cFired up to go to Miami but need to go on a diet so I can fit in my clothes.\u201d Reid is going to be just a little more delightful for the media in Miami than the hooded head coach who represented the AFC in the past three Super Bowls. Video of the week Travis Kelce fought for his right and he is going to party up a storm in Miami. We\u2019ll see if he has any functioning vocal cords left come Super Bowl Sunday. Elsewhere around the league -- The Cleveland Browns\u2019 season ended a while back but Odell Beckham Jr made plenty of news this week. While at the College Football National Championship, former LSU star Beckham was seen handing out wads of cash to Tigers players after they defeated Clemson. Minutes later Beckham was caught on camera slapping the butt of a security guard in the LSU locker room. New Orleans police pressed charges - charges that were later dropped - but Beckham\u2019s butt slap was viewed anywhere from weird to highly inappropriate. Handing college players a sliver of cash when the NCAA brings in billion dollars for itself every year is a far more layered situation. -- Speaking of Beckham, the Browns quickly hired Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski to become the franchise\u2019s fifth head coach in five seasons. Stefanski, along with a general manager who has yet to be hired, will be tasked with implementing a culture overhaul. Big personality guys like Beckham and Baker Mayfield will be under the microscope in year one as the new regime decides whether they are part of the organization\u2019s long-term plans. -- Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly, a nine-time Pro Bowler, unexpectedly retired at the age of 28. While Kuechly cited overall injuries and an uncertainty if he could still \u201cplay fast and play physical and play strong,\u201d he did suffer three known concussions in three years. Kuechly continues a trend of young NFL stars opting to retire early and live their NFL afterlives in, hopefully, sound health.",

Constrained by money, they take the place of the early Christians, living below ground on the outskirts of more prosperous society. (In Parasite, too, the down-on-their-luck Kim family live in a sub-basement flat.) It\u2019s a reminder that poverty can sink a person in more ways than one. In May this year, the nature writer Robert MacFarlane\u2019s book Underland was met with acclaim for its profound analysis of spaces deep beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. He uses the term \u201cAnthropocene unburials\u201d to describe events such as the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe and the thawing of the Arctic permafrost. Our activity on the planet has led to what MacFarlane calls \u201cunruly, obscene surfacings\u201d. So, too, in some of the past year\u2019s best cinema, the social reality we cannot bear to face is re-emerging in unexpected ways. While the capital\u2019s wealthiest residents dig below to accommodate luxury basement conversions, those without a home are forced to shelter in the relative warmth of the London underground. The space below our feet can hold many mysteries, but some are of our own making.",

      "bodyText": "Fifty years of the global trade in farm animals In 2017, nearly two billion animals a year were loaded onto ships or lorries to be sent on journeys ranging from a few hours to six weeks and even more. Fifty years of chickens \u2026 Top of the list of animals being exported in absolute numbers are chickens. The amount of live chickens being moved around the world has ballooned by a staggering sixteen times in fifty years. \u2026 And all the others The numbers of other live farm animals (we collected data for pigs, cattle, sheep and goats) being exported has also grown dramatically over the past half a century, according to data from the UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). This growth has shown no signs of slowing despite advances in refrigeration technology allowing fresh and frozen meat to be stored and transported and concerns around the spread of animal diseases such as African swine fever (ASF). What are the key markets for live animal imports? The trade is driven by appetite from all over the world, but the Middle East is a particularly key region, and has been a major importer of sheep since records were first collected by the FAO in the 1960s. Alongside Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Jordan also imported 400,000 sheep in 2017. The US figures are mostly made up of pig imports from Canada and cattle imports from Mexico. Just off the bottom of this list, the UK imported 500,000 live farm animals in 2017, most of which were pigs from Ireland. We\u2019ve left out the figures for imports of live chickens as the numbers are so large they would distort the chart. Where are these animals coming from? If we included the figures for chicken in the list of biggest exporters then the Netherlands would be top. But even taking away live chickens, the Netherlands is the second largest exporter of live pigs, cattle, sheep and goats after Denmark. The Danes are top mainly due to a large trade in pigs with Poland (6.2 million in 2017).

The majority of the animals it exported in 2017 went to Italy (980,000) and Spain (490,000), but it also sent 11,000 live cattle to Morocco, 14,000 to Lebanon and 38,000 to Algeria.

China\u2019s 1.6 million pig exports all went to Hong Kong in 2017, although that trade has since been hit by the outbreak of ASF, a highly contagious viral pig disease, that has wiped out some 40% of the Chinese pig population.

      "bodyText": "The department store chain Beales has gone into administration, threatening 1,300 jobs in the latest blow to the UK high street. Accountancy firm KPMG was appointed on Monday as administrator to the 23-shop chain, having initially been engaged by the retailer last month to explore possible sale and refinancing opportunities. KPMG said: \u201cDespite interest from a number of parties, this process did not secure any solvent solutions for the company, and as a result, the directors took the difficult decision to place the companies into administration.\u201d All 23 stores will continue to trade as a going concern \u2013 with all staff retained \u2013 while KPMG assesses its options for the business.

As soon as he spotted her on stage, sparks began to fly.</p> <p>\u201cAll the other band members used to tease me and say she was out of my league,\u201d Bob recalls. \u201cBut I won her over.\u201d They became a couple and, for the next three months, they spent all their time together. \u201cShe made me laugh. I felt like we were soulmates at that time.\u201d</p> <p>DeeDee made plans to move to Scotland, Bob\u2019s home country, where they hoped to find work as a comedy duo. But she soon realised she wasn\u2019t ready for such a big change. \u201cI was worried his feelings might be stronger than mine and I got cold feet about moving across the world and settling down.\u201d She sent him a letter asking him to come to LA instead, but the contact soon fizzled out.</p> <p>\u201cI was a bit miffed she had changed her mind,\u201d Bob admits. \u201cBut I sent her a mixtape, which was my way of saying it was all OK.\u201d For years afterwards, DeeDee would play the New Seekers song Alright My Love from the tape and tell her friends about her adventures with Bob. \u201cWe\u2019d had such a great time together.\u201d</p> <p>Back in LA, DeeDee settled into her career as an actor and dancer, while Bob became a civil servant in the UK. In 1976, he married Helen and they had four children together. Then, after 31 happy years of marriage, Helen died \u2013 she had leukaemia. He remarried in 2009 only to be hit by tragedy again. \u201cMy second wife, Jo, was diagnosed with cancer just two weeks after our honeymoon. I nursed her through the illness for six years.\u201d </p> <p>Before her death, the couple had been to counselling together, where Jo expressed her desire for Bob to meet someone else. \u201cShe told me to look up old friends and reconnect with people. One of the people she mentioned was DeeDee, because I had such fond memories from my time on the ship all those years ago.\u201d</p> <p>In October 2016, he took the plunge and sent DeeDee a friend request on Facebook. \u201cI was shocked because I never thought I\u2019d hear from him again,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look anything like him, so I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d But the pair began to chat and things clicked into place. Before long, they were having regular Skype calls, reminiscing about their adventures at sea. \u201cIt was so comfortable it just felt uncanny,\u201d says DeeDee. \u201cI\u2019ve never laughed so much with anyone.\u201d</p> <p>When she invited him to visit LA the following April, she didn\u2019t think it would be more than friendship. \u201cIt quickly became clear the chemistry was still there, though.

Raising awareness and offering support is a win-win situation for both women and employers, and I am encouraged that slowly but surely things are starting to change. To speed up the pace of change, I launched the #MakeMenopauseMatter campaign with three specific aims: to ensure mandatory menopause training for all GPs, to provide menopause guidance in every workplace, and for menopause to be included in the new relationships and sex education (RSE) curriculum in secondary education. I am delighted to say that as a result of the campaign, menopause will be taught in RSE from September. Menopause is not just a women\u2019s issue. It can affect us all: women suffer in silence, relationships break down, and careers are lost. Far too many are paying the needless price for a woeful lack of menopause education, care and support. The highest rate of suicide among women in the UK is between the ages of 45 and 49, when most women will be experiencing perimenopause. This could be the ultimate hidden cost, and it matters. \u2022 Diane Danzebrink is the founder of Menopause Support UK and the #MakeMenopauseMatter campaign",

But then, as she worked carefully, her knife easing the meat from the bone, we talked about the trusted farm the animal came from and how the price reflects the nature of the way that farm works. In that moment, I was reminded of <a href=\"http://hattieellis.com/books/what-to-eat/\" title=\"\">Hattie Ellis\u2019 book What to Eat</a>?, and her reminder that meat is not just any food, but a tricky business that requires much self-questioning; that it should be more of a cherished treat than convenience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/04/pasta-mista-potatoes-sausage-soup-rachel-roddy-recipe\">Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for pasta soup with potatoes and sausage | A Kitchen in Rome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is convenience, though, in having a butcher bone and dice your lamb.

It was Manuela\u2019s reaction that made me turn back, her practical admiration of the animal before her and then the way she carefully cut away the cluster of eggs and lifted them into a tub and told me to poach them in the broth I was about to make. Again, I was shocked by her suggestion; the familiar comfort of my morning shop and cooking plans disturbed by the reality of the meat I chose to eat. It was the same the other day as she carefully boned a leg of lamb and reminded me that the animal was four months old. But then, as she worked carefully, her knife easing the meat from the bone, we talked about the trusted farm the animal came from and how the price reflects the nature of the way that farm works. In that moment, I was reminded of Hattie Ellis\u2019 book What to Eat?, and her reminder that meat is not just any food, but a tricky business that requires much self-questioning; that it should be more of a cherished treat than convenience. There is convenience, though, in having a butcher bone and dice your lamb. More convenient is the rosemary bush in the park on the way home, when the one on the windowsill has not survived the winter. As well as resinous rosemary and sweet marjoram, this week\u2019s recipe for lamb rag\u00f9 includes sage, whose domineering and musty scent and astringent flavour are well matched by the rich and distinct braised lamb. The recipe has much in common with the classic Roman abbacchio alla cacciatora, lamb hunter\u2019s-style \u2013 so braised with wine and many herbs. Today\u2019s version also contains tomato and chilli, and is cooked until soft and collapsed enough to use as a pasta sauce for both dried shapes \u2013 rigatoni, paccheri or conchiglioni \u2013 and fresh ones \u2013 tagliatelle, pappardelle or gnocchi. As my pan of rag\u00f9 splutters and burps like a drunkard, I pull What to Eat? from the shelf and re-read Hattie\u2019s conclusions to the meat chapter. She suggests that if we choose to eat it, we should eat less but better quality. That, when we can, we should shop at butchers and visit farms; meat is a privilege and a pleasure. Lamb rag\u00f9 Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 4 1 onion, peeled and finely diced 1 small carrot, peeled and finely diced 1 stick celery, finely diced 6 tbsp olive oil 2 sprigs marjoram 2 sprigs rosemary 8 sage leaves Salt and pepper 450g boneless lamb suitable for stewing, cut into 2cm cubes 200ml white wine 1 x 400g tin peeled plum tomatoes 1 small dried red chilli 500g pasta (rigatoni, paccheri, tagliatelle, pappardelle) 1 handful grated pecorino Put the diced onion, carrot, celery and olive oil in a large, heavy-based pan. Finely mince half of each of the herbs and add to the pan along with a pinch of salt. Gently fry over a low heat until soft and fragrant \u2013 about seven minutes. Raise the heat a little, add the lamb, and cook, stirring, until browned on all sides. Raise the heat another notch, add the wine and let it bubble for two minutes. Add the tomatoes, remaining whole herbs, chilli and a good pinch of salt, lower the heat, cover and simmer gently for an hour and a quarter, lifting the lid to stir from time to time and adding more wine if it seems dry. Toward the end of cooking time, cook the pasta in plenty of fast-boiling salted water. Drain, tip into a bowl, sprinkle over a handful of grated pecorino, tip on the sauce, toss well and serve immediately, handing round more cheese to top.",

Fans of Maggie Nelson or Anne Carson may find themselves in familiar territory: there is the same impulse for wide-ranging references, the same desire to crack words open and poke around inside them. Ramayya\u2019s concerns, however, are broader than Nelson and Carson\u2019s sorrows in love: as the title suggests, States of the Body addresses ideas of the nation state, Hindu nationalism, British imperialism \u2013 and yes, love too.</p> <p>The collection opens with a long section of prose, much of which explores the metaphorical possibilities of the 10 Mah\u0101vidy\u0101s, goddesses who are manifestations of the greater Hindu goddess Sat\u012b. Can they be used to illuminate the caste system, Ramayya wonders? \u201cIf I\u2019m not careful, I allow them to mean everything,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe Mah\u0101vidy\u0101s are metaphors, which is where the difficulty begins.\u201d</p> <p>Difficulty is indeed the word at times. Ramayya\u2019s work is laced with citations of other writers, among them Frantz Fanon, a usual suspect of the so-called postcolonial; to paraphrase Arundhati Roy, the \u201cpost\u201d is unconvincing. Sara Ahmed and Julia Kristeva, and various experts in tantra, mantra and ritual, are also referenced. Their works are named \u201c(mostly) in the spirit of gratitude\u201d, Ramayya writes wryly in her endnotes, but these references feel pre-emptively defensive, like someone paying their academic dues. They act as a spiny scholarly exoskeleton, a defence against the charge, all too often levelled at poets of colour, that their work lacks craft, is insufficiently literary. But unfortunately, Ramayya\u2019s speaker keeps us at an intellectual distance, too.</p> <p>Central to Ramayya\u2019s work is her knowledge of Sanskrit, acquired through a Victorian dictionary written by Sir Monier Monier-Williams, who was Oxford\u2019s Boden Professor of Sanskrit, a position established to translate Christian scripture (no prizes for knowing what for). \u201cI crouch in definitions, dragging lamps,\u201d she writes of the decision to acquaint herself with her lost ancestral language. \u201cThis is my home, but [Monier-Williams] opens the door to let me in.\u201d His dictionary is a complicated inheritance: a key colonial foundation, but also how Ramayya can relearn the language of her forebears. In To Stupefy Like Bind, Ramayya interrupts the text of the British imperial penal code with five different definitions of the word utth\u0101na.</p> <p><em>the act of rising (as the moon, as the disposition of the<br>moon towards self-rule) \u2013<br>... the act of rising up to depart (as a warlike expedition, as<br>opening the door behind you, as welcoming ghosts) \u2013</em></p> <p>For poetry, a word with five possible definitions is a joy and here it delights. Ramayya the apprentice lexicographer aims it at an oppressor\u2019s justice system while Ramayya the poet rejoices. By comparison, the punning and metaphoric possibilities of English are run ragged in Death, where the onslaught of double meanings leaves one dizzied in lines such as \u201cfrom the dead time spent apart from you, spending lying die for you, the time of lying alongside you, from the lie of dying far from you\u201d.</p> <p>Pitting Sanskrit against English becomes an attempt to avenge a historical affront, most notoriously summarised by Thomas Babington Macaulay. In his Minute on (Indian) Education, which lobbied for the introduction of a Eurocentric literature curriculum in India, Macaulay declared: \u201cI have no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic,\u201d and, in the same breath, concluded that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library [is] worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. Sanskrit, which English tried to quash, now dances with five definition-words while English, the language of the country that stained the atlas pink, seems boring in comparison.</p> <p>All this throws into sharp relief the fact that Ramayya writes in English. She highlights the violence of the language, its use as a colonial weapon. Of course, all language can be made violent and Ramayya muses on Hindu nationalism\u2019s appropriation of the lexicon she has studied so lovingly: \u201cSanskrit is weaponised; its am. -s and ah. -s that sounded to me like a chorus of laughter, a string of pearls \u2026 turn to bile and blood in my mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, English is the language Ramayya lives and works in. By using it to write anti-imperial poetry, she has turned it against itself. To paraphrase Adrienne Rich, Ramayya cannot refuse English, the language forced upon her family by invasion and migration, but she can re-fuse it. This aspect of her work is thrilling.

      "bodyText": "Democrats are trying to choose a candidate to beat Donald Trump, the most corrupt president in history. Some think nominating Joe Biden, a moderate white man who calls himself \u201cMiddle Class\u201d Joe, makes sense. But Biden has a big corruption problem and it makes him a weak candidate. I know it seems crazy, but a lot of the voters we need \u2013 independents and people who might stay home \u2013 will look at Biden and Trump and say: \u201cThey\u2019re all dirty.\u201d It looks like \u201cMiddle Class\u201d Joe has perfected the art of taking big contributions, then representing his corporate donors at the cost of middle- and working-class Americans. Converting campaign contributions into legislative favors and policy positions isn\u2019t being \u201cmoderate\u201d. It is the kind of transactional politics Americans have come to loathe. There are three clear examples. First, Biden\u2019s support for finance over working-class Americans. His career was bankrolled by the credit card industry. He delivered for it by spearheading a bankruptcy bill that made it harder for Americans to reduce their debts and helped cause the financial crisis. He not only authored and voted for that bill, he split with Barack Obama and led the battle to vote down Democratic amendments. His explanations for carrying water for the credit card industry have changed over time. They have never rung true. The simplest explanation is the most likely: he did it for his donors. At a fundraiser last year, Biden promised his Wall Street donors that \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d for them if he became president. Now the financial world is raising huge money for his campaign. It clearly thinks he\u2019s going to be its friend if elected. Most Americans, who get ripped off by the financial sector on a daily basis, aren\u2019t looking for a candidate who has made their life harder. Second, healthcare. On 25 April, the day he announced his campaign, Biden went straight to a fundraiser co-hosted by the chief executive of a major health insurance corporation. He refuses to sign a pledge to reject money from insurance and pharma execs and continues to raise money from healthcare industry donors. His campaign is being bankrolled by a super Pac run by healthcare lobbyists. What did all these donors get? A healthcare proposal that preserves the power of the insurance industry and leaves 10 million Americans uninsured. Third, climate change. Biden signed a pledge not to take money from the fossil fuel industry, then broke his promise. Right after a CNN town hall on climate change, he held a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a fossil fuel conglomerate. He is pushing climate policy that has gotten dismal reviews from several leading environmental groups. There are plenty of other examples that raise questions, like housing and social security. Big real estate moguls are playing a major role in Biden\u2019s campaign. Unlike his rivals, he has no comprehensive housing plan. When he pushed for cuts to Social Security, was he serving donors or his constituents? I can already hear the howls: But look at Trump! Trump is 1,000 times worse! You don\u2019t need to convince me. I have spent my life writing about and fighting against corruption, and in America I have never seen anything like the current administration. In the last three years, I have made combatting Trump\u2019s corruption the heart of my work.

Now a tall and spindly 50-year-old, he has had to abandon that life as a boatman. The waters now sit so low that his services are unnecessary. So the past decade has instead been spent repairing shoes inside a dimly lit wooden booth in the village market.</p> <p>Bangladesh has <a href=\"https://www.gwp.org/globalassets/global/gwp-sas_images/gwp-sas-in-action/ldai/bdp-2100-ppt.pdf\">700 rivers</a> integral to the country\u2019s culture, but many of them are dying. Driven by changing weather patterns and the country\u2019s relentless push towards development, the crisis has become so critical that in July 2019 the supreme court declared all the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/18/20803956/bangladesh-rivers-legal-personhood-rights-nature\">country\u2019s rivers </a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/18/20803956/bangladesh-rivers-legal-personhood-rights-nature\">to be \u201cliving entities\u201d</a>, with anyone damaging them subject to punishment.</p> <p>But for many of the communities whose lives depend on the waterways, the change of law has come too late.</p> <p>\u201cI used to love just rowing the boat, being on the river. Nowadays I have very little work,\u201d says Robi Das. \u201cThe river was so much higher before. Now you see there are fields by the bank, but they used to all be part of the river.\u201d</p> <p>Only a month since the end of Bangladesh\u2019s rainy season, the river sits at less than half the level it did when it was a healthy tributary of the Surma, part of an extensive river system that stretches from India, breaking off and joining other rivers on the path southwards to the Bay of Bengal.</p> <p>Robi Das is part of a small Hindu community in Bangladesh\u2019s northern Sylhet district, in the town of Biswanath near the border with India, which has always been connected to the river.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9661044f79073b3c58bcbd9fd3ff80440f6ba4f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9661044f79073b3c58bcbd9fd3ff80440f6ba4f8/0_0_5793_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fisherman Chandra Das\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fisherman Lilon Chandra Das</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kaamil Ahmed</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe river is our home.

In the past it was guaranteed.\u201d</p> <p>Both people and goods were traditionally transported along Bangladesh\u2019s extensive river network. Floating markets still exist in parts of the country, and communities like the Choonati (named after the paste chewed with betel nut, made from grinding the shells of snails found on the river bed)&#xa0;found specialised work on the water.</p> <p>\u201cThey are the biggest losers. First of all, fishermen. Hundreds of fishing communities have been destroyed. Then the boatmen,\u201d said Sheikh Rokon, founder of the Riverine People network of environmental activists.</p> <p>He said the death of Bangladesh\u2019s rivers has been caused by encroachment, erosion, pollution and sand mining.</p> <p>All of these problems stem, he claimed, from decreased water flows that, while due in part to internal land barriers, are largely a result of restrictions on the flow by Bangladesh\u2019s neighbours, especially India.</p> <p>The two countries share several major rivers, but Bangladeshi communities complain that <a href=\"https://www.prio.org/Projects/Project/?x=1525\">they suffer from India\u2019s dams</a> depriving them of water during dry spells and inundating them in the rainy season.</p> <p>In October 2019, Bangladesh\u2019s state news agency <a href=\"https://www.bssnews.net/?p=281177\">reported that 78,000 people were affected by flooding</a> in the country\u2019s north-west soon after India opened the floodgates of its <a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/environment/2018/02/11/farakka-barrage-key-factor-bangladeshs-water-crisis\">Farakka barrage</a>, 20km from the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ec5ab12b1edf13019f26442e180b5a1aacdaeef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec5ab12b1edf13019f26442e180b5a1aacdaeef/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A traditional Bangladeshi fisherman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A traditional Bangladeshi fisherman.

Instead of rivers, transportation is concentrated on roads that even in rural areas are now congested. Dhaka, once a small capital, is now one of the most populous cities in the world, growing by an estimated <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/10-cities-are-predicted-to-gain-megacity-status-by-2030/\">half a million people every year</a>.</p> <p>Dhaka\u2019s water bodies have shrunk by two-thirds over the past 20 years, according to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bipinfo/posts/2689660007794835?__xts__[0]=68.ARDXQ-bCFS5OzoErP0zBLfiasMnrKsSsDnwmPc2z5mRVex_PDh4Fyz2Utiv9cpDbPje4wzVtTYix5_97rpoCV_LdMs4q1hv2yn-iyQ_GN8RvIJBrUbgPUjC77wDxxUz0ILKRiM_o4Zo06EQbQzrUwhNStjSzv9xtL0LcN9nn54hJ-IhX6uXUS57Cubn5nGjXvmHV-56CLuMSVpQ73u3S_QkmTiOsGdIOPWSq719tWuWrCUGaEPFN6Gn7t-wpPjYiP_B-lPZVKJUgl9_Z10QcdiMGeNIT8TfTXrzuealNetcrXwLc5ConnHjh2v1C6At2TqvI22XvJn-7iYInelS7AYUvdQ&amp;__tn__=-R\">recent study by the Bangladesh Institute of Planners</a>, and <a href=\"http://burigangariverkeeper.org/our-threats/\">hundreds of factories and tanneries pollute the city\u2019s Buriganga river</a>, according to activists.</p> <p>Bangladesh\u2019s progress has seen the country neglect its rivers in pursuit of resources, according to Rokon.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 38 rivers which are severely polluted and encroached. We have more than 80 rivers that are [suffering] under the sand-mining situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe modern monster is sand-mining. It is cruelly killing our rivers.\u201d</p> <p>Sylhet has suffered because the sand and stone collected from its river beds, washed down from the hills in India, are used in roads and construction. The often illegal and excessive collection has diverted the flow of rivers, <a href=\"http://bforest.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/bforest.portal.gov.bd/notices/c3379d22_ee62_4dec_9e29_75171074d885/13.%20Energy%20and%20Minerals_NCS.pdf\">according to the government\u2019s forestry department.</a></p> <p>As one of the activists who campaigned for Bangladesh to recognise the legal rights of rivers, Rokon welcomed the supreme court\u2019s July ruling, but he is also sceptical that action will be taken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d1d63f355a952e1aee9b8f8e60e3e9b13b66b4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d1d63f355a952e1aee9b8f8e60e3e9b13b66b4a/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boatmen in Dhaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boatmen on the river in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kaamil Ahmed</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from the challenge of taking on businesses that profit from mining the rivers or building around them, Rokon says there needs to be a cultural change in Bangladesh, where the traditional link to rivers has been forgotten.</p> <p>\u201cPeople became detached culturally from the rivers. We have to revive the utility of the rivers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Biswanath, the local administration has been exploring ways to reroute their dying river with the hope of increasing its flow for fishermen like Chandra Das, and to revive a tradition of transporting people and goods along the waterways, which could prove quicker and cheaper than Bangladesh\u2019s clogged roads.</p> <p>Robi Das is less optimistic about the changes, however. The death of local rivers has already forced him to search for a new livelihood and he expects his children will do the same.</p> <p>\u201cI have moved on now, even if they revive the rivers there won\u2019t be much chance of us returning to it.

      "bodyText": "Holding his downturned palm level with his waist, Musana Robi Das indicates how tall he was when he started working on Bangladesh\u2019s rivers. As a child he helped his father ferry villagers across local waterways. Now a tall and spindly 50-year-old, he has had to abandon that life as a boatman. The waters now sit so low that his services are unnecessary. So the past decade has instead been spent repairing shoes inside a dimly lit wooden booth in the village market. Bangladesh has 700 rivers integral to the country\u2019s culture, but many of them are dying. Driven by changing weather patterns and the country\u2019s relentless push towards development, the crisis has become so critical that in July 2019 the supreme court declared all the country\u2019s rivers to be \u201cliving entities\u201d, with anyone damaging them subject to punishment. But for many of the communities whose lives depend on the waterways, the change of law has come too late. \u201cI used to love just rowing the boat, being on the river. Nowadays I have very little work,\u201d says Robi Das. \u201cThe river was so much higher before. Now you see there are fields by the bank, but they used to all be part of the river.\u201d Only a month since the end of Bangladesh\u2019s rainy season, the river sits at less than half the level it did when it was a healthy tributary of the Surma, part of an extensive river system that stretches from India, breaking off and joining other rivers on the path southwards to the Bay of Bengal. Robi Das is part of a small Hindu community in Bangladesh\u2019s northern Sylhet district, in the town of Biswanath near the border with India, which has always been connected to the river. \u201cThe river is our home. We are always going down to it, we do everything there,\u201d said his neighbour, fisherman Lilon Chandra Das, 47. \u201cOur lives were more comfortable before, we could live from the river. Today I have a net with me in my boat but I don\u2019t have much confidence that I will catch anything. In the past it was guaranteed.\u201d Both people and goods were traditionally transported along Bangladesh\u2019s extensive river network. Floating markets still exist in parts of the country, and communities like the Choonati (named after the paste chewed with betel nut, made from grinding the shells of snails found on the river bed) found specialised work on the water. \u201cThey are the biggest losers. First of all, fishermen. Hundreds of fishing communities have been destroyed. Then the boatmen,\u201d said Sheikh Rokon, founder of the Riverine People network of environmental activists. He said the death of Bangladesh\u2019s rivers has been caused by encroachment, erosion, pollution and sand mining. All of these problems stem, he claimed, from decreased water flows that, while due in part to internal land barriers, are largely a result of restrictions on the flow by Bangladesh\u2019s neighbours, especially India. The two countries share several major rivers, but Bangladeshi communities complain that they suffer from India\u2019s dams depriving them of water during dry spells and inundating them in the rainy season. In October 2019, Bangladesh\u2019s state news agency reported that 78,000 people were affected by flooding in the country\u2019s north-west soon after India opened the floodgates of its Farakka barrage, 20km from the border. Reviving the rivers Since independence from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh has forged a path towards development that has focused on rapidly building its economy. The changes have been visible. Instead of rivers, transportation is concentrated on roads that even in rural areas are now congested. Dhaka, once a small capital, is now one of the most populous cities in the world, growing by an estimated half a million people every year. Dhaka\u2019s water bodies have shrunk by two-thirds over the past 20 years, according to a recent study by the Bangladesh Institute of Planners, and hundreds of factories and tanneries pollute the city\u2019s Buriganga river, according to activists. Bangladesh\u2019s progress has seen the country neglect its rivers in pursuit of resources, according to Rokon. \u201cWe have 38 rivers which are severely polluted and encroached. We have more than 80 rivers that are [suffering] under the sand-mining situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe modern monster is sand-mining. It is cruelly killing our rivers.\u201d Sylhet has suffered because the sand and stone collected from its river beds, washed down from the hills in India, are used in roads and construction. The often illegal and excessive collection has diverted the flow of rivers, according to the government\u2019s forestry department. As one of the activists who campaigned for Bangladesh to recognise the legal rights of rivers, Rokon welcomed the supreme court\u2019s July ruling, but he is also sceptical that action will be taken. Aside from the challenge of taking on businesses that profit from mining the rivers or building around them, Rokon says there needs to be a cultural change in Bangladesh, where the traditional link to rivers has been forgotten. \u201cPeople became detached culturally from the rivers. We have to revive the utility of the rivers,\u201d he said. In Biswanath, the local administration has been exploring ways to reroute their dying river with the hope of increasing its flow for fishermen like Chandra Das, and to revive a tradition of transporting people and goods along the waterways, which could prove quicker and cheaper than Bangladesh\u2019s clogged roads. Robi Das is less optimistic about the changes, however. The death of local rivers has already forced him to search for a new livelihood and he expects his children will do the same. \u201cI have moved on now, even if they revive the rivers there won\u2019t be much chance of us returning to it. My children study and they will try to use that for their lives,\u201d he said.",

One thing I\u2019ve asked them to do, is on the field they\u2019re being busy, throwing themselves around, and I think that sort of energy drags everybody else with them.

But I think for the moment, leave him where he is.</p> <p>We have got one eye on Sri Lanka and we\u2019ve got to work really hard to make sure with the spinners when we get there they\u2019re full of confidence, they\u2019ve got wickets under their belt, and they\u2019ve got their bond, like we do with our fast-bowling unit.

Joe Root opened with Stuart Broad, who for the second morning in a row dismissed Vernon Philander in his first over, with Ollie Pope taking his sixth catch of the match. Root himself decided to partner Stuart Broad at the start, which made sense given his success on Sunday, though it was surprising and ultimately embarrassing that he should bowl unchanged for 80 minutes without success. His last over yielded 28 runs (including four byes); it also removed the smile from Root\u2019s face and equalled the most expensive one delivered in Test cricket.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/20/england-thrash-south-africa-third-test-cricket\">England thrash South Africa by an innings and 53 runs to take 2-1 lead</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e257dd08f08e97ed2126a63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-20T10:21:17.138Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Joe Root has another chat, </strong>this time with Sky:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s nice for us all to be well and healthy at the moment.

But we did a job with the ball, controlled the run rate really well once again. I think so far this series our bowlers have kept a lid on their batting line-up. And then England played some really good cricket. They showed application, through Pope and Stokes, and then you lay a platform for guys to come in and just play freely. 500 on the board, you need to make sure you put on a fight and a big total to compete for the rest of the game, and we didn\u2019t do that. We batted poorly in the first innings, we didn\u2019t play Bess very well. Obviously he bowled really well but I felt we could have played him a bit better.</p> </blockquote> <p>He\u2019s asked about the rumours that his retirement is imminent:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve heard the rumours of a possible retirement. I\u2019ve been pretty consistent with my message, that the T20 World Cup is the timeframe I\u2019m looking for. There\u2019s not a lot of Test cricket from the remainder of the year. For me it\u2019s important as captain that we keep driving forward and applying ourselves to win [the next] Test match. And then after that it\u2019s two Tests in the West Indies and that\u2019s it for Test cricket. From a performance point of view, yes, me and the team are feeling the pressure of not performing to the standard that we should, but we\u2019ll keep fighting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e257a068f08e97ed2126a4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-20T10:01:49.081Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today, it turned ugly.</strong> Root bowled himself a bit too long, in search of a statistic.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. The fourth and final Test starts on Friday. Here\u2019s the report on the conclusion of this one again. Bye! Chris Silverwood also has a chat: To see it all come together is superb really. Ollie coming through, getting his maiden Test century, Bess with his first Test five-for, to see them all contributing, the feeling in the camp is superb. They bring real energy. You think back to when you were young, full of energy, full of life, and they\u2019re bringing that to the dressing-room. One thing I\u2019ve asked them to do, is on the field they\u2019re being busy, throwing themselves around, and I think that sort of energy drags everybody else with them. It helps you\u2019ve got Woody up there as well, full of energy, full of life, and he\u2019s infectious is Woody. To see him bowling with pace and with a big smile on his face was super. My temptation [with Pope] is to leave him where he is, let him find his feet, get a few more runs under his belt, make sure that he truly feels he belongs here, and I don\u2019t think it will take him too long to do that, and then we can assess again. But I think for the moment, leave him where he is. We have got one eye on Sri Lanka and we\u2019ve got to work really hard to make sure with the spinners when we get there they\u2019re full of confidence, they\u2019ve got wickets under their belt, and they\u2019ve got their bond, like we do with our fast-bowling unit. We\u2019re working hard on that. We\u2019ve actually got a few more spinners coming through now, so there\u2019s competition for places which I think is helpful. Vic Marks\u2019 report has landed, and here it is. The victory was so easy, despite a cheerful, preposterous last wicket partnership of 99, that it becomes hard to assess. At Cape Town England had to graft, dig deep and snatch every chance to win. Here they dropped half a dozen chances, with Ben Stokes the unlikely yet most regular culprit \u2013 though he does stick himself wherever he thinks the ball will go \u2013 and still they won by an innings and 53 runs. The mopping-up operation on a breezy day was clumsy but not too stressful, partly because the sun deigned to make an appearance again. Joe Root opened with Stuart Broad, who for the second morning in a row dismissed Vernon Philander in his first over, with Ollie Pope taking his sixth catch of the match. Root himself decided to partner Stuart Broad at the start, which made sense given his success on Sunday, though it was surprising and ultimately embarrassing that he should bowl unchanged for 80 minutes without success. His last over yielded 28 runs (including four byes); it also removed the smile from Root\u2019s face and equalled the most expensive one delivered in Test cricket. Much more here: Joe Root has another chat, this time with Sky: It\u2019s nice for us all to be well and healthy at the moment. The way we\u2019ve played since then, the way we\u2019ve adapted to the different surfaces and really stuck to our methods, I think this game has been a brilliant template for us moving forwards. Big first innings runs, a big partnership in there, and then really driving the game from there. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the group and for young lads to be stepping up yet again is [Sky\u2019s feed falters, insert your own positive adjective here]. I think more than anything, they\u2019re very willing to listen and to learn. Not that the other guys aren\u2019t, but they haven\u2019t seen any other way, if you like. We\u2019ve got a very clear direction of how we want to take the team forward. The guys have come in and they\u2019ve responded really well to that and we\u2019re now starting to see results, and when you start to see results it starts hammering home the message. Throughout this tour, we\u2019ve got 20 wickets in all three games and that\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t say has happened as often as you\u2019d like from an England side abroad. That\u2019s first and foremost a massive step forwards for us as a bowling group. To see guys finding different ways of manipulating the surfaces is really pleasing. And it\u2019s not just the youngsters, it\u2019s the senior guys still learning as well - Broady yesterday and this morning finding different deliveries, being open-minded enough to not just run in and bowl seam-upright stuff. Leg-cutters, cross-seam balls, trying different things, at his age, still now finding different ways to take wickets on flat surfaces is really impressive. Ollie Pope is the man of the match. He spends much of his interview talking about someone else: It was an amazing feeling, but it wouldn\u2019t have counted for much if we didn\u2019t win the game. That\u2019s the most important thing. So to get over the line this morning is an even better feeling. To bat with Stokesy is a privilege. He just keeps getting better. To see how he goes about building his innings and the tempo he plays at, it\u2019s awesome to watch and I was in a pretty good seat to watch another special innings from him. Joe Root is much chirpier: I think it\u2019s a great template for how we want to play our cricket moving forward: big first innings score and then drive the game from there. I thought Ollie batted brilliantly with Stokesy, a brilliant partnership that really put us in a commanding position. And then the way Bessy bowled was fantastic that first innings, and from that point on we always thought we were in control of it. Throughout this series we\u2019ve had four guys under 25 making five-fors or hundreds, which is a great place to be. We want to continue to provide an environment where that becomes possible, and keep giving those guys confidence. When guys are really stepping up to the plate, especially at a young age, and showing they can perform at this level, that\u2019s going to fill everyone with a huge amount of confidence. Faf du Plessis has a chat: Obviously we knew the toss was going to play a role. But we did a job with the ball, controlled the run rate really well once again. I think so far this series our bowlers have kept a lid on their batting line-up. And then England played some really good cricket. They showed application, through Pope and Stokes, and then you lay a platform for guys to come in and just play freely. 500 on the board, you need to make sure you put on a fight and a big total to compete for the rest of the game, and we didn\u2019t do that. We batted poorly in the first innings, we didn\u2019t play Bess very well. Obviously he bowled really well but I felt we could have played him a bit better. He\u2019s asked about the rumours that his retirement is imminent: I\u2019ve heard the rumours of a possible retirement. I\u2019ve been pretty consistent with my message, that the T20 World Cup is the timeframe I\u2019m looking for. There\u2019s not a lot of Test cricket from the remainder of the year. For me it\u2019s important as captain that we keep driving forward and applying ourselves to win [the next] Test match. And then after that it\u2019s two Tests in the West Indies and that\u2019s it for Test cricket. From a performance point of view, yes, me and the team are feeling the pressure of not performing to the standard that we should, but we\u2019ll keep fighting. Today, it turned ugly. Root bowled himself a bit too long, in search of a statistic. Nobody bowled well at the final pair. The match never threatened to even vaguely match the drama we enjoyed at Cape Town. But it\u2019s still been an excellent Test victory, plump with positives. Here\u2019s a quick report, with Vic Marks\u2019 version to follow in short order: 88.5 overs: South Africa 237 all out (Paterson 39) And so it ends. England didn\u2019t have to bowl at the stumps in the end, though it couldn\u2019t have hurt. They take a 2-1 lead in the series after what remains, despite this morning\u2019s lower-order fight-back, a pretty savage thumping, with the fourth and final Test starting at Johannesburg in four days\u2019 time. That\u2019s fine fielding, and very ordinary running. Curran collects at mid-on and his shy at the bowler\u2019s end flicks one stump, sends a bail spinning, and catches Maharaj a good yard short! 88th over: South Africa 237-9 (Maharaj 71, Paterson 39) England don\u2019t seem at all keen on bowling towards the actual stumps, allowing this final pair a lot of untroubled bat-swinging. Three more boundaries here, and South Africa now trail by 53. \u201cEngland have lost the plot here,\u201d says Nasser Hussain on Sky. Buttler seems pretty sure that Paterson nicked Curran\u2019s fifth delivery, and there was definitely a sound there, but nobody else, least of all the umpire, seems to have heard it, there was nothing to see, and England are fresh out of reviews. \u201cIn answer to Steve Hudson\u2019s question, I\u2019m panicking now,\u201d writes Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cI can easily see this pair slogging it out until lunchtime, followed by the heavens opening and there being no play for the rest of the day.\u201d It should remain dry for another few hours at least. 87th over: South Africa 225-9 (Maharaj 71, Paterson 27) Just the one boundary here, and one near-miss, Maharaj mistiming a pull that drops just short of Pope at midwicket. \u201cIt was suggested yesterday that for Root to take a five-for would damage Dom Bess\u2019s confidence by undermining his achievement, a part time bowler matching his figures,\u201d writes Thomas Atkins. \u201cSo good on the skipper for making the decision to bowl an over of abject filth, getting carted to all parts, to restore the spirits of his young teammate. 4D chess, I tell you.\u201d 86th over: South Africa 220-9 (Maharaj 67, Paterson 26) Dropped! Kind of! Maharaj hits high into the air and Bess runs back at mid-off, makes a desperate last-second dive and still can\u2019t get a hand on it! The next is just flicked over midwicket for six, and the one after that goes past mid-off for four. Then four more, flicked off the hip. These two are going down all guns blazing, and England\u2019s lead is down to 70. \u201cSo, at what point should we start to panic about this?\u201d asks Steve Hudson. 85th over: South Africa 204-9 (Maharaj 51, Paterson 26) Wood comes on. Paterson keeps stepping back to give himself room to work the ball into the off side, but then failing to put bat on ball with his extravagant swings, and Wood doesn\u2019t threaten the stumps. Maiden. 84th over: South Africa 204-9 (Maharaj 51, Paterson 26) Curran replaces Root, and South Africa\u2019s final pair keeps swinging. England could have ended it here, as Paterson launched himself on a second run while Maharaj stood still and got caught in no-man\u2019s land, but the throw isn\u2019t firm enough and when it arrives it\u2019s poorly handled. England\u2019s lead is now 86, or just 3.1 Root Over 82s. 83rd over: South Africa 195-9 (Maharaj 51, Paterson 21) Maharaj reaches his half-century with a sweep for four. That last Root over was the joint most expensive in the history of Test cricket. Time for a change, captain? 82nd over: South Africa 190-9 (Maharaj 46, Paterson 17) Carnage! Root starts his 29th over with a full toss, which Maharaj slaps away to square leg for four. Then the next goes super-fine, a bit super-finer than was intended, for four more, and the one after that Maharaj tries the same shot and gets it right, for another. Root changes angle, and Maharaj despots the next into the stands! And the one after that! Four byes to end the over, which Maharaj started on an 81-ball 22, and ended on an 87-ball 46! 14.7% of South Africa\u2019s total came in that over! 81st over: South Africa 162-9 (Maharaj 22, Paterson 17) That\u2019s a fine shot from Paterson, who leans back and smears through the covers for four. 80th over: South Africa 156-9 (Maharaj 22, Paterson 11) Of course I was wrong, Root still had this over to bowl with the old ball. His last delivery of the over heads down leg, spins a little further down leg, flicks off Buttler\u2019s gloves and runs away for four byes. England take the new ball immediately, and give it straight to Bess! 79th over: South Africa 149-9 (Maharaj 21, Paterson 9) Paterson leans back and works the ball to backward point. Rood sprints after it, dives, and scoops it away from the rope with an inch to spare, which is a commendably honest effort given that England, 144 ahead at that stage with just one wicket still to take, hardly needed to be overly concerned with the odd run here and there. 78th over: South Africa 145-9 (Maharaj 20, Paterson 6) A single off the second for Maharaj gives Root four balls against the new man, but Paterson looks entirely untroubled. He proves this by smacking the last straight down the ground for four! That\u2019s Root\u2019s last over with this ball, and it\u2019s followed by some drinks. 77th over: South Africa 138-9 (Maharaj 19, Paterson 0) Bess has a go. Slip, leg slip, silly point, short leg. Three dots, and then the wicket. His first ball to Paterson sounds like it hits bat as well as pad, but it lands safe. England are one wicket away now. \u201cRoot is going to insist on bowling with the new ball, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asks Bob O\u2019Hara. It may not get that far. Again a change of bowling brings instant reward! Good ball that, which skids through the gate and takes out middle stump! 76th over: South Africa 138-8 (Maharaj 19, Nortje 5) Root\u2019s 26th over of the innings. He clusters fielders around the bat, but Maharaj doesn\u2019t give them any exercise. 75th over: South Africa 137-8 (Maharaj 19, Nortje 4) Cowabunga! Wood opens the over with a vicious bouncer that rears into Maharaj, who does well to get out of the way. Having done so, he then gets four through point. Then one rears up and flies off the shoulder of the bat but loops wide of silly point and safely to turf! 74th over: South Africa 133-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 4) Just five overs now before the new ball becomes available, and England will surely take it pretty swiftly. Root\u2019s five-for needs to be nailed in short order, if it is to happen. It certainly doesn\u2019t happen here, and Nortje gets four off the last, tickled down the leg side. 73rd over: South Africa 128-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 0) Wood also switches angle, moving round the wicket mid-over. On Sky, the commentary team spend most of the over lauding Wood\u2019s character. In 20 years\u2019 time, when his sporting achievements are but a distant memory, he can play that to prospective employers/spouses. 72nd over: South Africa 128-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 0) Root bowls over the wicket to Maharaj, having decided that the angle that brought such success yesterday isn\u2019t cutting much morning mustard. \u201cI\u2019m with Brian Withington,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cThose of us of a certain age know that only a fool predicts England Test results but this shelling seems aeons away from the first Test. Pope is obviously a huge bonus, as is Bess, but whatever they\u2019ve had for breakfast, I\u2019m in.\u201d 71st over: South Africa 128-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 0) As Broad said this morning, \u201cit\u2019s one of those pitches that will offer something every few overs if you put the ball in the right areas\u201d. Maharaj and Rabada look pretty comfortable for a few overs, and then that. Presumably it slowed off the surface, because Rabada had pretty much finished his shot by the time the ball turned up. Wood replaces Broad, and strikes first ball! Rabada chips the ball limply to mid-on, where Broad runs in to take the most straightforward of catches! 70th over: South Africa 128-7 (Maharaj 15, Rabada 16) Four more, as Maharaj tonks Root over mid-on, where the fielder watches it sail way over his head on the way to the boundary. And then another boundary, as he works it to backward point where there is no fielder to stop it rolling away. 69th over: South Africa 120-7 (Maharaj 7, Rabada 16) Another lovely shot from Rabada, who drives to the long-on boundary for four. Meanwhile the sun is back out in Port Elizabeth, and it\u2019s blue skies ahead (though windy enough for that to change pretty swiftly). 68th over: South Africa 115-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 12) Another maiden, that Rabada six being the only scoring shot in the last four overs. This is a fine stat: 67th over: South Africa 115-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 12) Maharaj seems pretty untroubled by whatever Broad can throw at him, at least until the last, which stays low but passes safely under his bat and well wide of the stumps. \u201cWhatever happened to the tour from hell?\u201d wonders Brian Withington. \u201cWhiplash-inducing change in fortune and narrative for the red ball team - how long before canny all-rounder Joe Root is pronounced best ever captain? Rejoice and pass the smelling salts!\u201d 66th over: South Africa 115-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 12) Bingo! Rabada smashes Root high over long off for six! 65th over: South Africa 109-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 6) A maiden over from Broad to Maharaj. There were two slips in place this time, but they see no action. 64th over: South Africa 109-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 6) Root is indeed bowling himself, and there\u2019s a drop as the ball is edged to the left of Sibley at second slip and he can\u2019t react in time to collect. 63rd over: South Africa 106-7 (Maharaj 5, Rabada 4) The third ball brings the first wicket of the day, and the last the first boundary. It\u2019s off Rabada\u2019s outside edge, but there\u2019s only one slip in place and it goes wide of him and runs away. And so it begins! Well, continues! Philander gets a thick edge onto his front pad, and the ball loops up to Pope, who takes it diving forwards! Right then. The players are out and ready for action. Stuart Broad has the ball in his hands. Let\u2019s (watch other people) do this! England are 18 overs away from a new ball. Root will probably bowl a few of those, in search of his five-for. Perhaps they\u2019ll give Wood two or three overs at the start of the day, before wrapping him up until they get a look at a fresh cherry. \u201cA fine crisp day today in the UK,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can crunch our way through the Saffies again, eh? Not often one gets to write that kind of sentence, either.\u201d Stuart Broad has been interviewed by Sky this morning, in blazing sunshine. It\u2019s one of those pitches that will offer something every few overs if you put the ball in the right areas. It was a brilliant toss to win. It\u2019s one of those pitches where if you don\u2019t win the toss you can\u2019t win the game. But for us to get nearly 500 runs and the young players in the team do a lot of the work and stamp their authority on Test cricket is probably the highlight of our trip. There\u2019s a huge amount of talent. We know it can take a bit of time to settle in to Test cricket. The great thing about the young players that I see at the moment is how quickly they\u2019re learning, how quickly they want to learn. It\u2019s great for me, walking into the changing room each day and everyone\u2019s buzzing to be here. It\u2019s a great environment to be in at the moment. Sky\u2019s broadcast commences, with confirmation that it is, for now, cloudy, breezy and dry. Then Nasser Hussain lays into South Africa\u2019s lamentable performance against England\u2019s spin yesterday. Weather update: it looks like we should have a dry morning, at the very least, but would be lucky to have an entirely dry day. Hello world! England need four wickets. South Africa need one miracle. Welcome to the day five! For the second day in a row play will start with South Africa six wickets down. Yesterday they lost their final four wickets within 24 balls and for the addition of one run. They can only do better today (surely?). Perhaps of more concern to England will be the weather, which as I write this (on Sunday evening UK time) looks potentially, rather than certainly, rainy. If it stays dry, South Africa are surely doomed. Here\u2019s some pre-play reading: And here\u2019s Vic Marks\u2019 report on day four:",

Yet, tragically, it also unintentionally serves to reinforce the false narrative, perpetuated by fossil fuel propagandists, that we are all equally to blame.</p> \n<p>In reality, today\u2019s climate chaos is big oil\u2019s legacy, not ours. Unlike the rest of us, the fossil fuel industry saw this climate chaos coming, then literally and figuratively added fuel to the fire, doubling down on a business model incompatible with the science of stopping global warming; buying political inaction; and building a global climate denial and delay machine that has confused the public and fomented distrust of science, media and government.</p> \n<p>In October last year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/exxon-climate-crisis-house-democrats-hearing\">US Congress began to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/exxon-climate-crisis-house-democrats-hearing\">investigate</a> this history. Before a packed audience at a congressional subcommittee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/exxon-climate-crisis-house-democrats-hearing\">hearing</a> titled Examining the Oil Industry\u2019s Efforts to Suppress the Truth about Climate Change, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the climate scientist Dr Martin Hoffert about his collaborative research with Exxon in the 1980s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"36386f58-f651-4901-879e-6fa3dcc38acd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FGVW9vJ773k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSo in 1982,\u201d she said, referring to a recently <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken\">uncovered</a> internal company <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/documents/1982%20Exxon%20Primer%20on%20CO2%20Greenhouse%20Effect.pdf#page=14\">memo</a> containing a graph of global carbon dioxide and temperature levels rising over time, \u201c1982 \u2013 seven years before I was even born \u2013 Exxon accurately predicted that by this year, 2019, the Earth would hit a carbon dioxide concentration of 415 parts per million and a temperature increase of 1C. Dr Hoffert, is that correct?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were excellent scientists,\u201d answered the former New York University physics professor, triggering laughter from the audience.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes, you were; yes, you were,\u201d the congresswoman agreed. \u201cSo they knew.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was the first time that Congress \u2013 indeed, any legislative body in the world \u2013 had heard a firsthand account \u2013 from someone who was actually involved in the work \u2013 of just how much, and how early, the fossil fuel industry knew of the potential global warming dangers of its products.</p> \n<p>The event showed how effective such hearings can be. In the space of a couple of hours, expert witness testimony (including by one of us) and thousands of pages of documented evidence entered the congressional record. Masterful questioning helped translate a key whistleblower\u2019s knowledge into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/alexandria-\">viral</a> C-Span moment.</p> \n<p>It was just one hearing, but it had the makings of the tobacco industry investigations led by Representative Henry Waxman in the 1990s. He could just as easily have been speaking about fossil fuels when he <a href=\"https://constitutionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Waxman.pdf\">described</a> the purpose of that congressional oversight: \u201cTo build a public record and eventually create enough momentum in Congress and among the American public for legislation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Our message to Congress after its first foray into investigating fossil fuels is this: keep going. Because big oil is the new big tobacco.</p> \n<p>Investigative <a href=\"https://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/\">journalism</a> and peer-reviewed research, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/opinion/exxon-climate-change-.html\">our own</a>, clearly demonstrate that the fossil fuel regime has deliberately denied Americans and Congress their right to be accurately informed about the climate crisis, just as tobacco companies misled Americans about the harms of smoking. From <a href=\"http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/UCSexxon_report.pdf\">strategy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/02/19/how-tobacco-and-fossil-fuel-companies-fund-disinformation-campaigns-around-world\">networks</a> to <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tobacco-and-oil-industries-used-same-researchers-to-sway-public1/\">personnel</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2015/mar/05/doubt-over-climate-science-is-a-product-with-an-industry-behind-it\">rhetoric</a>, the fossil fuel regime\u2019s efforts to deny and delay come <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/merchants-of-doubt-9781608193943/\">straight out</a> of big tobacco\u2019s playbook.</p> \n<p>The historical record is incontrovertible. As we summarize in a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/americamisled\">recent report</a>, the fossil fuel industry\u2019s own internal documents reveal that it has been studying CO<sub>2</sub> pollution for more than 60 years. As early as the 1950s, it <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0349-9\">knew</a> its products had the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/01/on-its-hundredth-birthday-in-1959-edward-teller-warned-the-oil-industry-about-global-warming\">potential</a> to change the climate. By the late 1970s and early 80s, Exxon scientists were explicitly <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming\">aware</a> that burning fossil fuels could lead to what they called \u201ccatastrophic\u201d global warming. In 1986, an internal \u201cgreenhouse effect working group\u201d at Shell <a href=\"http://www.climatefiles.com/shell/1988-shell-report-greenhouse/\">concluded</a>: \u201cThe changes in climate \u2026 may be the greatest in recorded history.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil\u2019s closet, we are still only looking through the keyhole</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But instead of taking action or warning the public, fossil fuel interests stayed quiet. Then, in the late 1980s and early 90s, when global warming finally caught the world\u2019s attention, the carbon majors sprang to action and took the <a href=\"https://www.sheredling.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-03-95-Center-for-Climate-Integrity-et-al-Amicus.pdf#page=28\">low road</a>, spending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/oil-companies-climate-crisis-pr-spending\">billions of dollars</a> over the next 30 years on advertising and lobbying challenging science, slandering scientists and attacking policies to protect their profits. In so doing, they have undermined \u2013 and continue to undermine \u2013 Americans\u2019 chances of a just and stable future.</p> \n<p>Today, the case for subterfuge is so strong that New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 14 US cities and counties have variously <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04042018/climate-change-fossil-fuel-company-lawsuits-timeline-exxon-children-california-cities-attorney-general\">sued</a> ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies for fraud, damages or denial. Maui and Honolulu have recently <a href=\"https://heated.world/p/why-hawaii-is-taking-big-oil-to-court\">added</a> their intentions to file lawsuits. In Australia, there are mounting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/should-fossil-fuels-pay-for-australias-new-bushfire-reality-it-is-the-industry-most-responsible\">calls</a> to <a href=\"https://heated.world/p/celebrities-are-donating-more-than\">make polluters</a>, not just taxpayers, pay for wildfire relief and climate mitigation.</p> \n<p>For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil\u2019s closet, however, we are still only looking through the keyhole. Tracking down a few hundred documents has allowed us to uncover some key cogs in the climate denial <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Riley_Dunlap/publication/284261736_Organized_Climate_Change_Denial/links/5652077b08aeafc2aaba80c3/Organized-Climate-Change-Denial.pdf#page=3\">machine</a>. Yet it is a sprawling, well-funded, well-oiled network that stretches far beyond ExxonMobil and the Kochs: a labyrinth of people and money connecting fossil fuel companies, utilities, ancillary manufacturers, trade associations, PR firms, advertising agencies, libertarian foundations, thinktanks, legal firms and individuals, all feeding an echo chamber of pundits, astroturf groups, blogs, media and, yes, politicians. Network analysis has <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2875\">identified</a> at least 4,556 individuals and 164 organizations in the global web of denial. We believe the American public deserve to know the truth \u2013 and see the receipts \u2013 of these dealings that have already led to deaths, destruction and the injustices of a collapsing climate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/15/climate-emergency-2019-was-second-hottest-year-on-record\">Climate emergency: 2019 was second hottest year on record</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is where congressional authority to request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas, comes in. Key breakthroughs in tobacco control came as congressional investigations \u2013 as well as legal discovery and industry whistleblowers \u2013 exposed thousands, and <a href=\"https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/\">ultimately millions</a>, of damning documents. The tobacco industry was found guilty of racketeering in part because of the ways that individual companies had coordinated with each other and with third-party allies to present false information to consumers. That history is a <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Morton_Rosenberg_Testimony.pdf\">precedent</a> for Congress to investigate an industry network that has misled the public and policymakers in an effort to deny the dangers of its products and derail regulation.</p> \n<p>As the congressional scholar Morton Rosenberg recently <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/climate/hearings/climate-crisis-committee-to-hold-hearing-on-dark-money-and-climate-change\">testified</a> in the Senate: \u201cCongress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel production of information needed to discharge their legislative functions.\u201d</p> \n<p>We are not politicians or political strategists, so we do not presume to dictate how Congress exercises its investigatory powers. But as experts in the history of climate denial and global warming politics, it is our opinion that holding the fossil fuel industry accountable would be one of the most impactful ways for Congress \u2013 and governments around the world \u2013 to combat the climate crisis. Impeachment investigations understandably occupy much attention. Unfortunately, irreversible global warming and the fossil fuel regime underwriting it will be even harder to unseat than a president, and time is not on our side.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Geoffrey Supran is a research associate in the department of the history of science at Harvard University, where he investigates the tactics of fossil fuel interests.

      "bodyText": "Greta Thunberg summed up 2019 in five words: \u201cOur house is on fire.\u201d In Australia, this is now literally the case. Wildfires there have been raging for more than a month and now span an area larger than Switzerland. The situation bears all the hallmarks of a hot new world: lives lost, livelihoods ruined and species pushed towards extinction, accompanied by government inaction, industry PR spin, abetting rightwing echo chambers, and taxpayers footing the multibillion-dollar bill. Insanely, the Australian government remains in denial \u2013 ignoring the science, downplaying the seriousness and subservient to coal. The fossil fuel industry, meanwhile, is busy greenwashing and gaslighting: Chevron is boasting about its $1m donation \u2013 0.00667% of its annual earnings \u2013 to the Australian Red Cross, and Exxon Australia just wants everyone to \u201cStay safe and have fun\u201d. All this is set to a backdrop of mutually reinforcing rightwing new outlets, online bots and trolls, which are distracting and misinforming the public about the science and politics of climate-catalyzed fires. The charity of everyday people (and some celebrities) rising to meet the disaster has been inspiring and essential. Yet, tragically, it also unintentionally serves to reinforce the false narrative, perpetuated by fossil fuel propagandists, that we are all equally to blame. In reality, today\u2019s climate chaos is big oil\u2019s legacy, not ours. Unlike the rest of us, the fossil fuel industry saw this climate chaos coming, then literally and figuratively added fuel to the fire, doubling down on a business model incompatible with the science of stopping global warming; buying political inaction; and building a global climate denial and delay machine that has confused the public and fomented distrust of science, media and government. In October last year, the US Congress began to investigate this history. Before a packed audience at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled Examining the Oil Industry\u2019s Efforts to Suppress the Truth about Climate Change, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the climate scientist Dr Martin Hoffert about his collaborative research with Exxon in the 1980s. \u201cSo in 1982,\u201d she said, referring to a recently uncovered internal company memo containing a graph of global carbon dioxide and temperature levels rising over time, \u201c1982 \u2013 seven years before I was even born \u2013 Exxon accurately predicted that by this year, 2019, the Earth would hit a carbon dioxide concentration of 415 parts per million and a temperature increase of 1C. Dr Hoffert, is that correct?\u201d \u201cWe were excellent scientists,\u201d answered the former New York University physics professor, triggering laughter from the audience. \u201cYes, you were; yes, you were,\u201d the congresswoman agreed. \u201cSo they knew.\u201d This was the first time that Congress \u2013 indeed, any legislative body in the world \u2013 had heard a firsthand account \u2013 from someone who was actually involved in the work \u2013 of just how much, and how early, the fossil fuel industry knew of the potential global warming dangers of its products. The event showed how effective such hearings can be. In the space of a couple of hours, expert witness testimony (including by one of us) and thousands of pages of documented evidence entered the congressional record. Masterful questioning helped translate a key whistleblower\u2019s knowledge into a viral C-Span moment. It was just one hearing, but it had the makings of the tobacco industry investigations led by Representative Henry Waxman in the 1990s. He could just as easily have been speaking about fossil fuels when he described the purpose of that congressional oversight: \u201cTo build a public record and eventually create enough momentum in Congress and among the American public for legislation.\u201d Our message to Congress after its first foray into investigating fossil fuels is this: keep going. Because big oil is the new big tobacco. Investigative journalism and peer-reviewed research, including our own, clearly demonstrate that the fossil fuel regime has deliberately denied Americans and Congress their right to be accurately informed about the climate crisis, just as tobacco companies misled Americans about the harms of smoking. From strategy to networks to personnel to rhetoric, the fossil fuel regime\u2019s efforts to deny and delay come straight out of big tobacco\u2019s playbook. The historical record is incontrovertible. As we summarize in a recent report, the fossil fuel industry\u2019s own internal documents reveal that it has been studying CO2 pollution for more than 60 years. As early as the 1950s, it knew its products had the potential to change the climate. By the late 1970s and early 80s, Exxon scientists were explicitly aware that burning fossil fuels could lead to what they called \u201ccatastrophic\u201d global warming. In 1986, an internal \u201cgreenhouse effect working group\u201d at Shell concluded: \u201cThe changes in climate \u2026 may be the greatest in recorded history.\u201d But instead of taking action or warning the public, fossil fuel interests stayed quiet. Then, in the late 1980s and early 90s, when global warming finally caught the world\u2019s attention, the carbon majors sprang to action and took the low road, spending billions of dollars over the next 30 years on advertising and lobbying challenging science, slandering scientists and attacking policies to protect their profits. In so doing, they have undermined \u2013 and continue to undermine \u2013 Americans\u2019 chances of a just and stable future. Today, the case for subterfuge is so strong that New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 14 US cities and counties have variously sued ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies for fraud, damages or denial. Maui and Honolulu have recently added their intentions to file lawsuits. In Australia, there are mounting calls to make polluters, not just taxpayers, pay for wildfire relief and climate mitigation. For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil\u2019s closet, however, we are still only looking through the keyhole. Tracking down a few hundred documents has allowed us to uncover some key cogs in the climate denial machine. Yet it is a sprawling, well-funded, well-oiled network that stretches far beyond ExxonMobil and the Kochs: a labyrinth of people and money connecting fossil fuel companies, utilities, ancillary manufacturers, trade associations, PR firms, advertising agencies, libertarian foundations, thinktanks, legal firms and individuals, all feeding an echo chamber of pundits, astroturf groups, blogs, media and, yes, politicians. Network analysis has identified at least 4,556 individuals and 164 organizations in the global web of denial. We believe the American public deserve to know the truth \u2013 and see the receipts \u2013 of these dealings that have already led to deaths, destruction and the injustices of a collapsing climate. This is where congressional authority to request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas, comes in. Key breakthroughs in tobacco control came as congressional investigations \u2013 as well as legal discovery and industry whistleblowers \u2013 exposed thousands, and ultimately millions, of damning documents. The tobacco industry was found guilty of racketeering in part because of the ways that individual companies had coordinated with each other and with third-party allies to present false information to consumers. That history is a precedent for Congress to investigate an industry network that has misled the public and policymakers in an effort to deny the dangers of its products and derail regulation. As the congressional scholar Morton Rosenberg recently testified in the Senate: \u201cCongress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel production of information needed to discharge their legislative functions.\u201d We are not politicians or political strategists, so we do not presume to dictate how Congress exercises its investigatory powers. But as experts in the history of climate denial and global warming politics, it is our opinion that holding the fossil fuel industry accountable would be one of the most impactful ways for Congress \u2013 and governments around the world \u2013 to combat the climate crisis. Impeachment investigations understandably occupy much attention. Unfortunately, irreversible global warming and the fossil fuel regime underwriting it will be even harder to unseat than a president, and time is not on our side.

He is also eager to learn, yet bright enough not to follow slavishly every piece of advice offered; instead he sifts what he thinks will help. And he is up for any challenge. In one area he surpasses Moeen Ali. Whenever Moeen beats the bat with a lovely, turning delivery he gives the impression that this must have been an accident rather than a consequence of his special skill. By contrast Bess can bowl an innocuous straight ball and, if it does not meet the middle of the middle of the bat, up go the arms to his head; he has a little stare to suggest that the batsman was really quite fortunate to survive his latest, fizzing off-break. He is a more optimistic bowler than Moeen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34030c50dcb09dc770d1794a9c286fff04668896\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34030c50dcb09dc770d1794a9c286fff04668896/0_0_3500_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wood celebrates the wicket of South Africa\u2019s Keshav Maharaj.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood celebrates the wicket of South Africa\u2019s Keshav Maharaj.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then there is Root, the off-spinner.

This should not mean, however, that Root undertakes to bowl many of those tough first-innings overs on a non-turning track. That is a job for the specialists. He has enough to do already. But when the ball is turning he presents possibilities. This advance and Bess\u2019s success change the dynamic a little for the tour of Sri Lanka, although there is little doubt that Moeen would be in the best squad \u2013 if available.</p> \n<p>Wood\u2019s efforts were impressive and very encouraging; they also challenged the received wisdom. He had not bowled in a red-ball game for 11 months yet his preparations were so precise and conscientious that he could be parachuted into a Test match and still bowl with rhythm, control and, crucially, pace. Perhaps he really can be a wildcard in two or three Tests in a five-match series.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up for our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/220\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up for our weekly cricket email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All this optimism has to be tempered by the nature of South Africa\u2019s performance.

Bess is not mysterious but he is increasingly competent. He is also eager to learn, yet bright enough not to follow slavishly every piece of advice offered; instead he sifts what he thinks will help. And he is up for any challenge. In one area he surpasses Moeen Ali. Whenever Moeen beats the bat with a lovely, turning delivery he gives the impression that this must have been an accident rather than a consequence of his special skill. By contrast Bess can bowl an innocuous straight ball and, if it does not meet the middle of the middle of the bat, up go the arms to his head; he has a little stare to suggest that the batsman was really quite fortunate to survive his latest, fizzing off-break. He is a more optimistic bowler than Moeen. Then there is Root, the off-spinner. On Sunday he exploited the conditions better that Bess partly because he has learnt to propel the ball at pace, usually from around the wicket, and here it gripped and spun more than Bess could manage. In certain circumstances this can be invaluable \u2013 the upcoming tour to Sri Lanka springs to mind. This should not mean, however, that Root undertakes to bowl many of those tough first-innings overs on a non-turning track. That is a job for the specialists. He has enough to do already. But when the ball is turning he presents possibilities. This advance and Bess\u2019s success change the dynamic a little for the tour of Sri Lanka, although there is little doubt that Moeen would be in the best squad \u2013 if available. Wood\u2019s efforts were impressive and very encouraging; they also challenged the received wisdom. He had not bowled in a red-ball game for 11 months yet his preparations were so precise and conscientious that he could be parachuted into a Test match and still bowl with rhythm, control and, crucially, pace. Perhaps he really can be a wildcard in two or three Tests in a five-match series. All this optimism has to be tempered by the nature of South Africa\u2019s performance. From the second day onwards they were pretty awful. The loss of Rabada for the last Test, which was announced on the second morning, was a blow in the solar plexus for the team and the management for whom this decision creates all sorts of complications. Graeme Smith, the interim cricket director, opted to appoint coaches from his old team, Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis, because they might bring order, inspiration and, just possibly, instant success. The victory in Centurion seemed to give him leeway in terms of selection and policy but after two defeats, the second of which bordered on a humiliation, despite those late blows from Maharaj, that room for manoeuvre is fast disappearing. A drawn series after a South African victory at the Wanderers in Johannesburg might ease the situation but somehow this now seems most unlikely.",

The challenge now is to emulate the success of Saracens on two fronts and the Chiefs, armed with a ball-winning pack that spurns few opportunities close to an opponent\u2019s line, will take some stopping.

Batty had not long before scored a try to put Bath within four points of their hosts and the Premiership side were left to ponder their fate had they played with such resolution from the start of the tournament. Clermont Auvergne needed to win at Harlequins to win the group and, while they were never behind, they failed to pull away from their hosts, who were some way below full strength and were pressing for a draw at the end. <strong>PR</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51f5c9fc97157e1ed8c5ca05e96cc5796f40e92f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51f5c9fc97157e1ed8c5ca05e96cc5796f40e92f/0_200_2914_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Batty (centre) was sent off late on for Bath.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross Batty (centre) was sent off late on for Bath.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver McVeigh/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Pool 4</h2> \n<p>Racing 92\u2019s reward, if it can be called that, for topping the pool is a trip to Stade Marcel Michelin to meet Clermont. The Parisians look a good outside bet to win the Champions Cup. They gave Saracens an almighty scare in Barnet after their sleepy start and in Virimi Vakatawa have a centre who can cause any defence problems. Finn Russell is a class act behind their powerful pack that yielded nothing to Saracens. The champions themselves will be anxious to maintain some meaning to their season but it is difficult to see even them winning in Leinster.

Toulouse look certainties to prevail against Ulster at home in the quarter-finals. They rounded off their pool campaign with a 35-14 win against Gloucester and in Romain Ntamack, scorer of two tries on Sunday, have a real match-winner. The sight of Louis Rees-Zammit, the 18-year-old wing picked by Pivac in his Wales squad last week, limping off in Toulouse was not a heartening one for Gloucester fans. The Cherry and Whites never really recovered from their opening home defeat by Toulouse and continue to be maddeningly inconsistent. <strong>IM</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Pool 1 Leinster secured top-seed status after a hard-earned victory at Treviso. They did not need a bonus point which was just as well as they scored only two tries and it took them an hour to manufacture the first one. At one point it seemed Leinster would repeat their 3-0 Pro14 victory at Zebre in October but tries from Caelan Doris, who had spent 10 minutes in the sin-bin in the first half, and James Tracy ensured a stress-free final 15 minutes. The game in Lyon was far more open, generating eight tries, five of them scored by Northampton who again overcame a poor start to finish with a flourish. The bonus point left them with one leg planted in the quarter\u2011finals with the other landing the following day after Saracens failed to sprinkle their victory against Racing 92 with a fifth point. PR \u2022 Match report: Lyon 24-36 Northampton Pool 2 Exeter secured their first home tie in the European Champions Cup knock-out phase in timely fashion, the final whistle sounding on their ultimately decisive victory against La Rochelle as Premiership Rugby was putting out a statement that Saracens would be relegated at the end of the season. The Chiefs\u2019 chairman, Tony Rowe, who has led the chorus for the English and European champions to face drastic action for persistent breaches of the salary cap, confined his reaction to an interview with a local radio station, savouring the achievement of a team that was in the Championship 10 years ago. The challenge now is to emulate the success of Saracens on two fronts and the Chiefs, armed with a ball-winning pack that spurns few opportunities close to an opponent\u2019s line, will take some stopping. Glasgow scored six tries in their 45-7 demolition of Sale at the AJ Bell Stadium, but they were left to rue their home defeat against La Rochelle after Saracens overtook their 17 points. PR \u2022 Match report: Exeter 33-14 La Rochelle Pool 3 Bath and Harlequins had no chance of qualifying but they both made the top two teams, who were jockeying to finish first, battle hard for their victories. Bath endured a winless pool campaign in the Champions Cup for the first time but pushed Ulster all the way in Belfast, succumbing only after Ross Batty\u2019s dismissal for a dangerous tackle eight minutes from time. Batty had not long before scored a try to put Bath within four points of their hosts and the Premiership side were left to ponder their fate had they played with such resolution from the start of the tournament. Clermont Auvergne needed to win at Harlequins to win the group and, while they were never behind, they failed to pull away from their hosts, who were some way below full strength and were pressing for a draw at the end. PR Pool 4 Racing 92\u2019s reward, if it can be called that, for topping the pool is a trip to Stade Marcel Michelin to meet Clermont. The Parisians look a good outside bet to win the Champions Cup. They gave Saracens an almighty scare in Barnet after their sleepy start and in Virimi Vakatawa have a centre who can cause any defence problems. Finn Russell is a class act behind their powerful pack that yielded nothing to Saracens. The champions themselves will be anxious to maintain some meaning to their season but it is difficult to see even them winning in Leinster. They looked weighed down on Sunday with the pressures off the pitch and the loss of Billy Vunipola is an enormous blow to them and England this spring. Munster rounded off their European season with a routine win over the Ospreys, whose demise must be a concern for Wales\u2019s new head coach, Wayne Pivac. IM \u2022 Match report: Saracens 27-24 Racing 92 Pool 5 Toulouse, like Leinster, are the other team to finish their campaign with a 100% record and are once more playing with their old flair after a couple of years in the doldrums. Toulouse look certainties to prevail against Ulster at home in the quarter-finals. They rounded off their pool campaign with a 35-14 win against Gloucester and in Romain Ntamack, scorer of two tries on Sunday, have a real match-winner. The sight of Louis Rees-Zammit, the 18-year-old wing picked by Pivac in his Wales squad last week, limping off in Toulouse was not a heartening one for Gloucester fans. The Cherry and Whites never really recovered from their opening home defeat by Toulouse and continue to be maddeningly inconsistent. IM",

      "body": "<p>The Department of Defense is polluting the environment with toxic chemicals by continuing to incinerate a vast stockpile of firefighting foam in a move environmentalists say is in breach of new regulations.</p> <p>In a letter sent last week to the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, several environmental organizations argue the defense department is already out of compliance with new provisions regulating the disposal of the material and insist that it \u201cimmediately cease\u201d incineration of the foam \u2013 called AFFF \u2013 which puts communities at risk.</p> <p>AFFF is laced with toxic chemicals called PFOS and PFOA, two compounds belonging to a larger family of potentially toxic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).</p> <p>These chemicals have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney and thyroid disease, and pregnancy complications. The defense department used AFFF<a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/research/pfas-chemicals-contaminate-least-110-us-military-sites/pentagon-s-50-year-history-pfas\"> for decades</a>, leading to<a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/toxic-threat-pfas-contamination-military-bases\"> widespread contamination</a> of ground and drinking water at military bases nationwide.</p> <p>The National Defense Authorization Act says AFFF incineration must now be conducted in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA) at permitted hazardous waste facilities.</p> <p>But Erik Olson, the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s senior director for health and food, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a need for much more significant research and regulatory action to make sure that disposal is done in a way that doesn\u2019t just move the environmental problem around.\u201d</p> <p>Sonya Lunder, the Sierra Club\u2019s senior toxics adviser for its gender, equity and environment program, warned that incineration is unlikely to fully break down toxic chemicals in AFFF, leading to PFAS compounds, including possible greenhouse gases, being emitted into the environment.</p> <p>The Guardian reported in December that these compounds have been detected in rainwater across the country at levels high enough to trigger regulatory action if found in drinking water.</p> <p>Experts also voice concern over the poor compliance histories at certain hazardous waste incinerators and the proximity to these plants of low-income, vulnerable communities.</p> <p>The Veolia-owned hazardous waste incinerator in Sauget, Illinois, for example, has been issued a high-priority violation of the CAA every quarter for the past three years. Over half of the population within a three-mile radius of the plant live below the poverty level.</p> <p>For Mamie Cosey, who lives less than a mile from the Veolia plant in Sauget, the defense department \u201cabsolutely\u201d should not be allowed to incinerate AFFF so close to her home, she said. \u201cWhy do the residents have to suffer just because someone says that this is safe?\u201d</p> <p>Just turned 79, retired teacher Cosey is the guardian of three teenage great-grandchildren, and the \u201cterrible\u201d pollution already emitted from the plant causes her to worry that their asthma, headaches and other health issues will worsen, she said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have but a few more years to live,\u201d Cosey said. \u201cBut my great-grandchildren \u2013how will they grow up? What\u2019s the lasting effect of this on their life?\u201d</p> <p>Instead of incineration, said Lunder, the foam should be disposed of with technologies like those used to destroy the nation\u2019s stockpile of obsolete chemical weapons.</p> <p>Indeed, the air force has already solicited proposals for alternative disposal techniques, citing possible key failures with incineration.</p> <p>Maureen Sullivan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment, wrote in a statement that the defense department has been incinerating PFAS materials at hazardous waste facilities since 2016, \u201cas it is more protective of human health and the environment\u201d.</p> <p>The defense department did not answer how much AFFF is awaiting disposal. Early last year, the Intercept reported that the DoD was waiting to destroy 2m gallons of foam and contaminated water.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Department of Defense is polluting the environment with toxic chemicals by continuing to incinerate a vast stockpile of firefighting foam in a move environmentalists say is in breach of new regulations. In a letter sent last week to the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, several environmental organizations argue the defense department is already out of compliance with new provisions regulating the disposal of the material and insist that it \u201cimmediately cease\u201d incineration of the foam \u2013 called AFFF \u2013 which puts communities at risk. AFFF is laced with toxic chemicals called PFOS and PFOA, two compounds belonging to a larger family of potentially toxic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). These chemicals have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney and thyroid disease, and pregnancy complications. The defense department used AFFF for decades, leading to widespread contamination of ground and drinking water at military bases nationwide. The National Defense Authorization Act says AFFF incineration must now be conducted in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA) at permitted hazardous waste facilities. But Erik Olson, the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s senior director for health and food, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a need for much more significant research and regulatory action to make sure that disposal is done in a way that doesn\u2019t just move the environmental problem around.\u201d Sonya Lunder, the Sierra Club\u2019s senior toxics adviser for its gender, equity and environment program, warned that incineration is unlikely to fully break down toxic chemicals in AFFF, leading to PFAS compounds, including possible greenhouse gases, being emitted into the environment. The Guardian reported in December that these compounds have been detected in rainwater across the country at levels high enough to trigger regulatory action if found in drinking water. Experts also voice concern over the poor compliance histories at certain hazardous waste incinerators and the proximity to these plants of low-income, vulnerable communities. The Veolia-owned hazardous waste incinerator in Sauget, Illinois, for example, has been issued a high-priority violation of the CAA every quarter for the past three years. Over half of the population within a three-mile radius of the plant live below the poverty level. For Mamie Cosey, who lives less than a mile from the Veolia plant in Sauget, the defense department \u201cabsolutely\u201d should not be allowed to incinerate AFFF so close to her home, she said. \u201cWhy do the residents have to suffer just because someone says that this is safe?\u201d Just turned 79, retired teacher Cosey is the guardian of three teenage great-grandchildren, and the \u201cterrible\u201d pollution already emitted from the plant causes her to worry that their asthma, headaches and other health issues will worsen, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have but a few more years to live,\u201d Cosey said. \u201cBut my great-grandchildren \u2013how will they grow up? What\u2019s the lasting effect of this on their life?\u201d Instead of incineration, said Lunder, the foam should be disposed of with technologies like those used to destroy the nation\u2019s stockpile of obsolete chemical weapons. Indeed, the air force has already solicited proposals for alternative disposal techniques, citing possible key failures with incineration. Maureen Sullivan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment, wrote in a statement that the defense department has been incinerating PFAS materials at hazardous waste facilities since 2016, \u201cas it is more protective of human health and the environment\u201d. The defense department did not answer how much AFFF is awaiting disposal. Early last year, the Intercept reported that the DoD was waiting to destroy 2m gallons of foam and contaminated water.",

Women and girls across the globe contribute an estimated \u00a38.28tn ($10.8tn) to the global economy with a total of 12.5bn hours a day of unpaid care work, a figure more than three times the worth of the global tech industry, claims an Oxfam report published on Monday ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The charity says women around the world, especially those living in poverty, do more than three-quarters of all unpaid care work, which is chronically undervalued and taken for granted by businesses and governments alike. Ageing populations, cuts in public spending, and the climate crisis will exacerbate gender and economic inequality, the report warns. \u201cWhen 22 men have more wealth than all the women in Africa combined, it\u2019s clear that our economy is just plain sexist,\u201d said Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, Danny Sriskandarajah. \u201cIf world leaders meeting this week are serious about reducing poverty and inequality, they urgently need to invest in care and other public services that make life easier for those with care responsibilities, and tackle the discrimination holding back women and girls.\u201d In spite of increasing awareness about the wealth divide, most world leaders continue to pursue policy agendas that benefit the rich and hurt the poor, the report claims, pointing to tax cuts for billionaires promoted by US President Donald Trump and Brazil\u2019s leader Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cThe richer should be paying their fair share of tax, not dodging their tax or avoiding paying it,\u201d said Katy Chakrabortty from Oxfam GB. \u201cGetting the richest 1% to pay just 0.5% tax on their wealth \u2013 just on their wealth, not their income \u2013 would create enough money over the next 10 years to pay for 117m jobs, in education, health and elderly care. \u201cIf we really value care, then we need to be helping to shoulder the responsibilities so that women and girls can find the time to get an education or pursue their own, better remunerated activities.\u201d An estimated 2.3 billion people will be in need of care by 2030, an increase of 200 million from 2015, said the report. But governments are increasing taxation on the poorest, cutting public spending and privatising education and health, according to Oxfam. The climate crisis will mean an estimated 2.4bn people living with water shortages in the next five years, and already women and girls are disproportionately affected, having to walk further to find water. Solutions lie in governments thinking beyond profit and investing in water, sanitation, electricity, child and healthcare to improve quality of life and free up hours of work a day, according to Oxfam. \u201cFeminists used to say women held up half the world \u2013 well now it\u2019s the majority of women holding up a very small group of men on very high precipices,\u201d said Beverley Skeggs, a professor of sociology at the University of Lancaster. \u201cThis report challenges us to think differently.

In fact, there should be statues of her and cinemas named after her. At the very least, Guy-Blach\u00e9\u2019s name belongs in chapter one of cinema history, because she was the first female film director; indeed, for a good decade she was the only female film director.</p> <p>Guy-Blach\u00e9 was in the room when the Lumi\u00e8re brothers held the first ever cinema screening, in Paris in March 1895. By the following year, she was making her own films. And while the Lumi\u00e8res were still hung up on cinema as a technological spectacle \u2013 \u201cLook! A train!\u201d \u2013 Guy-Blach\u00e9 immediately saw its potential for telling stories. Even her 60-second debut, The Cabbage Fairy, had a fictional narrative (a fairy conjures babies from cardboard cabbages). As time went on, Guy-Blach\u00e9 helped write the rules of this brand new medium. She incorporated now-standard techniques such as editing, primitive special effects and hand-tinted colour. She might even have invented the music video, back in 1905, with her use of newfangled \u201cchronophone\u201d technology, by which singers were filmed lip-syncing to a prerecorded playback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa579006e1bac5e1782d97d81e052fb31258cea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa579006e1bac5e1782d97d81e052fb31258cea2/64_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Soul Market (1916), produced by Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Soul Market (1916), produced by Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guy-Blach\u00e9 began as in-house film-maker for France\u2019s Gaumont pictures, where she seems to have done everything: producing, writing, directing, casting, set design. She then moved to the US and founded her own studio (another first), Solax. She made more than 1,000 films, including comedies, westerns and dramas, many of which put women to the fore. Her 1906 film The Consequences of Feminism imagines a world where gender roles are reversed: men sew and iron at home while the women smoke and fight. She also made possibly the first all-African-American film: 1912\u2019s A Fool and His Money (its racial politics leave something to be desired).</p> <p>How could such a pioneer fade into obscurity? Film-maker Pamela B Green finds out in her new documentary Be Natural (which takes its title from a sign to actors Guy-Blach\u00e9 had hanging in her studio). Inevitably, the answer has much to do with her gender. Being a woman was no impediment to Guy-Blach\u00e9\u2019s career in France, but things got worse when she went to the US. But it is as much to do with how film history has been written by men. While her male counterparts were canonised, Guy-Blach\u00e9\u2019s work was forgotten, neglected, even attributed to the men.</p> <p>Be Natural doesn\u2019t just tell her story, it literally reconstitutes her legacy: Green scours archives, finds relatives, locates lost prints and interviews. Once it\u2019s reassembled, you wonder how this history could ever have been forgotten. And how many others like it might still be out there.</p>",

At the very least, Guy-Blach\u00e9\u2019s name belongs in chapter one of cinema history, because she was the first female film director; indeed, for a good decade she was the only female film director. Guy-Blach\u00e9 was in the room when the Lumi\u00e8re brothers held the first ever cinema screening, in Paris in March 1895. By the following year, she was making her own films. And while the Lumi\u00e8res were still hung up on cinema as a technological spectacle \u2013 \u201cLook! A train!\u201d \u2013 Guy-Blach\u00e9 immediately saw its potential for telling stories. Even her 60-second debut, The Cabbage Fairy, had a fictional narrative (a fairy conjures babies from cardboard cabbages). As time went on, Guy-Blach\u00e9 helped write the rules of this brand new medium. She incorporated now-standard techniques such as editing, primitive special effects and hand-tinted colour. She might even have invented the music video, back in 1905, with her use of newfangled \u201cchronophone\u201d technology, by which singers were filmed lip-syncing to a prerecorded playback. Guy-Blach\u00e9 began as in-house film-maker for France\u2019s Gaumont pictures, where she seems to have done everything: producing, writing, directing, casting, set design. She then moved to the US and founded her own studio (another first), Solax. She made more than 1,000 films, including comedies, westerns and dramas, many of which put women to the fore. Her 1906 film The Consequences of Feminism imagines a world where gender roles are reversed: men sew and iron at home while the women smoke and fight. She also made possibly the first all-African-American film: 1912\u2019s A Fool and His Money (its racial politics leave something to be desired). How could such a pioneer fade into obscurity? Film-maker Pamela B Green finds out in her new documentary Be Natural (which takes its title from a sign to actors Guy-Blach\u00e9 had hanging in her studio). Inevitably, the answer has much to do with her gender. Being a woman was no impediment to Guy-Blach\u00e9\u2019s career in France, but things got worse when she went to the US. But it is as much to do with how film history has been written by men. While her male counterparts were canonised, Guy-Blach\u00e9\u2019s work was forgotten, neglected, even attributed to the men. Be Natural doesn\u2019t just tell her story, it literally reconstitutes her legacy: Green scours archives, finds relatives, locates lost prints and interviews. Once it\u2019s reassembled, you wonder how this history could ever have been forgotten. And how many others like it might still be out there.",

Twenty-three years after Jane\u2019s death, and shortly before her own, Cassandra burned a significant portion of her correspondence with her sister. Literary historians and Jane fans have never quite forgiven Cassandra for this desecration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/may/19/gill-hornby-hive-interview\" title=\"\">Gill Hornby</a>\u2019s <em>Miss </em><em>Austen</em> attempts to solve the mystery with a fictional interpretation of Cassandra\u2019s motives and a tantalising suggestion of what those lost letters might have contained.</p> <p>The novel opens in 1840 with Cassandra, now in her late 60s, making an impulsive journey from her home in Hampshire to the village of Kintbury in Berkshire, ostensibly to pay her respects to a family friend, Isabella Fowle, on the death of her father. But Cassandra\u2019s real purpose is more devious; Isabella\u2019s mother, Eliza, was a dear friend of her sister and since Isabella is now to be turfed out of the rectory, Cassandra fears that Jane\u2019s letters to Eliza might fall into unscrupulous hands. The Austen industry is already sufficiently advanced that Cassandra feels bound to protect Jane\u2019s privacy by making sure whatever intimate details her sister may have confided to her friend do not become public knowledge.</p> <p>But the letters, naturally, plunge Cassy into often painful memories of their youth, so that the narrative is divided between past and present, with the Austen sisters\u2019 changing fortunes offering all the drama of financial insecurity and romantic hope and disappointment that will be familiar to Austen devotees.</p> <p>The great joy of <em>Miss Austen</em> is that the reader feels immersed in a world that is convincingly Jane\u2019s from the first page. Austen\u2019s style is superficially easy to pastiche, but deceptively hard to do well (as ITV\u2019s recent tone-deaf <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/01/peaky-blinders-series-5-review-sanditon-bake-off-black-and-white-killing-the-affair\" title=\"\"><em>Sanditon</em></a> attests); many have tried, but few have managed anything approaching her lightness of touch and swift, caustic wit.</p> <p>It\u2019s testament to Hornby\u2019s skill, then, that I had to turn to the author\u2019s note at the back to check how many of the letters included here were invented. It\u2019s also extremely funny; figures in Jane\u2019s life who might well have provided models for some of her more bumptious, self-important characters are fleshed out here with a comic relish that feels entirely Austenian. Hornby\u2019s Cassandra, concerned as she is with the written word and ideas of representation, can\u2019t help but be aware that she herself might become the future subject of outrageously inaccurate invention, as is already happening to Jane, but the novel wears this postmodern knowingness lightly. Considering a fossil at the seaside, Cassandra \u201cfelt rather sorry for it. She would hate to be dug up and pored over some time in the future.\u201d</p> <p><em>Miss Austen</em> is a novel of great kindness, often unexpectedly moving, with much to say about the status of \u201cinvisible\u201d older women. Above all, it\u2019s concerned with the triumph of small acts of goodness; you can\u2019t help feeling that Jane would have approved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"812ff64be8b04eda40df849715e5066e8f554401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/812ff64be8b04eda40df849715e5066e8f554401/0_0_3504_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talulah Riley (second left) as Mary Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talulah Riley (second left) as Mary Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Working Title</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At one point, Hornby\u2019s Cassandra worries that Jane will offend their plain and sententious sister-in-law, Mary Austen, by calling the unlikably plain and sententious Bennet sister in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> \u201cMary\u201d. Janice Hadlow evidently also felt that Mary Bennet was given a rough deal by her author and in <em>The Other Bennet </em><em>Sister</em> sets out to redress the balance, by retelling the events of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and their aftermath from Mary\u2019s perspective.</p> <p>Her Mary is a sensitive, well-meaning young woman, who strives for the affection of her remote, sardonic father and beloved older sister, Lizzie. Hadlow invents for Mary an inner life that Austen denied her, complete with romantic yearnings that she tries to dampen.</p> <p>The difficulty with trying to rewrite one of the best-loved novels in the English language is that the original is always there as the gold standard. So it is in the second part of the novel, which takes place two years after the events of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, when Hadlow\u2019s version really takes on a life of its own. Away from her family, Mary has the chance to free herself from their (and the reader\u2019s) narrow view of her.</p> <p><em>The Other Bennet Sister</em> reads as an enjoyable kind of fanfic and if it feels a little pedestrian by comparison, the fact that the appeal of these characters endures in hands less deft than their original creator\u2019s is testament to how vividly they were first drawn and the place they have established in readers\u2019 affections.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Miss Austen </em>by Gill Hornby is published by Century (\u00a312.99).

Just when you think every possible avenue for adaptation, interpretation, sequels, prequels, rewrites, biographies and spin-offs must have been exhausted, there comes news of another: our appetite for all things Austen is as indefatigable, it seems, as Lydia Bennet\u2019s for attention. Perhaps there would be less scope for speculation about Jane\u2019s own romantic adventures if more detail of her private thoughts had survived, and for that we must partially blame her devoted sister, Cassandra. Twenty-three years after Jane\u2019s death, and shortly before her own, Cassandra burned a significant portion of her correspondence with her sister. Literary historians and Jane fans have never quite forgiven Cassandra for this desecration and Gill Hornby\u2019s Miss Austen attempts to solve the mystery with a fictional interpretation of Cassandra\u2019s motives and a tantalising suggestion of what those lost letters might have contained. The novel opens in 1840 with Cassandra, now in her late 60s, making an impulsive journey from her home in Hampshire to the village of Kintbury in Berkshire, ostensibly to pay her respects to a family friend, Isabella Fowle, on the death of her father. But Cassandra\u2019s real purpose is more devious; Isabella\u2019s mother, Eliza, was a dear friend of her sister and since Isabella is now to be turfed out of the rectory, Cassandra fears that Jane\u2019s letters to Eliza might fall into unscrupulous hands. The Austen industry is already sufficiently advanced that Cassandra feels bound to protect Jane\u2019s privacy by making sure whatever intimate details her sister may have confided to her friend do not become public knowledge. But the letters, naturally, plunge Cassy into often painful memories of their youth, so that the narrative is divided between past and present, with the Austen sisters\u2019 changing fortunes offering all the drama of financial insecurity and romantic hope and disappointment that will be familiar to Austen devotees. The great joy of Miss Austen is that the reader feels immersed in a world that is convincingly Jane\u2019s from the first page. Austen\u2019s style is superficially easy to pastiche, but deceptively hard to do well (as ITV\u2019s recent tone-deaf Sanditon attests); many have tried, but few have managed anything approaching her lightness of touch and swift, caustic wit. It\u2019s testament to Hornby\u2019s skill, then, that I had to turn to the author\u2019s note at the back to check how many of the letters included here were invented. It\u2019s also extremely funny; figures in Jane\u2019s life who might well have provided models for some of her more bumptious, self-important characters are fleshed out here with a comic relish that feels entirely Austenian. Hornby\u2019s Cassandra, concerned as she is with the written word and ideas of representation, can\u2019t help but be aware that she herself might become the future subject of outrageously inaccurate invention, as is already happening to Jane, but the novel wears this postmodern knowingness lightly. Considering a fossil at the seaside, Cassandra \u201cfelt rather sorry for it. She would hate to be dug up and pored over some time in the future.\u201d Miss Austen is a novel of great kindness, often unexpectedly moving, with much to say about the status of \u201cinvisible\u201d older women. Above all, it\u2019s concerned with the triumph of small acts of goodness; you can\u2019t help feeling that Jane would have approved. At one point, Hornby\u2019s Cassandra worries that Jane will offend their plain and sententious sister-in-law, Mary Austen, by calling the unlikably plain and sententious Bennet sister in Pride and Prejudice \u201cMary\u201d. Janice Hadlow evidently also felt that Mary Bennet was given a rough deal by her author and in The Other Bennet Sister sets out to redress the balance, by retelling the events of Pride and Prejudice and their aftermath from Mary\u2019s perspective. Her Mary is a sensitive, well-meaning young woman, who strives for the affection of her remote, sardonic father and beloved older sister, Lizzie. Hadlow invents for Mary an inner life that Austen denied her, complete with romantic yearnings that she tries to dampen. The difficulty with trying to rewrite one of the best-loved novels in the English language is that the original is always there as the gold standard. So it is in the second part of the novel, which takes place two years after the events of Pride and Prejudice, when Hadlow\u2019s version really takes on a life of its own. Away from her family, Mary has the chance to free herself from their (and the reader\u2019s) narrow view of her. The Other Bennet Sister reads as an enjoyable kind of fanfic and if it feels a little pedestrian by comparison, the fact that the appeal of these characters endures in hands less deft than their original creator\u2019s is testament to how vividly they were first drawn and the place they have established in readers\u2019 affections. \u2022 Miss Austen by Gill Hornby is published by Century (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<h2>1) Saka\u2019s swap could fill a gap for Arsenal</h2> <p>Arsenal\u2019s injury problems at left\u2011back have led them to explore signing Layvin Kurzawa from Paris Saint-Germain. But what if the solution lies closer to home? Bukayo Saka is 18 and earlier this season was being rightly lauded for his rich promise as a flying winger. But he has filled in at full\u2011back four times in the past month, most recently against Sheffield United on Saturday, and looks the part. Saka is tenacious, diligent, has speed and energy to burn and a knack of picking out teammates with his deliveries. \u201cI think he could,\u201d Mikel Arteta said when asked if Saka could carve out a long-term future in the role. \u201cHe is someone that\u2019s never played there before but he\u2019s really trying to do it as well as possible. You can see that he\u2019s got many strengths to play in that position.\u201d Club and manager might have hit upon something far more exciting than they expected. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/arsenal-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal 1-1 Sheffield United</a></em></p> <h2>2) Grealish\u2019s positive attitude gives Villa confidence</h2> <p>England fans will have only Gareth Southgate to blame if Jack Grealish is not in their next squad. The player could hardly do more to prove he deserves a chance. His terrific goal at Brighton was the latest evidence of his exceptional ability. He has the skills and attitude to fit into a variety of positions and has shown at Aston Villa that he thrives on responsibility. \u201cHe\u2019s turned into an all-round player,\u201d said Dean Smith, Villa\u2019s manager. \u201cHe keeps pushing us as coaches to make him better. When you\u2019ve got that attitude, that application, then he\u2019s going to be a top player. People will take notice of him, that\u2019s for sure, and he\u2019s doing what he can to get himself noticed for the England squad.\u201d Grealish has scored seven league goals this season \u2013 his best haul. With him and Villa\u2019s new striker, Mbwana Samatta, the club can be confident of climbing out of relegation trouble. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/brighton-hove-albion-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 1-1 Aston Villa</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Rodgers detects Leicester\u2019s lack of confidence</h2> <p>Brendan Rodgers was not being peevish when he said Leicester deserved to win this game. They created most of the chances and, but for an exceptional goalkeeping performance by Nick Pope, would probably have gone home with something. \u201cSomehow we lost,\u201d the Leicester manager said. Crucial saves from Pope were the most obvious reason, particularly when denying Jamie Vardy from the penalty spot in the second half, though Rodgers also thought he could detect a drop in desire and motivation. Leicester\u2019s passing ability was superior but they were unable to make it count. While they remain a good bet for a top\u2011four finish it is possible they are finding it hard to keep up their earlier pace. \u201cThe character is strong but maybe the confidence isn\u2019t as strong as it has been,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get it back.\u201d <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/19/burnley-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 2-1 Leicester</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e45f7009465c261f12cee7ece8b62b205364f2cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e45f7009465c261f12cee7ece8b62b205364f2cf/276_12_2201_1321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Pope\u2019s fine display included saving Jamie Vardy\u2019s penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Pope\u2019s fine display included saving Jamie Vardy\u2019s penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Linley/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) De Gea\u2019s meekness becoming a regular failing</h2> <p>Roberto Firmino\u2019s disallowed goal could be argued over for eternity but there is no debating that it involved a desperately timid piece of goalkeeping from David de Gea. The Spaniard was impressive thereafter but he plays in an unforgiving position and what will stick in the mind is his meekness in coming to meet a high ball \u2013 strikingly similar to his costly mistake against Everton last month. Watford, Chelsea, Arsenal, Barcelona and Portugal have also benefited from De Gea blunders in recent memory and they are only the most glaring. The 29-year-old has been a rare jewel in the rubble of the post-Ferguson years but it is no exaggeration to say that he is in danger of becoming a liability. His club can, however, lay claim to a keeper with the joint\u2011most clean sheets in the division: Dean Henderson. Time for De Gea to worry? <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/19/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 2-0 Manchester United</a></em></p> <h2>5) Hodgson decides not to throw at Stones</h2> <p>Roy Hodgson felt compelled to defend John Stones after the defender had another shaky outing that culminated in him allowing Wilfried Zaha to force Fernandinho\u2019s late own-goal equaliser. Hodgson, who gave Stones his international debut when England manager, said: \u201cJohn is a good player \u2013 young, too. He still has his best years ahead of him, he\u2019s still learning the game, learning it in a fantastic environment with very good players around him. I still think that John Stones is every bit that we expected him to be. But he\u2019s playing in a very important goldfish bowl at the moment. Every mistake or every good thing is magnified 10 times over. He\u2019s very much a player that City and England will have good use from in the future. It\u2019s for Pep to decide.\u201d Guardiola voiced rare public criticism of the \u201cmistake\u201d that prompted Fernandinho\u2019s blunder. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City 2-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> <h2>6) Reinforcement can add to Newcastle\u2019s happiness</h2> <p>Matt Ritchie celebrated Isaac Hayden\u2019s last-gasp winner by kicking the corner flag into the crowd \u2013 where it hit a Newcastle fan in the groin, leaving him in agony. Frank Lampard and Chelsea probably felt much the same after monopolising possession and having 19 shots on target. What the bald statistics do not reveal is the visitors often passed sideways and created mainly half\u2011chances. While Reece James shone for Chelsea at right\u2011back the other contenders for man of the match were all Newcastle players.

If Norwich go down, they will go down playing sparkling football. But if Duda plays like that every week, they might just get the best of both worlds. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/norwich-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich 1-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p> <h2>8) Nuno accepts Wolves have to invest in transfer window</h2> <p>After a stirring comeback victory it would have been easy for Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo to be cavalier but the Wolves head coach acknowledged such a result does not alter the need for reinforcements.

The 25\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s fitness history is chequered but even when fit he has struggled to play under some of Watford\u2019s frequently changing managers. Nigel Pearson trusts him, however. \u201cHe\u2019s been fabulous again,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a gifted player but he\u2019s had to find a way of regaining his form. It\u2019s been a difficult year or so for him [but] he\u2019s the type of player that is very important for us.\u201d From the base of Watford\u2019s midfield Chalobah was effective in breaking up Spurs\u2019 attacks but his distribution high up the field was also crucial. He has a broad range of attributes for an English defensive midfielder and another manager who trusts him is Gareth Southgate. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/watford-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Watford 0-0 Tottenham</a></em></p> <h2>10) Bench shows West Ham\u2019s lack of options</h2> <p>The West Ham fans who protested against David Sullivan and David Gold before this draw with Everton will be paying close attention to whether the board reacts to a growing injury list by backing David Moyes in the transfer market. Missing Felipe Anderson, Michail Antonio and Andriy Yarmolenko, West Ham lacked ideas in the second half and did not have many attacking options on a bench containing three centre\u2011backs, an untried youngster, a left-back and Albian Ajeti, a forward whose only contribution was jutting his head into Mason Holgate\u2019s jaw after replacing Manuel Lanzini. Moyes admitted concern about the lack of support for the \u00a345m striker S\u00e9bastien Haller.

      "bodyText": "1) Saka\u2019s swap could fill a gap for Arsenal Arsenal\u2019s injury problems at left\u2011back have led them to explore signing Layvin Kurzawa from Paris Saint-Germain. But what if the solution lies closer to home? Bukayo Saka is 18 and earlier this season was being rightly lauded for his rich promise as a flying winger. But he has filled in at full\u2011back four times in the past month, most recently against Sheffield United on Saturday, and looks the part. Saka is tenacious, diligent, has speed and energy to burn and a knack of picking out teammates with his deliveries. \u201cI think he could,\u201d Mikel Arteta said when asked if Saka could carve out a long-term future in the role. \u201cHe is someone that\u2019s never played there before but he\u2019s really trying to do it as well as possible. You can see that he\u2019s got many strengths to play in that position.\u201d Club and manager might have hit upon something far more exciting than they expected. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-1 Sheffield United 2) Grealish\u2019s positive attitude gives Villa confidence England fans will have only Gareth Southgate to blame if Jack Grealish is not in their next squad. The player could hardly do more to prove he deserves a chance. His terrific goal at Brighton was the latest evidence of his exceptional ability. He has the skills and attitude to fit into a variety of positions and has shown at Aston Villa that he thrives on responsibility. \u201cHe\u2019s turned into an all-round player,\u201d said Dean Smith, Villa\u2019s manager. \u201cHe keeps pushing us as coaches to make him better. When you\u2019ve got that attitude, that application, then he\u2019s going to be a top player. People will take notice of him, that\u2019s for sure, and he\u2019s doing what he can to get himself noticed for the England squad.\u201d Grealish has scored seven league goals this season \u2013 his best haul. With him and Villa\u2019s new striker, Mbwana Samatta, the club can be confident of climbing out of relegation trouble. Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Brighton 1-1 Aston Villa 3) Rodgers detects Leicester\u2019s lack of confidence Brendan Rodgers was not being peevish when he said Leicester deserved to win this game. They created most of the chances and, but for an exceptional goalkeeping performance by Nick Pope, would probably have gone home with something. \u201cSomehow we lost,\u201d the Leicester manager said. Crucial saves from Pope were the most obvious reason, particularly when denying Jamie Vardy from the penalty spot in the second half, though Rodgers also thought he could detect a drop in desire and motivation. Leicester\u2019s passing ability was superior but they were unable to make it count. While they remain a good bet for a top\u2011four finish it is possible they are finding it hard to keep up their earlier pace. \u201cThe character is strong but maybe the confidence isn\u2019t as strong as it has been,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get it back.\u201d Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Burnley 2-1 Leicester 4) De Gea\u2019s meekness becoming a regular failing Roberto Firmino\u2019s disallowed goal could be argued over for eternity but there is no debating that it involved a desperately timid piece of goalkeeping from David de Gea. The Spaniard was impressive thereafter but he plays in an unforgiving position and what will stick in the mind is his meekness in coming to meet a high ball \u2013 strikingly similar to his costly mistake against Everton last month. Watford, Chelsea, Arsenal, Barcelona and Portugal have also benefited from De Gea blunders in recent memory and they are only the most glaring. The 29-year-old has been a rare jewel in the rubble of the post-Ferguson years but it is no exaggeration to say that he is in danger of becoming a liability. His club can, however, lay claim to a keeper with the joint\u2011most clean sheets in the division: Dean Henderson. Time for De Gea to worry? Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Manchester United 5) Hodgson decides not to throw at Stones Roy Hodgson felt compelled to defend John Stones after the defender had another shaky outing that culminated in him allowing Wilfried Zaha to force Fernandinho\u2019s late own-goal equaliser. Hodgson, who gave Stones his international debut when England manager, said: \u201cJohn is a good player \u2013 young, too. He still has his best years ahead of him, he\u2019s still learning the game, learning it in a fantastic environment with very good players around him. I still think that John Stones is every bit that we expected him to be. But he\u2019s playing in a very important goldfish bowl at the moment. Every mistake or every good thing is magnified 10 times over. He\u2019s very much a player that City and England will have good use from in the future. It\u2019s for Pep to decide.\u201d Guardiola voiced rare public criticism of the \u201cmistake\u201d that prompted Fernandinho\u2019s blunder. Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 2-2 Crystal Palace 6) Reinforcement can add to Newcastle\u2019s happiness Matt Ritchie celebrated Isaac Hayden\u2019s last-gasp winner by kicking the corner flag into the crowd \u2013 where it hit a Newcastle fan in the groin, leaving him in agony. Frank Lampard and Chelsea probably felt much the same after monopolising possession and having 19 shots on target. What the bald statistics do not reveal is the visitors often passed sideways and created mainly half\u2011chances. While Reece James shone for Chelsea at right\u2011back the other contenders for man of the match were all Newcastle players. They should shortly be joined by the Austria winger Valentino Lazaro after a provisional loan agreement was reached with Internazionale. Lazaro can expect some expert \u201cout of possession\u201d training\u2011ground tutelage from Steve Bruce and his assistant Steve Agnew. The defensive masterclass here was not accidental.

      "body": "<p>The diversity of Chinese cuisines is extraordinary but one food ritual unites Han Chinese communities all over the country and the world: the lunar New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. (This year\u2019s Chinese new year is on 25 January.) It\u2019s the time when families traditionally gather for a lavish feast, prefaced by ritual offerings to gods and ancestors, and followed at midnight by a storm of firecrackers.</p> <p>There are few rules for this \u201cfamily reunion\u201d (<em>tuannian</em>) meal except that there should be extraordinary amounts of food, particularly fish, meat and poultry (<em>dayu darou</em>: \u201cgreat fish and great meat\u201d). In the countryside, many households still fatten a pig as the holiday approaches, eating the prime cuts over the festivities, then making bacon, sausages or confit pork to eke out over the months ahead. The other essential is a fish, served whole and never quite finished, because the phrase \u201ca fish every year\u201d (<em>niannian youyu</em>) sounds the same in Chinese as \u201cevery year a surplus\u201d. </p> <p>When I\u2019m cooking a Chinese new year feast at home in London, I like to borrow freely from different regional traditions, mixing some of the delicate dishes from the Jiangnan region and the Cantonese south with a bit of Sichuan and Hunan spice. What\u2019s most important from the point of view of the cook is to avoid a menu that leans heavily on dishes that have to be prepared at the last minute. Instead, try to include a few cold dishes and slow-cooked stews that can be made ahead of time: that way, you can have fun with a bit of wok whizz-bangery and still sit down with your guests to eat.</p> <p>In the following selection, a sumptuous potful of dongpo pork, one of the classic dishes of Hangzhou, tastes even better when made a day in advance. The chicken for the Sichuanese bang bang chicken can also be poached beforehand, the spinach blanched, the sauces made. After that, a hot and spicy Sichuanese dry-braised fish will drive out winter chills and augur well for the year ahead. I\u2019ve also included a dish made with an ingredient that was virtually unknown in China a few years ago but is now all the rage: okra. This sizzly stir-fry is laced, Hunan-style, with black beans and chilli \u2013 delicious. With a potful of rice, this menu will generously feed four. If you\u2019re feeding more than four, the dongpo pork, bang bang chicken and spinach in ginger sauce can easily be doubled up. Alternatively, add other dishes or buy in Cantonese roast duck from a restaurant.</p> <p><em>All recipes serve 4 when eaten together</em></p> <h2>Braised fish with scorched chillies </h2> <p>This beautiful, spicy fish lolls in a pool of red oil under a glamorous scattering of chopped scorched chillies. The cooking method is a version of the classic Sichuanese \u201cdry-braising\u201d (<em>ganshao</em>), in which the sauce is not thickened but simply reduced to a scant, aromatic cloak of seasonings. In Sichuan, they tend to use carp; in London I\u2019ve used both bream and sea bass to delicious effect. Please make sure you use chillies that are not excessively hot: although the dish should pack a punch, you want fragrance as well as heat.</p> <p><em><strong>For the marinade</strong></em><br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>Shaoxing wine</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>ginger</strong> 25g<br><strong>spring onions </strong>2, white parts only</p> <p><strong>sea bream or bass</strong> 1 fresh, scaled and gutted (700g)<br><strong>Sichuanese dried chillies</strong> 15g<br><strong>cooking oil</strong> around 140ml<br><strong>Sichuan chilli bean paste </strong>1 tbsp (<em>doubanjiang</em>)<br><strong>ginger</strong> 1 tbsp, finely chopped<br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 tsp, finely chopped<br><strong>chicken stock</strong> 250ml<br><strong>Shaoxing wine</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>light soy sauce </strong>2 tsp<br><strong>dark soy sauce</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>white sugar</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>Chinkiang vinegar</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>spring onion greens </strong>3 tbsp, finely sliced<br><strong>ground roasted Sichuan pepper </strong>\u00bc-\u00bd tsp</p> <p>Lay your fish on a board and make 5-6 diagonal cuts into the thickest part on each side, to allow the flavours to penetrate. Rub the fish, inside and out, with the marinade salt and wine. Smack the ginger and spring onion whites lightly with the flat of a cleaver blade or a rolling pin to loosen, then pop them into the belly of the fish. Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients.</p> <p>Using a pair of scissors, trim the stem ends of the chillies and snip them into sections; shake out and discard the seeds as far as possible. Heat 4 tbsp of the oil in a seasoned wok over a medium flame. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the chillies and fry briefly until crisp and dark red, then remove immediately with a slotted spoon. (If you burn the chillies, repeat with another batch!) When the chillies have cooled, chop finely. Retain the spicy cooking oil too.</p> <p>Discard the ginger and spring onion from the marinade and tip away any juices; pat the fish dry. Return the wok to a high flame with 5 tbsp of fresh oil. Sprinkle a little salt around the base of the wok: this will help to prevent sticking. Add the fish and fry for a minute or two on each side until a little golden, tilting the wok for even browning. (Try not to disturb the fish until it is fairly well fried; this will help keep the skin intact.) When the fish is done, remove carefully from the wok. Pour off the oil and rinse and dry the wok if necessary.</p> <p>Return the wok to a medium flame with the spicy chilli oil you have reserved. Add the chilli bean paste and stir-fry gently until the oil is red and wonderfully aromatic. Tip in the ginger and garlic and fry until they smell gorgeous. Then add the stock, Shaoxing wine, soy sauces, sugar and vinegar and turn the heat to high. Use a slotted spoon to strain out and discard the solids from the wok. Now slide the fish into the sauce. Let the liquid bubble away, spooning frequently over the fish until it has evaporated to leave a lazy, glossy sauce. Turn the fish over after about 2 minutes; total cooking time should be about 4 minutes (poke a chopstick into the thickest part of the fish to make sure it\u2019s cooked through: the flesh should flake easily from the backbone).</p> <p>Gently transfer the fish to a serving dish. Pour over the remaining sauce and scatter with the spring onions. Finally, scatter with the Sichuan pepper, if using, and all or some of the chopped fried chillies, to taste.</p> <p><em>The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/search\" title=\"\">Good Fish Guide</a></em></p> <h2>Spinach in ginger sauce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0119dbb044bd997f53d2afa23dd70126a7314057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0119dbb044bd997f53d2afa23dd70126a7314057/0_1178_4700_4699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spinach in ginger sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spinach in ginger sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Cazals/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a most refreshing starter, with juicy leaves in a delicate dressing of ginger, mellow vinegar and sesame oil.

In southern Sichuan, where the dish originates, the base seasoning of sesame paste is jazzed up with sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, chilli and sesame oils and Sichuan pepper to make a lip-tingling sauce. The dish is said to have originated in Hanyang Ba, a town near Leshan that was once known for its chickens: free-range birds that fed on insects, stray grains and leftovers from the local peanut crop. In the early 20th century, Hanyang street vendors sold chunks of cooked chicken meat draped in spicy sauce as a snack.</p> <p>The dish became known as bang bang chicken, because of the sound their wooden cudgels made when hammered down on the backs of cleaver blades to help them through the meat. It began to feature on Chengdu menus from about the 1920s, though here the cudgels were used to whack the meat directly, loosening the fibres so it could be torn into slivers by hand.</p> <p>I have found this recipe one of the most difficult to commit to paper, because I have enjoyed so many different versions of it. If you like, you can serve the chicken on a bed of slivered lettuce or sliced cucumber.</p> <p><strong>poached chicken meat</strong> 400g, cold, off the bone (see below)<br><strong>spring onions</strong> 4, white parts only, cut into fine slivers (optional)<br><strong>roasted </strong><strong>peanuts</strong> 30g <br><strong>sesame seeds</strong> 2 tsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the sauce<br></strong></em><strong>sesame paste</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>salt</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1\u00bd tsp<br><strong>light soy sauce</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>Chinkiang vinegar</strong> 1\u00bd tsp<br><strong>ground roasted Sichuan pepper</strong> \u00bc-\u00bd tsp, or 1-2 tsp Sichuan pepper oil<br><strong>chilli oil</strong> 4 tbsp, plus 1-2 tbsp sediment<br><strong>sesame oil</strong> 2 tsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the poached chicken<br></strong></em><strong>chicken</strong> 1 x 1.6kg whole, to give 800g boneless meat<br><strong>ginger</strong> 20g<br><strong>spring onions</strong> 2, white parts only</p> <p>To make the poached chicken, let the chicken come to room temperature before you start. Lightly smack the ginger and spring onion whites with the flat of a cleaver blade or rolling pin to loosen them.</p> <p>Pour enough water to immerse your chicken into a lidded pan that will hold the bird snugly, and bring to the boil over a high flame. Lower the chicken into the water, return it quickly to the boil and then skim. Add the ginger and spring onion whites, half-cover the pan and turn the heat down so the liquid barely murmurs and poach for about 30 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken; if any of the bird sits above the water level, turn it halfway through.</p> <p>Pierce the thigh joint deeply with a skewer to see if it is done: the juices should run clear, not pink and bloody. When the chicken is just cooked, remove it from the pan and set aside to cool before chilling until needed (to arrest the cooking quickly and keep the skin taut, immediately immerse the bird in a large pan or bowl of ice water). The flesh should be moist and silky.</p> <p>For the bang bang chicken, if you want to be traditional, pummel the meat with a rolling pin to loosen the fibres, and then tear into bite-sized slivers; otherwise, simply tear or cut into bite-sized slivers or strips.</p> <p>Toss with the spring onion slivers, if using. Roughly chop the peanuts: the easiest way to do this is to gather them on a chopping board, lay the flat of a cleaver blade over them and press firmly to break them up a bit, then chop them into smaller pieces. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry wok or frying pan over a very gentle heat, until fragrant and tinged with gold.</p> <p>Next make the sauce. Dilute the sesame paste with a little oil from the jar and about 2 tbsp of cold water: you should end up with a paste the consistency of single cream \u2013 it needs to be runny\u2248enough to clothe the chicken. Place the salt, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar in a small bowl and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix well.</p> <p>Shortly before serving, pile the chicken on to a serving dish and pour the sauce over it. Garnish with the peanuts and toasted sesame seeds.<br><em>From <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-food-of-sichuan-9781408867556.html\" title=\"\">The Food of Sichuan</a> </em><em> (Bloomsbury</em><em>)</em></p> <h2>Stir-fried okra with black bean and chilli</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9898751395137dd16d8df1dcdbbe066cd8cbdc8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9898751395137dd16d8df1dcdbbe066cd8cbdc8f/0_980_4842_4843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stir fried okra with black bean and chilli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stir fried okra with black bean and chilli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Cazals/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until a few years ago, okra was all but unknown in China, but a sudden fashion for this originally African vegetable has swept the country and it now appears on the menu of almost every trendy restaurant. Local chefs prepare it in many ways, but this is the most delicious I\u2019ve encountered: a simple, sizzly, Hunan-style stir-fry of the sliced pods with fermented black beans, garlic and fresh red chilli.</p> <p>The following recipe is my attempt to recreate one I tasted at the Shengyongxing restaurant in Beijing. You can adjust the chilli heat according to taste, but it\u2019s best, in my opinion, to choose fresh red chillies that are colourful but not too hot (and you can substitute diced sweet red pepper if you prefer something that isn\u2019t spicy at all).</p> <p><strong>okra</strong> 300g<br><strong>fresh red chillies</strong> 2-3<br><strong>garlic</strong> 3 cloves<br><strong>ginger</strong> about 15g, peeled and sliced<br><strong>cooking oil </strong>4 tbsp<br><strong>fermented black beans</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>sesame oil</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>Top and tail the okra pods, and then slice at a steep diagonal angle into 1cm pieces. Do the same with the chillies, but with thinner slices. Peel and slice the garlic.</p> <p>Heat 2 tbsp of the cooking oil in a wok, add the okra and stir-fry over a high heat for 2-3 minutes, until the slices are piping hot, tender and slightly scorched around the edges. Remove from the wok and set aside.</p> <p>Tip the remaining cooking oil into the wok, add the black beans, garlic and ginger and stir-fry briefly over a high flame until they all smell delicious. Add the okra and mix everything together. Season with salt to taste.</p> <p>Off the heat, stir in the sesame oil and then serve.</p> <h2>Dongpo pork</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f364b342c370fcaecc3958429eebac5e8f16086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f364b342c370fcaecc3958429eebac5e8f16086/0_2430_5051_3031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dongpo pork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dongpo pork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Cazals/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sumptuous dish, named after the Song-dynasty poet Su Dongpo, is a Hangzhou speciality. Large square chunks of belly pork are slow-cooked with soy sauce, sugar and Shaoxing wine until they are so exquisitely tender that they melt away at a chopstick\u2019s touch.</p> <p>While serving as governor of Hangzhou in the late 11th century, Su Dongpo organised the dredging of the city\u2019s beautiful West Lake, which had become clogged. According to local lore, the grateful townspeople sent him gifts of his favourite meat for Chinese new year; touched by their kindness, the poet-governor instructed a servant to red-braise the pork and return it with a gift of wine. The servant mistakenly thought he\u2019d been told to cook the pork with the wine, and the resulting dish was so magnificent it has never been forgotten.</p> <p>The supposed rule with Dongpo pork is to let wine take the place of water in the stew, but in practice most chefs add a little water. Although it\u2019s traditionally cooked on the stove-top, a low oven works very well too. The final dish is so rich and intense that one square of pork, served with plain rice, is usually enough for each person. Make it a day in advance and chill it if you want to remove the layer of solid fat that will collect on the surface. Do not make this dish with everyday Shaoxing cooking wine; invest in a bottle of five- or 10-year aged drinking wine, found in good Chinese supermarkets.</p> <p>Happily, although this is one of the finest dishes in the whole pantheon of Chinese cooking, it\u2019s very easy to make.</p> <p><strong>belly pork</strong> 1 x 12cm-wide strip, unscored, skin on, boneless (about 1kg, or 1.3kg bone-in)<br><strong>spring onions</strong> 2<br><strong>fresh ginger</strong> 30g, skin on<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 4 tbsp<br><strong>light soy sauce</strong> 5\u00bd tbsp<br><strong>dark soy sauce</strong> \u00bd tbsp<br><strong>good Shaoxing wine</strong> 250ml<br><strong>plain white rice</strong> to serve</p> <p>If using an oven, preheat it to 110C/gas mark \u00bc. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the pork and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain it well and rinse under the cold tap. Place the pork, skin-side up, on a chopping board and cut it as accurately as possible into 5cm squares. Keep any trimmings. If you have one, lay a bamboo mat in the bottom of a heavy-based pan to prevent sticking. Crush the spring onions and ginger slightly with the flat side of a Chinese cleaver or a rolling pin and put them in the pan. Add the pork trimmings and arrange the pork chunks, skin-side down, on top. Add the sugar, soy sauces and Shaoxing wine. If you are using a traditional Chinese clay pot, warm it gently over a low flame to prevent cracking, then bring it to the boil over a high flame; if you are using a more robust pan, bring it to the boil directly.</p> <p>Boil rapidly for 1-2 minutes to give the skin a rich, soy-dark colour. Cover and cook gently for 2\u00bd hours over a very low flame or in the oven. Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn\u2019t boil dry; add a little hot water if necessary. Remove and discard the ginger and spring onions. For best results, leave the pork to cool in the pan and chill overnight.</p> <p>Scrape off and remove the layer of white fat on the surface (this can be used for other purposes, such as frying potatoes or stir-frying mushrooms).</p> <p>Reheat the pork in the pan, turning the pieces skin-side up as soon as the juices have loosened. You want to end up with a dark, slightly syrupy sauce: if there is too much liquid, strain it off, fast-boil to reduce it, then return it to the pan. Serve the meat and its juices with plain white rice.<br><em>From <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/land-of-fish-and-rice-9781408802519.html\" title=\"\">Land of Fish and Rice</a> (Bloomsbury</em><em>)</em></p>",

Then add the stock, Shaoxing wine, soy sauces, sugar and vinegar and turn the heat to high. Use a slotted spoon to strain out and discard the solids from the wok. Now slide the fish into the sauce. Let the liquid bubble away, spooning frequently over the fish until it has evaporated to leave a lazy, glossy sauce. Turn the fish over after about 2 minutes; total cooking time should be about 4 minutes (poke a chopstick into the thickest part of the fish to make sure it\u2019s cooked through: the flesh should flake easily from the backbone). Gently transfer the fish to a serving dish. Pour over the remaining sauce and scatter with the spring onions. Finally, scatter with the Sichuan pepper, if using, and all or some of the chopped fried chillies, to taste. The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide Spinach in ginger sauce This is a most refreshing starter, with juicy leaves in a delicate dressing of ginger, mellow vinegar and sesame oil. The combination of seasonings is known as \u201cgingerjuice flavour\u201d, and comes from the canon of classic Sichuanese flavour combinations. Do use bunched spinach for its wonderfully juicy texture (baby spinach leaves tend to melt away when you blanch them). bunched spinach 300g cooking oil 1 tbsp ginger 1 tbsp, very finely chopped Chinkiang vinegar 2 tsp light soy sauce 1 tsp stock or water 1\u00bd tbsp salt sesame oil \u00bd tsp Bring a large panful of water to a boil (1-1.5 litres will do). Wash and trim the spinach, but keep the leaves whole. When the water has boiled, add the oil, then the spinach and blanch for about 30 seconds. Drain the spinach and refresh in cold water, then shake dry in a colander. Gently squeeze it to remove as much water as possible. Combine the ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and stock or water in a small bowl, with salt to taste. Add the sesame oil. Lay the spinach leaves out on a chopping board and cut them across into about four sections. Pile these sections neatly on a serving plate. Give the sauce a stir and pour it over the spinach. From The Food of Sichuan (Bloomsbury) Bang bang chicken Bang bang chicken appears on countless Chinese restaurant menus in the west, but usually only as a shadow of its authentic self. In southern Sichuan, where the dish originates, the base seasoning of sesame paste is jazzed up with sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, chilli and sesame oils and Sichuan pepper to make a lip-tingling sauce. The dish is said to have originated in Hanyang Ba, a town near Leshan that was once known for its chickens: free-range birds that fed on insects, stray grains and leftovers from the local peanut crop. In the early 20th century, Hanyang street vendors sold chunks of cooked chicken meat draped in spicy sauce as a snack. The dish became known as bang bang chicken, because of the sound their wooden cudgels made when hammered down on the backs of cleaver blades to help them through the meat. It began to feature on Chengdu menus from about the 1920s, though here the cudgels were used to whack the meat directly, loosening the fibres so it could be torn into slivers by hand. I have found this recipe one of the most difficult to commit to paper, because I have enjoyed so many different versions of it. If you like, you can serve the chicken on a bed of slivered lettuce or sliced cucumber. poached chicken meat 400g, cold, off the bone (see below) spring onions 4, white parts only, cut into fine slivers (optional) roasted peanuts 30g sesame seeds 2 tsp For the sauce sesame paste 2 tbsp salt \u00bd tsp caster sugar 1\u00bd tsp light soy sauce 2 tbsp Chinkiang vinegar 1\u00bd tsp ground roasted Sichuan pepper \u00bc-\u00bd tsp, or 1-2 tsp Sichuan pepper oil chilli oil 4 tbsp, plus 1-2 tbsp sediment sesame oil 2 tsp For the poached chicken chicken 1 x 1.6kg whole, to give 800g boneless meat ginger 20g spring onions 2, white parts only To make the poached chicken, let the chicken come to room temperature before you start. Lightly smack the ginger and spring onion whites with the flat of a cleaver blade or rolling pin to loosen them. Pour enough water to immerse your chicken into a lidded pan that will hold the bird snugly, and bring to the boil over a high flame. Lower the chicken into the water, return it quickly to the boil and then skim. Add the ginger and spring onion whites, half-cover the pan and turn the heat down so the liquid barely murmurs and poach for about 30 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken; if any of the bird sits above the water level, turn it halfway through. Pierce the thigh joint deeply with a skewer to see if it is done: the juices should run clear, not pink and bloody. When the chicken is just cooked, remove it from the pan and set aside to cool before chilling until needed (to arrest the cooking quickly and keep the skin taut, immediately immerse the bird in a large pan or bowl of ice water). The flesh should be moist and silky. For the bang bang chicken, if you want to be traditional, pummel the meat with a rolling pin to loosen the fibres, and then tear into bite-sized slivers; otherwise, simply tear or cut into bite-sized slivers or strips. Toss with the spring onion slivers, if using. Roughly chop the peanuts: the easiest way to do this is to gather them on a chopping board, lay the flat of a cleaver blade over them and press firmly to break them up a bit, then chop them into smaller pieces. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry wok or frying pan over a very gentle heat, until fragrant and tinged with gold. Next make the sauce. Dilute the sesame paste with a little oil from the jar and about 2 tbsp of cold water: you should end up with a paste the consistency of single cream \u2013 it needs to be runny\u2248enough to clothe the chicken. Place the salt, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar in a small bowl and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix well. Shortly before serving, pile the chicken on to a serving dish and pour the sauce over it. Garnish with the peanuts and toasted sesame seeds. From The Food of Sichuan (Bloomsbury) Stir-fried okra with black bean and chilli Until a few years ago, okra was all but unknown in China, but a sudden fashion for this originally African vegetable has swept the country and it now appears on the menu of almost every trendy restaurant. Local chefs prepare it in many ways, but this is the most delicious I\u2019ve encountered: a simple, sizzly, Hunan-style stir-fry of the sliced pods with fermented black beans, garlic and fresh red chilli. The following recipe is my attempt to recreate one I tasted at the Shengyongxing restaurant in Beijing. You can adjust the chilli heat according to taste, but it\u2019s best, in my opinion, to choose fresh red chillies that are colourful but not too hot (and you can substitute diced sweet red pepper if you prefer something that isn\u2019t spicy at all). okra 300g fresh red chillies 2-3 garlic 3 cloves ginger about 15g, peeled and sliced cooking oil 4 tbsp fermented black beans 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tsp Top and tail the okra pods, and then slice at a steep diagonal angle into 1cm pieces. Do the same with the chillies, but with thinner slices. Peel and slice the garlic. Heat 2 tbsp of the cooking oil in a wok, add the okra and stir-fry over a high heat for 2-3 minutes, until the slices are piping hot, tender and slightly scorched around the edges. Remove from the wok and set aside. Tip the remaining cooking oil into the wok, add the black beans, garlic and ginger and stir-fry briefly over a high flame until they all smell delicious. Add the okra and mix everything together. Season with salt to taste. Off the heat, stir in the sesame oil and then serve. Dongpo pork This sumptuous dish, named after the Song-dynasty poet Su Dongpo, is a Hangzhou speciality. Large square chunks of belly pork are slow-cooked with soy sauce, sugar and Shaoxing wine until they are so exquisitely tender that they melt away at a chopstick\u2019s touch. While serving as governor of Hangzhou in the late 11th century, Su Dongpo organised the dredging of the city\u2019s beautiful West Lake, which had become clogged. According to local lore, the grateful townspeople sent him gifts of his favourite meat for Chinese new year; touched by their kindness, the poet-governor instructed a servant to red-braise the pork and return it with a gift of wine. The servant mistakenly thought he\u2019d been told to cook the pork with the wine, and the resulting dish was so magnificent it has never been forgotten. The supposed rule with Dongpo pork is to let wine take the place of water in the stew, but in practice most chefs add a little water. Although it\u2019s traditionally cooked on the stove-top, a low oven works very well too. The final dish is so rich and intense that one square of pork, served with plain rice, is usually enough for each person. Make it a day in advance and chill it if you want to remove the layer of solid fat that will collect on the surface. Do not make this dish with everyday Shaoxing cooking wine; invest in a bottle of five- or 10-year aged drinking wine, found in good Chinese supermarkets. Happily, although this is one of the finest dishes in the whole pantheon of Chinese cooking, it\u2019s very easy to make. belly pork 1 x 12cm-wide strip, unscored, skin on, boneless (about 1kg, or 1.3kg bone-in) spring onions 2 fresh ginger 30g, skin on caster sugar 4 tbsp light soy sauce 5\u00bd tbsp dark soy sauce \u00bd tbsp good Shaoxing wine 250ml plain white rice to serve If using an oven, preheat it to 110C/gas mark \u00bc. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the pork and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain it well and rinse under the cold tap. Place the pork, skin-side up, on a chopping board and cut it as accurately as possible into 5cm squares. Keep any trimmings. If you have one, lay a bamboo mat in the bottom of a heavy-based pan to prevent sticking. Crush the spring onions and ginger slightly with the flat side of a Chinese cleaver or a rolling pin and put them in the pan. Add the pork trimmings and arrange the pork chunks, skin-side down, on top. Add the sugar, soy sauces and Shaoxing wine. If you are using a traditional Chinese clay pot, warm it gently over a low flame to prevent cracking, then bring it to the boil over a high flame; if you are using a more robust pan, bring it to the boil directly. Boil rapidly for 1-2 minutes to give the skin a rich, soy-dark colour. Cover and cook gently for 2\u00bd hours over a very low flame or in the oven. Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn\u2019t boil dry; add a little hot water if necessary. Remove and discard the ginger and spring onions. For best results, leave the pork to cool in the pan and chill overnight. Scrape off and remove the layer of white fat on the surface (this can be used for other purposes, such as frying potatoes or stir-frying mushrooms). Reheat the pork in the pan, turning the pieces skin-side up as soon as the juices have loosened. You want to end up with a dark, slightly syrupy sauce: if there is too much liquid, strain it off, fast-boil to reduce it, then return it to the pan. Serve the meat and its juices with plain white rice. From Land of Fish and Rice (Bloomsbury)",

Thousands of Americans die at work each year The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported 5,147 workplace fatalities in the US in 2017. Among these fatalities, 887 were due to fatal falls, the highest level reported in the 26-year history of the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. There are two different categories for fatal falls: falls on the same level, such as slips or trips, and falls to a lower level. Both increased in 2017, with the majority, 713 fatalities, a result of workers falling to a lower level. In 2018, the latest year data is available, fatal falls decreased to 791, though overall workplace fatalities increased from the prior year to 5,250. The US consistently outpaces other industrialized nations in workplace fatalities: The average rate of workplace fatalities in the United States has hovered at 3.5 deaths for every 100,000 workers over the past decade. In comparison, workplace fatality rates in the UK have remained under 1.0 death for every 100,000 workers over the past decade, and under 1.5 deaths for every 100,000 workers on average for the 15 earliest member states of the EU. Transportation incidents are responsible for the highest number of deaths at work, and for more than a third of all work fatalities. The majority of fatal workplace falls regularly occur in construction and disproportionately impact Hispanic workers, though fatal fall increases in 2017 are attributed to a wide range of industries. Tower climbers Among the industries where workers are falling to their death, tower climbers have experienced fatality rates up to 10 times higher than construction workers. In one of the most dangerous job occupations in the US, tower climbers are among the workers at the highest risk for fatal falls in the workplace. Several workers who have to climb wireless and other communication towers fall to their death on the job every year. Jonce Hubble, 41, was one of these workers. While descending from a radio tower in Anniston, Alabama, in July 2010 a bucket truck operator working for a third-party contractor backed into the tower Hubble and a co-worker were on, causing them to fall 40 to 50 feet. \u201cMy husband was tied off, coming down, and someone collapsed the tower.

Hester used funds from the wrongful death settlement reached with the crane company to start the Hubble Foundation, a not-for-profit focused on providing support services to families of loved ones affected by the workplace deaths or injuries of tower climbers. \u201cIf you\u2019re falling from a tower, you have a few seconds to think about what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Hester. \u201cThat is what haunts most families \u2013 what was running through their head, what were they thinking about, how scared were they, and they wrestle with that in unimaginable ways.\u201d Hester said many companies take safety seriously, but incidents occur due to contractors cutting corners or some companies failing to take responsibility for keeping their workers safe in providing proper equipment and training to workers. Preventable In the steel industry, several workers die every year from a fatal fall, and the occupation is regularly cited as one of the most dangerous in the US. Mike Wright, director of health, safety and environment at the United Steelworkers union, said: \u201cThey\u2019re all preventable. I\u2019ve seen a lot of fatalities where you walk in and you think: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this didn\u2019t happen 10 years ago.\u2019\u201d According to Wright, fatalities most often happen in shifts where supervision is lacking in cases where routine safety procedures are ignored, such as workers rushing to fix a broken piece of equipment to return to production as soon as possible. He said many fatal falls are underreported because of how coroners rule on causes of death. In cases where a cardiac event was included as part of a workplace fall, Osha will often refuse to code these incidents as workplace fatalities even if the United Steelworkers union argues the victim would have survived the cardiac event otherwise. \u201cEvery single one of these deaths is preventable,\u201d said John Dony, director of environmental, health, safety and sustainability at the National Safety Council, a not-for-profit safety and health organization. \u201cJust like any other risk that an employer has in the workplace, taking a systemic approach to eliminating those risks are what\u2019s at play here. So thinking about policy, procedures, training and technology to \u2026 prevent these incidents.\u201d Dony said in addition to looking for ways to eliminate risks and hazards, employers should be using administrative controls, such as proper training, providing personal protective equipment and creating systems where production pressures, miscommunication or poor training don\u2019t enable something to go wrong where it could cause a worker to get injured or die in the workplace. \u201cNo one has to die at work,\u201d Dony said.",

Are you trying to tell me something about my inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to listen?</p> <p>As my editor started telling me how I might approach this piece, I began \u2013 much to the amusement of our colleagues \u2013 interrupting her. OK, maybe I do have a little problem shutting up for a few minutes to listen; a tendency to anticipate what the other person is going to say and reply before they have even had the chance to express it the way they want to. \u201cBad listeners are not necessarily bad people,\u201d Murphy says in her book, but being unable or unwilling to listen is not an attractive characteristic. It\u2019s time for a spot of re-education. Let\u2019s hope that after a life of lecturing rather than listening, it\u2019s not too late.</p> <p>Murphy, a journalist based in Texas, is a very good listener. I can tell that even on a long-distance phone link. She engages; treats my questions seriously; studiously compliments me for taking the trouble to read her book; tries to have a proper conversation. She has what is the crucial characteristic of the good listener \u2013 curiosity. Her hero is the late oral historian <a href=\"https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/\" title=\"\">Studs Terkel</a>, who found that everyone had a great story to tell if you could be bothered to talk to them properly and listen to what they had to say.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is interesting if you ask the right questions,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cIf someone is dull or uninteresting, it\u2019s on you.\u201d This makes me think of too many tedious, failed interviews I\u2019ve done, including one with a famous author during which I fell asleep. I\u2019d always argued both parties were to blame \u2013 an interview is a two-way street, after all \u2013 but it looks like I have to carry the can. I just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough to care.</p> <p>\u201cI saw a crying need to write this book,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cEveryone is so intent on expressing their own opinion, or they\u2019re so distracted by technology or by their own thoughts, that it\u2019s making us isolated, misinformed and intolerant. I wanted to raise awareness of the value and great joy of listening.\u201d She spent two years analysing academic research on listening and interviewed numerous people who are paid to listen intensely \u2013 \u201cspies, priests, psychotherapists, bartenders, hostage negotiators, hairdressers, air-traffic controllers, radio producers, focus group moderators\u201d. The result is a fascinating guide to something we assume we do automatically, yet for the most part do very badly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To be able to really listen, you have to get rid of your own ego, your own thoughts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Murphy doesn\u2019t claim to be a naturally good listener, but says she is a \u201cpractised\u201d one. \u201cAnyone can get good at it,\u201d she argues. \u201cThe more people you talk to, the better your gut instinct. You\u2019re able to pick up those little cues.\u201d She says the fact we now spend so much time communicating electronically means we are losing the ability to pick up all those face-to-face cues. Without them, she explains, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get the full context and nuance of the conversation\u201d.</p> <p>Bad listeners may not be bad people, but Murphy says the effects of bad listening are profound. \u201cAnyone who has shared something personal and received a thoughtless or uncomprehending response knows how it makes your soul want to crawl back into its hiding place,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhether someone is confessing a misdeed, proposing an idea, sharing a dream, revealing an anxiety or recalling a significant event \u2013 that person is giving up a piece of him or herself. And if you don\u2019t handle it with care, the person will start to edit future conversations with you, knowing: \u2018I can\u2019t be real with this person.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Before I talked to Murphy, I made a point of meeting <a href=\"https://www.bacp.co.uk/profile/38a8eae6-b2c8-e811-8128-3863bb351d40/therapist?location=Tunbridge%20Wells\" title=\"\">Gillian Rowe</a>, a psychotherapist based in Tunbridge Wells. I had met Rowe once before \u2013 we had a friend in common \u2013 and, as what could be called a professional listener, she agreed to discuss her approach to listening. I found our conversation strangely unnerving, and became aware of all my own tics \u2013 bursts of rapid-fire opinion, half-finished sentences, a tendency to interrupt, an inability to absorb what Rowe was saying (she practises transactional analysis, which I found really hard to grasp) while formulating my next question. All this contrasted with her measured, fluent, unhurried approach. She calmly let the conversation take its course; I felt I was constantly bending and stretching it, trying to hurry it on to some preordained end.</p> <p>\u201cTo be able to really listen, you have to get rid of your own ego, your own thoughts,\u201d says Rowe. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do, but you\u2019ve got to try to put all that aside.\u201d She says that, when she works with couples, she asks them to listen to each other and then repeat what the other has just said. \u201cThat might sound like quite an easy exercise to do,\u201d she says, \u201cbut invariably they will put their own twist on it and change it.\u201d Ego-free, agenda-free listening is hard.</p> <p>I relate my awkwardness to Murphy, contrasting my nerviness with Rowe\u2019s placid thoughtfulness. She immediately recognises the hallmark of the professional listener. \u201cThat was something I noticed in all the really excellent listeners I interviewed,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all had a very calm demeanour. They were very open, but they weren\u2019t in their own heads. That can be unnerving to someone who is all over the place. It\u2019s more comfortable if the other person isn\u2019t listening because then you\u2019re not responsible for what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p> <p>The generally accepted view is that women, having inherently more empathy than men, are better listeners. Murphy, although she admits that\u2019s what everyone assumes, is reluctant to accept it as a general rule. \u201cIt\u2019s a pervasive thought and both men and women think that,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you have to wonder if there isn\u2019t something to it. But I\u2019ve met women who are terrible listeners and men who are great listeners, so it really depends on the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy argues that our growing failure to listen has dire political consequences because we are no longer willing to engage with our opponents\u2019 points of view. In the US, for instance, \u201csenators used to meet in a communal dining room where they talked to each other and were exposed to each other in a way where they could really listen, whether it was about politics or something else. They humanised each other. Now people are intent on being separate and demonising one another. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t agree. They think the other person is bad, is an evil person. You can\u2019t start listening if you think the other person is fundamentally an idiot or a bad person.\u201d She says you only grow when you listen to opposing viewpoints \u2013 a powerful argument for escaping from our social-media echo chamber.</p> <p>For some, the ability to listen can be a matter of life and death, which is why every day thousands of <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\" title=\"\">Samaritans</a> volunteers are on call for desperate people with an urgent need to be heard. I go to Samaritans central office at an old mill in Surrey to meet its senior learning and development officer, Lucia Capobianco, who has also done listening shifts at her local branch for more than 10 years. As with Rowe, I am immediately struck by her calm, unhurried good sense. After an hour in her company, I feel better for having met her.</p> <p>Capobianco says the key to their work is making the person who has made the call feel in control. \u201cWe want them to take control of their decisions, which is why we will get them to talk about options by exploring open questions. The idea of Samaritans is not to make someone dependent on the service; we want to be able to talk to someone, to listen to them, find out what\u2019s going on and help them to move out of that situation.\u201d</p> <p>She says volunteers are trained to avoid being drawn into a discussion of themselves \u2013 something callers sometimes try to do. All the focus will be on the caller, with open questions that gradually get to the heart of whatever is bothering them. They don\u2019t see their role as advisers. They are a sounding board, there to listen and try to understand. \u201cWhat people want is to tell you what\u2019s going on at that moment,\u201d says Capobianco. \u201cThey just want to put it out there. Sometimes, it just needs a small thing like saying to someone: \u2018It is really crap, isn\u2019t it? The situation you\u2019re in is really awful; it\u2019s horrible.\u2019 And they feel validated because you\u2019re the first person who has said: \u2018It\u2019s OK to feel this way.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Capobianco says the organisation teaches its volunteers to be active listeners \u2013 a term coined in 1957 by the US psychologists Richard Farson and Carl Rogers. <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-active-listening-3024343\" title=\"\">Active listening is a kind of super-engaged form of listening</a> in which the listener concentrates intently on what is being said, asks questions to add detail and summarises what they have been told. New volunteers often consider themselves to be good listeners, but they soon realise the training they are given in active listening makes them far more effective. \u201cThere is a point when the active listening kicks in and their family and friends notice they are listening differently,\u201d says Capobianco.</p> <p>In our everyday lives, we will not usually have to talk people down from desperate situations or offer counselling that lays bare deep-seated psychological issues. But we can learn from the way the pros approach listening. It\u2019s about empathy, asking the right questions, being patient and giving people the time and space to tell their stories in the way they want to, offering odd words of encouragement, but not interrupting the flow and not feeling the need to fill every silence.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to give people breathing space,\u201d says Capobianco. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to ring Samaritans. They may be very upset, they may present quite aggressively to start with, they may blurt everything out, and silence just calms things down, gives them a break. When they\u2019ve got everything out, you can start to talk to them. You acknowledge their anger and say you are sorry this is happening to them, then lower your voice and say: \u2018Where would you like to start?\u2019 If someone is agitated and you start trying to come in with questions, you just make them more agitated and the conversation doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/the-agony-of-weekend-loneliness-i-wont-speak-to-another-human-until-monday\">The agony of weekend loneliness: \u2018I won't speak to another human until Monday\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Samaritans publishes a l<a href=\"Https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/support-and-information/worried-about-someone-else/difficult-conversations/\" title=\"\">ist of listening tips</a>: show you care by making eye contact and putting your phone away; have patience; use open questions and avoid putting your own spin on what you are being told; say it back to show you\u2019ve understood, but don\u2019t try to impose your own instantaneous solution; have the courage to ask someone how they feel and really care about their reply.</p> <p>Today, the third Monday of this challenging month, a day generally known as \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday\" title=\"\">Blue Monday</a>\u201d, Samaritans is launching a campaign, neatly called \u201cBrew Monday\u201d, to encourage family and friends to have a cup of tea together, talk about their lives and problems, and practise their listening skills. The organisation will even be supplying teabags <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/support-us/campaign/brew-monday/\" title=\"\">at railway stations and branch events across the country</a> for what it hopes will be a heartening, loneliness-defying brew.</p> <p>When we meet, Rowe also brings a set of listening tips, and it coincides with Samaritans\u2019 list at many points. Show empathy \u2013 enter into the world of the other person. Concentrate. Ask open questions: \u201cWhat was it like for you?\u201d \u201cHow did you feel?\u201d \u201cCan you tell me more?\u201d Reflect back the speaker\u2019s feelings and paraphrase what they have been saying in clear, simple language. Gently ask for clarification, although, as trust develops, she says you can begin to challenge what they are saying and focus more intensely on the problem they want, sometimes very guardedly, to discuss.</p> <p>Can journalists hope to listen in the way that the professionals do? I ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simonhattenstone\" title=\"\">Simon Hattenstone</a>, a very skilful Guardian interviewer, who last year, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-lavelle\" title=\"\">Daniel Lavelle</a>, wrote a remarkable<strong> </strong>series on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/the-empty-doorway\" title=\"\">the deaths of homeless people</a> in the UK that demanded tremendous listening skills when it came to finding out about them from family and friends.</p> <p>\u201cLiv Ullmann told me I was a really bad listener because I kept interrupting,\u201d Hattenstone recalls. \u201cWhen I was young, I used to think it was quite a cool technique; that it would make people relax by making them think I didn\u2019t give a shit about what they were saying.\u201d He says that back then he thought silences put people on their guard and made them too aware of what they might be about to reveal. Now, he says, he tries not to fill the silence, preferring to let the subject find their own way through it.</p> <p>\u201cThe most powerful things are often when you let the silence roll,\u201d he explains. That was especially true for the homeless deaths series, where he says it was essential to let the bereaved \u201chave their emotions and let them think their way through\u201d rather than impose his own agenda. A TV interview, he says, is about drama and confrontation; a print interview is about detail and getting proper answers. Like Capobianco, he says you have to \u201cslow people down\u201d when you talk to them because \u201cthey always want to speed up\u201d. You have to get as much detail as you can, and clues to a person\u2019s motivation or to the crux of an event will appear in unlikely places.</p> <p>Hattenstone says there is always a danger of following your interview script so slavishly that you miss the essence of what you are being told. \u201cSomeone is answering and you\u2019re already thinking about the next question, which is awful because you\u2019re not listening,\u201d he explains. \u201cOften in the best interviews people will take you to places you completely don\u2019t expect to go, but if you\u2019re rigidly looking at your questions you often miss what people say. It passes you by.\u201d</p> <p>The real art of listening lies in caring, profoundly caring, about what you are being told and about the person who is telling their story. In her book, Murphy offers an encomium to the people she has interviewed during her career. \u201cWithout exception, they have expanded my worldview and increased my understanding,\u201d she says. \u201cMany have touched me deeply. People describe me as the type of person who can talk to anyone, but it\u2019s really that I can listen to anyone.\u201d Curiosity, empathy, a genuine interest in other people. The art of listening is really the art of being human.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/you-re-not-listening-9781787300958.html\">You\u2019re Not Listening</a> is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a316.99) on 23 January.

She calmly let the conversation take its course; I felt I was constantly bending and stretching it, trying to hurry it on to some preordained end. \u201cTo be able to really listen, you have to get rid of your own ego, your own thoughts,\u201d says Rowe. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do, but you\u2019ve got to try to put all that aside.\u201d She says that, when she works with couples, she asks them to listen to each other and then repeat what the other has just said. \u201cThat might sound like quite an easy exercise to do,\u201d she says, \u201cbut invariably they will put their own twist on it and change it.\u201d Ego-free, agenda-free listening is hard. I relate my awkwardness to Murphy, contrasting my nerviness with Rowe\u2019s placid thoughtfulness. She immediately recognises the hallmark of the professional listener. \u201cThat was something I noticed in all the really excellent listeners I interviewed,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all had a very calm demeanour. They were very open, but they weren\u2019t in their own heads. That can be unnerving to someone who is all over the place. It\u2019s more comfortable if the other person isn\u2019t listening because then you\u2019re not responsible for what you\u2019re saying.\u201d The generally accepted view is that women, having inherently more empathy than men, are better listeners. Murphy, although she admits that\u2019s what everyone assumes, is reluctant to accept it as a general rule. \u201cIt\u2019s a pervasive thought and both men and women think that,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you have to wonder if there isn\u2019t something to it. But I\u2019ve met women who are terrible listeners and men who are great listeners, so it really depends on the situation.\u201d Murphy argues that our growing failure to listen has dire political consequences because we are no longer willing to engage with our opponents\u2019 points of view. In the US, for instance, \u201csenators used to meet in a communal dining room where they talked to each other and were exposed to each other in a way where they could really listen, whether it was about politics or something else. They humanised each other. Now people are intent on being separate and demonising one another. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t agree. They think the other person is bad, is an evil person. You can\u2019t start listening if you think the other person is fundamentally an idiot or a bad person.\u201d She says you only grow when you listen to opposing viewpoints \u2013 a powerful argument for escaping from our social-media echo chamber. For some, the ability to listen can be a matter of life and death, which is why every day thousands of Samaritans volunteers are on call for desperate people with an urgent need to be heard. I go to Samaritans central office at an old mill in Surrey to meet its senior learning and development officer, Lucia Capobianco, who has also done listening shifts at her local branch for more than 10 years. As with Rowe, I am immediately struck by her calm, unhurried good sense. After an hour in her company, I feel better for having met her. Capobianco says the key to their work is making the person who has made the call feel in control. \u201cWe want them to take control of their decisions, which is why we will get them to talk about options by exploring open questions. The idea of Samaritans is not to make someone dependent on the service; we want to be able to talk to someone, to listen to them, find out what\u2019s going on and help them to move out of that situation.\u201d She says volunteers are trained to avoid being drawn into a discussion of themselves \u2013 something callers sometimes try to do. All the focus will be on the caller, with open questions that gradually get to the heart of whatever is bothering them. They don\u2019t see their role as advisers. They are a sounding board, there to listen and try to understand. \u201cWhat people want is to tell you what\u2019s going on at that moment,\u201d says Capobianco. \u201cThey just want to put it out there. Sometimes, it just needs a small thing like saying to someone: \u2018It is really crap, isn\u2019t it? The situation you\u2019re in is really awful; it\u2019s horrible.\u2019 And they feel validated because you\u2019re the first person who has said: \u2018It\u2019s OK to feel this way.\u2019\u201d Capobianco says the organisation teaches its volunteers to be active listeners \u2013 a term coined in 1957 by the US psychologists Richard Farson and Carl Rogers. Active listening is a kind of super-engaged form of listening in which the listener concentrates intently on what is being said, asks questions to add detail and summarises what they have been told. New volunteers often consider themselves to be good listeners, but they soon realise the training they are given in active listening makes them far more effective. \u201cThere is a point when the active listening kicks in and their family and friends notice they are listening differently,\u201d says Capobianco. In our everyday lives, we will not usually have to talk people down from desperate situations or offer counselling that lays bare deep-seated psychological issues. But we can learn from the way the pros approach listening. It\u2019s about empathy, asking the right questions, being patient and giving people the time and space to tell their stories in the way they want to, offering odd words of encouragement, but not interrupting the flow and not feeling the need to fill every silence. \u201cYou have to give people breathing space,\u201d says Capobianco. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to ring Samaritans. They may be very upset, they may present quite aggressively to start with, they may blurt everything out, and silence just calms things down, gives them a break. When they\u2019ve got everything out, you can start to talk to them. You acknowledge their anger and say you are sorry this is happening to them, then lower your voice and say: \u2018Where would you like to start?\u2019 If someone is agitated and you start trying to come in with questions, you just make them more agitated and the conversation doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Samaritans publishes a list of listening tips: show you care by making eye contact and putting your phone away; have patience; use open questions and avoid putting your own spin on what you are being told; say it back to show you\u2019ve understood, but don\u2019t try to impose your own instantaneous solution; have the courage to ask someone how they feel and really care about their reply. Today, the third Monday of this challenging month, a day generally known as \u201cBlue Monday\u201d, Samaritans is launching a campaign, neatly called \u201cBrew Monday\u201d, to encourage family and friends to have a cup of tea together, talk about their lives and problems, and practise their listening skills. The organisation will even be supplying teabags at railway stations and branch events across the country for what it hopes will be a heartening, loneliness-defying brew. When we meet, Rowe also brings a set of listening tips, and it coincides with Samaritans\u2019 list at many points. Show empathy \u2013 enter into the world of the other person. Concentrate. Ask open questions: \u201cWhat was it like for you?\u201d \u201cHow did you feel?\u201d \u201cCan you tell me more?\u201d Reflect back the speaker\u2019s feelings and paraphrase what they have been saying in clear, simple language. Gently ask for clarification, although, as trust develops, she says you can begin to challenge what they are saying and focus more intensely on the problem they want, sometimes very guardedly, to discuss. Can journalists hope to listen in the way that the professionals do? I ask Simon Hattenstone, a very skilful Guardian interviewer, who last year, with Daniel Lavelle, wrote a remarkable series on the deaths of homeless people in the UK that demanded tremendous listening skills when it came to finding out about them from family and friends. \u201cLiv Ullmann told me I was a really bad listener because I kept interrupting,\u201d Hattenstone recalls. \u201cWhen I was young, I used to think it was quite a cool technique; that it would make people relax by making them think I didn\u2019t give a shit about what they were saying.\u201d He says that back then he thought silences put people on their guard and made them too aware of what they might be about to reveal. Now, he says, he tries not to fill the silence, preferring to let the subject find their own way through it. \u201cThe most powerful things are often when you let the silence roll,\u201d he explains. That was especially true for the homeless deaths series, where he says it was essential to let the bereaved \u201chave their emotions and let them think their way through\u201d rather than impose his own agenda. A TV interview, he says, is about drama and confrontation; a print interview is about detail and getting proper answers. Like Capobianco, he says you have to \u201cslow people down\u201d when you talk to them because \u201cthey always want to speed up\u201d. You have to get as much detail as you can, and clues to a person\u2019s motivation or to the crux of an event will appear in unlikely places. Hattenstone says there is always a danger of following your interview script so slavishly that you miss the essence of what you are being told. \u201cSomeone is answering and you\u2019re already thinking about the next question, which is awful because you\u2019re not listening,\u201d he explains. \u201cOften in the best interviews people will take you to places you completely don\u2019t expect to go, but if you\u2019re rigidly looking at your questions you often miss what people say. It passes you by.\u201d The real art of listening lies in caring, profoundly caring, about what you are being told and about the person who is telling their story. In her book, Murphy offers an encomium to the people she has interviewed during her career. \u201cWithout exception, they have expanded my worldview and increased my understanding,\u201d she says. \u201cMany have touched me deeply. People describe me as the type of person who can talk to anyone, but it\u2019s really that I can listen to anyone.\u201d Curiosity, empathy, a genuine interest in other people. The art of listening is really the art of being human. You\u2019re Not Listening is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a316.99) on 23 January.

      "body": "<p>A centuries-old institution survives not only through the accumulated weight of tradition, but through the ability to make sharp adjustments to its course when it finally realises it must. The British monarchy, by temperament a tortoise, has just put on a turn of speed again. Saturday\u2019s statements from the Queen and the Sussexes will not halt the storm surrounding the couple, but are designed to let the worst of the tempest abate.</p> <p>Less than two weeks before, Prince Harry and Meghan had announced their untenable desire to partially step back, operating half-in and half-out of the institution. Instead, they will effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/18/harry-meghan-buckingham-palace-deal-analysis\" title=\"\">stand down</a>, giving up royal duties and relinquishing their share of the sovereign grant from the Treasury. They will also repay the \u00a32.4m public funds used to refurbish their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage. In a classic establishment compromise, they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/18/the-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-to-drop-hrh-titles\" title=\"\">keep the right to be styled HRH</a> on the understanding that they will not exercise it. In theory, this retention would allow them to return as working royals should they change their minds. But while the arrangements are due for review in a year, the deal looks more like a decree nisi than a trial separation.</p> <p>Despite the palace\u2019s evident desire to draw a line beneath the matter, briefings at least purportedly on behalf of the players may well perpetuate the drama. Plenty of questions remain unanswered: notably, who will pay the sizable bill for the security they will need, and how they will cover their other costs. Not many commoners would understand \u201cfinancial independence\u201d to include seven-figure sums from a father who enjoys his own wealth through the same accident of birth that will make him king. But they will need additional income to maintain their current lifestyle. In reality, the glamour of royalty will remain their strongest suit, whatever their formal status. They could not retain royal funding while cutting commercial deals, however respectable \u2013 yet the cutting of pursestrings means that oversight will consist of the Queen\u2019s indication of approval or otherwise, rather than a formal vetting procedure.</p> <p>This is not what the Sussexes wanted. But it is what they have chosen. Their story has often been compared to that of another duke and duchess: Edward VIII, who abdicated to marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson. They spent the rest of their lives bitterly and ingloriously. But this is a very different \u2013 and much more sympathetic \u2013 couple in very different times. They have already shown a degree of courage as well as naivety. They will still enjoy a life of immense privilege. They should enjoy it. That looks easier said than done, given the racism and misogyny the Duchess has faced, as well as the broader criticism they have received and their ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/there-is-a-reason-why-royals-demonised-but-wont-read-all-about-it-prince-harry-meghan-markle\" title=\"\">battles with the media</a>, legal and otherwise. The Queen\u2019s acknowledgment of the intense scrutiny they have faced and her expression of pride in Meghan is surely intended to check the excesses, but is likely to have only limited effect.</p> <p>Nor is this what the palace wanted. Concerns about duty are compounded by the understanding that the UK\u2019s monarchy is a matter of showbusiness too. The royal family is losing the members most attractive and appealing to a younger generation, while the long reign of its respected head approaches its end. Yet even those who do not share the Guardian\u2019s republican views may agree that other countries have established more credible and creditable versions of the monarchy for the modern age. Slimming down the institution may well be in its best interests, however it plays out for those exiting the stage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A centuries-old institution survives not only through the accumulated weight of tradition, but through the ability to make sharp adjustments to its course when it finally realises it must. The British monarchy, by temperament a tortoise, has just put on a turn of speed again. Saturday\u2019s statements from the Queen and the Sussexes will not halt the storm surrounding the couple, but are designed to let the worst of the tempest abate. Less than two weeks before, Prince Harry and Meghan had announced their untenable desire to partially step back, operating half-in and half-out of the institution. Instead, they will effectively stand down, giving up royal duties and relinquishing their share of the sovereign grant from the Treasury. They will also repay the \u00a32.4m public funds used to refurbish their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage. In a classic establishment compromise, they will keep the right to be styled HRH on the understanding that they will not exercise it. In theory, this retention would allow them to return as working royals should they change their minds. But while the arrangements are due for review in a year, the deal looks more like a decree nisi than a trial separation. Despite the palace\u2019s evident desire to draw a line beneath the matter, briefings at least purportedly on behalf of the players may well perpetuate the drama. Plenty of questions remain unanswered: notably, who will pay the sizable bill for the security they will need, and how they will cover their other costs. Not many commoners would understand \u201cfinancial independence\u201d to include seven-figure sums from a father who enjoys his own wealth through the same accident of birth that will make him king. But they will need additional income to maintain their current lifestyle. In reality, the glamour of royalty will remain their strongest suit, whatever their formal status. They could not retain royal funding while cutting commercial deals, however respectable \u2013 yet the cutting of pursestrings means that oversight will consist of the Queen\u2019s indication of approval or otherwise, rather than a formal vetting procedure. This is not what the Sussexes wanted. But it is what they have chosen. Their story has often been compared to that of another duke and duchess: Edward VIII, who abdicated to marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson. They spent the rest of their lives bitterly and ingloriously. But this is a very different \u2013 and much more sympathetic \u2013 couple in very different times. They have already shown a degree of courage as well as naivety. They will still enjoy a life of immense privilege. They should enjoy it. That looks easier said than done, given the racism and misogyny the Duchess has faced, as well as the broader criticism they have received and their ongoing battles with the media, legal and otherwise. The Queen\u2019s acknowledgment of the intense scrutiny they have faced and her expression of pride in Meghan is surely intended to check the excesses, but is likely to have only limited effect. Nor is this what the palace wanted. Concerns about duty are compounded by the understanding that the UK\u2019s monarchy is a matter of showbusiness too. The royal family is losing the members most attractive and appealing to a younger generation, while the long reign of its respected head approaches its end. Yet even those who do not share the Guardian\u2019s republican views may agree that other countries have established more credible and creditable versions of the monarchy for the modern age. Slimming down the institution may well be in its best interests, however it plays out for those exiting the stage.",

      "bodyText": "Local people in a Yorkshire town are pressing for their river to become the first in the UK to be designated as a bathing area to force the authorities to clean up the water they say is being used as an open sewer. In the spa town of Ilkley a grassroots campaign has uncovered the regular and routine dumping of untreated sewage by Yorkshire Water \u2013 with the approval of the Environment Agency \u2013 into the River Wharfe. In the summer, the river is used by hundreds of children and families, wild swimmers and fishermen, but the work of the Ilkley Clean River campaign has shown that people are putting their health at risk. Instead of deterring them from taking to the water, locals are demanding that the much-used stretch of river is designated a bathing water area \u2013 an endorsement that would force the water company and the Environment Agency to invest in the infrastructure and treatment required to clean up the river.

Gauff, the youngest player in the main draw at Melbourne Park, has beaten Williams for the second time, and in straight sets at that. Gauff rushes to 40-0 courtesy of two Williams unforced errors and an ace of her own. Her serve for the match is called out. She challenges. It\u2019s in.

An ambitious second serve from Osaka leads to a second double fault of the match and 40-30 but the following rally goes her way, again dominating from the centre of the baseline, drawing Bouzkova out of her comfort zone and then fizzing the winner when enough open court presents itself. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e24f4f68f08e97ed2126740\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-20T00:39:54.230Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p> <strong>First set: Osaka 3-2 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): </strong>That scare on serve has stung Osaka into action.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019ll do from me. It\u2019s tea time in Australia. But worry not, for our esteemed colleagues in London will be firing up another live blog to cover the evening session when Ash Barty will play world No 120 Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine. Here\u2019s the new blog with all the action from the evening session: Williams 6-7 (5-7) 3-6 Gauff: Youth triumphs over experience at Margaret Court Arena but Williams elicits a rousing applause from the punters who came to see the two-time Australian Open runner-up. She looks far less happy than Gauff, who looks far less happy than her coach, who is wearing a \u2018Call Me Coco\u2019 t-shirt and simply cannot contain himself. It was quite a performance from the 15-year-old, who could yet deliver big things in her burgeoning career. She\u2019s not speechless, though, and is enamoured by the fact that people chant her name outside of the US. Second set: Williams 6-7 (5-7) 3-6 Gauff* (*denotes server): Game, set and match. Gauff, the youngest player in the main draw at Melbourne Park, has beaten Williams for the second time, and in straight sets at that. Gauff rushes to 40-0 courtesy of two Williams unforced errors and an ace of her own. Her serve for the match is called out. She challenges. It\u2019s in. She sends another first serve down and CONTROVERSY as Williams runs for a drop shot and appears to have caught it in the nick of time. But Gauff is looking at the umpire, and then at Williams, before it becomes clear the ball had bounced twice before Williams made contact. A bizarre ending to a very entertaining affair. Second set: Williams* 6-7 (5-7) 3-5 Gauff (*denotes server): Williams wins her game to love via her fourth ace. Second set: Williams 6-7 (5-7) 2-5 Gauff* (*denotes server): Williams hasn\u2019t exactly been out of this match, and she\u2019s cleaned up her unforced errors, but her lack of game time and no warm-up tournament is showing in the small moments. She will serve to stay in the match. Second set: Williams* 6-7 (5-7) 2-4 Gauff (*denotes server): Williams backhands, then aces, and then double faults before putting away a forehand winner. Another ace at 40-15 sees her hold. Second set: Williams 6-7 (5-7) 1-4 Gauff* (*denotes server): There\u2019s grit and there\u2019s grunt, and then there\u2019s Gauff. Pure grunt and grit give her this very important game. Williams has put up a fight, moving fluidly from 30-0 down into a jumping crosscourt forehand and levelling at 30-30, until a Gauff dropshot is too precise for retaliation. But one should never write off a player of Williams\u2019 calibre. Unfortunately for. Gauff, that\u2019s exactly what she does with a volley that boasts nowhere near enough width, depth or pace, and Williams pounces to wallop it deep beyond her stranded opponent. And yet, Gauff is really going for it on her second serve. The bigger the point, the bigger the second serve. Three deuces later and she holds. Second set: Williams* 6-7 (5-7) 1-3 Gauff (*denotes server): Williams definitely needs to hold. And that she does. A first-point winner sets the tone and the 39-year-old is on the board. Second set: Williams 6-7 (5-7) 0-3 Gauff* (*denotes server): Unforced error. Winner. Unforced error. Winner. Winner. Game Gauff. This is running away from Williams now. Second set: Williams* 6-7 (5-7) 0-2 Gauff (*denotes server): Williams races to 40-0 via some of the trademark play that has built her formidable CV over decades. But her younger counterpart is waiting with her own winner, and utilises the transition to go cross-court in the next point relentlessly prodding until Williams hits the net. Gauff is asking questions to the tune of winning five straight points, and what was a regulation service hold for Williams is all of a sudden an early break for Gauff. First set tie-break: Williams 6-7 (5-7) Gauff: At 5-5 Gauff\u2019s first serve is out but she challenges, and gets a bit uppity about it too. It is out, as was called. She fires a hard second serve but follows it with a. drop shot that leaves her a sitting duck and Williams capitalises to bring the tie-break back on serve. Another big second serve from Gauff puts the onus on Williams to serve to stay in the set. She pummels a would-be smash into the net with an open court beckoning, and Gauff wins the first set in more than an hour. First set tie-break: Williams 6-6 (4-5) Gauff: Gauff consolidates her mini-break and heaps all the pressure on Williams\u2019 serve. But the veteran isn\u2019t done asking questions and eight of the nine points have gone the way of the server. First set tie-break: Williams 6-6 (1-3) Gauff: Williams has lost the opening three points but her next point pays dividends. With ease she approaches for a forehand volley against the momentum of her body, which was moving left as the ball is diverted into the right-hand corner. First set: Williams 6-6 Gauff* (*denotes server): Tailing 15-30, there\u2019s a palpable sense of frustration building in Gauff. She may be a prodigy, but she\u2019s also a school kid. A 19-shot rally ensues and finishes with a monster forehand that gives Williams no chance. What was that about her being a school kid? Back in our box. One big serve and another winner later and we\u2019re going to a tie-break. First set: Williams* 6-5 Gauff (*denotes server): Well well. What do we have here? A tennis match, it would seem. Williams, playing competitively for the first time since October, when she suffered a round-one loss in China, has her tail up and after losing the first point, holds serve with ease. First set: Williams 5-5 Gauff* (*denotes server): It\u2019s 30-all and Gauff has a third break point as Williams attempts an audacious sliced backhand but the net isn\u2019t kind. Gauff serves a let, and then a good serve and Williams\u2019 return is good. Too good, as Gauff hammers it beyond the baseline. Williams, safely ensconced in another advantage, merely watches as Gauff double faults and hands her a break back. First set: Williams* 4-5 Gauff (*denotes server): Williams has barely blinked and she\u2019s down 15-40, gifting Gauff two set points. The sprightly, spindly teenager is nimble with a top-spin forehand and then a sliced backhand that draws audible awe from the crowd, who I daresay were less impressed with the subsequent backhand into the net. That was the rally of. the match. For Williams it\u2019s one set point down, one to go. She takes two on her toss. Is she nervous? Whatever it is, it puts Gauff off and she shanks her return off her frame. Two down. Williams takes the advantage and then the game in a manner only the truly experienced know how. First set: Williams 3-5* Gauff* (*denotes server): One more break and Gauff has the first set. First set: Williams* 3-4 Gauff (*denotes server): A see-saw ensues as Williams fights to hold serve. Up 30-15, the veteran slams a backhand down the line and Gauf is at full stretch but still possesses the awareness to draw Williams in, before waiting for the return and whipping her own response too deep for her to track back. The longest game of the match so far ensues with four deuces, Williams losing four game points as she attempts to keep the rallies short but dumps balls into the net. Gauff can\u2019t convert her first break point and we\u2019re at a fifth deuce. Then Williams, thankfully, conjures a glimmer of resilience for another advantage and wins the deciding point via a 183km/h ace for good measure. An important hold. First set: Williams 2-4 Gauff* (*denotes server): Fifteen-year-old Gauff is giving her opponent, 24 years her senior, the runaround and lures Williams into her eighth and ninth unforced errors to hold to love for a second time. First set: Williams* 2-3 Gauff (*denotes server): When Williams gets herself properly composed she still wields one of the meanest backhands in the game, and she primes herslef well for a forehand winner to go up 40-0 before holding serve in flawless fashion. First set: Williams 1-3 Gauff* (*denotes server): Afternoon all. I\u2019ve lobbed just in time to see Williams gain her first break point as Gauff toils at 30-40 on her serve. But she recovers with a deft touch, stealing the next three points with ease. First set: Williams* 1-2 Gauff (*denotes server): Much better from Venus, putting away a tough overhead then serving powerfully wide to Gauff\u2019s forehand for 40-30. She sees off the remaining point to get on the board but it\u2019s going to be a tough day at the office for the veteran. To take you through the remainder of the session it will be Emma Kemp. Thanks for your company. First set: Williams 0-2 Gauff * (*denotes server): Another game in quicktime for Gauff, winning eight of the first nine points. She is a supreme talent, and extraordinarily assured - full stop - let alone for her age. First set: Williams* 0-1 Gauff (*denotes server): The 15-year-old Coco Gauff has blitzed the opening game, breaking 39-year-old Venus Williams. This is such an iconic match-up. That\u2019s the day\u2019s action taken care of on RLA, so it\u2019s over now to Margaret Court Arena for Venus Williams v Coco Gauff, one of the most intriguing match-ups of the round. Kevin Mitchell\u2019s first report from Melbourne Park is in: Rain update: Play is still suspended on all outside courts. A further decision on recommencement of play will be made not before 17:00 AEDT. \u201cI\u2019m very happy\u201d Federer tells Jim Courier, with a smile that indicates he\u2019s aware of the understatement. He then explains how good a pre-season he\u2019s had, one with no interruptions, meaning he\u2019s fit and firing for the start of the season. Third set: Federer* 6-3 6-2 6-2 Johnson (*denotes server): One hour and 22 minutes is all it takes for Roger Federer to stamp his authority on the Australian Open. That was a vintage display. Even by his high standards that was awesome. Third set: Federer 6-3 6-2 5-2 Johnson* (*denotes server): Johnson rages against the dying of the light with a hold to love. Third set: Federer* 6-3 6-2 5-1 Johnson (*denotes server): Great hustle from Johnson to put Federer under pressure at 15-30. But then the GOAT needs only four more swings of his racket to seal the game. The end is nigh. Like so many big names today, Petra Kvitova (7) didn\u2019t hang around. Third set: Federer 6-3 6-2 4-1 Johnson* (*denotes server): A game full of creative shots and interesting points reaches deuce. Both men have all the shots in the kit-bag and both are prepared to use them. It\u2019s refreshing to see a match like this as opposed to the remorseless power-hitting from the baseline we\u2019re so often accustomed to. Federer forces a break point at deuce that Johnson saves. He earns another soon after when Johnson slices wide, and he converts when the American finds the net without provocation. Another break. Federer coasting to the second round. Third set: Federer* 6-3 6-2 3-1 Johnson (*denotes server): Another quick hold for the champ. RLA is now full to the brim for the Federer show after Osaka and Williams played to half-full arenas. Third set: Federer 6-3 6-2 2-1 Johnson* (*denotes server): \u201cHe\u2019s so comfortable this is turning into a tryout session\u201d explains Jim Courier about Federer standing way behind the baseline to return Johnson\u2019s serve. It doesn\u2019t work though and the American turns 15-30 to 40-30. An errant backhand slice provokes deuce where Federer comes out on top of a lovely rally full of different angles and spins. The Swiss then has the game at his mercy but he nets a backhand with the open court begging. Johnson then converts the second deuce after some unfamiliar off-kilter shots from his opponent. Third set: Federer* 6-3 6-2 2-0 Johnson (*denotes server): I am running out of ways to describe Federer\u2019s brilliance today. Another service game races by with some shots of audacious brilliance. He is timing the ball so purely on forehand and backhand. It\u2019s like watching a jazz drummer go through his drills. Magnificent. Third set: Federer 6-3 6-2 1-0 Johnson* (*denotes server): Another set begins with Federer climbing all over Johnson\u2019s serve and earning two break points, the second of which the American sends wide. This has been one-way traffic since the opening point. Only two other matches taking place right now because of the rain. Grigor Dimitrov (18) has just started on Melbourne Arena, while Petra Kvitova (7) is cruising a set to the good on Margaret Court Arena. Second set: Federer* 6-3 6-2 Johnson (*denotes server): A clean return winner from Johnson gives the American a rare foothold in a Federer service game. He then scraps to 15-30 but curses a poor backhand that ricochets off the frame of his racquet. Federer then takes control, powering to 40-30 at the net and then pummelling Johnson\u2019s return back where it came from - with interest - to seal the second set. Just 50 minutes played and the Fed Express is motoring at full speed. The latest update on the outside courts is that play will not resume before 4pm. Second set: Federer 6-3 5-2 Johnson* (*denotes server): Johnson\u2019s best service game for some time. He holds to love, ending with an ace on the armpit of the T. Second set: Federer* 6-3 5-1 Johnson (*denotes server): A spiffing volley wrong-foots Federer at the net but that\u2019s as good as it gets for Johnson as the third seed races to another hold of extraordinarily high quality. Federer is averaging under 90 seconds per service game. He\u2019s won 33 of 39 points on his own serve. Sensational. Second set: Federer 6-3 4-1 Johnson* (*denotes server): Johnson finally manages to slow the match down, interrupt Federer\u2019s rhythm and hold his serve. He has to play his best tennis to scrap to 30-30 though, at which point Federer fluffs a couple of lines and allows Johnson to dodge a second set bagel. Second set: Federer* 6-3 4-0 Johnson (*denotes server): Federer holds to love. Quelle suprise? Second set: Federer 6-3 3-0 Johnson* (*denotes server): This is liquid tennis from Federer. Another break arrives in effortless fashion. He\u2019s moving like a firefly, dancing with exceptional lightness of touch from spot to spot. It must be unnerving for Johnson; what does he do? Second set: Federer* 6-3 2-0 Johnson (*denotes server): I just want to make a series of swoon noises instead of typing actual words. A backhand down the line, over the net post, is gorgeous, then an in-to-out backhand winner deserves its own ESPN 30for30. Sublime, punishing, clutch, aesthetically pleasing, top-level sport. Just enjoy it. Second set: Federer 6-3 1-0 Johnson* (*denotes server): Federer is mixing flowing attacking tennis on his own serve with precise error-inducing tennis on Johnson\u2019s. That strategy earns Federer a game to love in a performance that resembled a warm-up for him and the most stress-inducing nightmare for his opponent. First set: Federer* 6-3 Johnson (*denotes server): The point of the match so far sees Federer ending a superb rally with a low stretching backhand volley at the net. The rest of the game is a cakewalk and the living legend takes the opening set in just 27 minutes. First set: Federer 5-3 Johnson* (*denotes server): Johnson holds with the help of a couple of Federer forehand errors. In case you were wondering about the weather... Caroline Wozniacki is safely through to the second round. She might be retiring imminently but she\u2019s playing her best tennis in 18-months at the moment. First set: Federer* 5-2 Johnson (*denotes server): Federer means business whether it\u2019s indoors or in the open air. There\u2019s an economy of movement, but much of that is forward, coming in and playing plenty of serve-volley tennis. Perhaps Federer is paying tribute to his idol Rod Laver? Another home hope fades quietly from the scene. First set: Federer 4-2 Johnson* (*denotes server): The roof has now weather-sealed RLA and after the resumption Johnson holds serve securely. Outside the three stadium courts we could be off for some time. The radar indicates a series of slow moving storm cells that promise plenty of rain. But hey, this is Melbourne, so who knows? Finally, much later than expected, the rain has arrived. The players head into the locker room while the roof is closed on Rod Laver Arena. Play will doubtless be suspended on the outside courts. First set: Federer* 4-1 Johnson (*denotes server): Majestic hold to love, Federer serving supremely, volleying crisply, moving nimbly, and firing groundstrokes with plenty of fizz. Dan Evans (30) has dodged a bullet. First set: Federer 3-1 Johnson* (*denotes server): The Johnson serve is under all sorts of pressure from Federer and it\u2019s an almighty scrap to get to deuce. Thereafter the American pushes through for his first game of the match. The first major shock of the tournament - Denis Shapovalov (13) is gone! A possible banana skin in Roger Federer\u2019s section of the draw has been avoided. First set: Federer* 3-0 Johnson (*denotes server): Federer faces a bit of pressure at 15-30 but aces his way out of it. Johnson comes back though, earning a break point, but Federer escapes back to deuce. After barely missing a first serve in two games Federer suddenly looks short of rhythm - but it doesn\u2019t last long. Johnson butchers a makable second serve before a thundering first serve closes the brief opportunity to break. First set: Federer 2-0 Johnson* (*denotes server): Federer is looking sharp early on and streaks to 0-40 before Johnson finally gets a point on the board. It counts for little though as a lovely rally goes Federer\u2019s way, one featuring plenty of Johnson\u2019s trademark backhand slice but ending with the champion\u2019s trademark backhand down the line. First set: Federer* 1-0 Johnson (*denotes server): Federer sprints through the opening game to love looking every inch the champion he is. Federer: 38-years-old, seeded three, six-time former champion and 20-time grand slam champion and 103-time title winner during an unrivalled career. He leads the head-to-head 2-0 with Steve Johnson, the 30-year-old American ranked 75 in the world. Also, it remains remarkable that play is still on considering the Melbourne weather. The eastern suburbs are getting a soaking but the CBD remains mercifully dry. Next up on centre court, Roger Federer. The Swiss maestro will break the record for the most appearances in the main draw of the Australian Open when he takes on American Steve Johnson in the last scheduled match of the day session at Rod Laver Arena. The No 32 seed bundled out on day one. That was convincing from the seven-time champion. The serve and power game were both on point, and the movement was as fluid as it\u2019s looked since Williams returned to the circuit as a mother. The first set was a walkover but she was challenged in the second and did what was needed on the pressure points. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back,\u201d she says post-match, beaming about her performance and reflecting on securing her first title as a mother recently in Auckland. \u201cI try to tell her [daughter Olympia] I\u2019m a somebody, you know,\u201d she says, smiling broadly, at ease with her surroundings. Actual tennis chat ends before we learn anything with Serena executing a well-practiced dismount from an interview by pretending to ramble then professing to worrying about rambling, before quickly legging it. Second set: Williams* 6-0 6-3 Potapova (*denotes server): A couple of aces, total composure, and Serena Williams is through to the second round. Second set: Williams 6-0 5-3 Potapova* (*denotes server): Potapova gets through her serving preparation in quicktime, giving her game an element of hustle about it. She exchanges points with Williams until 30-30 when she dumps an error into the net. A rally starts to form at break point but Serena then adds some extra sauce to a forehand that catches Potapova by surprise. Williams to serve for the match. There is rain pouring across swathes of Melbourne now, but the Olympic Park precinct remains dry - for now. Surely it can\u2019t be long before the outside courts are halted and the roofs cover the stadium courts. Second set: Williams* 6-0 4-3 Potapova (*denotes server): At 0-15 Serena looks to be facing a nervy service game but in the blink of an eye it\u2019s 40-15. Poptapova will not lie down though and she engineers a superb point, ending with a powerful angled forehand. Does Williams panic? Nope, another ace secures the hold. Second set: Williams 6-0 3-3 Potapova* (*denotes server): Williams is trying her best to pressurise the Potapova serve but the Russian is resolute, digging in at 30-30 then nailing an ace and an unreturnable scorcher to the Williams backhand. She is a fighter the teenager. Second set: Williams* 6-0 3-2 Potapova (*denotes server): There are fewer cheap points on offer now for Williams who is forced to work hard to share the opening two points of the game. An ace is then undermined by a wide forehand crosscourt, so what does Serena do? Another ace - 188 kph! Potapova is matching her stroke for stroke though and forces deuce by constantly hitting behind her opponent, keeping her on the defensive. For the second game in a row Serena faces a break point, this time with an unforced error, but she saves it despite plenty of hustle from Potapova. \u201cCome on!\u201d Williams bellows, unusually amped for what looks such a routine opening round contest. That routine resuming with a couple of powerful serves allowing an unexpectedly tough hold. Second set: Williams 6-0 2-2 Potapova* (*denotes server): Potapova is working into the contest now. She loses the opening point but makes Serena earn it, then prevails in a long rally full of intent for 15-15. An ace puts her in front but one of the rallies of the match draws Williams level again. These rallies are now much more evenly balanced than in the opening set with Potapova driving through her shots and going for the lines. Again Serena comes out on top in a longish exchange to engineer a break point, which he takes when Potapova goes long mid-rally. The immediate break back, the hallmark of a champion. Second set: Williams* 6-0 1-2 Potapova (*denotes server): A rare element of pressure on the Serena serve! Williams cruises to 40-15 but Potapova puts two strong points together the first after moving Serena around the court, the second with a clean winner down the line. The eighth seed dumps an unforced error into the net on deuce to allow her first break point of the match. What happened next? An ace, of course. But Potapova digs in and returns a couple of groundstrokes Williams expects to be winners and the veteran blinks first. The second break point? Double fault! Potapova breaks and sneaks ahead in this second set. Shapovalov (13) is as as good as two sets to one down, and not a happy bunny at all. More good news for a seed at the expensive of an Aussie. Second set: Williams 6-0 1-1 Potapova* (*denotes server): A series of Williams errors invite Potapova into the contest at 40-15. These only serve to highlight the astonishing skill she\u2019s displayed elsewhere, a reminder of which arrives with a rasping forehand winner to force 40-30. But Potapova holds! Finally, a game on the board for the teenager, after Williams hits a backhand a few inches long. Second set: Williams* 6-0 1-0 Potapova (*denotes server): There\u2019s a warm ripple of applause whenever Potapova wins a point, and stunned near-silence when Serena rips another of her many winners. Not sure if that\u2019s awe, disinterest, or dislike from the RLA crowd, because this is a supreme clinic. Another service game passes in the blink of an eye, sealed with a unreturnable wide kicking ace. First set: Williams 6-0 Potapova* (*denotes server): Potapova finds a couple of shots this game but Serena is playing near flawless tennis, and despite moving at what looks like half-pace she\u2019s executing with awesome force. She seals the opening set to love in just 19 minutes with a backhand return winner that thunders across court like a fighter jet skidding onto the runway of an aircraft carrier. I\u2019m covering the action from a few miles east of Melbourne Park, and I just heard an almighty rumble of thunder. The storms are closing in. First set: Williams* 5-0 Potapova (*denotes server): Williams holds to love. This is a mauling in mauve. First set: Williams 4-0 Potapova* (*denotes server): We are in double-bagel territory here. Williams races to 0-30 then 15-40 with some scudding groundstrokes on both flanks. A double fault, featuring a foot fault, extends Potapova\u2019s misery. Another seed through. Bad news for the Aussie. First set: Williams* 3-0 Potapova (*denotes server): Williams, top to toe in polka dot lavender, slides to 0-30, but then she gets to work, hitting groundstrokes that pop off the racket to secure four points in a row. Potapova already looks rattled, cursing her errors and directing pained expressions in the direction of her box. First set: Williams 2-0 Potapova* (*denotes server): Potapova skips to 30-0 but some neat court craft from Williams and an unforced error from the server and the scoreboard is suddenly 30-30. A double fault followed by a thumping forehand down the line from Williams secures the first break of the match. An ominous start from the seven-time former champion. First set: Williams* 1-0 Potapova (*denotes server): Serena comfortably holds her first service game of Australian Open 2020. This is her 19th visit to Melbourne Park and she arrives on the back of victory in Auckland recently, her 73rd professional crown. Potapova has yet to make her mark in the seniors but she is a former junior No 1 and Wimbledon junior champion. Serena is, well, Serena. Universe queen. Next up on Rod Laver Arena, the one, the only Serena Williams. The 38-year-old 23-time grand slam champion, against 18-year old Russian Anastasia Potapova. Querrey does it! The unseeded American has ousted 25th seed Borna Coric in straight sets. Denis Shapovalov (13) dropped the opening set to Marton Fucsovics but he has levelled things up in the second. Turns out #Bananagate is a thing. Borna Coric (25) received a horror draw when unseeded floater Sam Querrey was paired alongside him in the opening round and the American is now two sets up on show court two. Petra Martic, one of a few dozen genuine contenders for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. The US contingent is strong in the women\u2019s draw, Sofia Kenin among them. Elsewhere, Mackenzie McDonald remains in control of his contest with 30th seed Dan Evans. It remains dry over Melbourne Park, which is perhaps a surprise given the forecast. Storms are still predicted to hit at any point. \u201cIt was tough for me trying to control my nerves,\u201d says Osaka on court afterwards with customary honesty. She then thanks the crowd for turning out - self-deprecatingly suggesting they didn\u2019t come to see her play. She is as far from the cookie-cutter athlete as you could imagine in the modern era. Second set: Osaka* 6-2 6-4 Bouzkova (*denotes server): A solid service game to see things off for Naomi Osaka. Far from top form but a solid hit-out to get her campaign up and running. The unforced errors will give her and new coach Wim Fissette something to work on but a banana akin has been sidestepped. Second set: Osaka 6-2 5-4 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): All the momentum is with Osaka heading into a crucial Bouzkova service game and the Japanese\u2019s relentless pressure from the back of the court starts to grind her Czech opponent down. A couple of precision serves from Bouzkova drags 0-30 to 30-all but Osaka then demonstrates too much power and too much timing with her groundstrokes to seal her third game in a row. She will serve for the match. Second set: Osaka* 6-2 4-4 Bouzkova (*denotes server): Routine hold for Osaka. Second set: Osaka 6-2 3-4 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Osaka is starting to cut a frustrated figure out there as Bouzkova refuses to concede a point. Shots are being returned with interest but not all of them are hitting their targets. Not for the first time 30-30 feels pivotal - and this time it goes Osaka\u2019s way - a mishit return loops right on the baseline in the backhand corner and the opportunity to break back immediately presents itself. Bouzkova gold plates it with a double fault. Back on serve in the second set. Second set: Osaka* 6-2 2-4 Bouzkova (*denotes server): Impressive returning from Bouzkova and she earns her first break of the match! Nothing flash from the Czech but she kept forcing Osaka to play ball after ball and that patterns of winners or errors eventually counted against her. A wry smile from the third seed, who is perhaps the most unknowable character on the circuit. Second set: Osaka 6-2 2-3 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Osaka leads Bouzkova 23-8 in terms of both winners and unforced errors. That means the match is being played on Osaka\u2019s racket, but with enough inconsistency to keep the contest alive. This game is a case in point, winners and errors littering a comparatively simple hold for the underdog. Second set: Osaka* 6-2 2-2 Bouzkova (*denotes server): Rapid hold from Osaka. Julia Goerges might be unseeded but she has a weapon of a serve and she\u2019s been near the business end of the rankings for most of the past three seasons. She\u2019s in Ash Barty\u2019s quarter. Second set: Osaka 6-2 1-2 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Bouzkova continues to give the impression of keeping pace with Osaka but she continues to concede points with ungainly errors from the back of the court. She looked a million bucks at 30-15 but ends up 30-40 down and under enormous pressure from Osaka stepping inside the baseline and returning ferociously. The Czech forces deuce though, and consecutive errors from Osaka hands her the game. We saluted BJK earlier. I also love Judy Murray, as should everyone. Vamos! Second set: Osaka* 6-2 1-1 Bouzkova (*denotes server): Bouzkova has regrouped between sets and she stuns Osaka to move to 0-30 then 15-40 before the Japanese star finds her serving form to force deuce. At this point there\u2019s a short break in play after Osaka\u2019s serve strikes the net and removes the centre cord from its moorings, forcing some hasty refurbishments with particular attention paid to the net height, accurate to the precise millimetre. the speed of that DIY really was something to behold considering the pressure. Unperturbed, Osaka nails her second serve then unleashes an ace to hold. Second set: Osaka 6-2 0-1 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Bouzkova needs to snap Osaka\u2019s run of five straight games and that\u2019s exactly what she does with a scrappy hold. Around the courts a few men\u2019s seeds have some work to do. Denis Shapovalov (13) has lost the opening set to Marton Fucsovics, Borna Coric (25) is a set and a break down to Sam Querrey, and Dan Evans (30) is trailing Mackenzie McDonald. First set: Osaka* 6-2 Bouzkova (*denotes server): The new balls look to make an enormous difference this year. It has already been reported they fluff up quite quickly, creating a range of conditions during their lifespan. Osaka seems to struggle with the extra pace coming back at her after firing down an ace, slipping back to 30-30, before taking a firm grip of her service and securing the set. No dramas so far for the 2019 winner. First set: Osaka 5-2 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Osaka is returning superbly and the longer this match wears on the more errors she\u2019s inducing from Bouzkova. The Czech receives a gift at 15-30, a point that felt pivotal in the context of the momentum of the duel, but she backs it up with her first double fault of the match. An unforced error with plenty of court to hit - not for the first time - then hands Osaka her second break. The third seed will serve for the first set with new balls. First set: Osaka* 4-2 Bouzkova (*denotes server): Bouzkova plays some nice tennis but still slips to 30-0 then 40-15 with unforced errors. The point she won was a ripper though, crunching a forehand return down the line. An ambitious second serve from Osaka leads to a second double fault of the match and 40-30 but the following rally goes her way, again dominating from the centre of the baseline, drawing Bouzkova out of her comfort zone and then fizzing the winner when enough open court presents itself. First set: Osaka 3-2 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): That scare on serve has stung Osaka into action. A rasping return winner precedes a series of thumping forehands from the baseline to see her surge to 0-40. Bouzkova rallies confidently, saving two break points then denies the third with the help of a net cord and a superb backhand pass down the line after Osaka was unable to put away a diffiuclt backhand overhead. A fourth break point arrives at deuce when Osaka again takes control of the angles, but once more she can\u2019t convert, hitting her backhand long. A fifth follows soon after, and this time Bouzkova can\u2019t keep pulling rabbits out of hats and the champ moves a break up. The pattern of the match so far is Bouzkova struggling to land her first serves and Osaka controlling points from the baseline, hammering forehands and backhands, moving her opponent side to side, but struggling to land regular killer blows. First set: Osaka* 2-2 Bouzkova (*denotes server): A few questions for Osaka as she slips to 15-30 with a double fault. Bouzkova helps her out with a sloppy error but Osaka returns the favour to face the first break point of the match. She defends it well though, backing up a second serve with a fierce backhand into the corner. Deuce one becomes deuce two after Osaka struggled to read the pace of the court. Australian qualifier Max Purcell told me earlier this week he thought the courts were playing much slower than expected (and slower than he would like). Osaka eventually holds after prevailing in the point of the match so far, drilling a backhand down the line after a long probing rally. This is a fun pub conversation. Pliskova, by a mile, in the women\u2019s for me. Not sure about the men\u2019s. First set: Osaka 1-2 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Osaka wins the first point for a receiver to earn 15-15 after working Bouzkova around the court with some fierce backhands from the baseline. Both players are reasonably conservative in these early exchanges, eschewing the attempted big winners in favour of establishing a rhythm. Osaka looks the more confident during rally situations but slips to 40-15 with a couple of unforced errors but rips a massive forehand return winner to to get back to 40-30. Not that it matters as the following return limps tamely into the net. First set: Osaka* 1-1 Bouzkova (*denotes server): And an even easier hold to to love for Osaka, the defending champion\u2019s serve in fine order early on. First set: Osaka 0-1 Bouzkova* (*denotes server): Easy hold to love for the Czech thanks to Osaka missing her mark on a number of occasions testing out her range. The RLA roof is half-open (or half-closed) in anticipation of the weather to come. It\u2019s cool and overcast. The arena is maybe half full. Naomi Osaka all in white, Marie Bouzkova in a jazzy pink number. This is the first time these two have met in competition. Osaka, 22, the defending champion, seeded three (ranked four now on the WTA rankings) against Bouzkova, 21, ranked 59 in the world. Ok, the action will be underway shortly. Naomi Osaka is just going through some warm-ups in the bowels of Rod Laver Arena, ready to make the walk of champions and out into the spectacular stadium. John Fewings has emailed in, urging players to use their profile to highlight the environmental damage facing Australia as a consequence of the climate emergency. \u201cThe players should be wearing smoke masks and taking advantage of the opportunity to remind Australia\u2019s politicians that they have a duty to finally get their act together!\u201d It\u2019s a tall order. Modern tennis players have become masters at avoiding controversy and operating as CEOs of their own global brands. This promises to be the final sighting of Caroline Wozniacki on court at the Australian Open. The 2018 champion is ready for the next chapter in her life. Host broadcaster Channel 9 is not my spiritual home for sports coverage so this could be a long fortnight. Exhibit A: captioning Grigor Dimitrov as Stan Wawrinka during a filler segment recorded on a red carpet before cutting to adverts. Russell Jackson is on Kyrgios-watch all tournament, and he has set the scene superbly with this tremendous column. There has always been blame on both sides of the Kyrgios \u201cdebate\u201d, such as it is. The Nick knockers veer between sour-faced fogeyism and borderline white supremacy, while the boosters ignore Kyrgios\u2019s worst behaviour and pretend that a basketball jersey is a personality. In the middle somewhere lies an infuriating, funny, petulant, brilliant, inconsistent, even loveable young man, and one less easy to categorise. Novak Djokovic is the king of Melbourne Park. Ash Barty is not in action until later tonight, but as Simon Cambers writes, she is carrying the hopes of the home country on her shoulders. Plenty of preview content to dive into before the action gets underway. And what with her being up first on RLA, perhaps best to kick-off with a lovely feature on the charming and idiosyncratic Naomi Osaka from Tumaini Carayol. When Osaka is not exterminating effortless 100mph forehands, it can be easy to forget how ambitious and driven she is. Away from the courts, Osaka often seems younger than her age. She is funny and eternally honest. She pauses to think before each answer, she tosses in cultural references that invariably lead to errors from the stenographers who aren\u2019t quite knowledgeable in K-pop and memes. Billie Jean King is the best. After a lead-in focussing on the dangerous air quality and the impact that may have on scheduling, you guessed it, the rain has arrived. Melbourne was soaked on Sunday and is braced for more precipitation today. Thundery showers, accompanied by strong southerly winds, are forecast throughout the day, meaning we might not see much action outside the trio of courts with roofs. The rest of the week is classic Melbourne. Tuesday should be cool and dry. Wednesday will be hot and steamy with thunderstorms expected in the late afternoon-evening as fierce northerly winds blow through. That rain could interrupt play during the early part of Thursday too, which will see temperatures back on the mild side. The weekend should be settled, and may be required to host more matches than usual to make up for lost time. Who\u2019d be a scheduler? Here\u2019s a quick rundown of some other names in action that might catch your eye: Court 1573 (the old show court two): If you\u2019re looking for an upset, this could be the court for you. Borna Coric (25) has a tough test against Sam Querrey before Fabio Fognini (12) takes on the new serving king Reilly Opelka. Madison Keys (10) then faces former top-tenner Daria Kasatkina with the action rounded off by Jo Konta (12) against the dangerous Ons Jabeur. Court 3: Australians Lizette Cabrera and Jordan Thompson are in action early. Court 5: This will be wild! Marin Cilic - a former finalist here, but in a stinking run of form - will doubtless have an army of Croatian fans behind him on one of the quirkier outside courts, featuring as it does a row of gum trees among the limited seating. Court 7: Jannik Sinner and Max Purcell have a combined age of just 39 and their contest should be worth watching. Sinner is the recently crowned Next Gen Finals champion while Purcell is your prototypical Australian sportsman. There\u2019s plenty of other interesting names floating around, like Milos Raonic out on court 19, Kyle Edmund v Dusan Lajovic on court 15, and Dan Evans opening up on court 14. Rod Laver Arena: What a line-up for the opening morning of the grand slam season - defending champion Naomi Osaka followed by living legends Serena Williams and Roger Federer. All will expect to progress without alarm based on current form. Margaret Court Arena: Rising Canadian star Denis Shapovalov leads the way on the second stadium court, followed by popular Czech Petra Kvitova. After her comes an odd piece of scheduling. For mine, Venus Williams v Coco Gauff is the match of the opening round but it\u2019s somewhat buried in the schedule. Gauff is the hottest prospect in the sport, Williams a two-time former finalist of immense standing, and they have history after Gauff\u2019s stunning victory at Wimbledon last year. Melbourne Arena: Some home hopes get a run out on the third show court with wildcard Andrew Harris kicking things off against one of the finds of last year, Matteo Berrettini. After they have finished former champion Caroline Wozniacki begins her valedictory campaign, then it\u2019s nearly-man Grigor Dimitrov before Australian veteran Sam Stosur takes on Caty McNally, a player near-enough half her age. Hello everybody and welcome to live rolling coverage of the opening day\u2019s play from the Australian Open. We\u2019ll be with you here all the way until around 7pm Melbourne time, when a separate evening liveblog will kick-off for all the action under lights. Pre-season passes in the blink of an eye on the packed tennis calendar and once again the sport\u2019s superstars are gearing up for grand slam action. It\u2019s been an odd build-up to this year\u2019s event with the relaunched ATP Cup forcing a rejig to preparation for the men, and Melbourne\u2019s dreadful air quality overshadowing AO qualifiers. But the draw has sprinkled this opening day of action with stardust and tournament organisers will be hoping the likes of Roger Federer and Serena Williams will provide some much needed positive attention on an event marketed as the happy slam, but so far struggling to live up to its reputation.

      "body": "<p>The Queensland Nationals MP George Christensen has paid back $2,100 in taxpayer funds after an audit of his travel expenses found he misused entitlements for a domestic flight and government car service charges before travelling overseas.</p> <p>Christensen, who has come under fire for his extensive travel to the Philippines, referred his travel expenses to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA) following reports he had used entitlements to pay for connecting flights to Manila.</p> <p>The IPEA conducted an audit of Christensen\u2019s use of entitlements over a four-year period, looking at domestic travel \u201cwhich preceded or followed non-official international travel\u201d.</p> <p>The audit, released on Monday, found Christensen claimed one domestic flight and one Comcar journey that he should not have, with the IPEA saying it \u201cfailed the dominant purpose test\u201d for taxpayer-funded travel.</p> <p>This resulted in a move by the IPEA to recover $327.28 from Christensen, which included a penalty for wrongly billing the expenses to taxpayers.</p> <p>During the audit, Christensen also voluntarily offered to pay an additional amount of $1,843 for a number of Comcar trips and domestic airfares, meaning he has paid back a total of $2,100.</p> <p>The IPEA looked at 14 travel itineraries, uncovering one in March 2018 that did not comply with the legislation governing MP entitlements, with the audit stating the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of the trip was overseas travel.</p> <p>The authority said that of 12 itineraries governed by previous expenses rules, 10 coincided with committee hearings or parliamentary sittings that were held in locations outside his electorate.</p> <p>Christensen stated that after completing official business, he had to pass through a capital city to return to Mackay, even if he did not return to his home base.</p> <p>The audit said: \u201cIn these instances, Mr Christensen could not recall if any official business was conducted in the capital cities of his embarkation.</p> <p>\u201cIPEA also noted instances where upon entry into Australia after non-official international travel, Mr Christensen also claimed domestic travel expenses from Brisbane to his home base. In these instances, Mr Christensen cited official business, however, he was only able to provide details and evidence in some instances.\u201d</p> <p>The IPEA also suggested that had the new \u201cprinciples-based\u201d framework existed for these 12 itineraries, then more travel may have been non compliant.</p> <p>\u201cAll 12 itineraries in scope for this audit in the pre-1 January 2018 period were found to be compliant with the framework applicable at that time,\u201d the IPEA says.</p> <p>\u201cIPEA notes that while Mr Christensen\u2019s pattern of travel pre-1 January 2018 was compliant, different tests apply for post-1 January 2018. The current framework now requires that the dominant purpose was parliamentary business and that the travel represents value for money.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about the two itineraries that were subject to a new \u201cdominant purpose\u201d test that saw him claim connecting flights from Canberra to Sydney and Brisbane, Christensen said he \u201ccould not recall if parliamentary business was conducted\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe stated that he often conducts meetings with constituents, stakeholder groups, business groups or organisations and that these meetings are not always documented,\u201d the audit found.</p> <p>It said Christensen obtained a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d by not returning to his home base of Mackay, from where he would have had to pay his own way to a point of international departure.</p> <p>Christensen outed himself as the government MP who had come under federal police scrutiny for frequent travel to south-east Asia, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/22/george-christensen-hits-out-at-smear-campaign-over-reports-on-asia-trips\">has suggested he was the target of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The outspoken member for Dawson made 28 trips and spent almost 300 days in the Philippines between 2014 and 2018, where he met his now-wife, April Asuncion.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland Nationals MP George Christensen has paid back $2,100 in taxpayer funds after an audit of his travel expenses found he misused entitlements for a domestic flight and government car service charges before travelling overseas. Christensen, who has come under fire for his extensive travel to the Philippines, referred his travel expenses to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA) following reports he had used entitlements to pay for connecting flights to Manila. The IPEA conducted an audit of Christensen\u2019s use of entitlements over a four-year period, looking at domestic travel \u201cwhich preceded or followed non-official international travel\u201d. The audit, released on Monday, found Christensen claimed one domestic flight and one Comcar journey that he should not have, with the IPEA saying it \u201cfailed the dominant purpose test\u201d for taxpayer-funded travel. This resulted in a move by the IPEA to recover $327.28 from Christensen, which included a penalty for wrongly billing the expenses to taxpayers. During the audit, Christensen also voluntarily offered to pay an additional amount of $1,843 for a number of Comcar trips and domestic airfares, meaning he has paid back a total of $2,100. The IPEA looked at 14 travel itineraries, uncovering one in March 2018 that did not comply with the legislation governing MP entitlements, with the audit stating the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of the trip was overseas travel. The authority said that of 12 itineraries governed by previous expenses rules, 10 coincided with committee hearings or parliamentary sittings that were held in locations outside his electorate. Christensen stated that after completing official business, he had to pass through a capital city to return to Mackay, even if he did not return to his home base. The audit said: \u201cIn these instances, Mr Christensen could not recall if any official business was conducted in the capital cities of his embarkation. \u201cIPEA also noted instances where upon entry into Australia after non-official international travel, Mr Christensen also claimed domestic travel expenses from Brisbane to his home base. In these instances, Mr Christensen cited official business, however, he was only able to provide details and evidence in some instances.\u201d The IPEA also suggested that had the new \u201cprinciples-based\u201d framework existed for these 12 itineraries, then more travel may have been non compliant. \u201cAll 12 itineraries in scope for this audit in the pre-1 January 2018 period were found to be compliant with the framework applicable at that time,\u201d the IPEA says. \u201cIPEA notes that while Mr Christensen\u2019s pattern of travel pre-1 January 2018 was compliant, different tests apply for post-1 January 2018. The current framework now requires that the dominant purpose was parliamentary business and that the travel represents value for money.\u201d When asked about the two itineraries that were subject to a new \u201cdominant purpose\u201d test that saw him claim connecting flights from Canberra to Sydney and Brisbane, Christensen said he \u201ccould not recall if parliamentary business was conducted\u201d. \u201cHe stated that he often conducts meetings with constituents, stakeholder groups, business groups or organisations and that these meetings are not always documented,\u201d the audit found. It said Christensen obtained a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d by not returning to his home base of Mackay, from where he would have had to pay his own way to a point of international departure. Christensen outed himself as the government MP who had come under federal police scrutiny for frequent travel to south-east Asia, but has suggested he was the target of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d. The outspoken member for Dawson made 28 trips and spent almost 300 days in the Philippines between 2014 and 2018, where he met his now-wife, April Asuncion.",

      "body": "<p>I lost my mum to cancer when I was seven. My parents were already divorced and I was living with my mother in Cambridgeshire. When she died, I moved up to Scotland to my dad\u2019s, leaving behind a whole world. But I never properly grieved.</p> <p>Before Mum died, I remember my childhood idyllically. It was a rural upbringing filled with dogs, the outdoors, protection and love. I had many enthusiastic interests, from pirate ships and trains, to Lego and the guitar. I was popular at school and quite daring once I got over my initial shyness.</p> <p>My mother never talked to us about her illness \u2013 indeed she was somewhat in denial of death. So, the morning after she died, when I was told the news, I was wholly unprepared. I remember bawling my eyes out uncontrollably before wanting to go to school \u2013 probably the only way of clinging on to something resembling normality. That day I acted like nothing had happened.</p> <p>For the rest of my childhood, no one really talked to me about her death or how I was coping, and her name was seldom mentioned. In fact, I experienced what seemed like an entire culture \u2013 in family, at school and in the community \u2013 that didn\u2019t know how to talk about death; didn\u2019t express feelings about it and didn\u2019t know what to do with a bereaved child. The prevalent British attitude was to soldier on with a stiff upper-lip, death swept under the carpet. And so my grief became suppressed alongside her memory. But the agony I felt from losing her stayed deep within me, dangerously coiled like a spring that was then built over with layer upon layer of obscuring protection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2afb4db9a2b48486653717c423956acd3da80ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2afb4db9a2b48486653717c423956acd3da80ff/113_67_840_1075/781.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas MacGregor\u2019s mother, who died when he was seven\" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas MacGregor\u2019s mother, who died when he was seven.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Douglas MacGregor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wasn\u2019t even aware that I hadn\u2019t grieved. I just thought sadness was a part of me, a bottomless well that would always be there. Up in Scotland, I struggled to fit in. As I grew up, I never found an identity or a direction in life and I was unable to form romantic relationships. I had some sort of hidden internal breaks to any commitment in life, which left me rudderless and adrift.</p> <p>At 31, I finally admitted that something was wrong and arranged to see a therapist, ostensibly about my lack of direction in life. A few hours before the appointment, I caught my reflection in a mirror and it suddenly dawned on me after 25 years that I missed my mum terribly. Then came a flood of intense waves of grief as strong as if my mum had died the night before. Yet, this confusing knot of emotions had formed over the past two decades. All at once, I processed her illness, mourned her death, lamented my lost potential, and cried for my A-level results day along with every other big moment she had missed.</p> <p>This was the start of two years spent finding my way through a labyrinth of emotional turmoil. As a composer, I turned to music to cope with and process the experience. My mum loved classical music, the Beatles and Bruce Springsteen.

      "bodyText": "I lost my mum to cancer when I was seven. My parents were already divorced and I was living with my mother in Cambridgeshire. When she died, I moved up to Scotland to my dad\u2019s, leaving behind a whole world. But I never properly grieved. Before Mum died, I remember my childhood idyllically. It was a rural upbringing filled with dogs, the outdoors, protection and love. I had many enthusiastic interests, from pirate ships and trains, to Lego and the guitar. I was popular at school and quite daring once I got over my initial shyness. My mother never talked to us about her illness \u2013 indeed she was somewhat in denial of death. So, the morning after she died, when I was told the news, I was wholly unprepared. I remember bawling my eyes out uncontrollably before wanting to go to school \u2013 probably the only way of clinging on to something resembling normality. That day I acted like nothing had happened. For the rest of my childhood, no one really talked to me about her death or how I was coping, and her name was seldom mentioned. In fact, I experienced what seemed like an entire culture \u2013 in family, at school and in the community \u2013 that didn\u2019t know how to talk about death; didn\u2019t express feelings about it and didn\u2019t know what to do with a bereaved child. The prevalent British attitude was to soldier on with a stiff upper-lip, death swept under the carpet. And so my grief became suppressed alongside her memory. But the agony I felt from losing her stayed deep within me, dangerously coiled like a spring that was then built over with layer upon layer of obscuring protection. I wasn\u2019t even aware that I hadn\u2019t grieved. I just thought sadness was a part of me, a bottomless well that would always be there. Up in Scotland, I struggled to fit in. As I grew up, I never found an identity or a direction in life and I was unable to form romantic relationships. I had some sort of hidden internal breaks to any commitment in life, which left me rudderless and adrift. At 31, I finally admitted that something was wrong and arranged to see a therapist, ostensibly about my lack of direction in life. A few hours before the appointment, I caught my reflection in a mirror and it suddenly dawned on me after 25 years that I missed my mum terribly. Then came a flood of intense waves of grief as strong as if my mum had died the night before. Yet, this confusing knot of emotions had formed over the past two decades. All at once, I processed her illness, mourned her death, lamented my lost potential, and cried for my A-level results day along with every other big moment she had missed. This was the start of two years spent finding my way through a labyrinth of emotional turmoil. As a composer, I turned to music to cope with and process the experience. My mum loved classical music, the Beatles and Bruce Springsteen. After I had been jumping around the house for months, pretending to play along to Born in the USA, she got me a real guitar for my seventh birthday \u2013 the last present she ever gave me. I forgot about that guitar for years, but eventually came back to the instrument as a teenager and started writing songs. Looking back, my music had always somehow expressed my inner sorrow, even if it was unknowingly. But as I got closer and closer to the tipping point, it had become ever more introspective, circling in on grief. I had hidden my grief behind the idea that art was for art\u2019s sake only. Dropping that pretence and giving myself permission to grieve unashamedly through music was what ultimately freed me from my sadness. Music became my place to grieve.

As I type, they are busy turning our street into a low-traffic, communal <em>woonerf</em> or \u2018living street\u2019. It has become easier and safer to navigate the town on foot or by bike. Having recently returned from the Middle East the changes are even more striking, especially when it comes to my son.

In town I use the bicycle and it makes me happy. There are some negatives though.

      "bodyText": "Birmingham \u2013 once, proudly, the UK\u2019s \u201cmotorway city\u201d \u2013 has announced plans to entice people out of cars and on to bikes and buses. If officials get their way, the city will be split into zones, and, rather than driving direct, motorists will have to use the ring road for all zone-to-zone journeys. Those travelling by foot and bicycle in the new Brum won\u2019t be inconvenienced: their journeys will be simple and \u2013 with fewer cars \u2013 safer. With cars out of the way, bus journeys will become swifter and more reliable. The Birmingham transport plan, launched last week, was influenced by Ghent\u2019s zone-centred traffic circulation plan of 2017. This medieval Belgian city \u2013 a quarter of the size of Birmingham \u2013 demonstrated that it was possible to switch attitudes overnight. Streets were blocked to motorists one Sunday evening and \u2013 to the disappointment of the waiting media \u2013there was no wailing, no gnashing of teeth, no gridlock. Motorists have since found that, while their journeys are longer in distance, they take less time because there are fewer fellow travellers on the roads. Motor vehicles used to make up 55% of trips in Ghent \u2013 that number has now fallen to 27%. Retailers and restaurants that had warned of Armageddon discovered that takings did not plummet. \u201cActually the economic situation has improved,\u201d says the Green politician who led what had been controversial changes. Filip Watteeuw, deputy mayor of Ghent, points out there \u201chas been a 17% increase in restaurant and bar startups, and the number of empty shops has been arrested\u201d. A year after the imposition of the traffic circulation plan \u2013 in news that may encourage similarly minded politicians around the world, Watteeuw was re-elected with an increased majority. Another advantage of the intervention is that it is remarkably cheap to implement; Ghent\u2019s plan cost just \u20ac4m (\u00a33.4m) to implement. By comparison it costs an estimated \u00a320m-\u00a330m to build just one mile of motorway. \u201c[A city\u2019s] best car plan is a bike plan,\u201d he said. \u201cProviding more space for walking and cycling leads not only to more people walking and cycling, it also makes space for people who really need to use their cars.\u201d A great deal of Ghent\u2019s traffic congestion was found to have been caused by an excess of short car journeys \u2013 as planners had accurately modelled. \u201cWe had people complaining that a drive of 300 metres became a car journey of two kilometres,\u201d remembers Watteeuw. \u201cWe had to explain that we don\u2019t want people to use a car for 300 metres: they should walk.\u201d In Birmingham 25% of car journeys are one mile or less.

It\u2019s expensive, unpopular \u2013 and doesn\u2019t work. \u201cWe need to look at ways of keeping the city moving in a sustainable and efficient way,\u201d says Jones.

Businesses will be incentivised to remove parking spaces through the introduction of an annual \u00a3500 per space workplace parking levy, and the city will build 12,800 new homes on former car parks. \u201cValuable land in short supply [should be] used in the most productive way possible,\u201d the council says in its 36-page plan. \u201cReducing pressure on kerb space\u201d will \u201cprovide improved penetration and accessibility by public transport in the city centre,\u201d promises the plan. \u201cPublic transport and cycling provision will be prioritised over car parking provision.\u201d The \u201callocation of road space will change away from single occupancy private cars,\u201d the council says, because the priority should be \u201cmoving people, not vehicles\u201d. Freight deliveries will be restricted to out-of-hours, and there will be a blanket 20mph speed limit across the city\u2019s local roads. Birmingham must \u201cbuild a future in which the car will no longer be king\u201d, says Waseem Zaffar, the city council cabinet member for transport and environment. Cars, he adds, are \u201cbad for the health of ourselves and our families, bad for our communities and bad for business as measured by the millions of pounds of lost productivity caused by congestion\u201d. Watteeuw advises Birmingham\u2019s councillors not to stagger any changes. \u201cIn Ghent, we implemented the plan as a whole overnight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was technically and politically the easiest way.\u201d The Birmingham transport plan goes out to public consultation soon.

      "body": "<p>There are two key problems with books that attempt to be objective about illegal drugs. The first is that for the most part their authors won\u2019t admit to having used such substances for fear their own objectivity may be compromised. The second follows fairly logically from the first: who, precisely, are such books aimed at? If they are targeted at readers who already have a consuming interest in drugs (pun intended), then they are very likely \u2013 by definition \u2013 to know rather more about the subject than the author; and if they are for people who only have a tangential interest in the subject, why should they want to read about it at all? True, there may be such a thing as a \u201cgateway\u201d book about drugs that leads people deeper and deeper into compulsive reading about the subject, but I suspect neither of these titles will fulfil that role, no matter how vulnerable the reader is to literary addiction.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/antonyloewenstein\" title=\"\">Antony Loewenstein</a> never explicitly says that he hasn\u2019t used drugs in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pills-powder-and-smoke-9781912854240.html\" title=\"\"><em>Pills, Powder</em><em> and Smoke</em></a>, but nor does he ever indicate that he has. The personal information we gather about him is that he is something of an ingenue when it comes to the messy business of reportage in compromised and difficult environments. In the Philippines, where President Duterte\u2019s government has conducted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/08/rodrigo-dutertes-drug-war-is-large-scale-murdering-enterprise-says-amnesty\" title=\"\">a \u201cdirty war\u201d</a> against drug users and dealers for some years now (it\u2019s claimed anything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/dutertes-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-above-5000\" title=\"\">between 5,000 and 20,000 lives</a> have been lost), Loewenstein sees the corpse of a man who has been gunned down by the police: \u201cIt was the first dead body I had ever seen, apart from that of a deceased relative. I felt fascinated and sickened, wondering if I was a vulture for taking so many photos.\u201d No need to wonder, Antony, you were.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why not visit Mexico? Or one of the major South American coca producers? Or Afghanistan?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Loewenstein is trying to give a grand survey of the contemporary, global \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, but his choice of locations seems a little off kilter. The Philippines are certainly worth covering, as would be one of the major drugs trans-shipment locations for the South American cartels and European mafias that control the global trade. But Loewenstein goes to two: Honduras and Guinea-Bissau. Ditto, he visits and surveys three western countries\u2019 drug policies \u2013 the US, Australia and Britain \u2013 despite opining that, really, the States has always been the sniffer dog wagging the other two nations\u2019 tails when it comes to prohibition.</p> <p>So why not visit Mexico, that Pandora\u2019s box of a nation, out of which have come all the misfortunes of its northern neighbour? (At least according to American politicians.) Or one of the major South American coca producers, for that matter \u2013 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan\" title=\"\">Afghanistan</a>, the narco-state that has played the most significant role in providing western governments\u2019 military-industrial complexes with their raison d\u2019\u00eatre?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3748c3d7f6de2dedd61494f0a87dbf2a5b47a7c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3748c3d7f6de2dedd61494f0a87dbf2a5b47a7c7/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antony Loewenstein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antony Loewenstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to the dirty wars waged by the US Drug Enforcement Agency, which, after 9/11, created a fictitious bogeyman called \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d to partner \u201cIslamofascism\u201d as a casus belli, Loewenstein gives a thorough and convincing picture of an utterly failed policy, driven by racism, neoimperialism and mere professional closure on the part of politicians and police. But right-thinking people knew the war on drugs was futile years ago, didn\u2019t they? The very name gives the game away, for how can a war against an inanimate object ever be won?</p> <p>For my part, I remember writing a feature on illegal drugs in Britain in the early 1990s, wherein I interviewed the then head of illegal drug interdiction for the NCIS (National Criminal Intelligence Service), who candidly admitted it was a waste of time and money trying to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the UK. Nowadays, it\u2019s the Association of Chief Police Officers that is infinitely more radical than the political class \u2013 for its members see the dire consequences of criminalising drug users every day, in the form of ever more violent subcultures.</p> <p>In Britain, Loewenstein hangs out with sex workers in Newcastle, a homeless man next to King\u2019s Cross station and interviews a trio of the usual reformist suspects: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Dr David Nutt</a>, the government drugs tsar who was sacked for saying taking ecstasy was less dangerous than riding a horse; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/10/amanda-feilding-lsd-can-reset-the-brain-interview\" title=\"\">Amanda \u201chole in the head\u201d Fielding</a>, who runs the Beckley Foundation for research into psychedelic drugs; and the head of Imperial College\u2019s new centre for psychedelic research, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/03/will-by-will-self-drugs-memoir-autobiography-book-review\">Will by Will Self review \u2013 portrait of the author\u2019s younger Self</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as in his reporting on the drug wars where he takes his lead from the likes of writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/26/man-who-exposed-lie-war-on-drugs-roberto-saviano-ed-vulliamy\" title=\"\">Roberto Saviano</a>, whose <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/zero-zero-zero-9781846147708.html\" title=\"\"><em>Zero</em><em> Zero</em><em> Zero</em></a> exhaustively chronicles who kills whom, and Jeremy Harding, whose superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/16/border-vigils-jeremy-harding-review\" title=\"\"><em>Border Vigils</em></a> correctly sites prohibitionism in the suite of anti-migrant measures adopted by the west, so in his reporting on harm minimisation, and the possible benefits of using (at least some) drugs, Loewenstein follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/12/michael-pollan-reluctant-psychonanaut-psychedelic-drugs-how-to-change-your-mind\" title=\"\">Michael Pollan</a>, whose <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-change-your-mind-9780141985138.html\" title=\"\"><em>How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics</em></a> has the virtue of being written by an author who admits to turning on and tuning in \u2013 if not dropping out.</p> <p>On page 304 of her exhaustive survey of psychoactive drugs, Suzi Gage writes: \u201cI would not encourage anyone to take any of the substances mentioned here.\u201d Which, following what I\u2019ve written already, invites the question: who is this book aimed at?

      "bodyText": "There are two key problems with books that attempt to be objective about illegal drugs. The first is that for the most part their authors won\u2019t admit to having used such substances for fear their own objectivity may be compromised. The second follows fairly logically from the first: who, precisely, are such books aimed at? If they are targeted at readers who already have a consuming interest in drugs (pun intended), then they are very likely \u2013 by definition \u2013 to know rather more about the subject than the author; and if they are for people who only have a tangential interest in the subject, why should they want to read about it at all? True, there may be such a thing as a \u201cgateway\u201d book about drugs that leads people deeper and deeper into compulsive reading about the subject, but I suspect neither of these titles will fulfil that role, no matter how vulnerable the reader is to literary addiction. Antony Loewenstein never explicitly says that he hasn\u2019t used drugs in Pills, Powder and Smoke, but nor does he ever indicate that he has. The personal information we gather about him is that he is something of an ingenue when it comes to the messy business of reportage in compromised and difficult environments. In the Philippines, where President Duterte\u2019s government has conducted a \u201cdirty war\u201d against drug users and dealers for some years now (it\u2019s claimed anything between 5,000 and 20,000 lives have been lost), Loewenstein sees the corpse of a man who has been gunned down by the police: \u201cIt was the first dead body I had ever seen, apart from that of a deceased relative. I felt fascinated and sickened, wondering if I was a vulture for taking so many photos.\u201d No need to wonder, Antony, you were. Loewenstein is trying to give a grand survey of the contemporary, global \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, but his choice of locations seems a little off kilter. The Philippines are certainly worth covering, as would be one of the major drugs trans-shipment locations for the South American cartels and European mafias that control the global trade. But Loewenstein goes to two: Honduras and Guinea-Bissau. Ditto, he visits and surveys three western countries\u2019 drug policies \u2013 the US, Australia and Britain \u2013 despite opining that, really, the States has always been the sniffer dog wagging the other two nations\u2019 tails when it comes to prohibition. So why not visit Mexico, that Pandora\u2019s box of a nation, out of which have come all the misfortunes of its northern neighbour? (At least according to American politicians.) Or one of the major South American coca producers, for that matter \u2013 or Afghanistan, the narco-state that has played the most significant role in providing western governments\u2019 military-industrial complexes with their raison d\u2019\u00eatre? When it comes to the dirty wars waged by the US Drug Enforcement Agency, which, after 9/11, created a fictitious bogeyman called \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d to partner \u201cIslamofascism\u201d as a casus belli, Loewenstein gives a thorough and convincing picture of an utterly failed policy, driven by racism, neoimperialism and mere professional closure on the part of politicians and police. But right-thinking people knew the war on drugs was futile years ago, didn\u2019t they? The very name gives the game away, for how can a war against an inanimate object ever be won? For my part, I remember writing a feature on illegal drugs in Britain in the early 1990s, wherein I interviewed the then head of illegal drug interdiction for the NCIS (National Criminal Intelligence Service), who candidly admitted it was a waste of time and money trying to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the UK. Nowadays, it\u2019s the Association of Chief Police Officers that is infinitely more radical than the political class \u2013 for its members see the dire consequences of criminalising drug users every day, in the form of ever more violent subcultures. In Britain, Loewenstein hangs out with sex workers in Newcastle, a homeless man next to King\u2019s Cross station and interviews a trio of the usual reformist suspects: Dr David Nutt, the government drugs tsar who was sacked for saying taking ecstasy was less dangerous than riding a horse; Amanda \u201chole in the head\u201d Fielding, who runs the Beckley Foundation for research into psychedelic drugs; and the head of Imperial College\u2019s new centre for psychedelic research, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris. Just as in his reporting on the drug wars where he takes his lead from the likes of writers Roberto Saviano, whose Zero Zero Zero exhaustively chronicles who kills whom, and Jeremy Harding, whose superb Border Vigils correctly sites prohibitionism in the suite of anti-migrant measures adopted by the west, so in his reporting on harm minimisation, and the possible benefits of using (at least some) drugs, Loewenstein follows Michael Pollan, whose How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics has the virtue of being written by an author who admits to turning on and tuning in \u2013 if not dropping out. On page 304 of her exhaustive survey of psychoactive drugs, Suzi Gage writes: \u201cI would not encourage anyone to take any of the substances mentioned here.\u201d Which, following what I\u2019ve written already, invites the question: who is this book aimed at? True, Gage deals with legal as well as illegal drugs and for the most part \u2013 saving her rather coy little autobiographical asides \u2013 this is a competent survey. But people who take drugs tend to know a lot about them \u2013 that\u2019s what a drug culture is: a vector carrying information not usually, by definition, disseminated in the media. I reached page 50 of Say Why to Drugs before I learned anything new \u2013 and this was only that the somniferous herb valerian is not in any way related to the addictive benzodiazepine, Valium. Elsewhere, Gage \u2013 was she driven by nominative determinism to take up her calling as a drugs specialist? (gage being American slang for marijuana) \u2013 is less impressive, not seeming to be aware that cocaine is soluble (for injecting purposes) in water or that cannabis is a psychedelic. In common with many drugs specialists, she wants the latter to be in a class of its own, but this reflects its ubiquity rather than its pharmacology.

      "body": "<p>The Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds are the follow-ups to some of the best Bluetooth earbuds of 2018, but now smaller, lighter and longer-lasting.</p> <p>A lot has changed in the world of true wireless earbuds since 2018. Competition is fierce with many good options, but few still manage the perfect combination of comfort, connectivity, case and sound.</p> <p>The new \u00a3170 Elite 75t promise to pick up where their Elite 65t predecessors left off: a cross-platform basic AirPod beater.</p> <h2>Smaller and more comfortable</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bef78c2b008794d369d6110331a61e447889fce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef78c2b008794d369d6110331a61e447889fce1/592_881_2983_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jabra Elite 75t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The earbuds have small charging contacts on the back, a traditional silicone earbud tip and a physical button on the outside for controls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Elite 75t correct one of the biggest problems with previous Jabra earbuds simply by being 20% smaller. The 5.5g earbuds fit much more comfortably, with a shape that slots into the concha and manages to avoid pressing on any of the soft bits of the ear. They are still not quite as small and form-fitting as Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds, but they are as comfortable over extended periods. I never once thought they would fall out.</p> <p>The case, too, is small and compact, magnetically locking the earbuds in place and fitting into the money pocket of a set of jeans. Given it\u2019s easy to lose an earbud, having a pocketable case you can carry around with you to immediately store them away safely is essential.</p> <p>The case is made of a hard, smooth plastic that\u2019s fairly easy to mark. But it\u2019s only 35g and is charged via the newer USB-C standard, which is a bonus. It takes two hours 20 minutes to fully charge the case via a regular computer USB-port, or faster using a more powerful USB charger.</p> <p>The earbuds might be smaller than their predecessors, but they last longer per charge: just over 7.5 hours of continuous playback during my testing. The case will charge them more than 2.5 times too, making up to 28 hours of battery life all-in, which is longer than most similarly-sized competitors. A 15-minute quick-charge in the case will also give the earbuds enough battery power for about an hour of playback.</p> <p>Neither the <a href=\"https://www.jabra.co.uk/supportpages/jabra-elite-75t/100-99090000-60/faq/Best-practices-for-charging-and-storing-rechargeable-batteries#/\">battery in the case nor the earbuds is replaceable</a>, which ultimately means they are disposable, but they should last several years of daily use at least.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP55 (sweat/dust)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC</p></li> <li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> 7.5 hours listening, up to 28 hours with case</p></li> <li><p><strong>Earbud weight:</strong> 5.5g</p></li> <li><p><strong>Charging case dimensions:</strong> 62.4 x 36.6 x 27 mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Charging case weight:</strong> 35g</p></li> <li><p><strong>Case charging:</strong> USB-C, 2 hours 20 minutes full charge</p></li> </ul> <h2>Connectivity and controls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fdd964e1048cecb3ceb85d9967cecfb355418e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fdd964e1048cecb3ceb85d9967cecfb355418e2/663_767_3584_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jabra Elite 75t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The case is made of hard, smooth black plastic and readily fits into the money pocket of a pair of jeans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jabra was one of the first tech companies to solve the issue of a stable Bluetooth connection for true wireless earbuds. The Elite 75t are no different, with a rock-solid, skip-free connection with a large range of devices. They support Bluetooth 5, will pair with up to eight devices and connect to two simultaneously. But unlike other earbuds such as Apple\u2019s AirPods and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds, only the right earbud can be used separately as it alone connects to the phone sending the audio across your head to the left earbud. Jabra said an update allowing this and customised hearing profiles is due in the second quarter of 2020.</p> <p>Bluetooth audio format support is also limited to the standard SBC and AAC, which is perfectly fine for Apple devices that only support AAC at best, but a lack of the higher-quality aptX or similar formats is disappointing for Windows and Android users.</p> <p>The Elite 75t only suffer from a few minor lipsync issues, where the audio lags behind video, when watching things like YouTube in a browser on a PC and with games on a phone \u2013 something most Bluetooth earbuds still suffer from. Other video apps on both Android and iOS were fine.</p> <p>Call quality was good with recipients describing my voice as clear with a little bit of echo, although the earbuds allowed significant amounts of background noise into the call. The Elite 75t also have the option of sidetone, allowing you to hear your own voice and gauge how loud you are speaking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e031a7595114df1de8ba40ad8ad54c174a7c95a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e031a7595114df1de8ba40ad8ad54c174a7c95a/539_545_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jabra Elite 75t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jabra Sound+ app shows you battery levels, updates the firmware, changes settings and helps you find your earbuds if you lose them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each earbud has one button. Press the right button once to pause/play or twice for Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant. Press the left button once to activate hear-through allowing you to hear the outside world (and optionally mutes the music), twice to skip forward and thrice to skip backwards. Pressing and holding turns down the volume on the left and up on the right. Taking one earbud out pauses the music and plays again when reinserted within 60 seconds.</p> <p>All the controls work well and the buttons themselves are some of the best I\u2019ve used on an earbud: good click feeling while being soft enough to press without driving the earbud further into your ear, but firm enough that they are not activated accidentally by putting on a woolly hat.</p> <h2>Sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd746dfec1062c513e6e5e095a6170250de7969e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd746dfec1062c513e6e5e095a6170250de7969e/740_540_3514_2109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jabra Elite 75t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Elite 75t have a little too much bass, which is novel for a set of earbuds. A quick tweak in the equaliser brought out a much more rounded and enjoyable sound.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hear-through ambient listening mode is fairly natural-sounding, allowing you to have conversations if you so wish, but I found it most useful for a bit of awareness when crossing roads or listening out for announcements. It does not activate automatically on pause, which is a shame.</p> <p>The Elite 75t are some of the better-sounding earbuds available but don\u2019t quite live up to the sonic highs of Sony\u2019s WF-1000M3, unless you love bass. By default they have real, thumping, almost overpowering bass, which will please those looking for deep bass lines. It was a bit much for me, drowning out the midrange and highs, but thankfully the earbuds come with a really good equaliser. After reducing the bass a little, they sounded good, with a pleasing, well-rounded and warm tone.</p> <p>The earbuds don\u2019t offer noise cancelling, but are relatively effective at passively isolating you from the world with a solid selection of traditional silicone tips and standard attachment that will take third-party tips, which is good as one of the supplied ones split when removing it from the earbud.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e97dd7baf606759d14d417075120c93ec8434492\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e97dd7baf606759d14d417075120c93ec8434492/1144_562_2740_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jabra Elite 75t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The case is very pocketable with earbuds and lid held firmly in place by magnets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>You can activate voice assistants on a computer just like you can on a smartphone, with a double press of the right earbud button</p></li> <li><p>You can see the battery life of each earbud and the case in the Jabra Sound+ app on your phone</p></li> <li><p>You can switch the voice assistant to Alexa</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Jabra Elite 75t cost <a href=\"https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-75t\">\u00a3169.99</a> in titanium grey or gold beige.</p> <p>They will also be available in <a href=\"https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-active-75t\">an \u201cActive\u201d version</a> with increased water resistance to IP57 for \u00a3189.99 at the end of February.</p> <p>For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Buds cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NLLLXNX\">\u00a3109</a>, Apple AirPods cost <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MV7N2ZM/A/airpods-with-charging-case\">\u00a3159</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/09/airpods-pro-review-a-touch-of-apple-magic\">AirPods Pro</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWP22ZM/A/airpods-pro\">\u00a3249</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/libratone-track-air-review-the-noise-cancelling-airpods-apple-wont-give-you\">Libratone Track Air+</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SP524XM/\">\u00a3167</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">Sony WF-1000XM3</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-nfc-in-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote/black/p4237421\">\u00a3179</a>, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost <a href=\"https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/truewireless-details\">\u00a3280</a>, the B&amp;O E8 2.0 cost <a href=\"https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/earphones/beoplay-e8\">\u00a3300</a>, and the Master &amp; Dynamic MW07 cost <a href=\"https://www.masterdynamic.co.uk/products/mw07-true-wireless-earphones\">\u00a3229</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Jabra Elite 75t are very good true wireless Bluetooth earbuds, combining a small and pretty comfortable fit, with a pocketable case and long battery life.</p> <p>They sound good, particularly if you love your bass \u2013 those looking for more balanced sound will need to dive into the equaliser or look elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "The Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds are the follow-ups to some of the best Bluetooth earbuds of 2018, but now smaller, lighter and longer-lasting. A lot has changed in the world of true wireless earbuds since 2018. Competition is fierce with many good options, but few still manage the perfect combination of comfort, connectivity, case and sound. The new \u00a3170 Elite 75t promise to pick up where their Elite 65t predecessors left off: a cross-platform basic AirPod beater. Smaller and more comfortable The Elite 75t correct one of the biggest problems with previous Jabra earbuds simply by being 20% smaller. The 5.5g earbuds fit much more comfortably, with a shape that slots into the concha and manages to avoid pressing on any of the soft bits of the ear. They are still not quite as small and form-fitting as Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds, but they are as comfortable over extended periods. I never once thought they would fall out. The case, too, is small and compact, magnetically locking the earbuds in place and fitting into the money pocket of a set of jeans. Given it\u2019s easy to lose an earbud, having a pocketable case you can carry around with you to immediately store them away safely is essential. The case is made of a hard, smooth plastic that\u2019s fairly easy to mark. But it\u2019s only 35g and is charged via the newer USB-C standard, which is a bonus. It takes two hours 20 minutes to fully charge the case via a regular computer USB-port, or faster using a more powerful USB charger. The earbuds might be smaller than their predecessors, but they last longer per charge: just over 7.5 hours of continuous playback during my testing. The case will charge them more than 2.5 times too, making up to 28 hours of battery life all-in, which is longer than most similarly-sized competitors. A 15-minute quick-charge in the case will also give the earbuds enough battery power for about an hour of playback. Neither the battery in the case nor the earbuds is replaceable, which ultimately means they are disposable, but they should last several years of daily use at least. Specifications Water resistance: IP55 (sweat/dust) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC Battery life: 7.5 hours listening, up to 28 hours with case Earbud weight: 5.5g Charging case dimensions: 62.4 x 36.6 x 27 mm Charging case weight: 35g Case charging: USB-C, 2 hours 20 minutes full charge Connectivity and controls Jabra was one of the first tech companies to solve the issue of a stable Bluetooth connection for true wireless earbuds. The Elite 75t are no different, with a rock-solid, skip-free connection with a large range of devices. They support Bluetooth 5, will pair with up to eight devices and connect to two simultaneously. But unlike other earbuds such as Apple\u2019s AirPods and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds, only the right earbud can be used separately as it alone connects to the phone sending the audio across your head to the left earbud. Jabra said an update allowing this and customised hearing profiles is due in the second quarter of 2020. Bluetooth audio format support is also limited to the standard SBC and AAC, which is perfectly fine for Apple devices that only support AAC at best, but a lack of the higher-quality aptX or similar formats is disappointing for Windows and Android users. The Elite 75t only suffer from a few minor lipsync issues, where the audio lags behind video, when watching things like YouTube in a browser on a PC and with games on a phone \u2013 something most Bluetooth earbuds still suffer from. Other video apps on both Android and iOS were fine. Call quality was good with recipients describing my voice as clear with a little bit of echo, although the earbuds allowed significant amounts of background noise into the call. The Elite 75t also have the option of sidetone, allowing you to hear your own voice and gauge how loud you are speaking. Each earbud has one button. Press the right button once to pause/play or twice for Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant. Press the left button once to activate hear-through allowing you to hear the outside world (and optionally mutes the music), twice to skip forward and thrice to skip backwards. Pressing and holding turns down the volume on the left and up on the right. Taking one earbud out pauses the music and plays again when reinserted within 60 seconds. All the controls work well and the buttons themselves are some of the best I\u2019ve used on an earbud: good click feeling while being soft enough to press without driving the earbud further into your ear, but firm enough that they are not activated accidentally by putting on a woolly hat. Sound The hear-through ambient listening mode is fairly natural-sounding, allowing you to have conversations if you so wish, but I found it most useful for a bit of awareness when crossing roads or listening out for announcements. It does not activate automatically on pause, which is a shame. The Elite 75t are some of the better-sounding earbuds available but don\u2019t quite live up to the sonic highs of Sony\u2019s WF-1000M3, unless you love bass. By default they have real, thumping, almost overpowering bass, which will please those looking for deep bass lines. It was a bit much for me, drowning out the midrange and highs, but thankfully the earbuds come with a really good equaliser. After reducing the bass a little, they sounded good, with a pleasing, well-rounded and warm tone. The earbuds don\u2019t offer noise cancelling, but are relatively effective at passively isolating you from the world with a solid selection of traditional silicone tips and standard attachment that will take third-party tips, which is good as one of the supplied ones split when removing it from the earbud. Observations You can activate voice assistants on a computer just like you can on a smartphone, with a double press of the right earbud button You can see the battery life of each earbud and the case in the Jabra Sound+ app on your phone You can switch the voice assistant to Alexa Price The Jabra Elite 75t cost \u00a3169.99 in titanium grey or gold beige. They will also be available in an \u201cActive\u201d version with increased water resistance to IP57 for \u00a3189.99 at the end of February. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Buds cost \u00a3109, Apple AirPods cost \u00a3159, the AirPods Pro cost \u00a3249, the Libratone Track Air+ cost \u00a3167, Sony WF-1000XM3 cost \u00a3179, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost \u00a3280, the B&amp;O E8 2.0 cost \u00a3300, and the Master &amp; Dynamic MW07 cost \u00a3229. Verdict The Jabra Elite 75t are very good true wireless Bluetooth earbuds, combining a small and pretty comfortable fit, with a pocketable case and long battery life. They sound good, particularly if you love your bass \u2013 those looking for more balanced sound will need to dive into the equaliser or look elsewhere. The buttons for controls, including volume, are also first-rate, while connectivity was solid, as was call quality. You can only use the right earbud independently at the moment, and they only support AAC as their highest audio format \u2013 not aptX or higher quality codecs available on Android and Windows. But there are two things that hold them back against the competition. They only offer passive noise isolation, not active noise cancelling, which is quickly becoming the benchmark, and at \u00a3170 they are undercut by a large range of equally good and significantly cheaper competitors. If you want a solid set of true wireless earbuds that work just as well with Android and Windows as they do with an iPhone, iPad or Mac, then the Elite 75t are worth considering, particularly on a deal. Pros: long battery life, excellent case, good eq, lots of bass, comfortable, great buttons, good controls, good ambient mode, solid connection, minimal lag Cons: left cannot be used on its own, no aptX, no replaceable batteries, no wireless charging, no active noise cancellation, bit expensive compared to similar competition Other reviews Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked AirPods Pro review: a touch of Apple magic Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple\u2019s fitness AirPods rock Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won\u2019t give you Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great",

They are just one example from a long series of extreme weather events in 2019, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/11/cyclone-bulbul-deaths-millions-displaced-india-bangladesh\">cyclones in India and Bangladesh</a> that displaced more than three million people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/cyclone-idai-caused-2bn-of-damage-and-affected-millions-says-world-bank\">Cyclone Idai</a>, which killed more than 1,000 people in southern Africa, floods that displaced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/world/middleeast/iran-floods-evacuations.html\">tens of thousands of people in Iran</a>, and entire townships laid to waste by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-dorian\">Hurricane Dorian</a> in the Bahamas. The year ended with reports of record rates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/07/oceans-demise-the-end-of-the-arctic-as-we-know-it\">Arctic ice melt</a> that, through positive feedback effects, are likely to intensify climate heating and impact the future of humanity.</p> <p>In the face of global catastrophe, it\u2019s hard not to feel daunted.

I was a child of the 1980s and a teenager in the 90s: my formative years were during something like the most individualistic age in history. While I learned times tables at primary school, Margaret Thatcher was telling the nation there was no such thing as society. During my teenage years, product advertising and globalisation brought a new age of hyper-consumerism, as we were bombarded with education programmes to build self-esteem and TV shows such as Big Brother, The X Factor and The Apprentice<em>,</em> which all glorified self-aggrandisement in subtly different ways.</p> <p>Developing human minds are like sponges and ours were submerged in ever more individualistic language. Phrases such as \u201cunique\u201d, \u201cpersonal\u201d, \u201cself\u201d, \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d were used with increasing frequency in lyrics, TV shows and books.

In the last decade, we may have seen individualism peak. Scientific discoveries have revealed how the perception of a distinct self is an illusion. Our bodies are made from materials that were once parts of countless other organisms, from ancient plants to dinosaurs. Most of our 37tn cells are directed by a genetic code that is a shared heritage not just of humanity but all of life on Earth.

And the new science of social networks shows how we are linked together so closely that ideas, behaviours and preferences flow between us in a way that makes it unclear where one mind ends and another begins.</p> <p>And people are finding new value in being part of groups, whether it is through activism (Extinction Rebellion, youth strikes, political party memberships) or leisure activities (book clubs,<strong> </strong>festivals, park runs). New research shows that when people have a broader sense of group identity (for example viewing themselves as global citizens, rather than embracing nationalism), they tend to be <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00813/full\">more likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviours</a>, such as reducing their carbon emissions, buying sustainably and volunteering. A new age of collectivism seems to be dawning \u2013 and not a moment too soon.</p> <p>So what can be done to make people truly embrace being part of a group? In answering this question, it is worth bearing in mind that the evolutionary history of our brains means we are susceptible to certain biases. When populations face shocks such as environmental catastrophe or social unrest, they are more likely to strengthen bonds between their \u201cin-group\u201d members, while caring less about those outside of the group. This is a defence mechanism to help groups pull together and overcome hardship. Social research has shown that <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1100\">it operates at the country level</a>, too \u2013 countries facing crises are <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221953\">more likely to show prejudice towards outsiders and elect authoritarian leaders</a>. Environmental catastrophes are only expected to worsen under climate change, which means nationalism could grow purely due to this evolutionary bias. Yet, is this a sensible response?</p> <p>In 2020, we live in a highly globalised world, with cross-border flows of money and people, as well as environmental impacts such as the climate crisis and air pollution. If we bond together within nations but with less regard for the welfare of others beyond those borders, we will end up fouling the global commons, ultimately to our own detriment.</p> <p>Yet there is hope. New research shows how we can escape individualism. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-018-0542-9\">Outdoor community activities</a> increase both our psychological connectedness to others and to the natural world. Escape cities to go for a walk with family or friends, or volunteer in a garden or park near you as often as you can. Meditation is proven to alter neural networks in the brain and reduce self-centredness, and solitary activities such as reading and playing computer games have been shown to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-018-0029-6\">increase empathy with others</a>. We can all do something small to be part of something bigger and help solve our global problems.

When populations face shocks such as environmental catastrophe or social unrest, they are more likely to strengthen bonds between their \u201cin-group\u201d members, while caring less about those outside of the group. This is a defence mechanism to help groups pull together and overcome hardship. Social research has shown that it operates at the country level, too \u2013 countries facing crises are more likely to show prejudice towards outsiders and elect authoritarian leaders. Environmental catastrophes are only expected to worsen under climate change, which means nationalism could grow purely due to this evolutionary bias. Yet, is this a sensible response? In 2020, we live in a highly globalised world, with cross-border flows of money and people, as well as environmental impacts such as the climate crisis and air pollution. If we bond together within nations but with less regard for the welfare of others beyond those borders, we will end up fouling the global commons, ultimately to our own detriment. Yet there is hope. New research shows how we can escape individualism. Outdoor community activities increase both our psychological connectedness to others and to the natural world. Escape cities to go for a walk with family or friends, or volunteer in a garden or park near you as often as you can. Meditation is proven to alter neural networks in the brain and reduce self-centredness, and solitary activities such as reading and playing computer games have been shown to increase empathy with others. We can all do something small to be part of something bigger and help solve our global problems. Let\u2019s all get on with it. \u2022 Tom Oliver is professor of ecology at the University of Reading, and author of The Self Delusion, which will be published on 23 January.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of academic staff at British universities are being treated as second-class citizens on precarious contracts, says a report highlighting the \u201calarming rise of mass casualised labour\u201d in higher education. The report by the University and College Union claims institutions have created a pool of low-paid staff to teach undergraduates, conduct research and work in libraries, despite having advanced postgraduate or other academic qualifications. It calls on the Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, to require each university to publish figures showing their use of casual teaching staff, and and for research councils to insist their grant-holders employ staff on improved contracts. Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP for Newcastle Central, who is supporting the report, said it showed that precarious employment was not just an issue for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers. \u201cReliance on precarious, low-paid staff has become a business model and therefore universities across the UK are in the midst of industrial action over this issue,\u201d Onwurah said.

      "body": "<p>When Nadia Whittome was growing up, her mother told her that, as a working-class girl of colour, she had to be twice as good as others to be judged half as good. Evidently, it was a lesson that the youngest MP to enter parliament at after last month\u2019s general election took to heart. After all, not every 23-year-old\u2019s nights out clubbing end with them trying diligently to unionise the staff. \u201cSometimes in the club toilets there are women selling deodorants or sweets. And I\u2019ll go up to them and have a chat and just get to know them and ask whether they\u2019re in a union,\u201d explains the new Labour MP for Nottingham East, grinning. \u201cMy friends are always like: \u2018Nadia, we\u2019re going to get the shots in ...\u2019 But politics is life, isn\u2019t it? We live it every day.\u201d</p> <p>She is living it very differently these days, however. Almost overnight, Whittome went from living at home with her mum in Nottingham to representing her city in parliament and being grilled on the Today programme. Her election victory was a light on an otherwise dark night for the radical left. But it is a lot to take in for someone selected only 24 hours before the election was called and who had never lived away from home before she was elected (although she now has a flat in London for weeknights, she is still under her mother\u2019s roof in her constituency). \u201cPeople keep asking me how I feel, and the truth is there\u2019s no time to process how I feel. I\u2019m just getting on with the job,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does feel really odd that, not very long ago, I was looking for Christmas temp work \u2013 got rejected from a lot of Christmas temp work \u2013 and now I\u2019m a member of parliament.\u201d</p> <p>The so-called baby of the house has a certain steel about her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start to feel comfortable in that place,\u201d she says of parliament. \u201cI\u2019m not here to become part of the fabric of Westminster; I\u2019m here to change it.\u201d</p> <p>If she seems unusually self-possessed for her age, perhaps it is because Whittome had to grow up faster than some. She turned to activism as a teenager, she says, after watching friends on her estate struggle to cope under Tory austerity measures. Before long, this daughter of immigrants \u2013 her mother, who raised her as a single parent, is British-Indian; her father is of Punjabi heritage \u2013 was protesting against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/31/bedroom-tax-victims-forgotten-welfare-reform\" title=\"\">the bedroom tax</a> alongside Tony Benn and organising with Deliveroo riders against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/20/high-score-low-pay-gamification-lyft-uber-drivers-ride-hailing-gig-economy\" title=\"\">gig economy working practices</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"856a4153ed7dc2b444dd4e8b02621d3c3e6215c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/856a4153ed7dc2b444dd4e8b02621d3c3e6215c4/0_0_4947_3299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Whittome (bottom left) on the campaign trail in Nottingham with Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The individual policies of the manifesto were popular, but we hadn\u2019t built support\u2019 ... Nadia Whittome <em>(bottom left)</em> on the campaign trail in Nottingham with Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whittome says she joined Labour under Ed Miliband because she wanted it to be an anti-austerity party; in 2015, she was an early cheerleader for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign to succeed him. Having run unsuccessfully for a local council seat, she beat stiff competition to be selected as the party\u2019s candidate for the safe seat of Nottingham East after the incumbent Labour MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/in-their-own-words-why-seven-mps-are-quitting-labour-independent-group\" title=\"\">the Corbyn critic Chris Leslie</a>, defected to the short-lived <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/independent-group-for-change-party-disbanded\" title=\"\">Independent Group for Change</a>. Whittome had been the official candidate for a day when Boris Johnson called the 2019 election.</p> <p>Whittome is from a politically engaged family: her grandparents belonged to the Communist party of India (which she stresses is different from the Communist party in Britain) and her mother quit the Labour party over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/clause-iv-of-labour-party-constitution-what-is-all-the-fuss-about-reinstating-it\" title=\"\">the decision to amend clause </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/clause-iv-of-labour-party-constitution-what-is-all-the-fuss-about-reinstating-it\" title=\"\">IV in 1995</a>. \u201cI get a lot of my strength from my mum, but also the networks that we built around us,\u201d says Whittome.</p> <p>Her mother is a social-care lawyer working in local government; she got her law degree as a mature student and was out of work for five years when Whittome and her brother were young. Originally, Whittome planned to become a lawyer, too \u2013 partly due to the feeling that \u201cI have got to provide for my family when my mother can\u2019t\u201d \u2013 but she dropped out of university after two years for financial reasons.</p> <p>That must have been tough, I say. But she insists she loved the jobs she got instead, as a care worker and a hate-crime project worker. \u201cWhen I first stood for election, I was asked by people \u2013 white, middle-class academics: \u2018When are you going to get a proper job?\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019ve got a proper job; I\u2019m a care worker.\u2019 It felt like a real privilege to be let into people\u2019s homes and facilitate their lives. For a lot of people, you\u2019re the only person they see all day.\u201d She snorts at the argument that young people need more real-life experience before becoming MPs, pointing out that age is no guarantee of that: \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg is in his 50s and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/09/jacob-rees-mogg-is-a-deadbeat-dad-says-harriet-harman\" title=\"\">he\u2019s never changed a nappy</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it is undeniably a steep learning curve, moving from anonymous activist with the freedom to say what you like to this merciless public stage. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiawhittomemp/status/1210892014633574400\" title=\"\">Whittome has already triggered a </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiawhittomemp/status/1210892014633574400\" title=\"\">kerfuffle</a> by tweeting, when Iain Duncan Smith was knighted, that she was \u201cthinking of the millions of people whose loved ones have been killed\u201d by his policies. Does she really believe welfare reform directly claimed millions, or even hundreds of thousands, of lives?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What should have been a climate election was taken over by Brexit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMillions isn\u2019t necessarily an overestimation,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were, in 2017, 130,000 people who died avoidably due to austerity.\u201d But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\" title=\"\">the study I think she</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\" title=\"\"> is citing</a>, which examined the years 2012 to 2017, was not about welfare policy \u2013 it was about <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/130000-preventable-deaths-austerity/\" title=\"\">higher-than-expected numbers of deaths</a>, which the authors suggested (but could not prove) reflected cuts in health spending. What evidence has she for this serious accusation against the former work and pensions secretary? \u201cSpecifically on welfare policies, we don\u2019t know how many people have died as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-credit\" title=\"\">universal credit</a>. We know that people have died due to austerity.\u201d All right, but that is not what she tweeted.</p> <p>However, Whittome\u2019s convictions are not easily shaken. \u201cThe bigger problem is that we are talking about \u2018Is it tens of thousands, is it hundreds of thousands?\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not dozens \u2013 and \u2018How many people do each of these people know?\u2019, to ascertain exactly how many people are mourning and how many people have died. The fact that we\u2019re having this conversation in the media, rather than actually dealing with the immediate issue, is sad.\u201d To Whittome, all this is splitting hairs, yet she is operating in a world where precision matters.</p> <p>Of course, Whittome is not the first new MP to walk a tightrope between the formal demands of public life and staying true to his or her roots. (She has swapped numbers with the SNP MP Mhairi Black, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/09/mhairi-black-interview\" title=\"\">who was only 20 when she </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/09/mhairi-black-interview\" title=\"\">was elected in 2015</a>; they plan to compare notes over a drink.) But she is clearly anxious not to cut herself off from her community, which is why <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/youngest-mp-pledges-take-home-17420187\" title=\"\">she </a><a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/youngest-mp-pledges-take-home-17420187\" title=\"\">promised to take home only \u00a335,000 of her \u00a379,</a><a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/youngest-mp-pledges-take-home-17420187\" title=\"\">468 </a><a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/youngest-mp-pledges-take-home-17420187\" title=\"\">salary</a> and give the rest to local causes and strike funds. Her sacrifice may not have endeared her to Labour colleagues, who will be bracing themselves to justify taking their full pay. But Whittome says she did not mean to imply that politicians do not deserve the money; she just thinks that firefighters and teaching assistants deserve a rise, too \u2013 and she will take hers only when they get theirs. So is this purely a personal decision, or does she think other MPs should follow suit? \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision. I think it\u2019s an important representative principle, because as Labour MPs we are workers\u2019 representatives. I certainly don\u2019t berate MPs for taking the full salary.\u201d</p> <p>Yet for all her determination to \u201crise with her class, not above it\u201d, Whittome recognises that in some senses she has already changed. \u201cAs much as I was a working-class woman on 12 December, now I\u2019m not,\u201d she says. \u201cI walk the corridors of power and I have huge responsibility to share that [power] with everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>On election night, Whittome tweeted about wanting to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiawhittomemp/status/1205340043046506496?lang=en\" title=\"\">\u201ca new kind of MP\u201d</a>, inspired by radical women of colour.

She does not consider the timing a coincidence. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only person I know who suffered intensified abuse after Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cI think Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson\u2019s campaigns, which had very clear and overt racist undertones, legitimised the racism that already existed.\u201d There is every chance that the abusive passerby is one of her constituents, while the man she sees as legitimising hate runs the country.</p> <p>The lesson she takes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/corbyn-takes-share-responsibility-defeat\" title=\"\">Corbyn\u2019s crushing defeat last month</a> is not that the party was too leftwing or too pro-remain, but that it didn\u2019t make its case early enough, either for a second Brexit referendum or for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\" title=\"\">policies </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\" title=\"\">such as free broadband</a>. \u201cThe individual policies of the manifesto were popular, but there were just so many of them and we hadn\u2019t built support,\u201d Whittome says. She is passionate about tackling the climate crisis and would rather have seen the promise of 1m new green jobs take centre stage: \u201cI think what should have been a climate election was taken over by a Brexit election.\u201d</p> <p>Whittome nominated Clive Lewis to replace Corbyn as Labour leader \u2013 Lewis dropped out last week after failing to get enough nominations from Labour MPs and MEPs \u2013 and Dawn Butler for deputy. It worries her that BAME candidates such as Lewis, Butler and Rosena Allin-Khan had to plead for help getting on the ballot, while Lisa Nandy initially lagged behind the frontrunners; she remembers wanting to back Rushanara Ali for deputy in 2015 and not getting the chance because Ali could not get enough nominations. Why does she think this keeps happening? She says she has faith in her parliamentary colleagues, but adds: \u201cI think we need to interrogate our unconscious biases \u2026 we\u2019re lawmakers, and it\u2019s our responsibility to interrogate our privilege and to use the immense power that we have to amplify the voices of people who don\u2019t get heard.\u201d</p> <p>She is concerned, too, about calls for Labour to win back white, working-class voters by taking a tougher line on issues such as immigration. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted Clive on the ballot. I don\u2019t want to be back in a PLP [parliamentary Labour party] meeting in five years\u2019 time, talking about losing and winning back our heartlands, but we are talking now about different heartlands: Brixton, Nottingham, Liverpool.\u201d Her city seat is a traditional Labour stronghold, she points out, but one with many more black voters than the towns where Labour lost. \u201cI want to hear from candidates and activists in those places about what needs to change. But I\u2019m also clear that we can\u2019t just follow the conversation with immigration \u2013 we need to lead it, too. We need to make arguments for immigrants that aren\u2019t just about people\u2019s economic value, because the continuation of that is: when they are no longer of any economic value, they\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p> <p>The generational divide on the left between those comfortable with so-called identity politics and those occasionally confounded by it feels very clear talking to Whittome. Her politics is intersectional, deftly navigating the prickly places where race, class and other sources of discrimination collide; she expresses sympathy with the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s battle for acceptance in Britain, but she adds that liberation is not only about women at the top: \u201cEven if all the top business leaders were women of colour, that wouldn\u2019t make one jot of difference while lower-paid women of colour were being paid less than \u00a310 an hour for cleaning on zero-hours contracts.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this wariness of privilege in any form may not always sit easily with acquiring political power. When a cabbie asked recently if this was her dream job, she hesitated: \u201cI thought: \u2018Actually, I don\u2019t think my generation dreams the way that the older generation really did.\u2019 Our dreams are a lot more short-term: they\u2019re things like moving out of the family home, getting a job \u2013 any job, really. These are the struggles that occupy a lot of our thinking. That and the fact that we won\u2019t have a planet to live on if we don\u2019t take drastic action. That\u2019s my experience growing up in Nottingham \u2013 that we don\u2019t live in a society where we can afford to dream.\u201d Whittome can dream bigger now, but it may take her a while to get used to that.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2020 to clarify that the sum of \u00a335,000 which Whittome is planning to take is after tax. The basic annual salary for an MP before tax is \u00a379,468.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Nadia Whittome was growing up, her mother told her that, as a working-class girl of colour, she had to be twice as good as others to be judged half as good. Evidently, it was a lesson that the youngest MP to enter parliament at after last month\u2019s general election took to heart. After all, not every 23-year-old\u2019s nights out clubbing end with them trying diligently to unionise the staff. \u201cSometimes in the club toilets there are women selling deodorants or sweets. And I\u2019ll go up to them and have a chat and just get to know them and ask whether they\u2019re in a union,\u201d explains the new Labour MP for Nottingham East, grinning. \u201cMy friends are always like: \u2018Nadia, we\u2019re going to get the shots in ...\u2019 But politics is life, isn\u2019t it? We live it every day.\u201d She is living it very differently these days, however. Almost overnight, Whittome went from living at home with her mum in Nottingham to representing her city in parliament and being grilled on the Today programme. Her election victory was a light on an otherwise dark night for the radical left. But it is a lot to take in for someone selected only 24 hours before the election was called and who had never lived away from home before she was elected (although she now has a flat in London for weeknights, she is still under her mother\u2019s roof in her constituency). \u201cPeople keep asking me how I feel, and the truth is there\u2019s no time to process how I feel. I\u2019m just getting on with the job,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does feel really odd that, not very long ago, I was looking for Christmas temp work \u2013 got rejected from a lot of Christmas temp work \u2013 and now I\u2019m a member of parliament.\u201d The so-called baby of the house has a certain steel about her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start to feel comfortable in that place,\u201d she says of parliament. \u201cI\u2019m not here to become part of the fabric of Westminster; I\u2019m here to change it.\u201d If she seems unusually self-possessed for her age, perhaps it is because Whittome had to grow up faster than some. She turned to activism as a teenager, she says, after watching friends on her estate struggle to cope under Tory austerity measures. Before long, this daughter of immigrants \u2013 her mother, who raised her as a single parent, is British-Indian; her father is of Punjabi heritage \u2013 was protesting against the bedroom tax alongside Tony Benn and organising with Deliveroo riders against gig economy working practices. Whittome says she joined Labour under Ed Miliband because she wanted it to be an anti-austerity party; in 2015, she was an early cheerleader for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign to succeed him. Having run unsuccessfully for a local council seat, she beat stiff competition to be selected as the party\u2019s candidate for the safe seat of Nottingham East after the incumbent Labour MP, the Corbyn critic Chris Leslie, defected to the short-lived Independent Group for Change. Whittome had been the official candidate for a day when Boris Johnson called the 2019 election. Whittome is from a politically engaged family: her grandparents belonged to the Communist party of India (which she stresses is different from the Communist party in Britain) and her mother quit the Labour party over the decision to amend clause IV in 1995. \u201cI get a lot of my strength from my mum, but also the networks that we built around us,\u201d says Whittome. Her mother is a social-care lawyer working in local government; she got her law degree as a mature student and was out of work for five years when Whittome and her brother were young. Originally, Whittome planned to become a lawyer, too \u2013 partly due to the feeling that \u201cI have got to provide for my family when my mother can\u2019t\u201d \u2013 but she dropped out of university after two years for financial reasons. That must have been tough, I say. But she insists she loved the jobs she got instead, as a care worker and a hate-crime project worker. \u201cWhen I first stood for election, I was asked by people \u2013 white, middle-class academics: \u2018When are you going to get a proper job?\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019ve got a proper job; I\u2019m a care worker.\u2019 It felt like a real privilege to be let into people\u2019s homes and facilitate their lives. For a lot of people, you\u2019re the only person they see all day.\u201d She snorts at the argument that young people need more real-life experience before becoming MPs, pointing out that age is no guarantee of that: \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg is in his 50s and he\u2019s never changed a nappy.\u201d Yet it is undeniably a steep learning curve, moving from anonymous activist with the freedom to say what you like to this merciless public stage. Whittome has already triggered a kerfuffle by tweeting, when Iain Duncan Smith was knighted, that she was \u201cthinking of the millions of people whose loved ones have been killed\u201d by his policies. Does she really believe welfare reform directly claimed millions, or even hundreds of thousands, of lives? \u201cMillions isn\u2019t necessarily an overestimation,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were, in 2017, 130,000 people who died avoidably due to austerity.\u201d But the study I think she is citing, which examined the years 2012 to 2017, was not about welfare policy \u2013 it was about higher-than-expected numbers of deaths, which the authors suggested (but could not prove) reflected cuts in health spending. What evidence has she for this serious accusation against the former work and pensions secretary? \u201cSpecifically on welfare policies, we don\u2019t know how many people have died as a result of universal credit. We know that people have died due to austerity.\u201d All right, but that is not what she tweeted. However, Whittome\u2019s convictions are not easily shaken. \u201cThe bigger problem is that we are talking about \u2018Is it tens of thousands, is it hundreds of thousands?\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not dozens \u2013 and \u2018How many people do each of these people know?\u2019, to ascertain exactly how many people are mourning and how many people have died. The fact that we\u2019re having this conversation in the media, rather than actually dealing with the immediate issue, is sad.\u201d To Whittome, all this is splitting hairs, yet she is operating in a world where precision matters. Of course, Whittome is not the first new MP to walk a tightrope between the formal demands of public life and staying true to his or her roots. (She has swapped numbers with the SNP MP Mhairi Black, who was only 20 when she was elected in 2015; they plan to compare notes over a drink.) But she is clearly anxious not to cut herself off from her community, which is why she promised to take home only \u00a335,000 of her \u00a379,468 salary and give the rest to local causes and strike funds. Her sacrifice may not have endeared her to Labour colleagues, who will be bracing themselves to justify taking their full pay. But Whittome says she did not mean to imply that politicians do not deserve the money; she just thinks that firefighters and teaching assistants deserve a rise, too \u2013 and she will take hers only when they get theirs. So is this purely a personal decision, or does she think other MPs should follow suit? \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision. I think it\u2019s an important representative principle, because as Labour MPs we are workers\u2019 representatives. I certainly don\u2019t berate MPs for taking the full salary.\u201d Yet for all her determination to \u201crise with her class, not above it\u201d, Whittome recognises that in some senses she has already changed. \u201cAs much as I was a working-class woman on 12 December, now I\u2019m not,\u201d she says. \u201cI walk the corridors of power and I have huge responsibility to share that [power] with everyone else.\u201d On election night, Whittome tweeted about wanting to be \u201ca new kind of MP\u201d, inspired by radical women of colour. Those inspirations range from \u201cthe Squad\u201d in the US \u2013 the hotshot progressive Democrats Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib \u2013 to the late factory worker Jayaben Desai, who led the 1976 strike at the Grunwick film processing plant in north-west London. She feels particularly connected to Desai, who challenged lazy assumptions about female Indian workers: \u201cPeople thought that she was a docile, subservient Asian woman and she was anything but.\u201d Whittome is under no illusions about what she may face in the current political climate. The day after the Brexit referendum, she was called an \u201ceffing black bitch\u201d on the street in what is now her constituency. She does not consider the timing a coincidence. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only person I know who suffered intensified abuse after Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cI think Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson\u2019s campaigns, which had very clear and overt racist undertones, legitimised the racism that already existed.\u201d There is every chance that the abusive passerby is one of her constituents, while the man she sees as legitimising hate runs the country. The lesson she takes from Corbyn\u2019s crushing defeat last month is not that the party was too leftwing or too pro-remain, but that it didn\u2019t make its case early enough, either for a second Brexit referendum or for policies such as free broadband. \u201cThe individual policies of the manifesto were popular, but there were just so many of them and we hadn\u2019t built support,\u201d Whittome says. She is passionate about tackling the climate crisis and would rather have seen the promise of 1m new green jobs take centre stage: \u201cI think what should have been a climate election was taken over by a Brexit election.\u201d Whittome nominated Clive Lewis to replace Corbyn as Labour leader \u2013 Lewis dropped out last week after failing to get enough nominations from Labour MPs and MEPs \u2013 and Dawn Butler for deputy.

      "bodyText": "Will we soon see ermine on the Ouse? The weekend\u2019s report that the House of Lords might be moving, lock, stock and barrel, to York is radical, exciting and sensible. If this is the new Boris Johnson, all hail the chief. It is precisely the talisman needed of a government that has had enough of the southwards drift. Such ideas are often mooted but always crushed by a reactionary Westminster. The only doubt must be whether the Johnson-Cummings coalition has the guts and staying power to push it through. Britain now regularly bottoms Europe\u2019s league table in the disparity between its capital and its provinces, in everything from wealth and health to productivity and investment. The London magnet is awesome and relentless. Every infrastructure decision, from HS2 to Crossrail to research centres to museums, is aimed at London. This will not be reversed until those who take decisions view the nation from outside the capital. They have to get out of town. Moving the House of Lords would be largely symbolic, since the house is itself largely symbolic. It should stop being a mix of worthy veterans and party hacks and a place where seats can be bought along with the right to collect \u00a3300 a day. Johnson\u2019s reported idea of making it a chamber of the regions is excellent. That was how parliament functioned in the Middle Ages \u2013 and it worked. It staved off revolutions. As for the Commons, reform is no less urgent. MPs must shortly face a decision to vacate the Palace of Westminster. Parliament is not going to matter much over the next five Johnsonian years and the institution is badly in need of a detox. The building is already a disgrace, despite the huge sums of money continually being spent on it. The place is so rotten Big Ben cannot even be made to ring for under half a million pounds. Current proposals for the temporary evacuation of the palace read like something from a Ministry of Defence aircraft carrier spec. Every excuse has been dreamed up to increase cost \u2013 MPs\u2019 health and safety, national security, respect for tradition, staff facilities, swimming pools and gyms. Members want the taxpayer to build an extravagant replica House of Commons by demolishing a starred listed building off Whitehall behind Richmond Terrace. No other organisation in the land would be allowed to do this. In its place MPs want to erect a Disneyland Commons chamber with up to half a billion pounds of public money \u2013 all just for four years of use. This is chiefly because they have insisted on keeping replica division lobbies and not doing what every other country\u2019s assembly does, which is vote electronically. They cannot bring themselves even to save money by experimenting with a semicircular chamber, for fear it might reduce the shouting idiocies of prime minister\u2019s questions. All this is ruled by the speaker, the leader and a commission of mysterious MPs. This is how Britain, or at least Westminster, is run. It will make the MPs\u2019 expenses spent on moats and duck islands look like small beer. The answer has to be to get the hell out of the village, to escape the bubble, go on tour. Nothing would bring a more refreshing change of air to British politics after the past three years than for everyone to leave Westminster. There are debating chambers waiting the length and breadth of the land, from Manchester to Edinburgh, Cardiff to Winchester, Bristol to Newcastle. Since the Commons chamber is rarely full beyond Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the inconvenience would hardly be great \u2013 less so for provincial members. MPs can keep their London offices. As for the media, another England \u2013 another Britain \u2013 would emerge from the shadows and come to life. Every issue would look different, every priority shift, every budget subtly adjust. As for the lords, permanent residence in York would sort the wheat from the piffle and wind. If it is to be more than a distinguished old persons\u2019 club, it will have to play a role that challenges the Commons. It must be a true champion of the provinces. It could argue for the rerouting of the benighted HS2 up the east coast. It could demand such vanity projects be concentrated in the north. The mooted site for the new chamber, in a goods yard outside York station, is ideal. Appropriately it is near a museum crammed to bursting with exhausted steam engines. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 January 2020 because an earlier version implied that the site mooted for the new chamber is that of the National Railway museum. That attraction is nearby. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster has written to Boris Johnson demanding that he take immediate steps to allow the suppressed report into Russia\u2019s interference in the British political system to be published. Ian Blackford, the leader of the third-largest party in the Commons, called on the prime minister to begin appointing members of parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, necessary to allow the controversial document to be released. \u201cIt is unacceptable that your government has repeatedly and intentionally failed to take steps to establish the committee and has sought to escape scrutiny on vital issues,\u201d Blackford writes in a letter that has been shared with the Guardian. \u201cThe public interest and the imperative is and has always been clear: lift your sanction on publishing this report and re-establish the intelligence and security committee so that it can be immediately published,\u201d the SNP MP added. A report on Russia\u2019s spying activities against the UK and its attempts to penetrate the British establishment had been prepared by the committee in the last parliament, and had been made ready to publish when the election was called. Members of the committee saw evidence of Russian infiltration in Conservative political circles, but it is unclear how much of that concern reached the final document, which some sources say was watered down even before it went to Johnson. Ministers have repeatedly said there are no examples of \u201csuccessful Russian interference\u201d in the 2016 EU referendum or an election, although there is scepticism as to whether that has been properly investigated. The report was nevertheless awaiting final clearance from Downing Street, to check it did not contain any classified information, when the election was called. No 10 said it was not possible to clear it in time, a point disputed by the previous chairman of the committee, former MP Dominic Grieve. Downing Street eventually said after the election that the report was cleared. But its release depends on the appointment of nine cross-party backbench MPs and peers to the committee\u2019s membership, a task that falls to Johnson after consulting with other parties. Last time, committee members were not appointed until November 2017 \u2013 five months after the general election, prompting complaints that \u201ceffective and robust oversight of the intelligence community\u201d had been \u201cleft in a vacuum for so many months\u201d. In recent years, the SNP has had one member of the committee, including at one point Blackford himself. But party sources said they had heard nothing from No 10 to suggest the appointment process had even begun. The party acknowledges that the appointments process can take a while to find people willing to serve on the committee, which meets in secret in Westminster. But it wants Johnson to produce a timetable swiftly. \u201cRussian interference in elections is widespread and well documented, the evidence that Russia poses a direct threat to the functioning and operability of democracy among our allies in the EU and beyond is overwhelming,\u201d Blackford writes. \u201cIf this report, as you have recently claimed, shows that Russia has never interfered in any democratic event in the UK then it is inexplicable that you chose not to restore public trust and publish this report before the 2019 general election.\u201d",

Publishers have found that up to 60% of their \u201csafe\u201d \u2013 non-controversial or neutral \u2013 content is incorrectly falling foul of ad-blocking.</p> <p>It estimates that in total UK publishers made \u00a3758m from digital advertising last year, meaning that about one in every \u00a35 of ad revenue is being lost to blacklist blocking. National newspapers made \u00a3275m in digital advertising last year, regional titles \u00a3212m and magazine publishers \u00a3271m.</p> <p>In the UK, the <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2019/GB/\">most-searched phrase on Google last year was the Rugby World Cup</a>. However, according to the report many of the most-read articles fell foul of ad-blocking for the use of phrases such as \u201cattack\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d. Some articles on Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film of all-time, also suffered as they contained \u201cattack\u201d and \u201ckill\u201d.</p> <p>One senior executive at a UK media agency, which handles the advertising for numerous household-name brands, cited a case of being asked by a client to create a blacklist comprised of \u201cany negative words\u201d. Another agency executive knows of multiple advertisers who added the word \u201cis\u201d to their blacklists, wanting to avoid having ads appear around material on the Islamic State (Isis) militant group, virtually guaranteeing zero ads appearing on any news sites. Wildman says that the word Manchester is still on many blacklists three years after the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena.</p> <p>Embattled publishers are struggling to cope with the dominance of Google and Facebook, which control about 70% of the \u00a312bn UK digital ad market </p> <p>\u201cAdvertising technology can be very, very blunt and isn\u2019t sophisticated enough to discern between genuinely harmful content and acceptable content,\u201d said Rob Lynam, a media executive who has worked in ad agencies and at the publisher of the Daily Mail. \u201cThere are good intentions but I don\u2019t think anyone has really realised who it is punishing the most or to what extent.\u201d</p>",

While publishers have traditionally encouraged the use of such brand reputation protection measures in the digital age, blacklists are ballooning in some cases to as many as 3,000 or 4,000 words, blocking ads from many different stories. \u201cAn unintended consequence is that perversely some of the best and most trusted content is being blocked inadvertently,\u201d said James Wildman, chief executive of Hearst UK, the publisher of magazines including Cosmopolitan and Elle. \u201cIf we write about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex [Harry and Meghan], chances are most software would see the word \u2018sex\u2019 and assume it is inappropriate content to appear alongside and block it. We are getting blocked for keywords like \u2018shoot\u2019. We write about photoshoots constantly.\u201d Newspaper and magazine publishers in the UK, US, Japan and Australia missed out on $3.2bn (\u00a32.46bn) in digital revenue last year as \u201cover-blocking\u201d stopped ads appearing in articles with \u201csafe or neutral content\u201d, according to a report by the Merrick School of Business at the University of Baltimore, commissioned by cybersecurity firm CHEQ. The report estimates that UK publishers missed out on \u00a3167m in advertising last year due to keyword ad-blocking. Publishers have found that up to 60% of their \u201csafe\u201d \u2013 non-controversial or neutral \u2013 content is incorrectly falling foul of ad-blocking. It estimates that in total UK publishers made \u00a3758m from digital advertising last year, meaning that about one in every \u00a35 of ad revenue is being lost to blacklist blocking. National newspapers made \u00a3275m in digital advertising last year, regional titles \u00a3212m and magazine publishers \u00a3271m. In the UK, the most-searched phrase on Google last year was the Rugby World Cup. However, according to the report many of the most-read articles fell foul of ad-blocking for the use of phrases such as \u201cattack\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d. Some articles on Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film of all-time, also suffered as they contained \u201cattack\u201d and \u201ckill\u201d. One senior executive at a UK media agency, which handles the advertising for numerous household-name brands, cited a case of being asked by a client to create a blacklist comprised of \u201cany negative words\u201d. Another agency executive knows of multiple advertisers who added the word \u201cis\u201d to their blacklists, wanting to avoid having ads appear around material on the Islamic State (Isis) militant group, virtually guaranteeing zero ads appearing on any news sites. Wildman says that the word Manchester is still on many blacklists three years after the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena. Embattled publishers are struggling to cope with the dominance of Google and Facebook, which control about 70% of the \u00a312bn UK digital ad market \u201cAdvertising technology can be very, very blunt and isn\u2019t sophisticated enough to discern between genuinely harmful content and acceptable content,\u201d said Rob Lynam, a media executive who has worked in ad agencies and at the publisher of the Daily Mail. \u201cThere are good intentions but I don\u2019t think anyone has really realised who it is punishing the most or to what extent.\u201d",

A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords. Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government\u2019s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research \u2013 the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date. Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: \u201cThe survey documents, without question, we have an \u2018unsettling status\u2019. \u201cThis extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust; an erosion of wellbeing; and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents. \u201cThe government has a duty to finally give EU/EEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.\u201d The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme. The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status. As many as 11% said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required. This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document. On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well. As many as 97.1% of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected. However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with \u201csettled status\u201d was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were \u201cangry\u201d, \u201canxious\u201d and \u201cunwanted\u201d. Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80% either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious. Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure. \u201cWhile the EU settlement scheme works for many from a process perspective, it [does not] provide a sense of security,\u201d the report said, adding that while it works in essence for the Home Office, it would be better branded the \u201cunsettled scheme\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The transition to the National Disability Insurance Scheme has been \u201cconfusing\u201d for participants, who have faced frustrating delays and sometimes missed out on supports they received under the previous state-based system, a government-commissioned review has found. Former public servant David Tune\u2019s independent review of the NDIS Act, released on Monday, issued 29 recommendations to improve the scheme following an implementation process that the review found had \u201cnot been smooth\u201d. Some participants complained about a lack of transparency in the National Disability Insurance Agency\u2019s decisions, that the scheme was \u201ctoo complex and difficult to navigate\u201d and that NDIS staff did not understand their disability or the challenges they faced in their lives. \u201cThis review heard that, in combination, these issues have resulted in some participants reporting their engagement with the NDIS has led to lasting negative impacts on their wellbeing,\u201d the review said. But it also stressed that once people had received their plans and were receiving supports, \u201cparticipant outcomes are improving the longer they are in the NDIS\u201d. The Morrison government commissioned the review in August amid growing concerns around delays, with participants at the time waiting an average of 127 days to receive a plan. The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, also rolled out a temporary \u201cinterim plan\u201d model that has significantly cut waiting times, which has seen waiting times fall to an average of 77 days. On Monday, Robert said the government would respond to the findings \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d and lay out changes to legislate a new service guarantee for participants by 1 July 2020. \u201cThe review\u2019s findings reaffirmed what we have been hearing from participants, their families and carers and the disability sector \u2013 that while many participants have had excellent experiences and are benefitting from the scheme, many others have had frustrations with wait times, complexity of processes and a lack of understanding of their needs,\u201d Robert said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use these findings to update and clarify the legislation and remove barriers to a better NDIS.\u201d Among the 29 recommendations, the review calls for legislated time frames, including that participants should have a plan after no longer than 56 days when the scheme is at \u201cmaturity\u201d by July 2021. Tune also recommends the NDIS Act be amended so participants are given more powers to use their supports flexibly, calls for a trial that would allow NDIS planners to also approve participants\u2019 plans and calls for \u201cadditional funding to support people with disability to navigate the NDIS\u201d. The review also says the test used by the NDIA in its decision-making \u2013 whether a support is \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d \u2013 lacks a \u201cclear definition of what constitutes a reasonable and necessary support\u201d. \u201cThis creates confusion around the role and purpose of the NDIS and drives a number of individual cases towards tribunals and courts,\u201d the review says. Disability advocates cautiously welcomed the review\u2019s findings. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the Tune review acknowledge that the NDIS is too complex,\u201d said Romola Hollywood, a director of policy and advocacy at People with Disability Australia. \u201cPeople with disability tell us every day that the scheme is hard to access and difficult to navigate. We welcome the commitment to making the NDIS respond more quickly to people with disability, so that we can get access to the essential supports that we need. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want see greater accountability on timeframes for plan assessments and reviews to come at the expense of the quality of the plans.\u201d Hollywood said she was also concerned that the review did not recommend the scheme\u2019s staffing cap be removed or more people with disabilities be employed within the agency. \u201cThese are key issues that have to be urgently addressed,\u201d she said. The opposition\u2019s NDIS spokesman, Bill Shorten, said: \u201c[Tune\u2019s] findings that the scheme is plagued by delays and is frustrating to understand echo the experience of many thousands of participants. \u201cThe Liberals have had six years stewardship of what should be a world-class scheme but instead they have pillaged it and left people with disability out in the cold.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is unlawful for governments to return people to countries where their lives might be threatened by the climate crisis, a landmark ruling by the United Nations human rights committee has found. The judgment \u2013 which is the first of its kind \u2013 represents a legal \u201ctipping point\u201d and a moment that \u201copens the doorway\u201d to future protection claims for people whose lives and wellbeing have been threatened due to global heating, experts say. Tens of millions of people are expected to be displaced by global heating in the next decade. The judgment relates to the case of Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, which is considered one of the countries most threatened by rising sea levels. He applied for protection in New Zealand in 2013, claiming his and his family\u2019s lives were at risk. The committee heard evidence of overcrowding on the island of South Tarawa, where Teitiota lived, saying that the population there had increased from 1,641 in 1947 to 50,000 in 2010 due to sea level rising leading to other islands becoming uninhabitable, which had led to violence and social tensions. He also spoke of the lack of fresh water and difficulty growing crops due to salinity of the water table causing serious health issues for his family. He said that as Kiribati was predicted to be uninhabitable in 10 to 15 years, his life was endangered by remaining there. The New Zealand courts rejected Teitiota\u2019s claim for protection. The UN human rights committee upheld New Zealand\u2019s decision on the grounds that while \u201csea level rise is likely to render the republic of Kiribati uninhabitable \u2026 the timeframe of 10 to 15 years, as suggested by [Teitiota], could allow for intervening acts by the republic of Kiribati, with the assistance of the international community, to take affirmative measures to protect and, where necessary, relocate its population\u201d. However experts say the committee\u2019s ruling opens the way for other claims based on the threat to life posed by the climate crisis.

On Wednesday the auditor general released a scathing report on the program, finding it had a distributional bias in favour of marginal seats and suggesting the then sports minister may have lacked legal authority to approve grants. On Monday Labor stepped up its attack on Morrison\u2019s involvement, with the shadow small business minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, saying it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that the prime minister, the \u201ccampaigner in chief\u201d at the 2019 election, did not know how funding was allocated. Later, Morrison conceded that his office had been involved, claiming they passed on representations from MPs about projects for consideration by McKenzie. Three clubs in Morrison\u2019s electorate of Cook received funding under the community sport infrastructure grant program: Lilli Pilli Football Club, which got $200,000; Sans Souci Football Club ($50,000); and St George and Sutherland Shire Giants Baseball Club ($42,500). A Football NSW video posted to YouTube on 3 September 2019 shows Morrison officially opening the Lilli Pilli oval clubhouse and precinct upgrades funded in part through the program. Morrison outlines that he met the Lilli Pilli FC club president, Greg Storey, \u201ceven before I had become the member for Cook\u201d and the club had raised $500,000 in 20 years. \u201cSo with the council and the local community coming together it was our great thrill as a commonwealth government to back that in with our further $200,000 in support through the sport infrastructure grants program,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cBecause that grants program \u2013 which we not only do here but we do all around the country \u2013 it actually isn\u2019t about sport. It\u2019s not about football. It\u2019s about community, at the end of the day.\u201d Morrison also appeared in a Sports Australia video spruiking the grant to the Sans Souci Football Club. On 11 July both Morrison and the Sans Souci Football Club posted Facebook photos of his attendance at an event announcing the grant. On Facebook Morrison said that \u201cpart of the job of being [prime minister] is also about being a good local MP, supporting our local community\u201d. \u201cSo [it] was great to be back in southern Sydney today backing in our local youth sport clubs (Sans Souci Football Club and Gymea Netball Club) with new facilities under our stronger communities and sports infrastructure grants programs.\u201d On Monday Morrison was asked if he or his office played any role in the allocation of the grants. He replied: \u201cThe decisions were done in accordance with the process the minister set out, that was the minister made those decisions and they were actioned in an endorsing way by Sports Australia, that\u2019s how it worked.\u201d The Australian National Audit Office said that representations about projects were received \u201cacross the three rounds both directly and indirectly, including through the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d. Later on Monday, Morrison clarified that \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s office has always relayed on representations made to it by its members\u201d. \u201cThe minister was the one making the decision on those grants programs,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. In the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader Josh Frydenberg\u2019s seat of Kooyong, grants were given to Camberwell Hockey Club ($38,000), Camberwell Junior Football Club ($10,520) , East Camberwell Tennis Club ($90,000), Kew Little Athletics ($92,450), Grace Park Hawthorn Club ($25,000) and Hawthorn Malvern Hockey Centre ($500,000). In Kooyong, only the grant to the Camberwell Junior Football Club was given in the first round of the program, with the rest given in the controversial second and third rounds just weeks or months out from the May 2019 election. The auditor general\u2019s report found that 70% of projects approved by McKenzie in the second round in March 2019 were not recommended by Sport Australia, rising to 73% in the third round in April 2019 after an extra $40m was tipped into the program. Frydenberg spruiked the grants in press releases and a Twitter post on 7 May, in which he said it was \u201cfantastic to announce funding to upgrade the facilities at Camberwell Hockey Club\u201d. Morrison and McKenzie both maintain that all projects were eligible for funding and no rules were broken, although Morrison has asked the attorney general to \u201cclarify\u201d and \u201caddress\u201d legal issues raised by the auditor general. The audit report also said it was \u201cnot evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was\u201d for McKenzie to approve grants, comments which have led lawyers to warn that clubs which missed out on federal funding could bring court cases to overturn her decisions. At a doorstop in Melbourne, O\u2019Connor said it \u201cbeggars belief that [Morrison] was not aware, at least to some extent, of the way in which those matters were managed by his minister, given he was so much involved in those announcements and references to those announcements when he was campaigning\u201d.",

Responding to the recommendations soon to be made by the panel could boost outcomes for energy efficiency, as well as the industrial, agricultural and other sectors.

The Prime Minister has said the government could \u201cevolve\u201d its climate policies, including emission reduction targets that are pegged to 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2030. \u201cWe are dealing with our climate policies in the same way as we took them to the election \u2026 we will meet and beat our emission reduction targets,\u201d the prime minister said on Monday morning. In 2020 the Government has a number of options to evolve climate policies that don\u2019t involve drastic changes and could avoid potential brawls in the party room.

      "bodyText": "The two psychologists who designed the US \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d programme that included waterboarding and other forms of torture are due to give evidence in open court for the first time this week. James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen will answer questions at a pre-trial hearing on the 9/11 attacks before a military tribunal in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Lawyers for the defendants, who are among 40 detainees being held at prison camp on the island of Cuba, say it will be a unique opportunity to hold to account those responsible for approving and carrying out the use of torture, and to demonstrate that both the CIA and FBI were complicit in torture, with significant implications for any future trial of suspected 9/11 plotters. Mitchell and Jessen were former air force psychologists who were tasked by the CIA in 2002 to establish a programme of severe interrogation techniques. They were paid $1,800 a day and in 2005 they set up a private company, which provided most of the interrogators and most of the security staff at the \u201cblack sites\u201d, secret detention facilities. The company was paid $81m for its services before its contract was terminated in 2009. \u201cThe perverse \u2018work\u2019 of these psychologists has dramatically set back the global fight against torture. The interrogation methods they championed have had a rippling effect around the world,\u201d said Julia Hall, a human rights lawyer with Amnesty International who is attending the hearings. The American Psychological Association has disowned Mitchell and Jessen for \u201cviolating the ethics of their profession and leaving a stain on the discipline of psychology\u201d. But both men have insisted they did nothing wrong, arguing they were asked to do things that were declared legal by the George W Bush administration, and that they had to prevent the worst excesses of other interrogators. Defence lawyers and human rights advocates hope Mitchell and Jessen will cast more light on the scale of the torture programme, the culpability of senior officials and the role of the FBI, which has hitherto presented itself as uninvolved. \u201cThe main points that I will be asking the witnesses about are the deep involvement of the FBI in the rendition detention and interrogation program, the huge bureaucracy that was necessary to support the use of coercive pressure as an interrogation tactic, and the elements of the CIA\u2019s programme that didn\u2019t involve Dr Mitchell and Dr Jessen at all,\u201d said James Connell, lawyer for one of the defendants, Ammar al-Baluchi, who will lead the questioning of Mitchell this week. \u201cThere are many other people who are involved.\u201d Alka Pradhan, another Baluchi lawyer who will take the lead in questioning Jessen said the coming session was \u201cprobably one of the most consequential hearings we have had yet\u201d in eight years of pre-trial hearings. At the core of the prosecution case are a set of statements made by the defendants in 2007 to FBI investigators. The government contends that this was a \u201cclean team\u201d of investigators who had nothing to do with torture. The statements were therefore untainted and admissible in court. Pradhan said the Mitchell and Jessen testimony would add to already considerable evidence that the FBI also had dirty hands. \u201cThey knew that they needed \u2018clean interrogations\u2019 in order to be able to prosecute and eventually execute,\u201d she said. The defence lawyers say there were FBI agents at the black sites during enhanced interrogations and that the FBI submitted questions for the interrogators to use, knowing torture was being used. This week\u2019s hearing has been complicated by a new set of secrecy rules introduced by the prosecution on Thursday, that prevents defence lawyers from citing references to the interrogation programme in published books, even though they had been cleared for publication by the CIA. On the other hand, defence teams will be allowed to cite more details of dates, places and techniques used on detainees. The CIA has acknowledged that at least 39 prisoners were subjected to the enhanced interrogation techniques that included slamming detainees into a wall, confining them in a 21x30in (53x76cm) box, and waterboarding, the simulation of drowning by covering a prisoner\u2019s face with cloth and pouring water on it. The UN and human rights groups have declared waterboarding and some of the other techniques to be torture. Defence and prosecution lawyers are due to argue over classification and other procedural issues in closed session at the military commission built on the Guant\u00e1namo naval base near the detention camp. Then the presiding judge, Col Shane Cohen, is expected to hold open sessions for at least some of the next two weeks. Mitchell and Jessen agreed an out of court settlement in a civil suit brought by the American Council on Civil Liberties on behalf of Suleiman Abdullah Salim and Mohamed Ben Soud, who were released without charges after being tortured, and the family of Gul Rahman, who died under interrogation in 2002 in one of the CIA\u2019s secret detention facilities around the world, known as \u201cblack sites\u201d. Rahman died after being left shackled overnight naked from the waist down in a freezing concrete cell. Mitchell and Jessen said they had complained about Rahman\u2019s treatment but their warnings were ignored by senior CIA officials. The psychologists said their interrogation programme had been designed to induce a \u201clearned helplessness\u201d in detainees that would make them more compliant. Mitchell wrote a memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, in which he claimed that the enhanced interrogation techniques helped foil al-Qaida attacks on the US. \u201cI concluded that it would be immoral and unethical to ignore my obligation to use what I knew to defend our citizens and our way of life against enemies who themselves had initiated the conflict and whose stated goal was to destroy us,\u201d Mitchell wrote. His claims over the programme\u2019s success is disputed by a report by the Senate intelligence committee, which found that the enhanced interrogations produced no actionable intelligence.",

He also scored four touchdowns in what was a record-setting career day. </p> <p>It meant an easy walk in the park for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo who threw just eight times, an absolutely remarkable total for a pivot capable of taking over a game when necessary. </p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t today. Not with this rushing attack and not with this defense, a unit that let most of its points through during extended garbage time. </p> <p>And now they will face a considerably more formidable opponent in the Super Bowl.

The San Francisco 49ers are about an hour away from hosting the Green Bay Packers, with the winner set to cross the continent to Miami for Super Bowl LIV (54). </p> <p>We\u2019re really excited to have you with us but can I give you a little advice? For now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/19/afc-championship-game-tennessee-titans-kansas-city-chiefs-live-nfl\">stick with the Chiefs and Titans</a> and our live blogger extraordinaire, Hunter Felt, who is monitoring the AFC Championship for us. Once that\u2019s done, come back and read this little spiel below about the Niners and Packers, and get ready for the big game at Levi\u2019s\u00ae Stadium in Santa Clara.</p> <p>So, that spiel: we\u2019re lucky to have got two marquee quarterbacks to entertain us this evening (morning, afternoon): 36-year-old Aaron Rodgers and the kid, Jimmy Garoppolo, who isn\u2019t really a kid at age 28, who is playing on this stage for the first time. </p> <p>All Jimmy G has done since moving from being a would-be successor to Tom Brady in New England to the helm of the 49ers offense is go 22-5, in-between an ACL injury which kept him out for most of 2018. With a win today, Garoppolo takes another leap towards the top of the next generation quarterback class. </p> <p>And San Francisco should win this game, because they have more than enough weapons to do so convincingly. San Francisco\u2019s dynamic offense have the personnel to win any way they like. For example, head coach Kyle Shanahan could punch up a run heavy game plan featuring their three-headed rushing attack of Tevin Coleman, Raheem Mostert and Matt Breida, a trio that combined for close to 2000 yards this season. Or, should Green Bay stack the line, San Francisco could easily lean on Garoppolo, who has the luxury of George Kittle, a tight end who is nearly impossible to tackle, and is literally out there <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrWIZZx3Ats\">seeking out walls to run through</a>. </p> <p>Defensively San Francisco can pressure the quarterback with just four lineman, which could mean a tough day for Aaron Rodgers. The 15-year veteran is the last of the old generation standing - Brady, Brees Roethlisberger, two Manning brothers, Rivers and other old raisins are either retired, or almost retired, and are certainly not here playing for a shot at the Super Bowl. That\u2019s to his credit, as Rodgers put together a 13-3 season featuring over 4000 yards passing and 26 touchdown tosses against only four picks. Green Bay looked pretty good last week against a Seattle team that had divisional round defeat written all over them. </p> <p>You know when Green Bay didn\u2019t look so good? Back in week 12, when these very same Niners held Rodgers to just 81 yards passing. </p> <p>Final score: 37-8.</p> <p>So the question heading into this rematch is, what did Packers head coach Matt LeFleur learn from that shellacking, and what can he conjure up to turn that result 180 degrees the other way. In a few hours time we\u2019ll know if LeFleur and the Packers have enough to put Rodgers in a position to win his second Super Bowl ring, or, if Jimmy G will be heading to Miami for a shot at his first. </p> <p>We\u2019re getting closer to kickoff and we\u2019ll soon be rolling in more pre-game fun including predictions. </p> <p>What\u2019s your incredibly hot take on the NFC Championship? <br></p> <p>Feel free to share: tweet me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LengelDavid\">@lengeldavid</a> or email it to <a href=\"mailto:david.lengel.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">david.lengel.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a> and we\u2019ll make you famous!</p> <p>Please stand by for NFC Championship football - stick with us!<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e248dc28f08e97ed212647a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T17:12:20.154Z\">5.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s our preview of today\u2019s game:</p> <p><strong>What the Packers need to do to win:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl-playoffs-football\">As Oliver Connolly pointed out</a> in these pages, Green Bay are no longer in a position in which they need to rely solely on Aaron Rodgers. The future Hall of Famer is still vital though, and if he can pull off the <a href=\"https://www.packers.com/video/packers-qb-aaron-rodgers-hits-te-jimmy-graham-for-huge-third-down-pickup\">ice-cool third-down throws</a> he made against the Seahawks it could help decide a close game. Green Bay, however, were terrible in those scenarios the last time they played the 49ers, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=401128004\">a 37-8 blowout in November</a>. In that game, the Niners limited the Packers to one third-down conversion from 15 attempts. That\u2019s where the Packers offensive line come in: they\u2019ll have to stop the 49ers\u2019 terrifying defensive line \u2013 stacked with first-round draft picks \u2013 from getting to Rodgers or stymying running back Aaron Jones in short-yardage situations.</p> <p><strong>What the 49ers need to do to win: </strong>Prior to this campaign, San Francisco hadn\u2019t had a winning season since 2013, but their awesome defense, which has been painstakingly and brilliantly constructed over a number of years, have helped turn things around. Much like Mahomes with the Chiefs, if they play to their abilities they should be able to shut the Packers down.</p> <p>You can read the full article below:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/17/nfc-afc-championships-games-packers-49ers-chiefs-titans-nfl\">NFL conference championship picks: a Chiefs-Packers Super Bowl?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read all about it! Of course, it\u2019s always a team effort in the NFL, but in this game one name will stand out for all-time: Raheem Mostert. He carried the ball 29 times for 220 yards at 7.6 yards a run. He also scored four touchdowns in what was a record-setting career day. It meant an easy walk in the park for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo who threw just eight times, an absolutely remarkable total for a pivot capable of taking over a game when necessary. But it wasn\u2019t today. Not with this rushing attack and not with this defense, a unit that let most of its points through during extended garbage time. And now they will face a considerably more formidable opponent in the Super Bowl. Kansas City v San Francisco has enough story lines to keep everybody busy for two weeks - a marquee matchup that we can all look forward to. We will be in Miami in the lead up to the Big Show, and of course, will be here live when it finally kicks off. Until then, thank you for following along with us, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and good night. It\u2019s all over! The San Francisco 49ers are heading back to the Super Bowl after decimating the Green Bay Packers! Packers 20-37 49ers, 0:55 4th quarter The clock is moving and the Niners head to the line in victory formation. So we\u2019re back. Green Bay are at their own 38 and Rodgers is chucking it downfield and right into the hands of Richard Sherman! The San Francisco sideline erupts, the crowd celebrates and the Super Bowl beckons for these 49ers. Packers 20-37 49ers, 2:00 4th quarter Adams is open over the middle and has it for a 16-yard first down completion. We\u2019re at the warning. Packers 20-37 49ers, 2:08 4th quarter Timeout San Francisco, no2. Packers 20-37 49ers, 2:08 4th quarter Rodgers is killing the clock, hading it off to Williams. Not a whole lot of urgency from Green Bay and now Rodgers is sacked! And the ball is loose! Green Bay has possession. Arik Armstead with the quarterback sack. On 3rd &amp; 13, Rodgers launches downfield, incomplete, towards Lazard. That means it\u2019s 4th and season. Gould is good! And the send off to Miami continues for 49ers fans. Packers 20-34 49ers, 3:36 4th quarter Mostert is stopped on third down and the field goal until will come on for a field goal attempt of 42 yards to ice this game just a little bit more. San Francisco call for time, their first of the half. Packers 20-34 49ers, 5:08 4th quarter Mostert has a gain of three yards and Green Bay call their final timeout. FOX TV here in the US are starting to talk about things like the 49ers commitment from ownership in building up this program. That\u2019s the death knell. Packers 20-34 49ers, 5:13 4th quarter Mostert has it, and runs for a first down! Green Bay call their second timeout and the odds get longer for the Packers. Packers 20-34 49ers, 5:42 4th quarter Green Bay call timeout, which is apparently the first of the half. I was sure that I saw them call a timeout earlier but I am wrong. Pass to Mostert, complete. It looks like a first down but there is some confusion. Matt LaFleur is challenging the spot. This is a risky proposition because they could lose a timeout. But they need to win this challenge. He wins the spot and keep their time out. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 1. Huge play again right here. Packers 20-34 49ers, 5:53 4th quarter Garoppolo in the shotgun and he throws towards Kittle and it\u2019s incomplete - with flags! It\u2019s a little ticky tack if you ask me, but it\u2019s probably correct. That\u2019s a huge first down there for San Francisco. They can go back to running now. Packers 20-34 49ers, 6:13 4th quarter Mostert runs and is stopped short of a first down after a run of two and it\u2019s 3rd and 3 - the play of the game right here. Packers 20-34 49ers, 7:29 4th quarter Now Garoppolo throws and now he turns to Kittle, that warm security blanket of a tight end. It\u2019s a catch and run of 19 yards. Green Bay need a play. Packers 20-34 49ers, 8:10 4th quarter So televisions crackle back in Wisconsin on as word travels through the state that the Packers have crawled to within two scores. And we think about what might have been had Green Bay awakened just a little bit earlier. And about the timeout GB had to burn earlier when the game was a done deal. San Francisco start at their own 27. Rodgers rolling to his right, fires and has Sternberger in the back of the endzone! It\u2019s a touchdown! The extra point is good and it\u2019s a two-score game. Now they\u2019re really messing with the gamblers. Do I have to stop making jokes? Packers 13-34 49ers, 8:35 4th quarter Rodgers dumps off to Jones who has a first down catch, out of bounds at the eight. Packers 13-34 49ers, 9:13 4th quarter Adams has a catch at the 14 setting up a 3rd &amp; 2. Packers 13-34 49ers, 9:53 4th quarter Rodgers is chucking the ball around and on 3rd &amp; 5, he airs it out, way down field, and Adams makes an over the shoulder catch, beating Richard Sherman! That\u2019s a 65-yard chunk of cheese and the Pack are approaching the red zone. Packers 13-34 49ers, 11:25 4th quarter Now there\u2019s a false start on San Francisco. They may be trying to drain the clock a la Belichick, a la Vrabel. You won\u2019t see that next year. Will we ever see this punt? Yes! Irvin calls for a fair catch around the nine. Packers 13-34 49ers, 12:17 4th quarter It\u2019s 4th &amp; 1 and San Francisco are going for it. Or not. They try to draw GB offsides to no avail. Now they\u2019ll punt. Packers 13-34 49ers, 12:55 4th quarter Mark Nzeocha, a backup linebacker, smothers the onsides kick. San Francisco take over at the GB 49. Mostert has the ball and runs for three yards. He has 203 total.just one shy of 200. Garoppolo should try handing off with his other hand. Rodgers throws behind Adams and the ball bounces off his hands. So the lead is 21, if you\u2019re keeping score at home. No, Graham was down say the replay officials, so Jones ran it in from one yard out instead. Ho hum. Now they go for two. Hahahaha! So much for their advertising! Maybe if they had Lamar Jackson out there I would pay more attention! Rodgers finds Graham down the middle for a 43-yard strike! It\u2019s under review but he looks like he\u2019s in. I\u2019m gonna keep it up there, that\u2019s how good I feel about this. When we return, Green Bay will go for two. This is your brain on Mostert... ...any questions? Packers 7-34 49ers, end of 3rd quarter Rodgers finds Lazard over the middle and that will keep this futile drive alive, even if the Packers are all but dead. The Niners are one quarter away from the Big Show! Packers 7-34 49ers, 0:20 3rd quarter It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 12 for Green Bay from the GB 43. Rodgers is in the shotgun, has time and throws short to his right. It\u2019s Jimmy G...raham with the catch. And more men down for the Niners, Bosa is one of them, Greenlaw is the other. They\u2019re OK, but these key guys have to come out. We take a break - it\u2019s 4 &amp; 2 at the SF 47. They\u2019re going for it. Packers 7-34 49ers, 2:20 3rd quarter Now Rodgers, one of the NFL\u2019s all-time greats, and one of All-State\u2019s leading brand ambassadors, must suffer the indignity of being run out there for the next quarter and change. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7 on the GB 40. Rodgers is in the shotgun - he finds Jones, who gains six and is short of the first down. And there\u2019s a flag, on the defense! How about that, first down GB! It\u2019s the first penalty committed by San Francisco this game. OK, so Mostert runs again towards the far sideline and once again he has room and once again finds the endzone! It\u2019s the fourth touchdown of the night for Raheem Mostert, a name you will be getting to know if you don\u2019t know it. already. I am talking Wheaties boxes, a shoe deal, maybe even a custom Mostert emoji? Anything is possible at this point. That\u2019s a 22-yard run to pay dirt and he\u2019s now just four yards short of 200! Packers 7-27 49ers, 5:11 3rd quarter There\u2019s more. Samuel is getting the reps, and this time it\u2019s something of an end around - for 32 yards. I guess 32 yard gains are the new normal. San Francisco are at the Green Bay 22. At this point I think we have to ask, will Garoppolo ever pass again? I mean, even against Kansas City. Wishbone offense? Packers 7-27 49ers, 6:46 3rd quarter On 2nd &amp; 3, Mostert runs right for a first down, of course, since he is totally unstoppable. Why stop running now? And that clock just ticks away. Now it\u2019s Samuel running wide around the backfield, towards the far sideline for an eventual gain of 11 yards. I think I could run on Green Bay at this point. No seriously, I could. And I have a bad back. And I am really slow and quite wimpish. Green Bay burns a timeout. I am thinking salty snacks. Rodgers finds Jones who catches and runs relatively untouched into the endzone. Green Bay cut into the lead on a drive that takes up 6:16 of precious time. They still have a lot of work to do of course. Packers 0-27 49ers, 8:44 3rd quarter The Packers convert on third down for the first time this game and are approaching the red zone. Then they are flagged for a false start pushing them back to the 27. Now Rodgers finds Allison on the far sideline for seven. Decent drive - way too late. Lewis has a reception - a catch and run down to the Niners 11. That clock is moving fast... Packers 0-27 49ers, 11:12 3rd quarter Tevin Coleman is out fort the rest of the game with a shoulder injury, not that San Francisco need him. Meanwhile, Adams starts off the half with two catches for 30 yards. Green Bay are on the Niners 45 and on the move. Now there\u2019s some razzle dazzle: a flea flicker that ends in a fizzle. It\u2019s a short gain of eight rather than a momentum swinging big play they were looking for. Then Jones runs for a first down. Bosa limps off the field, evidence that only bad things can happen now for SF as they prepare to face Kansas City. Some injury in and around on the left hip area. Packers on the SF 28. Unfortunately for Green Bay fans, the players and coaches are contractually obligated to come out of the lockers and play a second half of football We\u2019re back! Email: Roy K writes: \u201cAnyway I\u2019m emailing to say Green Bay appear to be on the end of a right shellacking and poor Aaron Rodgers has the sad eyes of a cocker spaniel watching his owners eat prime rib. This may or may not be inspired by my own dog who looks at me this way at almost every meal...\u201d I think I need a snack. Email: Michael v Nick Nick is putting up more of a fight than Green Bay! He writes: Michael is being silly about Aaron Rodgers calling The City as San Fran. The days of being pissy about calling our fair city San Fran or Frisco are long gone. There is so much more that is important than Ess Eff\u2019s nick names. Mr Rodgers grew up in Nor Cal for goodness sake. It is fine he says San Fran. Plus the Niners are really the Silicon Valley Niners these days. Sincerely, Nick Bonnell San Francisco resident Raheem Mostert This man has dismantled the Green Bay Packers, and set a franchise record for playoff rushing yards in the process. In just one half of football, Mostert has run for 160 yards and three touchdowns. That\u2019s a lot. Meanwhile, Garoppolo has six passes all game, none of which have been to their the player who is arguably their biggest weapon on offense: George Kittle. A Green Bay punt ends this quarter and that makes perfect sense. It is complete and total domination by the home team as glasses clink all over the Bay and Silicon valley. Their team is 30 minutes away from a date with the Chiefs in Miami in two weeks time! Packers 0-27 49ers, 0:14 2nd quarter The crowd in Santa Clara are chanting \u201cdefense\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re getting. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s an ineligible receiver downfield for Green Bay. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 12 and the Packers can\u2019t get off the field fast enough. Remember when... ...the NFL passing game had taken over and running back play was cruising towards irrelevancy? Yeah, that seems silly right now. Raheem Mostert is strolling into the endzone for the third time in this game! He is completely unstoppable! There is no halftime speech that I know of that can help Green Bay. If Vince Lombardi came back right now he\u2019d say, hit the showers men. Packers 0-20 49ers, 0:50 2nd quarter Mostert is running again, and again nobody can stop Raheem from eating up chunks of territory. It\u2019s another 10 yards for the running back as SF set up at the GB 19. A false start by Green Bay ends in a 10-second time run off, giving the Packers even less time to make something, anything happen. Here\u2019s something happening - it\u2019s an INTERCEPTION! Moseley picks off Rodgers as Green Bay commit their second turnover! Televisions all over Wisconsin shut off in the hundreds of thousands! Now San Francisco have the ball at the Green Bay 30 and will enjoy another chance to pile on some points. Mess! Email! Michael from San Francisco writes: \u201cIn a pre-game interview Rodgers referred to the city of San Francisco as \u201cSan Fran\u201d For locals that is an absolute no-no - (our city is never referred to as that or \u201cFrisco) and for that reason alone the Packers cannot be allowed to win !! (Can only believe it was an intentional \u2018mis-speak\u2019 by Rodgers as he attended college in the San Francisco Bay Area and should know better...)\u201c Or perhaps Rodgers was just winding up the locals. If he was, that is the only thing he\u2019s done to wind them up today! Robbie Gould has an easy 27-yard field goal to extend the lead. This is a mess for Rodgers and the Packers. Seven before halftime would warm up their ice cold fans, at least a little. Packers 0-17 49ers, 2:00 2nd quarter Garoppolo has a man on the far sideline - it\u2019s Kendrick Bourne who has it but is short of the first down. it\u2019s 4th &amp; 2 from the GB nine. Do they go for the throat here or kick the field goal? We\u2019re at the two minute warning in what has been a speedy first half thanks to the heavy run play. All this offense and we haven\u2019t seen Garoppolo target Kittle yet! Packers 0-17 49ers, 2:10 2nd quarter Garoppolo back to pass, looking for Samuel on a slant, but King breaks it up setting up a key 3rd &amp; 8. Packers 0-17 49ers, 2:41 2nd quarter Garoppolo is in the shotgun: he hands to Mostert who jettisons up the middle for a first down, and more! It\u2019s 10 more yards for the mercurial Mostert who is making quite a name for himself here. The Packers look dead. Packers 0-17 49ers, 3:26 2nd quarter Big 3rd &amp; 2. Green Bay have got to make a stand and hold San Francisco to a field goal. Kyle Shanahan doesn\u2019t like what he sees and uses his first timeout of the half. Packers 0-17 49ers, 3:34 2nd quarter Defensive pass interference starts off the drive for Green Bay - King did the deed on Samuel as he tried to defend the slant. Now Mostert is running right and running far! He has room to roam as he crosses midfield and has himself a 34-yard gain! We all have to be thinking blowout as Mostert has over 100 yards already! What!? San Francisco are already at the Packers 27. A lot on the ground here for Green Bay, and that at the very least gives the defense a breather. But wait - here\u2019s a snap and Rodgers doesn\u2019t have the ball! The ball is on the ground! Who has it? A red shirt! DeForest Buckner recovers a fumble and that is a crucial mistake between Rodgers and center Corey Linsley. Niners take over on their own 25! Oy vey! Packers 0-17 49ers, 6:12 2nd quarter The Packers continue to move - Jones powers to his right for a gain of four and another first down for Green Bay. They\u2019re at the 25 now. Finally some signs of life for Green Bay. Packers 0-17 49ers, 7:55 2nd quarter Alright. Time for Green Bay to take a deep breathe and not panic. Rodgers starts off passing, finding Kumerow over the middle for 23 yards! Now Aaron Jones is running with room! He has another first down after a gain of 11. Suddenly, GB are at the SF 34! Talent like Mostert, who follows a block from Samuel into the far side of the endzone! Again, it is just too easy, as San Francisco\u2019s line controls the play. It is getting extremely ugly for Green Bay. How do you stop this train? Coleman His right arm and hand hang as Coleman deals with what looks to be substantial pain. The cart comes out, for a hand/arm/wrist/elbow injury, which tells you something about the kind of shape the running back is in at the moment. Concerned San Francisco fans can hang their hat on the long line of talent they have at the position. Packers 0-10 49ers, 9:33 2nd quarter Coleman runs for four yards to the 10 but he\u2019s hit and shaken up. he\u2019s on his back forcing an injury timeout. We\u2019ll let you know how banged up Coleman is when we hear. It\u2019s 2nd and 6 when we return. Packers 0-10 49ers, 9:37 2nd quarter Garoppolo with the old Tom Brady QB sneak, gets the first down as the Niners reload on downs at the 14. Packers 0-10 49ers, 11:18 2nd quarter More from Mostert - this time it\u2019s a 13-yard run to his right, around the edge and into pasture. Mostert again! Now it\u2019s on the near side for nine yards, and this is way too easy for San Francisco. Niners at the 16 yard line already. You\u2019re not kidding. My wife won\u2019t stop bringing it up - I\u2019m gonna have a complex by the fourth quarter. Packers 0-10 49ers, 12:32 2nd quarter Now GB starts up again and they need to put something together. But Jones is hit as he catches a second down pass - it\u2019s a loss of three yards as the Niners defense continues to rumble! Big 3rd &amp; 7 coming right here for Green Bay Rodgers is back to pass and now he loses the football - Williams knocks it away! Green Bay recover after a huge loss and it\u2019s an offensive nightmare for GB. And it gets worse - the ensuing punt is just 20 yards to the GB 37. Gut check time has arrived for the Packers. Robbie Gould is good from 54 yards out! So that\u2019s way better than a punt and I stand corrected. That\u2019s his first field goal of over 50 yards this season, so yeah, that was a wee bit aggressive from Shanahan. It pays off as the 49ers get points and a two score lead. Packers 0-7 49ers, end of 1st quarter It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 6 and a huge down right here for Green Bay. From the GB 28, Garoppolo from the shotgun, he has time, and then suddenly there\u2019s no time! Jimmy G is sacked! Kyle Fackrell makes the hit and that\u2019s absolutely enormous play right there. It sends San Francisco back to the 36. They have some options of what to do here on fourth down, but they\u2019ll likely kick it away. We\u2019ll find out after this message from...nobody. Stick with us! Packers 0-7 49ers, 0:44 1st quarter On 2nd &amp; 6, Garoppolo throws incomplete, but Clark is called for roughing the passer! So instead of third down, it sends the Niners 15 yards closer to the endzone. Unnecessary and ill timed penalty right there. GB can\u2019t make mistakes like that. Packers 0-7 49ers, 2:16 1st quarter On second down, Nick Bosa penetrates and wraps up Williams who is trying to run up the middle. That makes it 3rd &amp; 7 after a gain of just one yard. Now Rodgers is back to pass and rolling to his left - everyone is covered and the Packers QB is thrown to the turf! Bosa is there again to make the play! Now Scott punts, James has it and he has some room! He runs to his right to the sideline and turns! James with a 26-yard return! Good field position for San Francisco as they\u2019ll start at their own 49. Green Bay\u2019s defense must make plays and stop the Niners right now or this could get out of hand w=quickly. Packers 0-7 49ers, 4:21 1st quarter OK, so after being held on the first drive of the game, the 49er offense came back, shook off the rust, and kicked into gear with a six play, 89-yard drive. Now, how will the Packers respond? First Geronimo Allison has a short reception for two yards. Then Rogers rolls to his left and throws complete - 13-yard gain to Allen Lazard on the far sideline. Good throw! That moves the chains as Packers fans look for more positives here in the first quarter. Raheem Mostert takes it and he is off and running! Raheem Mostert is nearly untouched! he\u2019s streaking down the near sideline and he\u2019s into the endzone! It\u2019s a 36-yard run for Raheem Mostert! San Francisco have the lead! Packers 0-0 49ers, 6:54 1st quarter More play-action from Garoppolo but this time Green Bay have it covered - Mostert has the catch but he\u2019s wrapped up for a loss of four. It sets up a 3rd &amp; 8. Packers 0-0 49ers, 7:03 1st quarter Garoppolo fakes a handoff, rolls, fires and hits Sanders, who breaks outside and has a first down! That\u2019s a gain of 16 to start it off for the Niners on this drive. Now he hits Samuel again, this time over the middle! No19 is a trip away from a trip to his endzone - instead it\u2019s a 30-yeard gain to the Green Bay 37. The 49ers are moving. Packers 0-0 49ers, 9:52 1st quarter It\u2019s 3rd and three from the GB 47. Rodgers - a short pass to Williams who tries to break outside, can\u2019t break away and then gets just two yards. That sets up a 4th &amp; 1: Green Bay will play it safe and punt it away. Scott boots it to around the 10, fair catch and that\u2019s where San Francisco will start when we return. Solid start for these defenses. Packers 0-0 49ers, 11:52 1st quarter So that\u2019s the big defensive statement Green Bay needed at the start of this game. Now, what of the offense? Rogers starts off with throws to Aaron Jones and then Davante Adams, and there\u2019s a quick first down for the Packers. Packers 0-0 49ers, 13:05 1st quarter Tevin Coleman, back-to-back runs for a total of nine yards sets up a 3rd &amp; 1 on the opening drive. On the third try, Coleman is rejected by Green Back for no gain! Za\u2019Darius Smith, who we wrote about in the pre-blow show as being a potential factor today, gets the stop and San Francisco punts! And the NFC Championship is underway! Green Bay won the toss and they defer. The Packers kick it out of the endzone and here comes Jimmy Garoppolo starting at his 25! Let\u2019s go!! National Anthem OK, try not to freak out buyt Boyz II Men are singing the national anthem, right now, and it\u2019s phenomenal! Donning Niners uniforms, which is not very East Coast Family like, they do a phenomenal job, as the jets fly over Levi\u2019s\u00ae Stadium and the crowd goes wild! It\u2019s a 9/10 easy! Kickoff is moments away - stick with us! Prediction time! There are way too many people on San Francisco for this game to go easy for the 49ers. Yeah, they are blazing fast, and they can score a million ways, and they can get pressure with their front four and can clog the passing lanes, and yeah, the tight end has the most receiving yards of any tight end in NFL history through three seasons. Sure. But, don\u2019t the football Gods want a rematch of Super Bowl I, or as it was known, the AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game? Isn\u2019t Aaron Rodgers still really good? Are the really going to get blown out? Can they win? I think the answer is yes yes yes! Packers 27-20 - print it! Meanwhile, the wife is suddenly very curious about the NFL. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve taken over the TV - she\u2019s non stop! Where\u2019s Tom what\u2019s his name, the one who always wins? And why do they keep saying Janeane Garofalo? Sure, Jerry Rice looks good, but apparently Jimmy Garoppolo looks even better. He\u2019s very good looking. -my wife, just now Vegas! How do the Packers pull this thing off? Well, that\u2019s Matt LeFleur\u2019s job, but one thing we do know is that virtually nobody thinks they can. Just look at the Vegas numbers - a 7.5 point spread in the NFC Championship game is a hefty number indeed. But in short, Green Bay\u2019s defense needs to make a play early, take the crowd out of the game, and deliver a mesdsage-sending cut above an eye, and as fast as possible. Green Bay are not the sexy choice here, this we know, but heck, they did go 13-3 and do have some horses, especially on defense, to deliver. Green Bay need to ride the Smiths, Preston and Za\u2019Darius, who had their way with Seattle\u2019s offensive line to the tune of 18 combined QB pressures last week. Jimmy G hasn\u2019t experienced a whole lot of adversity this season: bring some imbalance to that incredibly balanced offense and hope that Rogers has more than 100 passing yards this time around - that\u2019s the only way this is going to work. To Miami! Andy Reid is heading to his second Super Bowl and he\u2019s taking the Kansas City Chiefs with him after their 35-24 victory over the Tennessee Titans. Read all about it right here: Now, who will they face? We\u2019ll find out shortly, the start of the NFC Championship draws even closer... The Last time In case you were wondering just how bad that thrashing was just eight weeks ago, here, see for yourself. It was pretty thorough. Aaron Rodgers was hit 10 times and sacked five. Meanwhile, the Niners , who were missing Breida, shredded Green Bay defense with Jimmy G making just 20 throws, racking up over 250 yards with two touchdowns and zero picks. Since then San Francisco have gotten back three other starters that didn\u2019t play that day. Gulp. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the NFC Championship game! The San Francisco 49ers are about an hour away from hosting the Green Bay Packers, with the winner set to cross the continent to Miami for Super Bowl LIV (54). We\u2019re really excited to have you with us but can I give you a little advice? For now, stick with the Chiefs and Titans and our live blogger extraordinaire, Hunter Felt, who is monitoring the AFC Championship for us. Once that\u2019s done, come back and read this little spiel below about the Niners and Packers, and get ready for the big game at Levi\u2019s\u00ae Stadium in Santa Clara. So, that spiel: we\u2019re lucky to have got two marquee quarterbacks to entertain us this evening (morning, afternoon): 36-year-old Aaron Rodgers and the kid, Jimmy Garoppolo, who isn\u2019t really a kid at age 28, who is playing on this stage for the first time. All Jimmy G has done since moving from being a would-be successor to Tom Brady in New England to the helm of the 49ers offense is go 22-5, in-between an ACL injury which kept him out for most of 2018. With a win today, Garoppolo takes another leap towards the top of the next generation quarterback class. And San Francisco should win this game, because they have more than enough weapons to do so convincingly. San Francisco\u2019s dynamic offense have the personnel to win any way they like. For example, head coach Kyle Shanahan could punch up a run heavy game plan featuring their three-headed rushing attack of Tevin Coleman, Raheem Mostert and Matt Breida, a trio that combined for close to 2000 yards this season. Or, should Green Bay stack the line, San Francisco could easily lean on Garoppolo, who has the luxury of George Kittle, a tight end who is nearly impossible to tackle, and is literally out there seeking out walls to run through. Defensively San Francisco can pressure the quarterback with just four lineman, which could mean a tough day for Aaron Rodgers. The 15-year veteran is the last of the old generation standing - Brady, Brees Roethlisberger, two Manning brothers, Rivers and other old raisins are either retired, or almost retired, and are certainly not here playing for a shot at the Super Bowl. That\u2019s to his credit, as Rodgers put together a 13-3 season featuring over 4000 yards passing and 26 touchdown tosses against only four picks. Green Bay looked pretty good last week against a Seattle team that had divisional round defeat written all over them. You know when Green Bay didn\u2019t look so good? Back in week 12, when these very same Niners held Rodgers to just 81 yards passing. Final score: 37-8. So the question heading into this rematch is, what did Packers head coach Matt LeFleur learn from that shellacking, and what can he conjure up to turn that result 180 degrees the other way. In a few hours time we\u2019ll know if LeFleur and the Packers have enough to put Rodgers in a position to win his second Super Bowl ring, or, if Jimmy G will be heading to Miami for a shot at his first. We\u2019re getting closer to kickoff and we\u2019ll soon be rolling in more pre-game fun including predictions. What\u2019s your incredibly hot take on the NFC Championship? Feel free to share: tweet me on @lengeldavid or email it to david.lengel.freelance@guardian.co.uk and we\u2019ll make you famous! Please stand by for NFC Championship football - stick with us! David will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s our preview of today\u2019s game: What the Packers need to do to win: As Oliver Connolly pointed out in these pages, Green Bay are no longer in a position in which they need to rely solely on Aaron Rodgers. The future Hall of Famer is still vital though, and if he can pull off the ice-cool third-down throws he made against the Seahawks it could help decide a close game. Green Bay, however, were terrible in those scenarios the last time they played the 49ers, a 37-8 blowout in November. In that game, the Niners limited the Packers to one third-down conversion from 15 attempts. That\u2019s where the Packers offensive line come in: they\u2019ll have to stop the 49ers\u2019 terrifying defensive line \u2013 stacked with first-round draft picks \u2013 from getting to Rodgers or stymying running back Aaron Jones in short-yardage situations. What the 49ers need to do to win: Prior to this campaign, San Francisco hadn\u2019t had a winning season since 2013, but their awesome defense, which has been painstakingly and brilliantly constructed over a number of years, have helped turn things around. Much like Mahomes with the Chiefs, if they play to their abilities they should be able to shut the Packers down. You can read the full article below:",

The Demographia international housing affordability survey studied more than 300 urban housing markets in eight countries and found housing in New Zealand was now more than seven times the median income, making it out of reach for most. The country\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 which has seen the homeless population grow, and the waiting list for a state house reach record highs \u2013 has spread to the provinces, the Act party\u2019s leader, David Seymour, said. \u201cThe effect of this is that even well-paid, professional Kiwis are unable to buy homes in the cities where they work,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a serious threat to productivity, the main driver of our living standards. \u201cIt costs too much and takes too long to build a house. New Zealand is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, but government has driven land prices up with the result that housing has become severely unaffordable.\u201d Seymour said councils around the country needed to urgently free up land to build more houses as the lack of affordable housing is \u201ca serious threat to the middle-class\u201d. Demographia classed unaffordable housing as anything more than three times the median income. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was voted into office in 2017 with a vow to \u201cfix\u201d the housing crisis, but the government\u2019s flagship affordable housing scheme, Kiwibuild, drew the ire of voters after it built only 47 homes in six months. The housing minister who oversaw the Kiwibuild fiasco was sacked and the new minister, Megan Woods, admitted the scheme had been \u201coverly ambitious\u201d. The target of building 100,000 affordable homes in 10 years has been scrapped. Community housing providers said that although the government was trying hard they were not yet seeing real changes and working Kiwis were increasingly falling into precarious housing or homelessness. The opposition spokeswoman on housing, Judith Collins, said Labour had over-promised: \u201c[It] talked a big game on housing but has failed to deliver meaningful change.\u201d The coastal city of Tauranga, which has seen a huge influx of Aucklanders in recent years, has New Zealand\u2019s hottest market, with housing costing 9.3 times the local median wage.

The port city was also the sixth most unaffordable city in the global survey, which looked at urban housing markets in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, the United States and the UK. The affordable housing markets are all located in the US, the survey found, and include Rochester, Oklahoma city, and Cleveland. The least affordable global housing markets are located in New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong. Hong Kong is the least affordable housing market at 20.8, followed by Vancouver, Sydney, Melbourne, Los Angleles, Toronto and Auckland. A co-author of the study, Hugh Pavletich, said housing unaffordability was no longer a crisis.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 50 nationally threatened animal and plant species are believed to have had at least 80% of the area in which they live affected by bushfire, a federal environment department analysis has found. Another 65 have had more than half their area in the fire zone. Scientists have warned some affected species could be pushed to extinction. The worst affected mammal is believed to be the Kangaroo Island dunnart, an endangered mouse-like marsupial endemic to the 160km long South Australian island. It is one of 49 species, including 47 plants and one spider, that have had at least 80% of their likely and known range within fire-hit areas. Seven of the plant species, including the nightcap oak and three types of leek orchid, are critically endangered. Species believed to have had at least half and up to 80% of their living area affected include the endangered long-footed potoroo in New South Wales and Victoria, the glossy black-cockatoo in South Australia, the Blue Mountains water skink, the rufous scrub-bird and three critically endangered turtles. They are among 331 threatened and migratory species that are believed to have had more than 10% of where they live in burned areas across all six states. The list includes 272 species of plant, 16 mammals, 14 frogs, nine birds, seven reptiles, four insects, four fish and one spider. John Woinarski, professor of conservation biology at Charles Darwin University, said: \u201cThis gives us grave concern about the conservation of many threatened species in Australia.\u201d He said it was too early to call extinctions, but that many species had almost all the entire area of their population burned. \u201cIt is all the more reason that we need urgent and sustained action to recover these species,\u201d Woinarski said. \u201cThe emergency board is full and over-flowing.\u201d The analysis includes a special note on the koala, which has been the focus of local and international concern about the impact of the fires on wildlife. About 12% of koala range in NSW, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory \u2013 the three jurisdictions in which it is listed as vulnerable \u2013 is believed to have been affected by fires. Koalas also live in South Australia and Victoria, but are not listed in those states. The threatened species commissioner, Sally Box, said the results were just the first step in understanding the damage wrought by the bushfire crisis, and that the list would be refined. She said some species on the list were likely to have been worse affected than others, giving the example of the critically endangered Wollemi pine, or \u201cdinosaur tree\u201d. The last known natural stand of Wollemi pine is in the fire zone and it appears on the list, but the NSW government last week announced it had been saved by firefighters. \u201cSome species are more vulnerable to fire than others and some areas were more severely burned than others, so further analysis will be needed before we can fully assess the impact of the fires on the ground,\u201d Box said. \u201cAlready we are seeing positive examples of threatened species having survived the fires.\u201d The desktop analysis compared maps of areas burned between August and 13 January with distribution maps of species listed under national environment laws. Box said it would help decide where $50m in initial federal wildlife recovery funding was spent. The department said some species included in the list might live near, but not in, the areas affected by the fires. Others might have had a larger proportion of the range burned than the preliminary analysis suggested. The analysis gave the example of the western ground parrot as a species that might be worse affected than first thought. It warned that some species not currently listed as threatened would have had their range affected by fire and might now qualify as threatened. The department would be \u201cconsidering assessments of these species in the near future\u201d. Woinarski, a member of an expert panel of scientists working with Box on wildlife recovery but not speaking in that capacity, stressed fire response would vary between species, with some plants thriving while others did not cope. He said the response to the fires needed to include development of better models showing the distribution of species and rapid on-ground inspections. He said examining the impact on wildlife not already listed as threatened was urgent. \u201cMany of those species may now be seriously imperilled,\u201d he said. Conservation groups have called on the government to use an ongoing review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, led by the businessman Graeme Samuel, to boost wildlife protection in the wake of the bushfires. Hundreds of scientists last year warned the laws needed to be strengthened to help address what was already a worsening extinction crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Former Australian War Memorial director Brendan Nelson has taken a senior job with Boeing, a company that controversially gave corporate sponsorship to the institution. Nelson prompted significant criticism during his seven-year stint as AWM director for allowing weapons companies to act as corporate sponsors. The AWM lists Boeing, Thales, Lockheed Martin and BAE systems among its corporate partners, and allows some to attach their names to individual parts of the AWM such as the BAE Systems Theatre, a conferencing facility. Allowing weapons companies to sponsor a memorial to Australia\u2019s war dead prompted criticism from former AWM director Brendon Kelson and the Medical Association for Prevention of War, which described the arrangement as \u201ccontemptible\u201d. Nelson, also a former Australian defence minister, left his role as AWM head at the end of last year. On Monday, Boeing announced that Nelson would become president of Boeing Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific. The company\u2019s announcement said he would lead the company\u2019s work in defence systems, commercial airplane manufacturing, research and development and autonomous systems. Nelson will also head its community engagement efforts, including veteran outreach. In a statement announcing the appointment, Nelson said it was an honour to join Boeing. \u201cToday, Boeing Australia employees are working across the country in high-tech jobs that help define and deliver the future of aviation and defence \u2013 not just for Australian customers but for the world,\u201d he said. Nelson has staunchly defended the AWM\u2019s acceptance of arms manufacturer sponsorship. He argues arms companies had a corporate responsibility to help explain \u201cwhat is being done in the name of our country\u201d. Nelson, in his capacity as AWM director, has personally thanked Boeing and other arms manufacturers for their \u201cgenerous\u201d support. Kelson, a former AWM director from 1990 to 1994, said he was not particularly surprised by the appointment, and said he still believed there was a conflict posed by the AWM\u2019s relationships with weapons companies. \u201cWhile he was there at the memorial engaging with various manufacturers and purveyors of arms, I thought there was a moral conflict there,\u201d Kelson told the Guardian. \u201cMy personal view was that the memorial, in engaging with those companies \u2026 it was about as appropriate as a tobacco company offering money to the Peter MacCallum institute for cancer. An AWM spokesman said Nelson was \u201cfree to accept such a role\u201d as a private citizen. The spokesman also said Boeing has been a corporate partner since 2011. Nelson began his term as director in late 2012. \u201cWe understand Dr Brendan Nelson AO has taken up a position in the private sector with Boeing Australia. As a private citizen, he is free to accept such a role,\u201d the spokesman said. It is not the first time Nelson has taken work with arms companies. While he was still AWM director, Nelson took a job advising Thales, the French multinational. The job entitles Nelson to a fee, but he said he donated all the money to the AWM. Internal documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the Thales job prompted some internal concern at the AWM. The laws governing the AWM generally prohibit directors from taking payments for outside work, unless ministerial approval is first obtained. When Nelson obtained the approval, then veteran affairs minister Michael Ronaldson warned him to ensure the two roles did not come into conflict. \u201cWhere the two roles could potentially be in conflict, I ask that you take the necessary steps to avoid these circumstances,\u201d Ronaldson told him.",

Analysis by the YMCA youth charity found that local authority expenditure on youth services dropped from \u00a31.4bn in 2010-11 to just under \u00a3429m in 2018-19, resulting in the loss of 750 youth centres and more than 4,500 youth workers. Spending is at its lowest point in a generation, according to the YMCA, and cuts have been so severe that youth services in some areas, including Trafford, Medway, Luton and Slough, have completely lost their funding. Youth services in England have been worse affected than Wales, according to YMCA analysis of local authority spending. Last year, funding for youth services accounted for just 4% of local spending on children and young people\u2019s services in England, compared with 13% in 2010-11. Youth services are seen by those working in the sector as vital in the fight against knife crime, but cash-strapped local authorities \u2013 whose funding from central government has dramatically declined \u2013 say they have been forced to divert money to frontline services, protecting children at immediate risk of harm. According to YMCA analysis, every region in England has suffered cuts of at least 60% since 2010, rising to 74% in the north-west, 76% in the north-east and 80% in the West Midlands. Gateshead, Nottingham and Norfolk have suffered cuts of more than 90%. The research confirms and builds on previous warnings by the YMCA. While cuts were most acute in 2011-12 when funding was reduced by more than a quarter, in the past year alone youth services in England lost \u00a326m in real terms \u2013 a 6% cut on the previous year.

Before the budget on 11 March, the YMCA is calling for youth services funding to return to 2010-11 levels in real terms and for the introduction of a national youth services strategy. Responding to the YMCA research, the government said councils in England would have access to \u00a349.1bn next year, \u201cthe biggest annual real-terms increase in spending power in a decade\u201d and pointed to a new \u00a3500m youth investment fund. \u201cCouncils, not central government, are best placed to know what their communities need and they take decisions about how much they spend on youth services,\u201d a government spokesperson said.

Over half a million people came to them for help in 2018-19. \u201cThese figures show the increasing levels of support needed by people with nowhere else to turn,\u201d said Donal Watkin, chief executive of the Association of Charitable Organisations, which represents more than 120 benevolent charities. The rise in demand, say the charities, is driven by collapsing living standards and static wages, and the pressures of precarious and stressful working lives, against a backdrop of cuts to the NHS, care services and welfare benefits. The funds were set up originally by occupational groups \u2013 sailors, vicars, accountants, actors and musicians, engineers, for example \u2013 or by parishes in the years before state pensions and social security to provide charitable assistance to members or local residents who faced destitution. Although they fell into decline after the creation of the welfare state, many funds have now rebranded and modernised in response to new demand: the Society for the Assistance of Ladies in Reduced Circumstances, for example, has become the Smallwood Trust; the Distressed Gentlefolks\u2019 Aid Association has become Turn2Us. Surviving on endowments and in some cases topped up by donations and fundraising, the benevolent funds are tiny compared with the mighty billions of the welfare state, but they act as a tracker both of wider societal trends and the receding frontiers of state-provided social security. In recent years they have experienced a switch in demand from end-of-life assistance to help for younger working-age beneficiaries, often in decent jobs but with few savings who find that a single adverse event \u2013 illness, unemployment \u2013 can trigger a spiralling crisis, one compounded if the state safety net is inadequate.

The Charity for Civil Servants stepped in on several occasions where current and former civil servants with chronic disease or disability had been denied home adaptation grants by local councils, coming to the rescue with grants of more than \u00a310,000. \u201cIf the local authority says a person isn\u2019t eligible for help, and a grant from us is the only way that person can have a normal quality of life, why wouldn\u2019t we do it?\u201d said Flavia Gapper, director of help and advice at the Charity for Civil Servants. Glasspool Charity Trust, a general poverty fund that spent nearly \u00a31.7m last year on grants for basic household appliances such as washing machines, cookers and beds, says homelessness, domestic violence, mental illness, in-work poverty and debt caused by long waits for universal credit are among the key drivers of demand. Demand surged after the coalition scrapped the social fund in 2013 in favour of local welfare provision, which subsequently collapsed in many parts of England. In these \u201cwelfare deserts\u201d cash-strapped councils rely increasingly on charities such as Glasspool, as well as food banks and faith groups, to help poor people in crisis. Glasspool\u2019s chief executive, Julie Green, warned that it would not be able to provide unlimited help for the increasing numbers of people who could no longer rely on the state for help: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to replicate state funding, but the goalposts of what constitutes state funding have moved.\u201d Damon Gibbons, director of the Centre for Responsible Credit, said rising demand for general hardship funds reflected the growth of destitution and extreme poverty. \u201cThese charities have always existed to cover for the holes in the safety net but the holes have got bigger and they are struggling to fill the gap.\u201d \u2018I was reminded people do care\u2019 Emily Beardall, 44, had just qualified with a degree in pharmacy when she was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). \u201cI couldn\u2019t work.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s energy watchdog has warned the oil and gas industry that it risks a public backlash by failing to act on the climate crisis in favour of making short-term profits. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil companies must balance their desire for near-term returns and a long-term future by playing a much more significant role in combating the climate crisis. The IEA is preparing to make its most direct call for oil companies to help tackle the climate crisis at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday. The oil and gas industry faces \u201ctwin threats\u201d to its financial profitability and social acceptability, according to the IEA. \u201cThere are already signs of both, whether in financial markets or in the reflexive antipathy towards fossil fuels that is increasingly visible in the public debate, at least in parts of Europe and North America,\u201d it said. Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cNo energy company will be unaffected by clean-energy transitions. Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option.\u201d The report said that although some oil and gas companies have taken steps to support efforts to combat the climate crisis, the industry as a whole could play a much more significant role. Oil companies could do more now to help shrink the industry\u2019s giant carbon footprint but most companies were yet to play a meaningful role, according to the report. The world\u2019s oil companies have channelled less than 1% of their spending towards alternative energy technologies outside of oil and gas, despite growing calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The leading oil companies spend about 5%, the report said. The IEA has called on the oil industry to use its \u201cextensive knowhow and deep pockets\u201d to help accelerate the development of clean energy and carbon capture technologies that could help absorb the greenhouse gas from factories before they enter the atmosphere. Last week Microsoft announced plans to establish a $1bn (\u00a3770m) fund dedicated to \u201ccarbon reduction, capture, and removal technologies\u201d and aims to become \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030. The IEA report found that the combined spending of large oil and gas companies in projects beyond oil and gas was just over $2bn last year. \u201cWithout the industry\u2019s input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,\u201d Birol said. \u201cThe first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the carbon footprint of their own operations. As of today, around 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers.\u201d Birol said a large part of these emissions could be brought down relatively quickly and easily by investing in technology that can stop methane leaking from fossil fuel projects into the atmosphere. The IEA has faced scathing criticism in the past that it is undermining the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy by mapping out influential future energy scenarios \u2013 used by governments to help set energy policy \u2013 which are not aligned with global climate targets. The IEA has called for a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of policymakers, investors and oil executives to work together to tackle the climate crisis but this is the first report to focus directly on the role for oil and gas companies in the energy transition. In Europe, major oil companies are facing rising public opposition, including a growing number of cultural institutions that have said they will no longer accept financial support from oil and gas companies.

The European Investment Bank vowed late last year to end its support for fossil fuels within the next two years to become the world\u2019s first \u201cclimate bank\u201d, but 32 gas projects are still eligible for funding before the crackdown. The majority of these projects would waste billions of euros of taxpayers\u2019 money, according to Artelys, an independent data science company, because they would be left as \u201cstranded assets\u201d in the move towards cleaner energy. The report warns that gas investments will be unnecessary in the decades ahead because Europe already has enough infrastructure \u2013 such as pipelines and processing plants \u2013 to meet the continent\u2019s future demand. The European commission set out a sweeping Green Deal plan late last year which aims to create a carbon-neutral EU by 2050, in part by increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency. Under Europe\u2019s climate action roadmap, gas demand is expected to fall by almost 30% by 2030 compared with 2015 levels. But even in scenarios in which gas demand climbs higher, the report found that new investments in gas infrastructure would be \u201csuperfluous\u201d from an economic perspective. The report said Europe\u2019s existing gas projects could even withstand a wide range of extreme disruptions to gas pipelines, including year-long supply shocks to gas from Ukraine, Belarus or Algeria, by importing shipments of liquefied natural gas through existing port terminals. Claude Turmes, Luxembourg\u2019s energy minister, said it \u201cmakes absolutely no sense\u201d that EU decision-makers are supporting investments in new gas infrastructure with public funds. \u201cThis report debunks the argument that these investments would be needed for the EU\u2019s security of gas supply. We risk wasting \u20ac29bn on future stranded assets while locking our energy system into fossil gas addiction for the next 40 years,\u201d he said. According to Artelys the European commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, has overestimated the gas infrastructure needed because Europe\u2019s investment planning is handled separately for gas and electricity projects. The modelling experts said future investment planning should be integrated because the move to tackle the climate crisis will spur demand for renewable electricity to replace gas in the energy system. \u201cWe need to prioritise renewable energy investments over the interests of the European and international gas industry,\u201d Turmes said. Lisa Fischer, a senior policy adviser at the climate thinktank E3G, said the report proves that \u201cit\u2019s possible to safely divert from the \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach to planning and funding energy infrastructure in the EU\u201d. \u201cWe have the technology needed for a clean energy transition.
