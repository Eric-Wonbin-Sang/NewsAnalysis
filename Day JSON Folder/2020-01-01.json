Working alongside bowlers of minimal velocity and negligible spin, he has been a one-person wrecking ball, bowling with great skill, intelligence and endurance. Through his bouncer barrage, not one of Australia\u2019s batters has been able to dominate him. Bouncers require so much skill and exertion that bowlers typically use it as a short-term tactic, for physical reasons as much as anything else. But it appears Wagner does not know how to stop. And his intimidation doesn\u2019t cease there. Per his Perth press conference, he also appears to be prepared to pronounce \u201cLabuschagne\u201d in the way Marnus says it\u2019s intended. Few things upset some Australians more.</p> <p>Cultural vagaries aside, while Friday looms as New Zealand\u2019s last chance to strike a meaningful blow this series, more likely is an Australian procession on the back of unremitting pace and pressure. Though much like Sydney\u2019s fireworks, for many this Test\u2019s joy may be deeply subdued \u2013 its hazy spirit now replaced by actual haze.</p>",

Tom Blundell batted brilliantly for his second innings hundred in Melbourne, but it\u2019s difficult to look past the relentlessness of Australia\u2019s fast bowling at this moment. It evokes memories of late last century \u2013 if McGrath doesn\u2019t get you, Gillespie will. If you see them off, enjoy Brett Lee. Now that\u2019s done, here\u2019s Shane Warne. For the New Zealand batters, it\u2019s hard to know where the break arrives. Even Marnus Labuschagne now averages a tick over 30 with the ball. Though while they\u2019re here, the Australian public would do well to enjoy Neil Wagner\u2019s work. Working alongside bowlers of minimal velocity and negligible spin, he has been a one-person wrecking ball, bowling with great skill, intelligence and endurance. Through his bouncer barrage, not one of Australia\u2019s batters has been able to dominate him. Bouncers require so much skill and exertion that bowlers typically use it as a short-term tactic, for physical reasons as much as anything else. But it appears Wagner does not know how to stop. And his intimidation doesn\u2019t cease there. Per his Perth press conference, he also appears to be prepared to pronounce \u201cLabuschagne\u201d in the way Marnus says it\u2019s intended. Few things upset some Australians more. Cultural vagaries aside, while Friday looms as New Zealand\u2019s last chance to strike a meaningful blow this series, more likely is an Australian procession on the back of unremitting pace and pressure. Though much like Sydney\u2019s fireworks, for many this Test\u2019s joy may be deeply subdued \u2013 its hazy spirit now replaced by actual haze.",

Speaking of hangovers, Arsenal are still trying to get over the one induced by pumping 75% proof Unai Emery into their veins. New boss Mikel Arteta looks to have brought some endeavour and freedom to Arsenal\u2019s attacking players but the same old issues continue in defence and it cost them two late goals and the match against Chelsea. Arteta will be hoping he can secure his first win tonight but that will not be as easy as it seemed a couple of months ago.</p> <p>Manchester United have lost just once in their last nine games and will be hoping to carry that fine form on at the Emirates. Paul Pogba could be brought back into the side after sitting out the relatively routine 2-0 win over Burnley. Unlike Arsenal, United have plenty of players who have found consistency and look like they could genuinely challenge for a top-four spot. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are very much on the same wavelength and Fred is running things from midfield, which is a bit of a shock considering the fact he spent a long time at the club looking woefully out of his depth and it\u2019s even better news due to the injury to Scott McTominay. The United defence was never in trouble at Turf Moor, an impressive feat for a side who have struggled to keep cleansheets this season, not helped by their goalkeeper chucking one in. </p> <p>It\u2019s a new year and new beginnings, which is cracking news for Arteta, while Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will just want to carry on where he left off last year. </p> <p>Should be a cracker under the lights.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 8pm GMT</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-01T18:30:56.414Z\">at 6.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining me for an enjoyable New Year\u2019s Day. Here\u2019s the match report, which includes the word \u2018mojo\u2019 in the headline. Van Persie pointing out how many times Rashford and Martial made dozens of great runs but never received the ball. A sign of United\u2019s issues. A very honest interview from Luiz, who points out the team were unhappy and unfit under Emery. Luiz: \u201cI think it was great. We did a great first-half and we were a mature team in the second. \u201cPhysically we are not ready. When you are physically not there you have to show heart. \u201cWe are trying to change things but you can\u2019t go from zero to 10 in one day. It\u2019s great to see how committed the kids are. \u201cMikel is a great coach. I think he can improve every single player. In life, when you are happy, results can be a lot different.\u201d Sokratis: \u201cWe have to start again. We have a lot of space to improve. Second half we did not play like the first half but I think every game is better. The fans are back and I hope the new year brings the best. \u201cWe are not ready to fight for 90 minutes and this second half again today we were struggling but every players like the way we play.\u201d Don\u2019t take my word for it ... United just could not create anything of use. Lingard and Pereira were frankly poor (and have been for a while). Surely Solskjaer must do all he can to sign Christian Eriksen. Mesut Ozil completed 90 minutes which is a rare sight. I say this without any research but it\u2019s certainly a positive for Arsenal. The Emirates is singing Sweet Caroline while Arteta goes to each member of his team to celebrate. They players seem to like him, that\u2019s for sure. A fine first-half performance from Arsenal was enough to see them through. Their attacking players excelled and created two well-worked goals, while their defence solid throughout and United just could not break it down. 90+2 mins: There\u2019s been plenty off huffing and puffing from United but without any real quality in the final third, which must worry Solskjaer. The latest being Mata finding Rashford in the box but he volleys into Leno\u2019s chest. Keown gives Luiz Man of the Match. It could have been a number of players in their defensive ranks. Torreira and Xhaka have also been excellent. 90 mins: Four minutes added on. 89 mins: Aubameyang breaks clear of Fred, who tries to take him down but fails. The striker gets to the edge of the box and tries to find the marauding Nelson but the cross is not good enough and United clear. Daire Finnie offers: \u201cMaguire on course to be United\u2019s most expensive mistake since Pogba. He may yet come good but the first 20 odd games for United he has been by far the weakest link in defence..even when Young has played.\u201d 87 mins: If Arteta\u2019s methods are going to work then he needs a fitter squad. Other (better) teams than United will break them down if they are this fatigue in the second half. They are still holding on here. 85 mins: Arsenal are playing very deep and United just cannot find a way through at the moment. 83 mins: Torreira has taken on some energy gel and is battling his way through the final few minutes. 81 mins: Arsenal have some issues. Lacazette is down, Torreira looks done for. Arteta only has one sub left. In the end Guendouzi replaces Lacazette. Mata replaces Matic for United. 79 mins: Aubameyang cuts in from the left, dribbles towards the box, gives it to Lacazette who opens his body up but whacks his shot high and wide from 20 yards. Saka leads a break out from Arsenal, using his fresh legs to dribble beyond on the United defence but he shoots off-balance and it trickles into De Gea\u2019s hands. 77 mins: Guendouzi is ready to come on, one assumes for Torreira. 75 mins: Fred swings in a cross from the right, after the referee has a word with Sokratis about something or other, which Leno punches clear. Arsenal break and Ozil plays a fine pass for Lacazette to run onto but the Frenchman is static. 73 mins: United are penning Arsenal in and the hosts are struggling to hold them back. Greenwood collects the ball on the edge of the area and strikes a low drive which Leno drops on top of. 71 mins: Martial pulls the ball back from the byline, Fred collects it and lays it off to Wan-Bissaka who takes the ball into the box and goes down under a challenge. United call for a penalty, Arsenal claim its a dive and VAR gives nothing. 69 mins: Kolasinac has dropped to the floor with his usual ankle issue and he is replaced by Saka. I would argue the second was not a bookable offence but it was a close call. You do indeed have a point. 67 mins: Holding looked like he was coming on but he\u2019s put his training gear back on. Maybe someone has a problem in the Arsenal defence ... 65 mins: United are putting pressure on the Arsenal defence. Martial drives into the Arsenal box only to be crowded out but he gets the ball to Pereira, who lays it off to Rashford and he curls a shot just over the bar. 63 mins: Pepe departs and Nelson comes on. Martial pushes the Arsenal man off the side of the pitch to speed up proceedings. This tweet was supposed to be sent to Metro, I believe. 61 mins: Arsenal have certainly slowed down in this half, like they did against Chelsea. They need to work on their fitness so they can keep up the tempo required by Arteta for 90 minutes. 59 mins: Matic turns himself inside and out on the edge and then works it through to Pereira but he snatches at the shot and it whacks into the side netting. I am not saying it is the rules, just that it could be a factor in the referee\u2019s mind. Send your complaint letter to Chris Kavanagh. 57 mins: Pereira and Greenwood are on for United. Lingard is coming off, as he\u2019s been awful, and James is also withdrawn. 55 mins: James gets into the box and spots a gap at the front post so tries a cheeky shot but Leno gets down well and holds on. Fred whacks one from 25 yards with his right boot but it\u2019s right down Leno\u2019s throat. 53 mins: Lingard fires a shot from 20 yards but it is blocked by Luiz in the area. United are having more of the ball in this half but struggling to do anything with it. 51 mins: United have sent a few players out to warm up. Changes must be coming. 49 mins: Martial dissects the defence with a pass but it\u2019s got too much on it for Rashford and calmly dribbles into Leno\u2019s arms. Fred again scythes down Lacazette and still avoids a booking. Kolasinac got carded in the opening few minutes for a little push. The referee has been inconsistent. 47 mins: Luiz comes out of defence to whack the ball against James for his own amusement. Fred then catches Lacazette on the shin but the referee takes no further action. No changes for United but surely it cannot be long until Solskjaer rolls the dice. Here we go again! Dael Morris points out: \u201cUnited look woeful. You\u2019ve been right that the problems are with Matic, who\u2019s simply outpaced, and Shaw, who\u2019s simply not good or smart enough, but you have to credit the Arsenal team\u2019s willingness to press everyone in possession. United look stunned every time they\u2019re closed down. Also, both Lindelof and Maguire are at fault for the goals. They both need to be closing down attackers and in the case of both goals the goal scorers have far too much time to decide what to do, mainly because the defenders are clueless. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird game to watch as a United supporter, because United look like they have never really started and are trying to remember what they were told in the briefing, rather than deal with what they\u2019re actually facing. It\u2019s all common this season to see United play like they\u2019re learning.\u201d Certainly the best I\u2019ve seen Arsenal play for a long old while. I am taking nothing away from them. Already on a booking, so a touch of lenience added? Martin Lancon asks about Luiz: \u201cHow does he get away with it, two off the ball fouls, both seen by VAR, one given as foul, surely yellow in hindsight after first. He used to get away with it at Chelsea as well, sneakily dirty player but never carded because never seen by ref the type of incident that I thought was one of the reasons for VAR.\u201d He knows when to do it to avoid the glare of the officials. David Moyes is a genius. Yeah, to be fair it was. I am just trying to rebuild Ozil\u2019s reputation singlehandedly. Peter Oh tries to bring intelligent thought to this blog: \u201cThe Arsenal attack asking questions that the United defence can\u2019t answer. The Sokratic method?\u201d United looked bright in the opening few minutes but have been woeful since. There\u2019s been plenty of zip about Arsenal and they thoroughly deserve the lead with their front four looking extremely dangerous whenever the ball goes near them. 45 mins: One minute added on. 44 mins: The Emirates is bouncing, something which has not happened for a while. United need to change things at half-time. Greenwood on for Lingard? Ozil drifts into space, collects the ball and picks a pass over the top to Maitland-Niles\u2019 run down the right but his cross is blocked by Maguire. The resulting inswinging corner from Pepe is flicked on at the front post by Lacazette and De Gea can only palm it into the danger zone where Sokratis is waiting to smash the ball in from a few yards out. 40 mins: Lacazette drifts out to the right from where he bends in a super cross along the six-yard line but there is no one there to meet it. Arsenal are definitely a more attacking and inventive force under Arteta. Long may it continue. 38 mins: De Gea\u2019s latest error sees him try to whack a clearance straight into Lacazette but it just clips the striker and goes about 18 yards to Pepe, who pikcks up the ball, cuts in and curls a shot against the base of the post. A let-off for De Gea and United. 36 mins: Arsenal have been on top in this game since the opener and United do not seem to have a gear change. Is it down to the fixture schedule or just a bad performance? It might not be a bad idea. Lingard also not in the game. 34 mins: Torreira is the next to have a pop. He spins on the edge of the box, gets the ball onto his left foot and swings through his shot but the ball goes inches wide of De Gea\u2019s left-hand post. 32 mins: Lacazette should double the lead. Pepe lays it into Lacazette in the area, he spins Maguire but then sends his shot closer to the corner flag than the goal. 30 mins: Maguire then seems to catch Lacazette when jumping for a header but the referee sees nothing in it. It looks like Maguire catches the striker in the back of the head with his elbow, leaving the Frenchman to rub his head. There is nothing malicious in it but it should be a foul. 28 mins: Martial drives into the area but Sokratis gets round to clear the ball out of a throw. A less successful intervention from a centre-back sees Maguire clean out Ozil about five seconds late to stop a counter-attack. 26 mins: One obvious thing about United is how much they miss McTominay in the middle of the park. No one else can match his energy in there and things just look quite sluggish. To mix things up, a long ball is played over the top for Rashford to chase but Leno reads the danger and comes outside of his box to head clear. I think turning the defence and using the pace of their attackers could be a fruitful concept tonight. 24 mins: United are popping the ball around a bit but they are struggling with the final pass. A fine joke: 22 mins: It might not be his best position but Aubameyang is dangerous on the left, whipping in a delightful cross with the outside of his boot which just defeats everyone and Shaw clears. Ian Collins writes in to discuss poor Luke: \u201cAre we saying that Jose was right about the once great hope for England left back and that he\u2019s just not that good?\u201d I agree with Mourinho on everything. 20 mins: Arsenal\u2019s front four seem to have a better understanding than United\u2019s who are yet to click tonight, playing some sloppy passes as attacks keep breaking down. 18 mins: Maitland-Niles pulls down Rashford, who for added effect jumps up a bit to show it is a foul. United need to get Fred on the ball a bit more as Matic just does not have the passing range to cause problems. 16 mins: This sounds delightful ... as a fellow south Londoner, I can confirm this is not a regular occurrence but I am also quite pro-Pepe. 14 mins: Luiz is done for holding Martial on the halfway line, which is frankly pointless. He looks to be playing on the edge tonight. 12 mins: Shaw might be in a for dreadful evening trying to stop Pepe, purely because the United man isn\u2019t actually very good. He does not look smart enough to keep the Arsenal man quiet. 10 mins: Just before the goal I was typing about how United had started the better but needed to make the most of it. They proved me right. Pepe almost turns provider by rinsing Shaw just outside the area - in the end the defender does well to not give away a penalty - the winger then lifts a ball to the back post to Aubameyang who volleys over. Some fantastic work down the left flank from Kolasinac sees the defender get to the byline, from where he pulls the ball back into a dangerous area to a waiting Pepe and he sidefoots the ball into the back of the net. 6 mins: Maitland-Niles puts his team into trouble by passing the ball straight to Lingard who drives forward and slips in James but Arsenal recover and the ball is diverted behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 4 mins: Kolasinac bundles over James who is far too quick for the full-back. The Arsenal defender in the end gets booked for his indiscretion - not good news for a man who is up against one of the fastest players in league. Fred whips in the set-piece but Leno comes out and punches clear. Martial is also unhappy after being caught late by Luiz, who gets away with it. 2 mins: United start the game brightly and break on Arsenal, resulting in Lingard laying it off to Rashford who lines up a drive from 25 yards which dips and bounces but Leno gets himself behind it. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are in the tunnel but I doubt we will see any Vieira v Keane-esque shenanigans. Looks quiet. I think it\u2019s fair to say it is a crisp day in London. Lovely night for a zipping the ball around the Emirates. The battle for second is still on! Graham Fulcher asks: \u201cRe the small piece of news. I wonder if they would have been better extending the loan. Some players with Championship experience could prove invaluable next year.\u201d I have a feeling he will be off elsewhere. Bristol City are very interested. Paul Mullally brings the pleasantries: \u201cFirst off happy new year. As a lifelong United fan, Pogba missing tonight\u2019s game is not surprising players hold the power in this day and age is Mino Raiola up to some mischief? Anyway enjoy the game United 2 Gooners 1.\u201d Happy New Year to everyone! Even Mino. Small piece of Arsenal news: they have recalled Eddie Nketiah from Leeds. BT Sport have been surprisingly smug about being on air all day. It\u2019s literally your job, lads. And well done for making Manchester United fans travel down to London for an 8pm kick-off. Kim Doyle is hoping for goals: \u201cIt is a new year for the Gunners and an offensive look that all the fans have been waiting for \u2013 Auba, Laca, Ozil and Pepe all starting. Perhaps a flurry of goals will follow.\u201d Not a good sign ... Paul Pogba is \u201cfeeling some discomfort in his ankle and he\u2019ll be out for a few weeks - definitely\u201d, says Solskjaer. Hmmm ... Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. Some potential January moves in this morning\u2019s Rumour Mill ... I am expecting Aubameyang to play on the left, which is a shame as it\u2019s certainly not his best position but Arteta has obviously decided the way to go is to get all his best players onto the pitch and fit them into a formation. Bill emails in: \u201cRe the 606 call (18.57), any analysis of Arsenal\u2019s descent will have to include a look at the seemingly entitled, paranoid, delusional, highly critical parts of the fan base, I\u2019d say. I think Arteta seems to have a great plan and be acting intelligently. No wonder he\u2019s had to spend time rallying the fans, but should that be necessary? I can see the point of being vocal where it\u2019s due (Emery was a mistake from the off), but surely support should go the other way, from fan to club\u201d Welcome to a new year. No Pogba once again for United, which will fuel a few rumours, I am sure. He didn\u2019t feature at Burnley due to some degree of fatigue. Can he still be tired? January business for United? Xhaka and Torreira are paired together as the wall to stop Manchester United and that Arsenal front four looks rather exciting: Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang and Lacazette. Matic keeps his place in midfield for United, while Shaw will line up against Pepe, which will be an intriguing battle. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Sokratis, Luiz, Kolasinac, Xhaka, Torreira, Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Martinez, Ceballos, Holding, Nelson, Willock, Guendouzi, Saka. Manchester United: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Matic, Fred, James, Lingard, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Romero, Jones, Mata, Pereira, Young, Greenwood, Williams. An Arsenal \u2018fan\u2019 has just phoned up 606 to say they are going down and Aubameyang and Lacazette aren\u2019t good enough. I know things aren\u2019t great the the moment but to say the Gunners will be relegated is bizarre. Odd chap. Here\u2019s David Hytner on Mikel Arteta\u2019s worries. Happy New Year! Hopefully by now your hangover has subsided and you have moved back onto solids. Speaking of hangovers, Arsenal are still trying to get over the one induced by pumping 75% proof Unai Emery into their veins. New boss Mikel Arteta looks to have brought some endeavour and freedom to Arsenal\u2019s attacking players but the same old issues continue in defence and it cost them two late goals and the match against Chelsea. Arteta will be hoping he can secure his first win tonight but that will not be as easy as it seemed a couple of months ago. Manchester United have lost just once in their last nine games and will be hoping to carry that fine form on at the Emirates. Paul Pogba could be brought back into the side after sitting out the relatively routine 2-0 win over Burnley. Unlike Arsenal, United have plenty of players who have found consistency and look like they could genuinely challenge for a top-four spot. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are very much on the same wavelength and Fred is running things from midfield, which is a bit of a shock considering the fact he spent a long time at the club looking woefully out of his depth and it\u2019s even better news due to the injury to Scott McTominay. The United defence was never in trouble at Turf Moor, an impressive feat for a side who have struggled to keep cleansheets this season, not helped by their goalkeeper chucking one in. It\u2019s a new year and new beginnings, which is cracking news for Arteta, while Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will just want to carry on where he left off last year. Should be a cracker under the lights. Kick-off: 8pm GMT",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has emerged as an early frontrunner in the Labour leadership race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn after a poll of members suggested he was the first choice in all regions of the UK, age groups and social classes. The shadow Brexit secretary is yet to formally launch his campaign but is expected to do so in the first few weeks of the new year. The new leader will be elected in March after Corbyn said he would step down following the party\u2019s catastrophic general election defeat. Polling by YouGov for the Party Members Project put Starmer as winning with a 61% vote share to 39% for the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, in the last round. Jess Phillips, the chair of the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, who has yet to declare if she is running, was the third most popular choice among members, who were surveyed between 20 and 30 December. The results at this preliminary stage suggest that the winner is unlikely to come from the left of the party, according to Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, who jointly ran the poll with the University of Sussex. \u201cThis is not shaping up to be a 2015-style Labour leadership contest. Unless potential candidates drop out before the start of voting, it may take a few rounds to decide the winner this time around. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look at the moment as if the winner will come from the left of the party. Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory,\u201d he said. So far only the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have officially said they want to run to be the next Labour leader. Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, are expected to stand while the former Labour minister and home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, is understood to be weighing up her options as to whether she will vie for the leadership for a second time. The party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery \u2013 who lambasted the party\u2019s performance for their muddled stance on Brexit \u2013 might also run. A former National Union of Mineworkers chair who supports leaving the EU, he would be the most leftwing of all the potential candidates. The poll will be interesting reading for all those who said they were using the Christmas break to decide whether to launch official campaigns and gain the signatures of MPs needed to get on the ballot. In the survey of 1,059 Labour party members, 31% put Starmer as their first-choice candidate, 20% backed Long Bailey as their favourite, Phillips received 11% and Lewis and Cooper were the first choice for 7% of surveyed members. Thornberry was on 6% and Nandy was on 5%. With the \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d removed from the survey and numbers put through a simulated leadership vote, Prof Bale and Prof Paul Webb of the University of Sussex found Starmer beat Long Bailey in the last round by 61% to 39%. In the simulation, Phillips was knocked out in the penultimate round with 18% of the vote. Cooper made it through to the fourth round. Nandy and Thornberry were the first to be knocked out. The leave-remain split may impact on the eventual vote as Long Bailey is ranked first by just 19% of Labour members who voted remain in 2016 but by 31% of those who voted leave. Starmer, on the other hand, is ranked first by only 17% of leavers but by 34% of remainers. The majority of party members are remainers, which may work in his favour in an actual vote. There is little difference between the popularity of the candidates between men and women, although Long Bailey is fractionally more popular among male members. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t look as if Labour\u2019s members are necessarily persuaded that it\u2019s time the party had a female leader. They seem more interested in picking the best person for the job, irrespective of gender,\u201d said Bale, who co-wrote Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st century with Webb and Monica Poletti. Starmer is also shown in the survey to be more popular than Long Bailey in all age groups but particularly with those aged over 60. He also was more popular with middle-class members by 14 percentage points over Long Bailey. Much of the reflection among members after the election has been on whether Labour needs someone from the north of England to reconnect to voters in former heartland seats that fell to the Tories. However, the most northern of all the MPs \u2013 Lisa Nandy \u2013 does not seem any more popular among Labour members living in the north than with those in other UK regions. Labour\u2019s northern members seem to be just as keen as members from other parts of the country on Starmer, who represents Holborn and St Pancras in north London. Scottish members were shown to much prefer Starmer to Long Bailey, who polled at 11% compared with Starmer\u2019s 42%. Bale said: \u201cFor all the talk of Labour needing some \u2018northern grit\u2019 in order to help it regain its so-called northern wall seats and working-class voters, it looks like the membership are more interested in who they think will do the best job than where or what background they come from.\u201d The survey of 1,059 Labour members, weighted by age, gender and region, was commissioned from YouGov by the Party Members Project, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and run by Prof Tim Bale (Queen Mary University of London) and Prof Paul Webb (University of Sussex).",

Everyone\u2019s looking for an angle these days, a slightly different take on things that makes them seem more interesting than the average keyboard expert. But sometimes you can\u2019t ignore the obvious. Take tonight\u2019s world darts championship final at Alexandra Palace between Michael van Gerwen and Peter Wright. You just can\u2019t get past the fact that it\u2019s a serial winner against a serial runner-up; that, when these two meet in a final, it invariably ends with Wright saying \u201cI\u2019ll get him next time\u201d during a rueful post-match interview.</p> <p>Wright is a magnificent player, one of the best never to win a world title, but his record in major finals is desperate. He has lost 12 out of 13, nine of them to van Gerwen, and it is cruelly symbolic that the only time he did win a major \u2013 the 2017 UK Open \u2013 was when van Gerwen was absent through injury.</p> <p>The most painful defeat was in the Premier League final of 2017, when Wright blew a 7-2 lead and missed six match darts before losing 11-10. The biggest was the world championship final five years ago, when van Gerwen won 7-4.</p> <p>Wright turns 50 in March, a birthday that all darts players dread, and may never have a better chance of laying the ghost. He has stopped playing silly buggers with his darts, instead sticking to the same pair, and has been the best player at a slightly underwhelming world championships. After surviving a huge scare in the first round against Noel Malicdem, he played with impressive authority to beat Seigo Asada, Jeffrey de Zwaan, Luke Humphries and Gerwyn Price.</p> <p>Van Gerwen, by contrast, has been a fair way from his coruscating best. His victories over Jelle Klaasen, Ricky Evans, Stephen Bunting, Darius Labanauskas and Nathan Aspinall were laboured, as if it was all a bit too easy. Van Gerwen is still the best player in the world by a distance, but he\u2019s nowhere near as unbeatable during his imperial phase in 2015-16.</p> <p>Wright will probably outscore van Gerwen, but that alone will not be enough. Van Gerwen has become a master of doing, to use his favourite phrase, \u201cthe right things at the right moments\u201d. The timing of his breaks and big checkouts, even when he is not playing well, is often devastating.</p> <p>I think Wright might do it tonight, but he has got to start well. If not, the tungsten flashbacks could ruin him.</p> <p>The first dart will be thrown around<strong> 7.15pm</strong> local time. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-01T18:49:30.730Z\">at 6.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog, so I\u2019ll leave you with a report from Ally Pally. Thanks for your company, goodnight! There\u2019s so much affection for Peter Wright among the crowd and in the Sky Sports studio. He\u2019s a thoroughly decent guy, who has waited so long for this, and I\u2019m chuffed to bits for him. At the age of 49, when most thought his time had passed, he has reached the promised land. Wayne Mardle makes a very good point on Sky. Wright has won it the hard way. The draw didn\u2019t open up; he had to take out Jeffrey de Zwaan in the last 16, and then the big two - Price and van Gerwen - in the semi-final and final. The doubles decided the game. Van Gerwen took out 40 per cent, Wright 55 per cent - and his timing was better as well. There were spells when van Gerwen went berserk on the trebles, but Wright never really looked like he was feeling the strain. In the context of all those previous defeats, it was a glorious performance. Here\u2019s Peter Wright again \u201cI\u2019ve calmed down now! You should never give up; it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you get beaten. I used to get beaten by Phil Taylor, Gary Anderson all the time. But I\u2019ve done it. Thanks to all my family \u2013 Jo, Mandy, I love you \u2013 and everyone back home.\u201d Here\u2019s Michael van Gerwen \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed but what you can do? Every important shot I missed, he took his out \u2013 his finishing was phenomenal. I can only blame myself. I had several chances to go in front, but when you don\u2019t take them against a player like Peter Wright, you\u2019re not gonna win, simple as that. \u201cI\u2019ll be back stronger next year. Fair play to Peter, he played a phenomenal world championship. He got away with a scare early on, but everyone does. Fair play. What else can I say?\u201d Peter Wright is the world champion \u201cThat sounds amazing, doesn\u2019t it? Sorry to Michael. The chances I used to give him, he gave me them tonight. He deserved a lot more sets. But hey, that\u2019s a nice \u2018champion of the world\u2019 thing. Argh! \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the first two darts [at D10] didn\u2019t go in. I thought, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t do it again\u2019, because he\u2019s blown me away in the past.\u201d Bless him, he\u2019s got such a lump in his throat that he\u2019s struggling to speak. He survived a match dart in the first game, against Noel Malicdem, but he has without doubt been the best player in the tournament. Most of us thought his chance had gone, and he went out in the early rounds in the last two years, but now he has done it. If Peter Wright ever tries to change his darts again, he should be arrested for self-harm. Michael van Gerwen 3-7 Peter Wright The match was far closer than the score suggests. MvG was beaten at his own game, with Peter Wright doing the right things at the right moments. His doubling, under such incredible pressure, was immense. Wright has exorcised all his ghosts in one fell swoop, and he\u2019s in floods of tears! These are lovely scenes. Van Gerwen is gracious in defeat, as is always the case. Wright\u2019s doubling was just too good. He missed two at D10 for the title, and must have been starting to wonder if it was happening again. But he nailed it with his last dart, and he was in tears before he had collected his darts from the board. All that heartache is just prologue now: he\u2019s the world champion! WRIGHT BREAKS AGAIN! Van Gerwen 3-6 Wright (legs: 1-2) Wright has another great chance of a break, leaving 76 after 12. He hits T20 first dart and then pings his old friend D8. He\u2019s one leg away from the promised land \u2013 and he has the darts. VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 3-6 Wright (legs: 1-1) This is astonishing. Wright misses the bull for a 12-darter, and MvG returns to hit D6 and go out in 10. More importantly, it\u2019s a break of throw. It would have been a break as well. WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 3-6 Wright (legs: 0-1) And now he\u2019s only two legs away. Wright breaks the throw in 13 darts, finishing on D12, and van Gerwen is almost at the point of no return. Wright\u2019s performance has been glorious. Wright is one set away from the darts world championship! He left 130 after nine, van Gerwen 100. Wright could only manage 60 \u2013 but van Gerwen missed two more at doubles! His doubling is going to cost him his world title. Peter Wright is doing the right things at the right moments. Wright took out tops to win the set, and van Gerwen was so discombobulated that he walked off the stage, thinking there was a break. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-5 Wright (legs: 2-2) Wright misses two darts for a 6-3 lead! Van Gerwen takes out D8, and now we have yet another crucial fifth leg. Wright is throwing to move within one set of glory. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-5 Wright (legs: 1-2) Van Gerwen\u2019s 13th maximum gives him half a chance of a break \u2013 and then he misses the bull for a 164! Wright then misses D10 for 128. Oh my days. Van Gerwen comes back for 25, and he misses two more at D8! This is so tense. Wright then takes out D5, last dart in hand, to give within one leg of a 6-3 lead! Van Gerwen has missed too many important doubles. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-5 Wright (legs: 1-1) Van Gerwen has gone off the boil since he had that storming spell from sets 3-7. Saying which, he cleans up 128 on D10 for a 15-darter. But he has to find a way to break Wright in this set. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-5 Wright (legs: 0-1) A comfortable hold for Wright, with van Gerwen back on 170. This is starting to slip away from him. Both players are averaging 104. The doubles have been the difference: van Gerwen is on a solid 42 per cent, Wright an exceptional 62 per cent. Wright has pinched it! It was a very nervy final leg, but MvG missed one dart at tops and Wright took out D16. He\u2019s two sets away from being world champion \u2013 and he has the darts in the next one. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-4 Wright (legs: 2-2) Yet another Big Fifth Leg coming up. If van Gerwen holds, it\u2019s 4-4. If Wright breaks, he\u2019ll be two sets away from the promised land. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-4 Wright (legs: 2-1) An unusually poor leg from both players \u2013 but van Gerwen won\u2019t care. With Wright waiting on D4, van Gerwen takes out 96 in two darts for a crucial hold. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-4 Wright (legs: 1-1) Wright, again under pressure, starts with a 180 on his own throw. But van Gerwen is still on his case, hitting 180 on his second visit. Wright holds his nerve to pop a 12-darter of his own. The standard is quite majestic. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 3-4 Wright (legs: 1-0) Van Gerwen has the darts in this set to make it 4-4. He starts with an effortless 12-darter, hoovering up 124 at the end. This is just brilliant. \u201cMVG starting to look annoyed now - which doesn\u2019t bode well for Wright,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cThe former has gears to go through whereas I don\u2019t think Wright has. Testimony to MVG\u2019s ability as Wright is playing so well.\u201d Wright has been much better on doubles, though, and if he stays at 60 per cent win I think he\u2019ll win. Whether he will is another matter. It\u2019s been a fascinating game, and a bit like watching the old MvG - astonishing scoring and some dodgy doubling. Van Gerwen leaves 53 after nine on his own throw, and cleans it up in two darts to take the set against the throw. That\u2019s huge. VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 2-1) That\u2019s a huge moment! Van Gerwen hits the bullseye to take out 84 and move within one leg of taking the set against the darts. This is some game, certainly the best of the tournament. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 1-1) More ludicrous scoring from van Gerwen, who hits a 180 and a 177 en route to an 11-darter. Big leg, this next one. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 0-1) Wright has the darts in this set, with the chance to go 5-2 ahead. Van Gerwen almost breaks, missing D7 for a 134, and Wright takes out D20 at the first opportunity. Wright is 60 per cent on doubles, van Gerwen just 33. That\u2019s the game. Wright takes the set 3-0 on the van Gerwen throw! MvG missed three more at double \u2013 that\u2019s becoming a problem \u2013 and that allowed Wright to take out 80. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-3 Wright (legs: 0-2) Wright is the better player at the moment. He takes out 81 again, this time in 11 darts, to go within one leg of a 4-2 lead. WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 2-3 Wright (legs: 0-1) Brilliant stuff from Wright, who withstood an onslaught from van Gerwen and now leads against the throw in the sixth set. He broke van Gerwen in 12, taking out 81 on D16. Wright breaks the van Gerwen throw to win the set! Van Gerwen missed one at D16 - that\u2019s seven in a row he\u2019s missed at double - and Wright calmly took out 96. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 1-2) Oh my days. Van Gerwen somehow misses six darts at double, allowing Wright to hold despite being behind throughout the leg. WRIGHT BREAKS BACK! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 1-1) Wright hits seven perfect darts before missing T19. The crowd boo but the break of throw is far more important than a nine, and Wright returns to take D16 for a 10-darter. This is glorious. VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 1-0) This is a vital set for Wright, who has the throw. If he loses this he might start to fear the worst \u2013 not least because van Gerwen is playing devastatingly well. He goes out in 12 to break again, and has now won seven of the last nine legs. The match averages Van Gerwen 104.96 Wright 102.34 \u201cHaving the final on New Year\u2019s Day is a bad idea,\u201d says Roger Kirkby. \u201cThe main players in the event are hungover, knackered and voiceless. They don\u2019t jump up and down much either.\u201d \u201cEvening and happy new year to you, Rob,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cIs there any instance in which VAR might be introduced to liven things down a bit?\u201d They could use it to assess the sobriety of those making their way to the bar. Decision: no pint. Oof. In another high-class leg, both players miss one dart for the set before van Gerwen takes out D8 to level the match. The van Gerwen surge is one of the greatest sights in sport, and the last two sets have been MvG porn. But Wright was good enough to stay with him in the fourth and could easily have pinched it. This is blistering stuff. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 2-2) A really impressive hold from Wright, who has been battered in the last few legs. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 2-1) This is great stuff now. Van Gerwen hits 180 and 140 to take his match average up t0 107, and misses D18 for a 12-darter. No matter: he returns to clean up in 14. VAN GERWEN BREAKS BACK! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 1-1) Van Gerwen ignores that inconvenient cock-up in the previous leg and continues to pummel trebles. Eventually he takes out D18 for a 13-darter. WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 0-1) Van Gerwen has been punished! He declined the bull from 82, and then Wright took out 140 \u2013 the same finish that saved him against Noel Malicdem. Awesome. Van Gerwen takes the third set, on the Wright throw, in a total of 37 darts. His average in that set was 122. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-2 Wright (legs: 2-0) He\u2019s on one now! Van Gerwen has responded ferociously to going two sets down, and holds with a majestic 11-darter. VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 0-2 Wright (legs: 1-0) Van Gerwen breaks in 13 darts, starting with a 180 and finishing with D12. He declined a bull opportunity from 164, with Wright on 145. The gamble paid off. \u201cPeter Wright = Jimmy White?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cMaybe not...\u201d Wright has blown leads against van Gerwen before, most famously in the 2017 Premier League final, so we shouldn\u2019t get carried away. But it\u2019s been a hugely impressive start. Peter Wright takes the second set against the darts! He nails tops for another authoritative 13-dart leg, and at the moment he is undeniably the better player. Wright is averaging 105 to van Gerwen\u2019s 99, and the first two sets could hardly have gone any better. WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 1-2) Wright starts with a 180 on the van Gerwen throw. He is outscoring MvG and leaves 81 after nine. And he takes it out, last dart in hand, to move within a leg of a 2-0 lead! WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 1-1) A comfortable hold for Wright, with van Gerwen well back on 136. Since the first leg, Wright\u2019s doubling has been impressive. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 1-0) This is warming up nicely. Van Gerwen misses four at double, Wright can\u2019t take out tops and van Gerwen returns to take out D6. The averages so far Van Gerwen 99.89 Wright 101.92 Wright takes the first set on tops \u2013 but only just. Van Gerwen wired the bull for 170, which would have been a savage blow, and Wright returned to take the leg in 14 darts. He really couldn\u2019t afford to lose that set. VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 2-2) Van Gerwen nails the bull to take out 86 \u2013 and that means we have the first crucial fifth leg of the night. This is where van Gerwen can be deadly. WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 1-2) Wright has started strongly, with more trebles and fewer loose darts than van Gerwen. After MvG misses D5 for a break, Wright takes out tops. WRIGHT BREAKS BACK! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 1-1) An immediate break back for Wright, who takes out tops for a 13-darter. VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 1-0) Wright goes off with 60, MvG with just 34. That allows Wright to take control of the leg with 140 and then the first 180 of the final \u2013 but then he misses three at D20 and D10, and van Gerwen burgles the leg by taking out 88 in two darts. Michael van Gerwen hurries towards the stage to the sound of Seven Nation Army - and a few boos from the crowd, for some reason. Eejits. That could be a factor tonight, as it was when he lost that epic semi-final against Rob Cross two years ago. It\u2019s time for the walk-ons. Peter Wright is first, dancing across the stage to Don\u2019t Stop the Party by Pitbull. He looks slightly nervous, no more than that. The tournament stats are almost identical: both are 44 per cent on the doubles, with MvG averaging 98.14 and Wright 98.29. There is a compelling argument that it has been a bit too easy for van Gerwen, and that Wright will push him to produce his A-game. Van Gerwen is chasing a fourth world title, having won three of the last six. His big target is six - one more than Raymond van Barneveld\u2019s Dutch record. Peter Wright has won the bullseye and will throw first. \u201cI\u2019ll be rooting for Snakebite,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of his but I\u2019d like him to get this one. Outside of Fallon Sherrock\u2019s run I think the best moment of the tournament was when Snakebite was under massive pressure against Malicdem and he won a leg by finishing 302 with six perfect darts. Kaboom!\u201d Yeah, you\u2019d have to have a pretty hard heart \u2013 or be very, very Dutch \u2013 to begrudge Peter Wright. It makes no sense that he has only won a single UK Open. Pre-match reading Hello. Everyone\u2019s looking for an angle these days, a slightly different take on things that makes them seem more interesting than the average keyboard expert. But sometimes you can\u2019t ignore the obvious. Take tonight\u2019s world darts championship final at Alexandra Palace between Michael van Gerwen and Peter Wright. You just can\u2019t get past the fact that it\u2019s a serial winner against a serial runner-up; that, when these two meet in a final, it invariably ends with Wright saying \u201cI\u2019ll get him next time\u201d during a rueful post-match interview. Wright is a magnificent player, one of the best never to win a world title, but his record in major finals is desperate. He has lost 12 out of 13, nine of them to van Gerwen, and it is cruelly symbolic that the only time he did win a major \u2013 the 2017 UK Open \u2013 was when van Gerwen was absent through injury. The most painful defeat was in the Premier League final of 2017, when Wright blew a 7-2 lead and missed six match darts before losing 11-10. The biggest was the world championship final five years ago, when van Gerwen won 7-4. Wright turns 50 in March, a birthday that all darts players dread, and may never have a better chance of laying the ghost. He has stopped playing silly buggers with his darts, instead sticking to the same pair, and has been the best player at a slightly underwhelming world championships. After surviving a huge scare in the first round against Noel Malicdem, he played with impressive authority to beat Seigo Asada, Jeffrey de Zwaan, Luke Humphries and Gerwyn Price. Van Gerwen, by contrast, has been a fair way from his coruscating best. His victories over Jelle Klaasen, Ricky Evans, Stephen Bunting, Darius Labanauskas and Nathan Aspinall were laboured, as if it was all a bit too easy. Van Gerwen is still the best player in the world by a distance, but he\u2019s nowhere near as unbeatable during his imperial phase in 2015-16. Wright will probably outscore van Gerwen, but that alone will not be enough. Van Gerwen has become a master of doing, to use his favourite phrase, \u201cthe right things at the right moments\u201d. The timing of his breaks and big checkouts, even when he is not playing well, is often devastating. I think Wright might do it tonight, but he has got to start well. If not, the tungsten flashbacks could ruin him. The first dart will be thrown around 7.15pm local time.",

      "body": "<p>Lenny Henry is 93% human. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other 7%?\u201d asked Doctor Who\u2019s sidekick Yaz after she surreptitiously scanned his DNA with a handheld device that left my smartphone feeling pretty inadequate.</p> <p>It is a good question, and the answer is not mince pies. Lord Leonard of Dudley is leaner and meaner than ever in this first episode of the new Doctor Who series, in which he plays Daniel Barton, a person of colour who has overcome all kinds of obstacles to become CEO of a global techno-oligarchy called VOR.</p> <p>What obstacles? As one of the few non-white people in his Bromsgrove school, he explained, Barton spent a lot of time in his bedroom developing the coding skills that would ultimately make him the most powerful human in our galaxy, certainly now Caroline Flack has stood down from Love Island. But what does VOR stand for? None of your nonsense, young lady, that\u2019s what. In truth, the answer is beyond my pay grade \u2026 but as far as I can tell it\u2019s a mashup of Google, Amazon and Facebook. Barton, then, is a combination of Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, none of whom are 100% human, either.</p> <p>But there was a problem. Barton\u2019s DNA was colluding with super-aliens who, despite being super-aliens, were powerless when confronted by the BBC\u2019s special effects budget, which has evidently been slashed to pre-empt Boris Johnson from decriminalising licence-fee rebels. Essentially, they\u2019re lo-fi, throbbing white silhouettes who replicate at will, and yet have booming voices that betray Rada training. Say what you like about Daleks and Cybermen, at least they had readily merchandisable costumes. That said, these aliens were scary dead ringers for cut-outs of David Bowie circa Ashes to Ashes, right down to the pierrot hats. I\u2019ve had nightmares since.</p> <p>Their aim? The usual. To subject the universe to their infernal will. For those who watched the recent War of the Worlds, this was HG Wells on an intergalactic scale. Clearly the Australian security grunts who fatuously shot at this superior race hadn\u2019t got the memo. The super-aliens didn\u2019t actually say: \u201cYour puny human weapons are useless against us!\u201d But it was implicit.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the Doctor got the call from MI6 which, worryingly for British chances of defeating aliens or Putin\u2019s goons, was headed by Stephen Fry.

      "bodyText": "Lenny Henry is 93% human. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other 7%?\u201d asked Doctor Who\u2019s sidekick Yaz after she surreptitiously scanned his DNA with a handheld device that left my smartphone feeling pretty inadequate. It is a good question, and the answer is not mince pies. Lord Leonard of Dudley is leaner and meaner than ever in this first episode of the new Doctor Who series, in which he plays Daniel Barton, a person of colour who has overcome all kinds of obstacles to become CEO of a global techno-oligarchy called VOR. What obstacles? As one of the few non-white people in his Bromsgrove school, he explained, Barton spent a lot of time in his bedroom developing the coding skills that would ultimately make him the most powerful human in our galaxy, certainly now Caroline Flack has stood down from Love Island. But what does VOR stand for? None of your nonsense, young lady, that\u2019s what. In truth, the answer is beyond my pay grade \u2026 but as far as I can tell it\u2019s a mashup of Google, Amazon and Facebook. Barton, then, is a combination of Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, none of whom are 100% human, either. But there was a problem. Barton\u2019s DNA was colluding with super-aliens who, despite being super-aliens, were powerless when confronted by the BBC\u2019s special effects budget, which has evidently been slashed to pre-empt Boris Johnson from decriminalising licence-fee rebels. Essentially, they\u2019re lo-fi, throbbing white silhouettes who replicate at will, and yet have booming voices that betray Rada training. Say what you like about Daleks and Cybermen, at least they had readily merchandisable costumes. That said, these aliens were scary dead ringers for cut-outs of David Bowie circa Ashes to Ashes, right down to the pierrot hats. I\u2019ve had nightmares since. Their aim? The usual. To subject the universe to their infernal will. For those who watched the recent War of the Worlds, this was HG Wells on an intergalactic scale. Clearly the Australian security grunts who fatuously shot at this superior race hadn\u2019t got the memo. The super-aliens didn\u2019t actually say: \u201cYour puny human weapons are useless against us!\u201d But it was implicit. That\u2019s why the Doctor got the call from MI6 which, worryingly for British chances of defeating aliens or Putin\u2019s goons, was headed by Stephen Fry. He delivered my favourite line in the show (\u201cDoctor, the security of the entire planet is at stake!\u201d) before being shot dead with an alien laser beam to the head, poor chap. But if Fry was fried, who would save Blighty, the planet, nay the universe? Step forward the 13th Time Lord. Jodie Whittaker is all woman with a side order of sass, eyebrows that just won\u2019t quit and trousers belonging to a taller person.

      "bodyText": "Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad Stadium for the Guardian - here\u2019s how he saw the game unfold. Elsewhere in the Premier League: West Ham enjoyed a new manager bounce under David Moyes, running out 4-0 winners over Bournemouth, who look to be in serious trouble. A late equaliser from the lesser-spotted Connor Wickham enabled Crystal Palace to snatch a point after they came from behind to draw with Norwich. Earlier this afternoon, Watford continued their resurgence under Nigel Pearson with a win over Wolves, while Jose Mourinho\u2019s mask of humility was conspicuous by its absence as Tottenham lost against Southampton. Newcastle ran out 3-0 losers against Leicester at home, while Villa won on their travels to the Burnley. In the day\u2019s early kick-off, Brighton and Chelsea shared the points in an entertaining match at the Amex Stadium. And Everton? While they lost a game during which Carlo Ancelotti could repeatedly be seen urging his players to get the ball forward more quickly, Everton can take heart from this performance. They defended well for long periods, restricting City to a limited number of scoring opportunities. Ultimately, however, the class of the Premier League champions prevailed. A brace for Gabriel Jesus: The Brazilian striker scored twice and struck the post to win all three points for his team. They were entirely convincing but scored two good goals, before allowing Everton back into the game with a gift. Richarlison pounced at the far post after a kamikaze pass from Claudio Bravo left Joao Cancelo in all sorts of bother in his own penalty area. Peep! Peep! Peep! It\u2019s all over at the Etihad Stadium, where City have won by the odd goal of three to move back to within a point of Leicester City. They remain in third place in the table, 11 behind leaders Liverpool. 90+4 min: Everton win a corner, which Theo Walcott will take once the Manchester City fans behind the goal give him the ball. They eventually oblige and his inswinger is headed clear by Kevin De Bruyne. 90+3 min: Sterling comes on for Riyad Mahrez. 90+2 min: Two minutes into added time and Everton are struggling to get a touch of the ball. Raheem Sterling is on the touchline, waiting to come on, but City aren\u2019t putting the ball out of play. 89 min: Claudio Bravo takes an eternity over a goal kick as we prepare for a minimum of four minutes of added time. 88 min: Nothing comes from the corner, which City take short, happy just to keep hold of the ball as the clock ticks down. 87 min: City win a free-kick on the right flank and Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s delivery is put out for a corner by Sidibe. 86 min: Down by the corner, Dominic Calvert-Lewin slides in to dispossess Fernandinho with a scything challenge. Manchester City\u2019s players react furiously and the Everton striker is perhaps lucky to escape with just a yellow card. 84 min: Dominic Calvert-Lewin picks up a long ball over the top in a good position on the right byline. He dithers over what to do next and wastes an opportunity to dink it over Bravo towards Kean at the far post. 83 min: Manchester City substitution: Phil Foden makes way for David Silva. 82 min: Gabriel Jesus is flat on his back in the Everton penalty area after being caught by Yerry Mina. He\u2019ll live. 80 min: Eric Garcia denies Moise Kean with a good tackle shortly after Tom Davies is booked. 78 min: It\u2019s all City at the moment as they lay siege to the Everton goal. They missed out on a penalty because Sidibe got his foot to the ball as he stopped Foden with a last-ditch lunge. Moments later, Mahrez went close, before Gabriel Jesus rifled a shot off the upright. 77 min: There are loud appeals for a penalty as Phil Foden goes to ground in the Everton box. None is forthcoming. 77 min: Moise Kean spins and volleys towards goal after being picked out in the Manchester City penalty area. Wide, but not much. 74 min: Jesus squanders an opportunity to bag his hat-trick after getting on the end of a Cancelo cross to the far post. His downward header is saved easily by Pickford. 72 min: It\u2019s safe to say Pep will be seething at the concession of that goal, as City gifted the ball to them deep in their own territory. Joao Cancelo miscontrolled a daft pass from Claudio Bravo, allowing Theo Walcott to shoot from the edge of the box. His effort cannoned off Benjamin Mendy and was fizzing across the face of goal, leaving Richarlison with the easy task of firing hime. Manchester City give the ball away in their own penalty area and Richarlison pulls one back for Everton, hammering a cross in from close range at the far post. 69 min: Everton give the ball away cheaply twice in quick succession in midfield. Fabian Delph is booked for a foul on somebody or other that leaves him hobbling away. From the ensuing free-kick, Riyad Mahrez heads wide of the upright under pressure from Davies. 67 min: Kean comes on for Everton and the captain\u2019s armband goes around the biceps of Tom Davies. 64 min: Manchester City continue to dominate as Everton prepare to bring on Moise Kean for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who took the captain\u2019s armband from Seamus Coleman. A long spell of City possession ends with Yerry Mina conning a free-kick out of Andre Marriner with a theatrical collapse to the turf just outside his own box. 62 min: Moments after that second goal went in, Everton brought on Theo Walcott. Seamus Coleman made way. 61 min: It was a clinical finish to round off an excellent Manchester City move. Kevin De Bruyne kicked it off with a wonderful pass to Phil Foden, who found Mahrez. He picked out Jesus, who made a run into the box and the Brazilian made no mistake with his seventh goal in six games against Everton. Jesus doubles Manchester CIty\u2019s lead, letting the ball run across his body before burying a low drive into the bottom corner at the near post with his left foot. 56 min: Yerry Mina and Riyad Mahrez tussle for a ball that eventually goes out of play for an Everton goal kick. Mahrez is none too impressed by what he perceives to be Mina\u2019s roughhouse tactics after being shoved towards the advertising hoardings. 55 min: That goal really seems to have sparked Everton into life and they are playing with a positivity that was hitherto lacking from their game. 54 min: Everton win a corner and Dominic Calvert Lewin goes close with a header after getting on the end of Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s inswinger. His effort is deflected out for another corner, from which nothing comes. 52 min: There are ironic cheers from Manchester City\u2019s fans when the VAR officials finish poring over the footage of Jesus\u2019s goal and can find no reason to rule it out. Jesus pounced on a wonderful ball into the Everton box from Ilkay Gundogan, cut inside Mason Holgate and curled the ball into the top right-hand corner. Jordan Pickford got a hand to it but couldn\u2019t keep it out. Gabriel Jesus curls the ball into the top corner and it gets a helping hand on its way from Jordan Pickford. 50 min: Phil Foden marauds up the inside right channel before laying the ball off to Gabriel Jesus. Everton keep their shape well and force them backwards. 49 min: The game is played out in near silence and to be fair to those present, there\u2019s not much for either set of fans to cheer in the opening minutes of this second half. 47 min: Tom Davies wins a free-kick on the halfway line after being brought down by Kevin De Bruyne. 46 min: Play resumes with no changes to either side at half-time. Gabriel Jesus is flagged for offside as he gets on the end of a raking Kevin De Bruyne pass from deep and heads wide from a tight angle. Elsewhere in the Premier League: West Ham are beating the increasingly hapless Bournemouth 3-0 at half time, while Norwich are 1-0 up against Crystal Palace at Carrow Road. Earlier today, there were wins for Watford, Aston Villa and Leicester. Brighton and Chelsea drew 1-1 in the day\u2019s early kick-off. The players go in for the break, with Manchester City having bossed possession, but created comparatively little in the way of goalscoring threats. They did have the ball in the Everton net, but VAR intervened and ruled that Riyad Mahrez had been offside in the build-up to Phil Foden\u2019s tap-in. 45+2 min: Everton win a corner late in the first half. Gylfi Sigurdsson sends the ball into the mixer, where Yerry Mina leaps highest. Under pressure from Eric Garcia, he put his header goes over the bar. 45+1: It seems Mahrez controlled the ball with his hand, so any goal he scored would not have counted anyway. 44 min: Benjamin Mendy curls a cross into the Everton penalty area and it appears to drop kindly drops for Mahrez at the far post. Mason Holgate scrambles back and does enough to prevent the City winger firing off a shot. 42 min: Riyad Mahrez drags a low diagonal effort wide of the far post after being teed up by Gabriel Jesus. It was on his weaker right foot, but he should have done better. 41 min: Manchester City continue to dominate possession, while Carlo Ancelotti continues to criticise his players for not trying to get it forward with enough urgency when they are allowed a touch of it. 38 min: Foden and Mendy combine down the left again and tee up Gabriel Jesus in the box. He strikes the bouncing ball with the outside of his left foot, then angrily admonishes himself when it sails wide. It was a poor effort. 36 min: Phil Foden shoots straight at Pickford from a narrowish angle after combining down the left flank with Benjamin Mendy. 36 min: Manchester City enjoy another spell of possession but are forced backwards by Everton, who will happy enough with how they have coped so far. 34 min: Manchester City ping the ball around the fringes of the Everton penalty area, probing for an opening but are once again thwarted by the linesman\u2019s raised flag. Riyad Mahrez had strayed offside again. 32 min: The crowd at the Etihad seems very subdued but break their silence for a brief jeer when Phil Foden is penalised for a foul on Gylfi Sigurdsson near the halfway line. 30 min: Yerry Mina is booked fr a tactical foul on Kevin De Bruyne that nips a Manchester City attack in the bud. 29 min: Riyad Mahrez stings the palms of Pickford with a shot towards the near post from a narrow angle. A corner for City, which goes out for another one off Dominic Calvert-Lewin. This set-piece ends with Ilkay Gundogan shooting straight at Pickford from distance after the ball is half-cleared. 27 min: Carlo Ancelotti seems to have heard McManaman, as Pickford has gone long with his past three kick-outs and clearances. On the touchline the Italian admonishes his players for passing the ball backwards rather than forward. 25 min: Steve McManaman is on co-comms for BT Sport and he\u2019s criticised Everton for repeatedly trying to play the ball out from the back when they\u2019re not good enough to do so. He suggests they should \u201cgo long\u201d and give themselves a chance of winning 50-50 balls. He may well have a point - they do have a height advantage over their opponents in almost every area of the pitch. 24 min: Another poor clearance from Pickford results in Gabriel Jesus being presented with a shooting chance from distance. He skies the ball over the bar. 22 min: Jordan Pickford shanks a clearance into the stand and Joao Cancelo takes the ensuing throw-in. The ball goes out for another throw-in, which is taken by Everton\u2019s Luca Digne. Those two VAR interventions, the second of which was completely farcical, seem to have had a detrimental effect on the rhythm of this game. 19 min: To be clear, if Mahrez was fouled by Digne, it was after Marriner had blown his whistle for offside against the City midfielder. After a lengthy consultation, during which the fans in the stadium had no idea what was going on, VAR decides that City aren\u2019t getting a penalty. Which seems fair. 17 min: Running towards the Everton goal, Riyad Mahrez tries to control a Fernandinho pass from deep on his chest, but is penalised for offside. Replays suggest he wasn\u2019t offside but now referee Andre Marriner seems to have been told Mahrez might have been fouled by Lucas Digne. 15 min: On the touchline, Pep Guardiola is giving the fourth official an awful rollicking, but he can\u2019t really complain. As Manchester City swept forward, the ball was played to Mahrez in an offside position on the right wing. He played it towards Cancelo, whose excellent ball across the face of the Everton goal was stabbed home by Foden. He thought he\u2019d scored his second Premier League goal, but the wait goes on. An offside in the build-up to Manchester City\u2019s goal means it is chalked off. This one, to be fair, was visible to the naked eye. Phil Foden opens the scoring for the hosts with a tap-in at the far post. 11 min: Pickford comes off his line to intercept an Ilkay Gundogan pass over the top that Riyad Mahrez was chasing with a perfectly timed run. 10 min: More good work from Coleman, this time at the other end of the pitch. The Irishman does well to show Kevin De Bruyne wide as he charged into the Everton penalty area with the ball at his feet. 9 min: Claudio Bravo is is forced to tip the ball over the bar after a deft touch from Seamus Coleman, who was attempting to dink the ball over the keeper after running on to a through-ball from Sigurdsson. Nothing comes from the ensuing corner. 7 min: Benjamin sends a low cross into the Everton penalty area after latching on to a ball into space up the left flank. His delivery fizzes behind the on-rushing Gabriel Jesus and a decent chance goes to waste. 5 min: Everton enjoy a spell of possession and win a free-kick when Davies gets kicked just inside the City half. 4 min: City are dominating these very early stages, albeit without creating anything much thus far. Rodri tries to get them forward, but his through ball is put out for a throw-in. 2 min: Playing on the right of Everton\u2019s back three, Seamus Coleman gets an early touch. Moments later, Gylfi Sigurdsson is dispossessed in his own half, but City can\u2019t take advantage. 2 min: Jordan Pickford fumbles an early cross whipped into the box by Kevin De Bruyne. It doesn\u2019t matter, the flag was up for offside. 1 min: Tom Davies gets the ball rolling for Everton, who line up in a 3-4-3 formation, their players wearing navy shirts, shorts and socks. Manchester City are in their customary home kit of light blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. Not long now: Andre Marriner leads both teams out on to the pitch on a busy day for the Premier League. Leicester\u2019s 3-0 win over Newcastle earlier this afternoon means they have tightened their grip on second place and are now four points clear of City having played one game more. Kick-off is just a couple of minutes away. More news on Ederson: Pep Guardiola has explained his goalkeeper is ill and therefore absent from the Manchester City squad. A late change for Everton: Tom Davies has come in for Bernard, who must have done himself a mischief in the warm-up. Anthony Gordon steps up to the substitutes\u2019 bench. Team news: Manchester City go without goalkeeper Ederson despite him having served a one-match suspension. The Brazilian is absent from the matchday squad and Claudio Bravo keeps his place, with Scott Carson on the bench in reserve. Joao Cancelo, Benjamin Mendy, Phil Foden, Ilkay Gundogan and Gabriel Jesus come into the side. Carlo Ancelotti also makes five changes to his side with Yerry Mina, Lucas Digne, Seamus Coleman, Fabian Delph and Bernard all coming in. Man City: Bravo, Joao Cancelo, Garcia, Fernandinho, Mendy, Gundogan, Rodri, Mahrez, De Bruyne, Foden, Gabriel Jesus. Subs: Walker, Sterling, Aguero, Jose Angelino, Bernardo Silva, Silva, Carson. Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Holgate, Mina, Digne, Sidibe, Sigurdsson, Delph, Bernard, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Keane, Walcott, Tosun, Stekelenburg, Davies, Kean. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands) Early team news David Silva and John Stones have returned to first team training with City following spells on the sidelines and were due to be assessed of today\u2019s game. Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte remain out with injury for the foreseeable future, although the latter is expected to return to full training within the next fortnight.

      "bodyText": "Navy ships and army aircraft have been dispatched to help fight devastating bushfires on Australia\u2019s south-east coast that are feared to have killed at least 17 people, amid a spiralling debate over the government\u2019s stance on the climate emergency. Thousands of people have fled apocalyptic scenes, abandoning their homes and huddling on beaches to escape raging columns of flame and smoke that have plunged whole towns into darkness and destroyed more than 4m hectares of land. Thousands of firefighters were still battling more than 100 blazes in New South Wales (NSW) state and nearly 40 in Victoria on Wednesday, with new fires being sparked daily by hot and windy conditions and, more recently, dry lightning strikes created by the fires themselves. At the end of Australia\u2019s hottest-ever decade, Canberra, the capital, was blanketed in a cloud of dense smoke that left its air quality more than 21 times the hazardous rating. The haze drifted more than 1,200 miles (2,000km) to the South Island of New Zealand, where it turned the daytime sky orange. Fanned by soaring temperatures, strong winds and a terrible three-year drought, huge blazes have ravaged a tinder-dry landscape, causing immense destruction: since November, more than 900 homes have been lost in NSW alone. With three months of the summer still to go, the early and devastating start to the country\u2019s fire season has led authorities to rate it the worst on record and prompted urgent questions about whether the conservative government of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has taken enough action on global heating. Polls show a large majority of Australians see the climate emergency as an urgent threat and want tougher government action, but Morrison has focused instead on the nation\u2019s response to the bushfire crisis and defending Australian business, while other government officials have publicly disparaged climate activists. In his New Year\u2019s Eve address to the nation, Morrison did not make any connection between the bushfires and global heating, suggesting that while they were a terrible ordeal, Australians had faced similar trials throughout history. Past generations had \u201calso faced natural disasters, floods, fires, global conflicts, disease and drought\u201d and overcome them, the prime minister said in a video message. \u201cThat is the spirit of Australians, that is the spirit that is on display, that is a spirit that we can celebrate as Australians.\u201d On Wednesday, he acknowledged at a reception that the fires were \u201ca time of great challenge for Australia\u201d, but deflected debate about the underlying cause of the fires, concentrating again on the nation\u2019s resilience. Fire experts and scientists have described the scale and impact of this year\u2019s fires as unprecedented and said that greenhouse gas emissions, while they do not cause fires, play a proven role in raising temperatures and creating the exceptionally dry conditions that make the risk of fire extreme or catastrophic. Although slightly cooler conditions on New Year\u2019s Day gave the country a moment to take stock of the devastation, conditions were set to deteriorate again over the weekend, said the NSW state premier, Gladys Berejiklian. Dangerous fire conditions were forecast to return to eastern Victoria and NSW on Saturday, with temperatures again likely to reach the mid-40s. \u201cWe are assuming that weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cAll of us have to brace ourselves.\u201d While most of the destruction occurred on Tuesday, the ferocity of the fires meant many people were unable to find out basic information until New Year\u2019s Day. Electricity and communications lines were cut for extended periods in many areas. Roads in and out of towns remained closed. Officials in NSW and Victoria said on Wednesday another five people were confirmed dead, and another man was presumed to have been killed. Scores more were missing and the death toll was likely to continue to rise, they said. Three bodies were found on Wednesday at Lake Conjola on the south coast of NSW, bringing the death toll in the state to 15.

Mick Roberts from East Gippsland had been unaccounted for since Monday and was found dead in his home on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s not missing any more \u2026 sorry but his body has been found in his house,\u201d his niece, Leah Parsons, said on social media. At Malua Bay, on the NSW south coast, survivors spoke of how 1,000 people spent the night on the beach. \u201cEveryone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke,\u201d Al Baxter, a retired rugby union international, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere was a strange calmness. People were as close to the water\u2019s edge as they could be. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash.\u201d Criticism of the Morrison government\u2019s climate stance has intensified as the fires have raged. Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas, but the prime minister, who won a surprise election victory in May, last month rejected calls to downsize Australia\u2019s lucrative coal industry. His government has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2030, a modest figure compared with the centre-left opposition Labor party\u2019s pledge of 45%. The leader of the minor Australian Greens party, Richard Di Natale, demanded a royal commission, the nation\u2019s highest form of inquiry, on the crisis. \u201cIf he (Morrison) refuses to do so, we will be moving for a parliamentary commission of inquiry with royal commission-like powers as soon as parliament returns,\u201d Di Natale said in a statement. Australia\u2019s armed forces, including helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels, were being deployed to help fight the fires, bring water, food and fuel to towns where supplies were depleted and roads cut off, as well as evacuate residents. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said the 176-metre HMAS Choules, due to arrive by Friday, may be used to evacuate many of those stranded in Mallacoota, although its capacity of 1,000 people would not be enough on its own to handle everyone who needed to get out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the current capacity for everyone at Mallacoota,\u201d Crisp said. \u201cWe are exploring all our options \u2026 and certainly to look at evacuating some people from Mallacoota by sea is an option we\u2019re seriously considering.\u201d Besides the deployment of HMAS Choules, Australia\u2019s defence force said it had been providing support to bushfire efforts in all states except Tasmania since 8 November and was dispatching Taipan, Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters plus two Spartan aircraft to Victoria, where they would help with firefighting efforts and provide humanitarian assistance to isolated communities.",

A number of drugs targeting tau tangles are currently in clinical trials, including some that aim to interfere with the production of tau in the brain or its spread between cells. Dr Renaud La Joie, another author of the research, said the findings suggested the imaging technique could prove valuable both in choosing which patients to enrol to test such drugs and in monitoring whether the drugs work.

      "bodyText": "Queensland government experts raised repeated warnings about the long-term sustainability of groundwater extraction at a southern Queensland property which has since been approved to operate as a commercial water mine. The approval for the 96m litre a year bottled water extraction operation at Cherrabah \u2013 in a severely drought-hit area where locals are on water rations and communities at imminent risk of running dry \u2013 has raised significant questions about the oversight and regulation of critical water resources in Queensland. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show how longstanding concerns about groundwater security at Cherrabah were overridden by changes to Queensland law enacted by Campbell Newman\u2019s government in 2013. Under the changes, the Chinese-owned company Joyful View Garden Real Estate Development Resort Pty Ltd was automatically granted a 94-year extraction permit at Cherrabah when a short-term allocation expired in 2017. Written concerns outlined in the documents obtained by Guardian Australia include the expert review of a study commissioned by Joyful View in 2009 that was the basis for its subsequent water extraction applications. The study contained repeated qualifications that its modelling could not be relied upon for a period longer than 12 months. One bureaucrat detailed \u201cnot small or irrelevant errors\u201d in that study, including that it overstated the amount of rainfall recharge to groundwater \u201cby a factor of almost 20\u201d. The public servant, whose name is redacted from the document, calculated an annual recharge of 40m litres \u2013 less than half the Cherrabah allocation. Another public servant, the principal natural resource officer for groundwater, wrote that he had concerns about Joyful View, which at the time had wanted the allocation to support plans for a massive resort development. He raised concerns the company might seek to exert political pressure to gain the permit. \u201cIn October 2008 I wrote to the company and set out, amongst other things, the range of information that would be required to support consideration for an application for an increased water entitlement,\u201d the public servant said. \u201cI have continually referenced the need for caution in the development and use of groundwater from the type of aquifer systems existing on Cherrabah.

Joyful View appealed that decision and in 2012 was granted 96m litres a year on the basis of advice by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The Newman government\u2019s changes to the Water Act meant the allocation was effectively made permanent with no review of monitoring data, and no additional study to assess drawdown effects. The way Joyful View gained approval to mine water \u2013 amid sustainability concerns and with relatively little scrutiny of the impact on groundwater \u2013 has further raised concern about the extent to which other extraction operations, particularly irrigators and pastoralists, might be operating in a manner that is compounding the effects of the drought. The Southern Downs deputy mayor, Jo McNally, told a recent meeting the council was aware of many property owners extracting water and selling it outside the region, but could do nothing to stop it. A 2018 Queensland background paper on groundwater in the Upper Condamine area shows about 9bn litres a year allocated in the Warwick area, but the actual groundwater take is unknown, because bores for stock and domestic use do not require authorisation. There are more than 900 irrigators in the Condamine Balonne underground water management area and many pump unrestricted, without meters. Earlier this year state proposals to place meters on bores and restrict groundwater pumping were met with significant resistance by farmers. Licences also come with no restrictions on how the water is used. Joyful View had wanted to use its water to support a resort development the size of a small town. Its current plan \u2013 to truck water to a Gold Coast bottling plant \u2013 requires no additional state approval. Members of the Southern Downs regional council, which approved the facility this month, a day before placing residents on extreme water restrictions, have said they have no control over the water or its use, and do not have grounds to refuse a development on that basis. Attempts were made to contact Joyful View for comment.",

With Best Wishes, Alan.\u201d</p> <p>Jones, the top rating talkback breakfast presenter in Sydney, is more than just a radio personality on 2GB. He has been a force in NSW politics for two decades, leveraging his top-rating show and his audience of tradies and older voters to win the attention of decision-makers in business and politics.</p> <p>He demands to be heard and responded to. And politicians, from prime ministers down, seem unwilling to ignore him even when there is clearly no love lost, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/malcolm-turnbull-clashes-with-alan-jones\">as was the case with Malcolm Turnbull</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/01/conspiracy-commerce-and-climate-denial-inside-the-parallel-universe-of-alan-jones\">Conspiracy, commerce and climate denial: inside the parallel universe of Alan Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones has had more than his fair share of controversies, which have led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/12/alan-jones-ordered-to-pay-34m-defamation-damages-to-wagner-family\">defamation payouts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/alan-joness-radio-show-loses-hundreds-of-advertisers-since-jacinda-ardern-storm\">advertiser boycotts</a> and demands from his employer, Macquarie Radio, for on-air apologies. The most recent was his remark that the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/malcolm-turnbull-clashes-with-alan-jones\">should have \u201ca sock shoved down her throat\u201d</a>, for which Jones was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/16/alan-jones-writes-to-jacinda-ardern-to-apologise-after-companies-pull-ads\">swiftly forced to apologise</a>.</p> <p>A prodigious letter writer, Jones keeps up a steady dialogue with state and federal politicians.</p> <p>Some of this correspondence can be revealed thanks to freedom of information requests to 10 NSW ministers and five federal ministers, covering the six months after the Berejiklian government was re-elected in March.</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s flattery, sometimes fatherly advice, a kind word, or a request for help for one of his listeners. But often Jones\u2019s views are delivered with menace: that a failure to heed his views will lead to unspecified political pain and suffering for the individual and their party.</p> <p>The responses also reveal much about how politics is transacted in NSW.</p> <h2>\u2018A disgraceful abdication and a betrayal\u2019</h2> <p>In August, Jones returned to the airwaves after a short break and immediately took up the cause of the plan to build a tower on top of the Star casino in the inner Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. The 237m glass edifice is planned to house a six-star Ritz Carlton hotel and apartments to rival Crown casino\u2019s Barangaroo tower on the other side of Darling Harbour. The only trouble was the NSW planning department had recommended against the Star\u2019s plans.</p> <p>On 6 August, Jones delivered a full-throated on-air attack on Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s government for its shortsightedness.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re an embarrassment, Gladys. Make a decision. Take a stand. Give the thing a go ahead and get on with it,\u201d he said on 2GB. His remarks were quickly picked up by the Daily Telegraph, which has also been an unwavering supporter of the Star\u2019s proposal.</p> <p>After he came off air, Jones wrote to Stokes to underscore his displeasure.</p> <p>But what Jones did not disclose to Stokes is that the Star is an advertiser on Macquarie\u2019s 2GB or that it was about to part-fund Jones\u2019s trip to Tokyo to the Rugby World Cup in late September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a058b23fa2a83f7172ea7cf62889e08b0877a43c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a058b23fa2a83f7172ea7cf62889e08b0877a43c/0_324_4898_2941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, with the minister for planning and public spaces, Rob Stokes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, with the minister for planning and public spaces, Rob Stokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Stokes was aware of the connection between the broadcaster and the casino. The Star is disclosed on Macquarie Radio\u2019s website as an advertiser, as required under the legislation colloquially known as the cash for comment rules.</p> <p>But Jones made no specific disclosures when berating the government on air about the Star\u2019s planned tower or when he wrote to the minister. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jones-Stokes exchange\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;&quot;&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;View Jones&amp;#x2F;Stokes on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/440206319/Jones-Stokes#from_embed&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot; &gt;Jones&amp;#x2F;Stokes&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title=&quot;View The Guardian's profile on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/user/17081734/The-Guardian#from_embed&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot; &gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; on Scribd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;scribd_iframe_embed&quot; title=&quot;Jones/Stokes&quot; src=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/embeds/440206319/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-oT9lzaUAqi2gM0pcaSOi&amp;show_recommendations=true&quot; data-auto-height=&quot;false&quot; data-aspect-ratio=&quot;0.7061128526645768&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; id=&quot;doc_39512&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Stokes initially pushed back, replying quite accurately that a decision on the Star tower had not been made. But eventually action was taken to clear the way for the Star\u2019s plans.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for your email,\u201d Stokes wrote. \u201cOn the Star proposal, please note that a decision has not been made. The department has produced an assessment of the proposal that recommends refusal, which you can see <a href=\"https://www.ipcn.nsw.gov.au/resources/pac/media/files/pac/projects/2019/07/star-casino-site-mp-08-0098-mod-13/referral-from-department-of-planning-industry-and-environment/assessment-report.pdf\">here</a>. The proposal has been referred to the Independent Planning Commission for a decision.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to speak with you on this if you\u2019d like some further background.\u201d</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t placate Jones.</p> <p>On 7 August, Jones took to the airwaves again to castigate the minister for not immediately approving \u201cthis outstanding proposal\u201d and for the fact that its fate now rested with an independent panel.</p> <p>Independent panels had been set up by the Berejiklian government to address the corruption risk, amply demonstrated by the previous Labor government, when the minister was the final consent authority on major projects.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Rob Stokes, any minister so delinquent in his role should be sacked, and I\u2019m sorry Gladys, where the hell are you?\u201d Jones fumed on air.</p> <p>Two days later he wrote again.</p> <p>\u201cRob, this is immensely damaging. You\u2019ve approved of this and been witness to it all the way. This should go ahead, I cannot believe that Government are telling Star that they can\u2019t get involved. Why did we elect people on March 18. This is a disgraceful abdication and a betrayal. And your constituency won\u2019t cop betrayal.\u201d</p> <p>The transcript of his on-air comments was enclosed.</p> <p>Stokes replied on 10 August to reveal he and the premier had met the Star, and wrote: \u201cExisting laws do not allow me to intervene in an assessment report, nor to seek to influence the Independent Planning Commission to favour a particular applicant or development application.</p> <p>\u201cI can however, look to review and update planning rules that might unnecessarily restrict appropriate development.\u201d</p> <p>Jones had been given a scoop, but didn\u2019t realise it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have said no more about Star than I\u2019ve said about development generally.</p> <footer> <cite>Alan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stokes went on to tell Jones that he and the premier had agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/19/sydney-lord-mayor-calls-snap-pyrmont-planning-review-an-astounding-betrayal-of-trust\">a snap review of Pyrmont\u2019s planning controls</a> by the Greater Sydney Planning Commission of the entire Pyrmont precinct.</p> <p>On 19 August, Berejiklian announced the review. Pyrmont would become \u201ca vibrant residential, entertainment and innovation hub\u201d, she said.</p> <p>The Greater Sydney Planning Commission got the job done in just six weeks, confirming that Pyrmont should no longer be a heritage village but home to an expansion of the CBD. On 5 October, the government announced that Pyrmont was \u201cthe next frontier\u201d for high rise development.</p> <p>Asked about the exchange, Jones told Guardian Australia: \u201cI have said no more about Star than I\u2019ve said about development generally.</p> <p>\u201cI have been through the Ritz-Carlton proposal every which way. I have seen what they have done at the Gold Coast and are doing in Brisbane. I have been a persistent advocate whether it be lockout laws or major projects, that we have to wake up and become an international city.\u201d</p> <p>Nine, which now owns Macquarie Radio, said: \u201cAlan is a passionate advocate on the issues he believes are important to Sydney. There is no link between his genuinely held opinions on development in Pyrmont and the Star\u2019s commercial arrangements with 2GB.\u201d</p> <p>The Star said it had a longstanding commercial relationship with Macquarie Media, but \u201cno direct agreement of any kind with Alan Jones nor any requirement for him personally to advocate for the Star\u201d. </p> <p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority said it was \u201clooking into the issues raised\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018Thanks for the blunt reply\u2019</h2> <p>Berejiklian herself is not on Jones\u2019s mailing list. The premier\u2019s office said she had not received any correspondence or emails from the broadcaster in the six months covered by the request. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, the corrections minister, Anthony Roberts (who used to be known as \u201cthe minister for Alan Jones\u201d when he was a staffer for John Howard) and the police minister, David Elliott, also said they had not received any.</p> <p>But some have very warm relations indeed.</p> <p>Stuart Ayres, the former sports minister, and his wife, the federal foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, are part of the Jones in-crowd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d120e145783dbc7065cd91f1d37cf0bdc045de0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d120e145783dbc7065cd91f1d37cf0bdc045de0/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, pictured with prime minister Scott Morrison, is part of the Jones in-crowd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, pictured with prime minister Scott Morrison, is part of the Jones in-crowd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones, Ayres and Payne share a common bond: <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sports-minister-stuart-ayres-declares-ownership-in-four-racehorses-20140820-1067m1.html\">they all own racehorses</a>.</p> <p>On 25 February, in the lead-up to the March state election, Jones wrote to Ayres asking him to support grants for Australian Sailing for its new training and administration centre at Neutral Bay on Sydney harbour. The exchange demonstrates how Jones uses his influence to smooth troubled waters.</p> <p>\u201cHappy New Year. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve spoken \u2026 I\u2019m sure you know this is our most successful Olympic sport,\u201d Jones wrote to Ayres.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet this is an outfit that\u2019s cash poor. Surely to God you can manage $1.3 million over four years. Hope the electorate is going well. Yell if I can help. Kindest regards. With Best Wishes, Alan.\u201d</p> <p>Ayres wrote a lengthy reply. \u201cTo be frank, I\u2019ve found the behaviour of Sailing Australia (sic) appalling,\u201d he confided to Jones. \u201cIn my view, it has done the sport an incredible disservice in NSW.\u201d</p> <p>Australian Sailing had failed to follow his advice and apply for various grants and had then turned on him in the media, Ayres wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI play politics as hard as the best of them but I\u2019ve seen more professionalism at the Cambridge Park under 8s Rugby League team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you can see I\u2019m quite frustrated with their behaviour and lack [of] willingness to follow any advice we provided them.\u201d</p> <p>Australian Sailing said it had no comment other than to note that it enjoyed a strong relationship with the NSW government.</p> <p>In the face of Jones\u2019s interest, Ayres said he would \u201ctalk to Matt Allen [president of Australian Sailing, who retired recently] about the steps they should take to repair the situation and be better placed to secure funding for their facilities and events.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you informed of how I go with Matt. Regards, Stuart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the blunt reply,\u201d Jones wrote back. \u201cThat\u2019s why you are a very good minister. And you are on top of things. Keep me informed. I won\u2019t say anything to Matt Allen until I hear back from you. Is everything okay in the electorate? Yell out if I can help. Kindest regards. With best wishes, Alan.\u201d</p> <p>Jones is also close to Payne, Ayres\u2019s partner. Her office told the Guardian that any correspondence that might have existed was not covered by federal freedom of information laws.</p> <p>That means any letters she may have received or written to Jones are personal, not ministerial, and will not be released. The Guardian has appealed against the FOI decision.</p> <h2>\u2018What a whole heap of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo\u2019</h2> <p>The state\u2019s water minister, Melinda Pavey, does not get such an easy run.</p> <p>Water policy has long been an issue of interest for Jones. He grew up in rural Queensland, ran for preselection for the National party and has regularly taken up issues for farmers.</p> <p>In May, Pavey faced her first grilling with Jones on breakfast radio since becoming the water minister. The subject was water restrictions for Sydney. She acquitted herself without drawing Jones\u2019s ire.

No.</p> <p>On 14 June he wrote back: \u201cWhat a whole heap of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. I wouldn\u2019t be listening to these bureaucrats, I can tell you,\u201d he told Pavey.</p> <p>\u201cAll these dam projects should be brought together, Melinda.

      "bodyText": "\u201cRob, what the hell is happening with this Ritz Carlton? We\u2019re making fools of ourselves.\u201d On 6 August the broadcaster Alan Jones was writing to the New South Wales minister for planning and public spaces, Rob Stokes. \u201cWe\u2019re turning Sydney into a joke. Queensland/ Brisbane are wiping the floor with us. You must rethink and this is the time for Government to make big decisions. Stop pandering to minorities. \u201cKindest regards. With Best Wishes, Alan.\u201d Jones, the top rating talkback breakfast presenter in Sydney, is more than just a radio personality on 2GB. He has been a force in NSW politics for two decades, leveraging his top-rating show and his audience of tradies and older voters to win the attention of decision-makers in business and politics. He demands to be heard and responded to. And politicians, from prime ministers down, seem unwilling to ignore him even when there is clearly no love lost, as was the case with Malcolm Turnbull. Jones has had more than his fair share of controversies, which have led to defamation payouts, advertiser boycotts and demands from his employer, Macquarie Radio, for on-air apologies. The most recent was his remark that the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, should have \u201ca sock shoved down her throat\u201d, for which Jones was swiftly forced to apologise. A prodigious letter writer, Jones keeps up a steady dialogue with state and federal politicians. Some of this correspondence can be revealed thanks to freedom of information requests to 10 NSW ministers and five federal ministers, covering the six months after the Berejiklian government was re-elected in March. Sometimes it\u2019s flattery, sometimes fatherly advice, a kind word, or a request for help for one of his listeners. But often Jones\u2019s views are delivered with menace: that a failure to heed his views will lead to unspecified political pain and suffering for the individual and their party. The responses also reveal much about how politics is transacted in NSW. \u2018A disgraceful abdication and a betrayal\u2019 In August, Jones returned to the airwaves after a short break and immediately took up the cause of the plan to build a tower on top of the Star casino in the inner Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. The 237m glass edifice is planned to house a six-star Ritz Carlton hotel and apartments to rival Crown casino\u2019s Barangaroo tower on the other side of Darling Harbour. The only trouble was the NSW planning department had recommended against the Star\u2019s plans. On 6 August, Jones delivered a full-throated on-air attack on Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s government for its shortsightedness. \u201cWe\u2019re an embarrassment, Gladys. Make a decision. Take a stand. Give the thing a go ahead and get on with it,\u201d he said on 2GB. His remarks were quickly picked up by the Daily Telegraph, which has also been an unwavering supporter of the Star\u2019s proposal. After he came off air, Jones wrote to Stokes to underscore his displeasure. But what Jones did not disclose to Stokes is that the Star is an advertiser on Macquarie\u2019s 2GB or that it was about to part-fund Jones\u2019s trip to Tokyo to the Rugby World Cup in late September. Perhaps Stokes was aware of the connection between the broadcaster and the casino. The Star is disclosed on Macquarie Radio\u2019s website as an advertiser, as required under the legislation colloquially known as the cash for comment rules. But Jones made no specific disclosures when berating the government on air about the Star\u2019s planned tower or when he wrote to the minister. Stokes initially pushed back, replying quite accurately that a decision on the Star tower had not been made. But eventually action was taken to clear the way for the Star\u2019s plans. \u201cThanks for your email,\u201d Stokes wrote. \u201cOn the Star proposal, please note that a decision has not been made. The department has produced an assessment of the proposal that recommends refusal, which you can see here. The proposal has been referred to the Independent Planning Commission for a decision. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to speak with you on this if you\u2019d like some further background.\u201d But that didn\u2019t placate Jones. On 7 August, Jones took to the airwaves again to castigate the minister for not immediately approving \u201cthis outstanding proposal\u201d and for the fact that its fate now rested with an independent panel. Independent panels had been set up by the Berejiklian government to address the corruption risk, amply demonstrated by the previous Labor government, when the minister was the final consent authority on major projects. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Rob Stokes, any minister so delinquent in his role should be sacked, and I\u2019m sorry Gladys, where the hell are you?\u201d Jones fumed on air. Two days later he wrote again. \u201cRob, this is immensely damaging. You\u2019ve approved of this and been witness to it all the way. This should go ahead, I cannot believe that Government are telling Star that they can\u2019t get involved. Why did we elect people on March 18. This is a disgraceful abdication and a betrayal. And your constituency won\u2019t cop betrayal.\u201d The transcript of his on-air comments was enclosed. Stokes replied on 10 August to reveal he and the premier had met the Star, and wrote: \u201cExisting laws do not allow me to intervene in an assessment report, nor to seek to influence the Independent Planning Commission to favour a particular applicant or development application. \u201cI can however, look to review and update planning rules that might unnecessarily restrict appropriate development.\u201d Jones had been given a scoop, but didn\u2019t realise it. Stokes went on to tell Jones that he and the premier had agreed to a snap review of Pyrmont\u2019s planning controls by the Greater Sydney Planning Commission of the entire Pyrmont precinct. On 19 August, Berejiklian announced the review. Pyrmont would become \u201ca vibrant residential, entertainment and innovation hub\u201d, she said. The Greater Sydney Planning Commission got the job done in just six weeks, confirming that Pyrmont should no longer be a heritage village but home to an expansion of the CBD. On 5 October, the government announced that Pyrmont was \u201cthe next frontier\u201d for high rise development. Asked about the exchange, Jones told Guardian Australia: \u201cI have said no more about Star than I\u2019ve said about development generally. \u201cI have been through the Ritz-Carlton proposal every which way. I have seen what they have done at the Gold Coast and are doing in Brisbane. I have been a persistent advocate whether it be lockout laws or major projects, that we have to wake up and become an international city.\u201d Nine, which now owns Macquarie Radio, said: \u201cAlan is a passionate advocate on the issues he believes are important to Sydney. There is no link between his genuinely held opinions on development in Pyrmont and the Star\u2019s commercial arrangements with 2GB.\u201d The Star said it had a longstanding commercial relationship with Macquarie Media, but \u201cno direct agreement of any kind with Alan Jones nor any requirement for him personally to advocate for the Star\u201d. The Australian Communications and Media Authority said it was \u201clooking into the issues raised\u201d. \u2018Thanks for the blunt reply\u2019 Berejiklian herself is not on Jones\u2019s mailing list. The premier\u2019s office said she had not received any correspondence or emails from the broadcaster in the six months covered by the request. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, the corrections minister, Anthony Roberts (who used to be known as \u201cthe minister for Alan Jones\u201d when he was a staffer for John Howard) and the police minister, David Elliott, also said they had not received any. But some have very warm relations indeed. Stuart Ayres, the former sports minister, and his wife, the federal foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, are part of the Jones in-crowd. Jones, Ayres and Payne share a common bond: they all own racehorses. On 25 February, in the lead-up to the March state election, Jones wrote to Ayres asking him to support grants for Australian Sailing for its new training and administration centre at Neutral Bay on Sydney harbour. The exchange demonstrates how Jones uses his influence to smooth troubled waters. \u201cHappy New Year. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve spoken \u2026 I\u2019m sure you know this is our most successful Olympic sport,\u201d Jones wrote to Ayres. \u201cAnd yet this is an outfit that\u2019s cash poor. Surely to God you can manage $1.3 million over four years. Hope the electorate is going well. Yell if I can help. Kindest regards. With Best Wishes, Alan.\u201d Ayres wrote a lengthy reply. \u201cTo be frank, I\u2019ve found the behaviour of Sailing Australia (sic) appalling,\u201d he confided to Jones. \u201cIn my view, it has done the sport an incredible disservice in NSW.\u201d Australian Sailing had failed to follow his advice and apply for various grants and had then turned on him in the media, Ayres wrote. \u201cI play politics as hard as the best of them but I\u2019ve seen more professionalism at the Cambridge Park under 8s Rugby League team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you can see I\u2019m quite frustrated with their behaviour and lack [of] willingness to follow any advice we provided them.\u201d Australian Sailing said it had no comment other than to note that it enjoyed a strong relationship with the NSW government. In the face of Jones\u2019s interest, Ayres said he would \u201ctalk to Matt Allen [president of Australian Sailing, who retired recently] about the steps they should take to repair the situation and be better placed to secure funding for their facilities and events. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you informed of how I go with Matt. Regards, Stuart.\u201d \u201cThanks for the blunt reply,\u201d Jones wrote back. \u201cThat\u2019s why you are a very good minister. And you are on top of things. Keep me informed. I won\u2019t say anything to Matt Allen until I hear back from you. Is everything okay in the electorate? Yell out if I can help. Kindest regards. With best wishes, Alan.\u201d Jones is also close to Payne, Ayres\u2019s partner. Her office told the Guardian that any correspondence that might have existed was not covered by federal freedom of information laws. That means any letters she may have received or written to Jones are personal, not ministerial, and will not be released. The Guardian has appealed against the FOI decision. \u2018What a whole heap of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo\u2019 The state\u2019s water minister, Melinda Pavey, does not get such an easy run. Water policy has long been an issue of interest for Jones. He grew up in rural Queensland, ran for preselection for the National party and has regularly taken up issues for farmers. In May, Pavey faced her first grilling with Jones on breakfast radio since becoming the water minister. The subject was water restrictions for Sydney. She acquitted herself without drawing Jones\u2019s ire. But a few days later, she received a stern letter. \u201cAs I said to you on air this week I think water will be the single most critical issue of this government\u2019s tenure. I want to raise with you an issue brought to my attention by one of my listeners. Welcome Reef Dam.\u201d Jones argued that the scheme on the Shoalhaven River, abandoned by the former premier Bob Carr in 2002, should be revived. \u201cMelinda, I just think this is something which requires a simple directive to the bureaucracy. Tell me how this can be done.\u201d Whether Pavey replied remains a mystery \u2013 her office did not produce the reply. But there was more correspondence between them about dams. Pavey replied to Jones on 12 June about Cranky Rock and Wyangala dams in the Lachlan Valley, in response to another document that could not be found. Her reply suggests Jones was advocating for the Cranky Rock dam project to go ahead. \u201cYou\u2019re correct the Lachlan Valley was identified in 2014 as one of four priority catchments for investment and delivery of critical water infrastructure projects over the next decade,\u201d Pavey wrote. But she explained that Cranky Rock had been ruled out, detailing the geological challenges,including an underlying limestone cave system. \u201cTo avoid flooding the caves completely the full supply level of the dam would need to be below the bottom level of the caves,\u201d she said. Was Jones convinced? No. On 14 June he wrote back: \u201cWhat a whole heap of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. I wouldn\u2019t be listening to these bureaucrats, I can tell you,\u201d he told Pavey. \u201cAll these dam projects should be brought together, Melinda. And you need experts outside the bureaucracy to advise. Then you order the bureaucracy to make it happen. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you. Kindest regards. With best wishes, Alan Jones AO.\u201d \u2018I wonder whether politicians read?\u2019 Andrew Constance, the transport minister, was also on the receiving end of a Jones reprimand in June over another pet subject: windfarms. The Crudine windfarm between Mudgee and Bathurst has been a particular thorn in the side of some local landholders, who have fought a vigorous campaign. Jones has taken up their cause on a number of occasions and has interviewed a local farmer, Penny Hundy. The windfarm has now been approved by both state and federal authorities, though with fewer, bigger turbines. But the company, CWP, recently needed approval to change the route for delivering the larger wind turbines to the site and to remove trees in order to widen a country road. Jones took up the cause again. The first part of the letter lacks Jones\u2019s usual rhetorical flair and appears to be a cut-and-paste of the information sent by the objectors. But it ends with a classic Jones zinger. \u201cAndrew, this appears to me to be an absolute disaster. Who can these people turn to? What on earth is going on? These people [CWP] are a law unto themselves. I look forward to hearing from you confirmation that CWP will NOT be able to alter its original route as outlined in the traffic management plan.\u201d Jones continued: \u201cAndrew, more importantly, why doesn\u2019t someone deny any approval for these wind farms? I wonder whether politicians read? \u201cWhy the hell do we put people in environments where their health is at risk and keep supporting these ridiculous wind farms.\u201d Either Constance did not reply or his response is lost to history. The Crudine windfarm got permission from the Independent Planning Commission to widen the road in late June and work is proceeding. \u2018Dear Josh, what is this rubbish about?\u2019 The Guardian asked five federal ministers for their correspondence with Jones. Morrison replied on Christmas Eve and produced just one heavily redacted letter. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said they had no correspondence, despite Jones\u2019s on-air interest in their portfolios. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, produced one email exchange, which demonstrates every query from Jones appears to warrant a personal reply from the minister, no matter how small or misguided. In June, Jones took up the concern of a listener who had been charged a $259 supervisory levy by the Australian Tax Office on their self-managed superannuation fund, even though they had no tax to pay. \u201cDear Josh, What is this rubbish about? A supervisory Levy? Come on. Who\u2019s going to pull the Tax Office into line? This is absurd. With Best Wishes, Alan.\u201d Frydenberg replied personally by email that the levy had been in place since 1991 and set at $259 a year since 2014-15 (for established funds). \u201cAll superannuation funds are subject to a supervisory levy to fund the regulatory costs of ensuring that funds comply with their legislated obligations.\u201d He went on to detail what the charge covered, including advice and call centres. \u201cIf [the owners of the fund] have any further enquiries they can contact [name redacted] in my office on [phone number].

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis could be the greatest thing that ever happened in Queensland.\u201d If there was a gold medal for pre-Olympic bid hyperbole, then the state\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is already on the podium. Amid the excitement about a possible tilt by south-east Queensland at staging the Olympics in 2032, the infamous pictures of abandoned sporting venues in Athens and Rio that have come to symbolise the movement\u2019s reputation for vainglorious waste don\u2019t seem to be putting anyone off in a state already saddled with big debts. But in many ways there are few countries better placed than Australia to judge the merits or otherwise of hosting the \u201cgreatest show on Earth\u201d. The Sydney Olympics are still relatively fresh in the memories of many people and the physical legacy of the Games is obvious in what was once a derelict, polluted and unloved part of the city. In addition, Melbourne and Brisbane have both hosted the Commonwealth Games in the 21st century, giving Australia unprecedented experience to draw upon. South-east Queensland \u2013 comprising Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast \u2013 estimates that hosting the Olympics would cost $5.3bn (US$3.6bn), according to a feasibility study by the region\u2019s mayors. It hopes the International Olympic Committee, which under its reforming management is hoping to eradicate waste, will contribute nearly A$1.7bn amid alarm that the cost of hosting is putting cities off. After the fierce competition faced by London in bidding for 2012, the IOC reforms have streamlined the process and Paris (2024) and Los Angeles (2028) went through unopposed. The $5.3bn number appears very low compared with the current $12.5bn estimated cost for next year\u2019s Tokyo Games or the similar figure for the 2012 London Games. Holding the 2016 summer Games \u2013 with the Paralympics \u2013 is widely blamed for shattering Rio\u2019s economy. Financial questions will always surround the bid, although organisers will point to a Griffith University study showing that the private sector returned 70c for every dollar of the government\u2019s $1.78bn funding for the Commonwealth Games. The state\u2019s GDP grew $2bn thanks to the Games, it said. The Queensland government believes that it can construct a bid that ticks many of the IOC\u2019s boxes. \u201cThe Olympics is not what it used to be,\u201d a government spokesman said. \u201cThe IOC don\u2019t want white elephants, they don\u2019t want another Bird\u2019s Nest [the hugely expensive stadium built for the Beijing Games in 2008 which is now mothballed]. They don\u2019t want cities saddled with debt.\u201d The argument goes that Queensland is building roads, rail links and housing anyway, not to mention sporting facilities such as a possible aquatics centre needed by a growing population. The Olympics can therefore be built around the city, not the other way around. The state government claims that 80% of venues for the Games are already built, not least because of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. These include the Coomera sports complex on the Gold Coast, which has a seating capacity of 7,500 and could be used for indoor events such as basketball and handball. Planning suggests that Sydney\u2019s rowing centre at Penrith could be used if a suitable venue could not be found in Queensland. There is also the possibility of renovating the Gabba for the opening and closing ceremonies, although the main athletics stadium is likely to be built from scratch or possibly housed in an upgraded QEII stadium. The experience of the Gold Coast Games was also crucial. \u201cThe Games showed the IOC that Queensland could do big events and do them well, do them under budget and do them safely,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThey were also impressed by the friendliness of people.\u201d The 2018 Games are also a cautionary tale, however, with the decision to urge residents to avoid the city during the event backfiring. Joan Carlini, a Griffith business school lecturer, said a study showed 74% of businesses were negatively impacted by the Games and organisers failed to engage properly with communities. The Olympic bid must \u201clearn the lesson\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cIf you are coming into a different town, you can\u2019t think you know more than the local community.\u201d She also said local businesses had not seen the claimed $2bn revenue from the Commonwealth Games, and warned: \u201cFor the Gold Coast Games, people were compliant. But they will be much more sceptical next time.\u201d A cursory look at previous Olympic bids indicates that the final price tag could end up being at least double the initial estimate. Queensland taxpayers will be hoping the overshoot is not on the epic scale of the infamous 1976 games in Montreal where the cost came in at 13 times higher than forecast, bankrupting the city for years. Pasquale Sgro, a professor of economics at Deakin University, said that despite public debate often focusing on the financial angle, cost was usually a low priority for bidders. \u201cThese sort of bids are done for lots of reasons such as status and reputation,\u201d Sgro said. \u201cHow much money they cost is a long way down the list. \u201cThese sort of large events don\u2019t really make any money. But the public like them apparently. Governments have money to spend so do you spend them on a warship or the Olympics?\u201d John Fahey, who was chairman of Sydney\u2019s bid in 2000, echoed Carlini\u2019s concerns, warning that organisers have to encourage as much citizen participation as possible. \u201cDo not repeat the extraordinary mistake of the last Commonwealth Games of encouraging the locals to leave the areas of activities,\u201d he said. Queensland also has to \u201cplan early for facilities for conventions and visitors post the Games. Sydney was 10 years too late with its new convention facilities.\u201d But he emphasised that it was clear that the state could leverage the prestige conferred by the Olympics \u201cfor future tourism and business opportunities\u201d, as Sydney had done.

John Swift turned home in the first half and Charlie Adam tapped in after some tremendous wing play from Ovie Ejaria to make it an uphill battle for the hosts, who pulled one back when substitute Ivan Cavaleiro curled home on the hour. Fulham were leapfrogged by Nottingham Forest, who beat Blackburn 3-2. Joe Lolley\u2019s cross-cum-shot snuck in at the back post to break the deadlock and Lewis Grabban converted an emphatic penalty before Stewart Downing\u2019s superb finish made it 2-1 at half-time. Grabban\u2019s delightful cushioned header made the points safe despite Joe Worrall\u2019s late own-goal. Promotion hopefuls faced off at Aston Gate \u2013 where 10-man Bristol City were demolished 4-0 by Brentford with goals from Bryan Mbuemo, Sa\u00efd Benrahma and two from Ollie Watkins taking the Bees up to third in the table. At Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday came unstuck against Hull City thanks to Jarred Bowen\u2019s 17th goal of the season. Rampant QPR ended their four-game winless streak in emphatic fashion, demolishing Cardiff 6-1. Nahki Wells scored a hat-trick, Eberechi Eze scored one and laid on another two, and Bright Osayi-Samuel got a double as Neil Harris\u2019s side were thrashed. Birmingham\u2019s dismal recent form continued with a 3-2 home loss to against Wigan, Josh Windass tapping home and forcing a Gary Gardner own-goal to twice put the visitors ahead. C\u00e9dric Kipr\u00e9 bundled in a late third to ensure a first away win of the season for Wigan. Fellow strugglers Stoke ran riot at Huddersfield, coming away with a 5-2 win. Sam Vokes netted an early poacher\u2019s effort that drew a quickfire second-half response as the hosts went ahead. Nick Powell tucked home an equaliser before Tyrese Campbell stuck twice and Lee Gregory curled in a late fifth as the Potters boosted their survival hopes.

The murder investigation was launched after Derbyshire constabulary were called to a house in New Zealand Lane at 4.11am on Wednesday, where they found a man and a woman fatally injured. A 39-year-old man was arrested on the scene on suspicion of two counts of murder and remains in custody. Officers confirmed that there were no other people present in the property at the time.

      "bodyText": "At least seven people have been killed across the UK in road traffic collisions over the new year period. The deaths included three British Airways cabin crew, all in their 20s, killed in a single crash in Surrey on New Year\u2019s Eve and a 19-year-old killed in Derry, Northern Ireland, in another collision. Elsewhere a woman on a mobility scooter in Staffordshire was killed in a suspected hit and run. In the incident in Surrey, three people died and a fourth was seriously injured in a collision between a lorry and a car at a junction in the village of Stanwell. BA confirmed the victims were members of cabin crew, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply saddened to learn of the death of our colleagues involved in a road traffic collision last night. Our thoughts are with their family and friends.\u201d Emergency services were called shortly after 11.30pm to a crash involving a Mercedes HGV and a Toyota Yaris. The HGV left the road and ended up in Longford River. Two men aged 25 and 23 and a woman aged 20 who were in the Yaris died at the scene. Another 25-year-old woman in the Yaris, who also worked as cabin crew for BA, is in hospital in a serious condition. The site is close to Heathrow airport. It is believed that all four cabin crew were friends and two of them had finished work at about 6pm, while the others were on a day off and not scheduled to be on duty. The BA pilot Jai Dillon tweeted: \u201cThoughts are with the friends and family of the three crew who were tragically taken from us last night while driving home from work to be with their loved ones for new year.\u201d A crowdfunder set up on Wednesday to raise money for the families of the crew members involved had reached more than \u00a332,000 within six hours of being set up, with more than 2,000 people donating to it. Police are appealing for witnesses. The lorry was operated by the air services provider dnata, which offers ground handling, cargo, travel and flight catering services to airlines. A dnata spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm that one of our trucks was involved in a road traffic accident on the evening of 31 December. We are fully assisting relevant authorities with their investigations.\u201d Police are investigating several other road deaths across the UK. In the Fallowfield area of Manchester, a 59-year-old man died and five others were injured, four seriously, in a crash between a Skoda Octavia and a Mercedes at 3.30am on New Year\u2019s Day. Another driver died in the first minutes of New Year\u2019s Day after his BMW crashed into a tree. West Midlands police said the 37-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene in Great Barr, near Walsall, shortly after midnight. In County Derry, Northern Ireland, a 19-year-old man died following a collision between two Audis shortly after 2.30am on New Year\u2019s Day. A woman and two teenage males were taken to hospital. A suspect has been arrested in Staffordshire after a 62-year-old woman riding a mobility scooter was killed in a hit-and-run crash on New Year\u2019s Eve. Staffordshire police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene in Cannock after her scooter was in collision with a car, believed to be a Volkswagen Golf, at about 6.30pm. A 27-year-old man was arrested in the early hours on New Year\u2019s Day on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision.

      "bodyText": "The Labour leadership hopeful Clive Lewis has called for unity among would-be candidates to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as they confront the \u201ccliff face\u201d of defeat. The shadow Treasury minister said he would not fall out with fellow hopefuls while the party undergoes what he described as an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d. His remarks came in a complaint on Twitter over being contacted by the media to ask whether he agreed with the party chair, Ian Lavery, on why it lost the election so dramatically. Lewis said setting out the divisions among people interested in the top job was not befitting of a party seeking to rebuild. Lavery \u2013 who supports Brexit and represents Wansbeck, a leave-voting seat in Northumberland \u2013 is a staunch supporter of Corbyn. He is tipped to run for the leadership himself and said in a piece in the Daily Mirror that Labour lost the election because of its position on the EU, infighting in the party and a lack of trust among voters that it could deliver its manifesto promises. Lewis said he did not disagree with Lavery on how much rebuilding the party needed to do and would not be drawn into creating splits on how the party must change. He tweeted: \u201cWhilst I don\u2019t agree with everything he\u2019s said I do agree with parts of his analysis. So perhaps if all we use the coming elections [to succeed Corbyn] as a lens through which to listen to each other, we can work out a path ahead. Because Ian Lavery is correct to say we face an existential crisis as a party. \u201cAs such, when you\u2019re hanging by the fingernails on a cliff edge, it\u2019s usually not a good time to start fighting with those dangling with you. Far better is to help each other work out the way back up the cliff face.\u201d Lewis, a former army reservist, was the second Labour MP to announce he wanted to run for leader, following the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. There are concerns Lewis might split the vote of leftwing members should he make it on to the ballot paper, potentially drawing support away from the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey. Thornberry wrote a lengthy Facebook message about her foreign policy priorities on New Year\u2019s Day, taking a swipe at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. She has been a regular critic of the US president, branding him a sexual predator and racist, and saying he is not welcome in the UK. She wrote on Facebook: \u201cFinally, I hope in November, our long global nightmare will be over and Donald Trump will be dumped out of office by the American people, and we will finally see the United States resume its role as a global leader on the issues that matter to us all. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s defeat would hopefully turn the tide on his vicious band of so-called \u2018populist\u2019 imitators around the globe, including our current PM.\u201d Thornberry regularly faced Johnson at the despatch box in the Commons when he was foreign secretary and has written of the need for someone with confidence and forensic skill to take him on in the chamber.",

He\u2019d jumped brilliantly until then.\u201d<br><br>Champ\u2019s connections had hoped for a more straightforward outcome, allowing them to go straight to the RSA Chase at the Festival here in March, for which he remains a strong favourite at 7-2. Now Henderson must consider whether another outing is needed, possibly in Ascot\u2019s Reynoldstown Chase.<br><br>\u201cYou hardly want to come into it on the back of what he\u2019s done there,\u201d the trainer mused. \u201cBut there are millions of ways of skinning a cat and we will just have to decide which way we want to skin this one.\u201d<br><br>Harry Skelton was also having a hairy time on jump racing\u2019s rollercoaster. He was delighted to get a win out of Protektorat in the opening novice hurdle, only to lose the race in the stewards\u2019 room, where he was handed a four-day whip ban into the bargain. Three races later, he was wreathed in smiles after Oldgrangewood delivered his trademark strong finish to prevail by inches over Saint Calvados and Lalor in the Paddy Power Handicap Chase.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a funny old hour,\u201d Skelton said, having clearly learned restraint and understatement from his many years in the saddle. He and his brother Dan, in Florida on holiday, are expected to appeal the disqualification of Protektorat, even though it means an unwanted return to the High Holborn offices of the BHA, where Harry spent an entire day just before Christmas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/17/sandown-seven-jockeys-win-flag-not-waved-sufficiently-showy-manner-christmas-horse-racing\">appealing a 10-day riding ban, successfully.</a> <br><br>Protektorat was judged to have taken the ground of Imperial Alcazar, who was switched by Paddy Brennan and finished well to be beaten just a head. Brennan never stopped riding in the incident at the final flight, leading to many surprised faces when the verdict was announced.<br><br>The inquiry was an early blooding for the new chief steward, the South African Shaun Parker, on his first day working at a British racecourse.

      "bodyText": "The new year opened with another drama-packed card at the home of jump racing, featuring a three-way photo, two stewards\u2019 inquiries and a controversial disqualification which is almost certain to be appealed. But the most significant moment of the day came at the second-last fence, where the much-vaunted Champ barely took off and crashed out with a Grade Two prize seemingly at his mercy. Sent off at odds of 4-9, Champ was four lengths clear of his field and would surely have prevailed, considering that the eventual winner, Midnight Shadow, appeared very tired in the closing stages. \u201cHe had it totally under control,\u201d was the verdict from Champ\u2019s trainer, Nicky Henderson, who later reported the horse to be \u201cslightly sore in his shoulder\u201d. It meant that Barry Geraghty suffered late and high-profile falls on back to back rides, as this was his first action since hitting the turf with Sizing John at Punchestown on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cI\u2019d say he was looking in the stands rather than at what was in front of him,\u201d the unscathed jockey reported. \u201cIt was a novicey fall. He\u2019d jumped brilliantly until then.\u201d Champ\u2019s connections had hoped for a more straightforward outcome, allowing them to go straight to the RSA Chase at the Festival here in March, for which he remains a strong favourite at 7-2. Now Henderson must consider whether another outing is needed, possibly in Ascot\u2019s Reynoldstown Chase. \u201cYou hardly want to come into it on the back of what he\u2019s done there,\u201d the trainer mused. \u201cBut there are millions of ways of skinning a cat and we will just have to decide which way we want to skin this one.\u201d Harry Skelton was also having a hairy time on jump racing\u2019s rollercoaster. He was delighted to get a win out of Protektorat in the opening novice hurdle, only to lose the race in the stewards\u2019 room, where he was handed a four-day whip ban into the bargain. Three races later, he was wreathed in smiles after Oldgrangewood delivered his trademark strong finish to prevail by inches over Saint Calvados and Lalor in the Paddy Power Handicap Chase. \u201cIt\u2019s been a funny old hour,\u201d Skelton said, having clearly learned restraint and understatement from his many years in the saddle. He and his brother Dan, in Florida on holiday, are expected to appeal the disqualification of Protektorat, even though it means an unwanted return to the High Holborn offices of the BHA, where Harry spent an entire day just before Christmas appealing a 10-day riding ban, successfully. Protektorat was judged to have taken the ground of Imperial Alcazar, who was switched by Paddy Brennan and finished well to be beaten just a head. Brennan never stopped riding in the incident at the final flight, leading to many surprised faces when the verdict was announced. The inquiry was an early blooding for the new chief steward, the South African Shaun Parker, on his first day working at a British racecourse. But his colleague, Simon Cowley, insisted the decision did not represent new thinking on the interference rules. \u201cAlthough Protektorat has not made contact with Imperial Alcazar, he\u2019s forced Paddy Brennan to come off his intended running line, costing him momentum and a little ground,\u201d Cowley said. \u201cWe take that into account and also the fact that Brennan\u2019s mount was making ground all the way to the line and, possibly a stride after the line, he was in front. We think that what happened cost him more than the distance he was beaten.\u201d Skelton was cautioned for careless riding. Sometimes the game gives back to those who have been wronged and so it was for connections of Doing Fine, who \u2018won\u2019 the voided London National. Now 12, the horse had enough left to prevail in the Markel Insurance Chase under his young pilot, Philip Donovan. Meanwhile, Al Boum Photo enjoyed a winning reappearance at Tramore and was shortened from 8-1 to 6-1 for a repeat victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.",

      "bodyText": "For a long time, the seductive promise of the internet was of expanding horizons. Individual users would reach out, discovering new friends and new prospects. Nation would speak unto nation. That dream was not unfounded, but it was always an incomplete account, and the sceptics are increasingly being proved right. We are entering an age when what defines the internet may be not expansion but contraction; while the number of its users continues to grow, the imaginative and discursive space it offers is under threat. That space is constrained not only by tech firms\u2019 decisions and customers\u2019 choices, but by the diktat of governments. Look to a new record set by India at the end of the year. In mid-December, the internet shutdown in Kashmir \u2013 one of several in the country \u2013 became the longest ever imposed in a democracy. The government celebrated with restrictions in Delhi, too. India\u2019s actions put it in bad but plentiful company. The year began with a 20-day shutdown in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sudan, Zimbabwe and Iraq are among those who followed due to protests. (Ethiopia cut off access for fear of cheating in exams, as well as following the assassinations of officials.) The effect was not only to prevent information coming in, or circulating internally, but to hinder news getting out. Access Now, an advocacy group dedicated to a free and open internet, says that shutdowns \u2013 sometimes targeting specific services, or throttling bandwidth rather than totally closing down access \u2013 leapt from 75 in 2016 to 196 in 2018. Last year\u2019s tally, still being finalised, will show another rise. Spreading controls Shutdowns are the most blunt and conspicuous aspect of internet restrictions. Other methods range from \u201cfake news\u201d laws in Singapore and Myanmar to the blocking of particular platforms. The US NGO Freedom House has recorded declines in net freedom eight years in a row. In part, of course, censorship is rising because internet use is increasing. More than half the world is now online. Communities have found new sources of information and opinion, and a new way to magnify their voices. Some of the governments spending billions to get their peoples online are simultaneously finding ways to deny them access. The global tilt towards authoritarianism is another critical factor, and has helped drive demand for sophisticated censorship technologies. Leaders seeking to expand their traditional information controls (arresting journalists; closing printing presses) into the new realm are also taking cues from each other; when Benin shut down access last year, it followed the regional examples of Togo and the Gambia. No country has done more to encourage the spread of internet restrictions than China, which has developed the world\u2019s most sophisticated and wide-reaching censorship system, comprising internal controls, the Great Firewall blocking external services and, say researchers, the Great Cannon, a tool for DDoS attacks that overwhelm their targets with traffic. Though Beijing, too, has used shutdowns, for the most part it has ensured that it does not need to do so.

A commentary on the website suggested that this had \u201conce again proved that the necessary regulation of the internet is a reasonable choice of sovereign countries based on national interests, and a natural extension of national sovereignty in cyberspace\u201d. It\u2019s true that democracies \u2013 even those far more liberal than Narendra Modi\u2019s India \u2013 set limits upon what can be published, sometimes wrongly.

It will cut China\u2019s banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points, to 12.5%, from 6 January. The move means lenders can lend more of their savers\u2019 funds to borrowers to support the economy, rather than keeping it on hand. The RRR was cut three times during 2019 as Beijing tried to protect companies from the damage caused by the US-China trade war. Despite these efforts, growth hit a 30-year low in 2019, with manufacturing activity shrinking for much of the year. The PBoC said this latest cut was meant to \u201cfurther support the development of the real economy and lower real financing costs\u201d. The lower RRR could also prevent financial conditions tightening in the run-up to the lunar new year this month, when firms and families need cash on hand. In a new year message, the PBoC governor, Yi Gang, said the central bank had taken \u201cresolute and strong actions\u201d in 2019, to combat predictable and unpredictable events. \u201cFacing potential [unpredictable and high-impact] \u2018black swan\u2019 and [highly probable] \u2018grey rhino\u2019 incidents in the financial market, we had the resolution, confidence and ability to win the battle of forestalling and defusing major financial risks,\u201d Yi declared.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with a freshly baked match report from St James\u2019 Park. Goodnight! Peep peep! Leicester consolidate second place with an emphatic victory at St James\u2019 Park. The match was over in the 46th minute when Newcastle, already 2-0 down, suffered their fourth injury of the match. Newcastle\u2019s grotesque misfortune is not Leicester\u2019s problem, though, and they had already demonstrated their superiority before Newcastle went down to 10 men. Ayoze Perez scored against his old club, with James Maddison and Hamza Choudhury both getting on the scoresheet with brilliant long-range shots. 90 min There will be three minutes of added time. Hamza Choudhury, whose every touch has been booed, gets his first goal in senior football with a brilliant finish. Ndidi played the ball square to him, 22 yards from goal, and he nonchalantly sidefooted an immaculate rising shot that beat Dubravka and flew in off the underside of the bar. 86 min \u201cSounds like a bad day to have Kane and Vardy up front in Fantasy Football...\u201d banters Matt Dony. 84 min Another change for Leicester. Wes Morgan on, Jonny Evans off. 81 min Nothing is happening. Both teams are waiting for the final whistle. 77 min Hamza Choudhury, a popular man in these parts, replaces the brilliant James Maddison. 76 min Leicester have had almost 80 per cent of the possession in this half. That\u2019s no great surprise, given their superiority and numerical advantage. 74 min \u201cIn the other game, Kane just limped off with a hamstring,\u201d says Joe Pearson. Spurs are still losing 1-0 to Southampton. There\u2019s more soccer to come 69 min Almiron tries a dummy on his own byline, gets himself in a tangle and knocks the ball behind for a corner. Happily for his self-esteem levels, nothing comes of it. 68 min Gray miskicks eight yards from goal after a precise cutback from Tielemans. I think Perez got in his way. 67 min Newcastle would certainly take a 2-0 defeat. It\u2019s easy to be critical but they have had grotesque luck with injuries in the last few weeks. 66 min Perez is flagged offside after being put through on goal by Ricardo. He tries a cocky chip that drifts just wide of the far post - but replays show he was probably onside, so had he scored it would have counted. 63 min Demarai Gray replaces Kelechi Iheanacho for Leicester. 62 min Most teams in Leicester\u2019s position would declare at 2-0. But they are a ruthless bunch, as Southampton found out earlier in the season, and they look hungry for more. 60 min Dubravka makes a vital double save from Iheanacho and Perez at the end of a superb Leicester counter-attack. 59 min Tielemans is booked for a foul on Fernandez. Moments later, Joelinton mishits a shot from the edge of the area after a cutback from Muto. That was a decent opportunity, but he looks so low on confidence. 55 min Another vicious left-footed drive from Maddison, this time from 30 yards, is well held by the leaping Dubravka. 53 min Maddison cracks a free-kick wide from the edge of the box. 53 min \u201cHappy New Year, Rob, and here\u2019s to Newcastle 0-5 Leicester,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cNot because I have any especial fondness for the one or animus against the other, but because Arsenal sit below Newcastle United for the first time in (I could look it up, but it\u2019s probably 100 years), and this might help. Arsenal fans are now used to looking for any small comfort - petty, mean-minded and self-centred as it might be. Also a portent of what 2020 will bring in society more generally, I fear.\u201d 51 min Schar is leaving the field. Newcastle are down to 10 men, having suffered four injuries in the first 46 minutes. Happy new year. 49 min Schar is back on the field, but he can barely run. 48 min Schar is having his hamstring strapped on the sideline, with a view to carrying on, but if it\u2019s a hamstring injury he surely won\u2019t last long. 47 min Now it looks like Fabian Schar has pulled a hamstring! This is astonishing. Newcastle could be down to 10 men for the rest of the game. 46 min Newcastle begin the second half. They\u2019ve made a third enforced change at half-time, with Sean Longstaff on for the injured Jonjo Shelvey. Half-time reading Peep peep! Leicester have been too good for injury-hit Newcastle, although both goals came from sad errors by Florian Lejeune. Ayoze Perez\u2019s opener was good; James Maddison\u2019s second was spectacular. 45+3 min Another injury for Newcastle: Emil Krafth is on for Javier Manquillo. 45+1 min Leicester have been rampant since they scored the first goal, and Newcastle could do with a half-time break. 45 min Another injury for Newcastle: DeAndre Yedlin replaces Jetro Willems. 43 min Dubravka makes a fine reaction save from Iheanacho! Perez was put clear on the right and crossed first time towards Iheanacho at the far post. He mishit his shot, with the ball zipping awkwardly off the pitch, but it took a deflection off the sliding Fernandez and was going in before it was pawed away by Dubravka. 42 min This could get ugly for Newcastle. It\u2019s not particularly pretty as it is. 41 min A half-chance for Almiron, who heads over the bar from Shelvey\u2019s imaginative, outside-of-the-foot cross. Poor Florian Lejeune was at fault again. His sloppy clearance was intercepted by Ricardo, and then Perez played the loose ball back towards Maddison. He zipped infield from the right, onto his left foot, and rifled a blistering 20-yard drive into the top corner. What a goal from James Maddison! That\u2019s another hideous defensive error from Newcastle. Lejeune\u2019s pass across the edge of his own penalty area was too short and intercepted by Perez. He moved into the area, chopped back inside Schar and screwed a right-footed shot that took a slight deflection and nestled in the far corner. Ayoze Perez scores against his old club! 33 min Another booming corner from Maddison is headed over by Ndidi, under pressure on the six-yard line. He couldn\u2019t quite get over the ball. 33 min \u201cStress free, huh?\u201d says JR in Illinois. \u201cStress free my behind. West Brom are facing Leeds in fewer than two hours in a battle for the top of the Championship and I\u2019m having kittens over here. My Baggies need to snap out of their recent form or they\u2019re in for a schooling. And then right after that there\u2019s the darts final which is nerve-racking even if you don\u2019t have a rooting interest. I tell you it\u2019s enough to have me running to the medicine cabinet to double up on my blood pressure medication.\u201d 31 min Ah, the first replay suggests Joelinton was onside when he missed that chance. Meanwhile Fernandez is booked for pulling back Maddison, who had rolled him classily on the left wing. 30 min Maddison\u2019s booming corner is punched away by Dubravka. We still haven\u2019t seen a replay of that Joelinton chance, not that it really matters. 27 min Leicester appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Maddison falls over after a challenge from Willems. There was nothing in that. 25 min: Joelinton misses a great chance! He ran clear onto Shelvey\u2019s long pass, and though he looked a mile offside he was allowed to continue. His stabbed shot was blocked superbly by Schmeichel, with the ball looping up in the air, but Joelinton could only head it back across goal rather than into the net. We haven\u2019t seen a replay but I\u2019d be surprised if he was onside. 23 min One consolation for Newcastle is that, for all Leicester\u2019s dominance, Dubravka has only had a couple of difficult saves to make. 20 min \u201cTwo likeable teams, and in Almiron and Maddison, two of my favourite players in the league (plus the added bonus of Shelvey, who will always be a hero after his magnificent verbal volley at Fergie),\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cPurely in terms of league position, I guess I want Newcastle to win, but I\u2019m happy to see either side do well. A nice stress-free watch on a quiet day.\u201d Nice. Likeable. Stress-free. Quiet. It\u2019s how the 2020s roll. 19 min Schar\u2019s long-range shot is comfortably held by Schmeichel. 18 min This is painfully one-sided at the moment. Newcastle can\u2019t get a foothold in the game. 15 min Tielemans drills a sweet left-footed drive from 20 yards that is pushed away by Dubravka, and Fernandez does brilliantly to reach the loose ball a split-second before Perez. Had he not been in Big Ron\u2019s Wide Awake Club, Perez would have had a tap-in. 13 min Leicester are dominating possession, as expected, although they look most dangerous when they have the opportunity to counter-attack. 11 min Perez neatly releases Chilwell, whose driven cross/shot is palmed away by the flying Dubravka. Iheanacho was waiting behind him in front of an open goal. 9 min \u201cWith the title race settled (and we both know it is) I\u2019ve been thinking about Manager of the Year,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI suspect if Liverpool cruise it to winning by 10+ points that will go to Jurgen Klopp, but it\u2019s much more fun to gauge the award on who has done the most with the least, or under the most adversity. I\u2019ll tell you who would get my vote, even though he won\u2019t win it in a million years, Graham Potter at Brighton. Having just watched the Seagulls hold Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea (another contender) to a draw through shrewd substitutions and tactics I\u2019m not so sure that there\u2019s a better manager in the league, showponies included. You?\u201d Well, Klopp would be 1st, 2nd and 3rd, but aside from him I\u2019d go for Chris Wilder. I do like Potter a lot, though. 6 min Leicester have started very impressively, their swagger apparently not affected by those defeats against Manchester City and Liverpool. 3 min Maddison plays a lovely pass inside the full-back for Ricardo, who wins a corner. Leicester are playing a back three, not the usual 4-1-4-1. One of those three centre-halves, Jonny Evans, almost scores from the corner. Maddison curled it towards the near post, where Evans\u2019 firm header was palmed up in the air by Dubravka. It came back to Evans, who tried to loop a follow-up header into the far corner. Dubravka reached over a couple of players to flap the ball down, and one of the Newcastle defenders belted it clear. 1 min Peep peep! Leicester get the match under way, kicking from left to right. After a comforting blast of Local Hero at St James\u2019 Park, the players assume their positions. It\u2019s time for some more association football. \u201cHas there ever been a season when so few teams are able to hold form for more than a couple of weeks? (There is an exception, I know),\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cWhat\u2019s causing it? Has it always been like this? Is it all VAR\u2019s fault - as everything else seems to be? All I know is that I don\u2019t know.\u201d My feeling is that it was like this in the first half of almost every season until inequality kicked in in the mid-2000s. Have a look, for example, at the table in December 2001. The first half of that season was gloriously unpredictable. The lunchtime games have finished Brighton 1-1 Chelsea Burnley 1-2 Aston Villa That\u2019s a particularly valuable win for Villa, who have moved out of the relegation places. There\u2019s no Jamie Vardy in the Leicester squad, which is a terrible blow for those who hate Fantasy Football League banter. He has a tight calf. Newcastle (3-4-1-2) Dubravka; Schar, Fernandez, Lejeune; Manquillo, Hayden, Shelvey, Willems; Almiron; Joelinton, Muto. Substitutes: Darlow, Krafth, Yedlin, Atsu, S Longstaff, Carroll, Gayle. Leicester (3-3-2-2) Schmeichel; Soyuncu, Evans, Fuchs; Ricardo, Ndidi, Chilwell; Tielemans, Maddison; Iheanacho, Perez. Substitutes: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Barnes, Choudhury. Referee Martin Atkinson Hello and welcome to live coverage of Newcastle v Leicester from St James\u2019 Park.

The potential excites me.\u201d</p> <p>The sharpness of Maddison\u2019s passing and movement in front of a revamped visiting back five not only ensured the injured Jamie Vardy was barely missed but helped his teammates to shred Bruce\u2019s gameplan. Indeed with Leicester sometimes enjoying 80% possession, the only mild surprise was that it took the impressive Ayoze P\u00e9rez \u2013 sold by Newcastle in exchange for \u00a330m last summer \u2013 36 minutes to open the scoring.</p> <p>By way of exacerbating Geordie gloom, his goal originated with Florian Lejeune\u2019s horribly underhit pass being intercepted by the Spaniard. All that remained was for P\u00e9rez to cleverly dodge Sch\u00e4r\u2019s lunging attentions and direct a right\u2011foot shot into the far corner.</p> <p>Poor Lejeune had little chance to compose himself before making another awful mistake. This time his appalling clearance was intercepted by Ricardo Pereira, prefacing Maddison\u2019s goal. After shifting the ball on to his left foot, Maddison unleashed a drive which, in whizzing inexorably into the top corner, simultaneously sent defiant messages to Liverpool and Manchester City and destroyed any remnants of new year optimism still lurking on the Gallowgate End.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"892d2275c35105adc6c1e3e518d7bef926045c1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/892d2275c35105adc6c1e3e518d7bef926045c1c/0_89_2908_1745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabian Sch\u00e4r\u2019s injury meant that Newcastle played much of the second half with only 10 men.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fabian Sch\u00e4r\u2019s injury meant that Newcastle played much of the second half with only 10 men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bruce\u2019s scope for tactical adjustment was negated by the late first-half hamstring and groin injuries to Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey which necessitated their swift replacement by DeAndre Yedlin, Emil Krafth and Sean Longstaff.</p> <p>With all three substitutes on and the second half barely under way Sch\u00e4r then pulled up with another hamstring pull, promptly hobbling off.</p> <p>Deja vu descended.

The potential excites me.\u201d The sharpness of Maddison\u2019s passing and movement in front of a revamped visiting back five not only ensured the injured Jamie Vardy was barely missed but helped his teammates to shred Bruce\u2019s gameplan. Indeed with Leicester sometimes enjoying 80% possession, the only mild surprise was that it took the impressive Ayoze P\u00e9rez \u2013 sold by Newcastle in exchange for \u00a330m last summer \u2013 36 minutes to open the scoring. By way of exacerbating Geordie gloom, his goal originated with Florian Lejeune\u2019s horribly underhit pass being intercepted by the Spaniard. All that remained was for P\u00e9rez to cleverly dodge Sch\u00e4r\u2019s lunging attentions and direct a right\u2011foot shot into the far corner. Poor Lejeune had little chance to compose himself before making another awful mistake. This time his appalling clearance was intercepted by Ricardo Pereira, prefacing Maddison\u2019s goal. After shifting the ball on to his left foot, Maddison unleashed a drive which, in whizzing inexorably into the top corner, simultaneously sent defiant messages to Liverpool and Manchester City and destroyed any remnants of new year optimism still lurking on the Gallowgate End. Bruce\u2019s scope for tactical adjustment was negated by the late first-half hamstring and groin injuries to Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey which necessitated their swift replacement by DeAndre Yedlin, Emil Krafth and Sean Longstaff. With all three substitutes on and the second half barely under way Sch\u00e4r then pulled up with another hamstring pull, promptly hobbling off. Deja vu descended. Once again Newcastle were down to 10 men and struggling badly against a Leicester side who, by way of variation, slowed the pace to exhibition level before the substitute Hamza Choudhury scored his first senior goal. Choudhury\u2019s dangerous tackle during Leicester\u2019s League Cup win here in August left Newcastle\u2019s much missed Matt Ritchie requiring two ankle operations and his every touch was duly booed. Not that the vitriol raining down from the stands prevented Choudhury meeting Wilfred Ndidi\u2019s pass and unleashing a rising shot which consigned Bruce\u2019s side to a third successive defeat. \u201cI\u2019ve never known four players injured within 15 minutes,\u201d the Newcastle manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre. To play so many games over Christmas is ridiculous and this is the consequence. But Leicester are very good.\u201d",

Tell us something we don't know | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How have they fared since her departure? Not great, is the answer in short.</p> <p>The answer in detail is somewhat bleaker: to date the Glory have scored a paltry four goals in six games, and sit second to bottom of the W-League with a single point. Last season Perth acquired their first point in their first game, and it took them just under two game to net their first four goals. By the beginning of round eight last season they\u2019d scored 17 goals, had ten points, and were unbeaten. After round eight last season Perth were top, and remained in the top four for the rest of the season. And, of course, they went on to make the grand final, losing to Sydney FC.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unexpected for teams to experience a dip when their star player moves on, especially when that player was to the team what Kerr was for Perth: the fulcrum of their attack whether she\u2019s the goalscorer or creator, or otherwise enabling her teammates to perform at their best as she led by example as captain. But Perth\u2019s slide this season has been something else. Most striking with the departure of Kerr, as well as 2018-19 teammates Nikki Stanton and Rachel Hill, all architects of Perth Glory\u2019s success last season, has been the relinquishing of their swashbuckling on-pitch panache. If you\u2019re going to draw a game, after all, why 1-1 when it could be 4-4?</p> <p>The situation, then, leaves much to be desired on the part of the decision makers at the club, who clearly weren\u2019t prepared for the post-Kerr era. Given her departure was signalled long before the 2019-20 season kicked off, there should have been sufficient impetus for recruitment plans to be put in place that befit the club\u2019s status of league finalists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/14/sam-kerrs-watershed-move-and-the-start-of-the-new-normal-for-womens-football\">Sam Kerr\u2019s watershed move and the start of the new normal for women's football | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Perth were slow to announce player signings in the pre-season, and even allowing for the fact that only Sam Kerr is Sam Kerr, there was no big name to replace her. As other W-League clubs were quick to snap up her Matildas teammates returning down under, Perth did not follow suit. And the FFA marquee player fund, which can be used by any club for the appropriate player, has been unused this season.</p> <p>Keeping Kerr in the W-League last season, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/marquee-status-sam-kerr-re-signs-with-perth-glory-for-another-w-league-season-20181004-p507tk.html\">when Chelsea were already reported to be inquiring about the possibility of her services</a>, through the marquee player mechanism was a no-brainer. It reiterated the esteem in which she\u2019s already held in Australian football, while the rest of the world cottoned on to her brilliance. And what better way to instigate the concept to the league than via a player who is well on the way to becoming an all-time great of the game.</p> <p>Then FFA chief executive David Gallop made it clear when Kerr was announced as the league\u2019s first marquee player that part of the importance lay in the scope for raising the league\u2019s profile. \u201cWe truly hope that historic days like today will ensure we create an important legacy for professional female players in the future,\u201d he said at the time.</p> <p>Such rhetoric is appropriate for the W-League which, in global women\u2019s football\u2019s increasingly crowded marketplace, needs to assert its points of difference and what it can offer players. The prestige and pay associated with a marquee player contract is one of these.</p> <p>Geared towards building audiences for the last W-League season before the World Cup, the marquee player concept<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/11/virtuoso-sam-kerr-underlines-success-of-w-league-marquee-concept\"> at the time </a>hoped to represent a new watershed moment for the Matildas and Australian football, and possibly attract other new international players in the future. Which for the W-League arguably has worked - the standard continues to rise, and think of the calibre of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/31/new-york-state-of-mind-fuels-western-sydneys-w-league-charge?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet\">NC Courage cohort at Western Sydney Wanderers</a> is a testament to the league\u2019s international appeal. But bound in this is the fact the W-League has found a way to go on in the post-Kerr era in a way that, right now, seems to have passed Perth Glory by. As the first W-League club to boast a marquee player, they haven\u2019t used this to their advantage as they could have.</p> <p>Legacy is a nice word, after all, and is often thrown around in football. But a legacy, as it can be viewed at this particular point in time, in which a team is left to crumble after the marquee player moves on, surely isn\u2019t what anyone had in mind.</p> <p>After all, what real benefit can come from pitching a marquee on foundations which might prove to be made of sand? When the eventual winds of change banish not just the tent but its anchors, too? As Perth Glory are finding this season, not a lot when you\u2019re kissing the prospect of finals football goodbye.</p>",

It\u2019s not unexpected for teams to experience a dip when their star player moves on, especially when that player was to the team what Kerr was for Perth: the fulcrum of their attack whether she\u2019s the goalscorer or creator, or otherwise enabling her teammates to perform at their best as she led by example as captain. But Perth\u2019s slide this season has been something else. Most striking with the departure of Kerr, as well as 2018-19 teammates Nikki Stanton and Rachel Hill, all architects of Perth Glory\u2019s success last season, has been the relinquishing of their swashbuckling on-pitch panache. If you\u2019re going to draw a game, after all, why 1-1 when it could be 4-4? The situation, then, leaves much to be desired on the part of the decision makers at the club, who clearly weren\u2019t prepared for the post-Kerr era. Given her departure was signalled long before the 2019-20 season kicked off, there should have been sufficient impetus for recruitment plans to be put in place that befit the club\u2019s status of league finalists. But Perth were slow to announce player signings in the pre-season, and even allowing for the fact that only Sam Kerr is Sam Kerr, there was no big name to replace her. As other W-League clubs were quick to snap up her Matildas teammates returning down under, Perth did not follow suit. And the FFA marquee player fund, which can be used by any club for the appropriate player, has been unused this season. Keeping Kerr in the W-League last season, when Chelsea were already reported to be inquiring about the possibility of her services, through the marquee player mechanism was a no-brainer. It reiterated the esteem in which she\u2019s already held in Australian football, while the rest of the world cottoned on to her brilliance. And what better way to instigate the concept to the league than via a player who is well on the way to becoming an all-time great of the game. Then FFA chief executive David Gallop made it clear when Kerr was announced as the league\u2019s first marquee player that part of the importance lay in the scope for raising the league\u2019s profile. \u201cWe truly hope that historic days like today will ensure we create an important legacy for professional female players in the future,\u201d he said at the time. Such rhetoric is appropriate for the W-League which, in global women\u2019s football\u2019s increasingly crowded marketplace, needs to assert its points of difference and what it can offer players. The prestige and pay associated with a marquee player contract is one of these. Geared towards building audiences for the last W-League season before the World Cup, the marquee player concept at the time hoped to represent a new watershed moment for the Matildas and Australian football, and possibly attract other new international players in the future. Which for the W-League arguably has worked - the standard continues to rise, and think of the calibre of the NC Courage cohort at Western Sydney Wanderers is a testament to the league\u2019s international appeal. But bound in this is the fact the W-League has found a way to go on in the post-Kerr era in a way that, right now, seems to have passed Perth Glory by. As the first W-League club to boast a marquee player, they haven\u2019t used this to their advantage as they could have. Legacy is a nice word, after all, and is often thrown around in football. But a legacy, as it can be viewed at this particular point in time, in which a team is left to crumble after the marquee player moves on, surely isn\u2019t what anyone had in mind. After all, what real benefit can come from pitching a marquee on foundations which might prove to be made of sand? When the eventual winds of change banish not just the tent but its anchors, too? As Perth Glory are finding this season, not a lot when you\u2019re kissing the prospect of finals football goodbye.",

Police detained about 400 people on charges including illegal assembly and possession of offensive weapons after the rally on Wednesday, which organisers said was attended by more than a million people. It was one of the largest numbers of arrests in a single day since the unrest began. But the march had begun in a mood of carnival celebration \u2013 there were protesters in costumes and families with children and elderly people. Marchers chanted slogans including \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our era\u201d. Riot police fired teargas rounds in Wan Chai district after protesters threw objects at officers who had arrested several people for allegedly vandalising a bank. Some protesters retaliated by throwing molotov cocktails at the police, but many in the crowd were caught by surprise as the march was expected to be peaceful and most did not wear protective gear. Police demanded that the protest organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, immediately call off the demonstration, but large crowds continued to march and police declared that they were taking part in an illegal assembly. As night fell, police used water cannon on crowds in Wan Chai and the financial district of Central. Protesters laid bricks across the main thoroughfare in Central in an attempt to impede the police\u2019s advance towards the area.

There had already been a bleak start to 2020: shortly after revellers counted down to midnight and shouted \u201cHappy new year!\u201d, police in the central district of Mong Kok shot teargas at protesters who set off fireworks and set fire to roadblocks. On Tuesday night police deployed water cannon to disperse protesters while armoured vehicles cleared roadblocks. The crowd had gathered outside a metro station where people were leaving flowers to commemorate protesters rumoured to have died during a clash with police four months ago.

As of last week, 6,494 people had been arrested since the movement started in June, some as young as 12, according to the police. Many in Hong Kong, including pro-democracy supporters, are weary of the frequent violent confrontations in the movement and are seeking new directions in their attempt to press the government into conceding to their demands. Some are urging fellow Hong Kongers on social media to use economic means to put pressure on the government instead, including joining trade unions so that they can launch strikes and other collective actions more effectively. \u201cWe want to show our determination to the world that we will not back down on our resistance against an authoritarian regime,\u201d said Mary Chin, a former bank employee in her 40s.

But Labour is unquestionably going to have to do very much better than this if it is to climb out of the electoral abyss into which Corbyn led it in December. Talking about resistance to Johnson is simply displacement activity. The central truth is that Labour has to make itself the electable alternative that it failed to be in 2019.

Its share of the poll, 32%, was among the lowest in its history. Its seat total, 203, is its lowest since 1935. Labour is now less than ever a national UK party, with only one MP in Scotland, only six in England south of the M4 outside London and Bristol, and swaths of losses in parts of the north and Midlands. Judging by Michael Ashcroft\u2019s <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2019/12/how-britain-voted-and-why-my-2019-general-election-post-vote-poll/\" title=\"\">election day poll</a>, its core vote is probably closer to 20%.</p> \n<p>And it could easily have been even worse. If the Brexit party had stood down in Labour seats, the losses would have been larger. Labour\u2019s vote was also boosted by the absence of a strong Liberal Democrat challenge. This is why it is misleading to claim that 2019 was not as awful as 1983, when there was a very formidable Liberal-SDP challenge. Nevertheless, Labour\u2019s 32% means it is still the second party in British politics. That is a powerful base for a recovery if it takes wise decisions. But it could easily evaporate if it takes foolish ones.</p> \n<p>This is extremely likely to occur if Labour continues to put the cart before the horse. The leadership election is under way. But the period of reflection has barely started. It needs more time and structure. The costs were obvious this week, when the apparent frontrunner published a manifesto of vacuous generality, which posed no difficult questions and lacked substantive proposals for doing anything differently. On the basis of that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\" title=\"\">article</a>, if Rebecca Long-Bailey is the answer, then Labour is asking the wrong question.</p> \n<p>If it is to be useful, Labour\u2019s period of reflection needs some ground rules it currently lacks. These include: a recognition of the gravity of the situation, an obligation to answer difficult questions, a dispassionate study of the facts, an open-minded approach, a willingness to admit mistakes, the avoidance of slogans, and the willingness to listen to others \u2013 who should include Labour\u2019s opponents and (increasingly the same thing) the voters. There is not much sign of any of that yet.</p> \n<p>The right questions need to be rooted in a balanced and honest appraisal of Labour\u2019s electoral position. And the answers must avoid the habit, which affects all sides in the party, of evading difficult truths by talking about something else. So here are some of the important questions, and my own brief and provisional answers:</p> \n<p>Was Brexit the main problem? It was one of them, but Labour\u2019s Brexit problem was its longstanding ambiguity, not its pro-European approach. Labour still needs a European policy for the post-Brexit 2020s.</p> \n<p>So was it Corbyn? The surveys say yes. His ratings were the worst ever for a Labour leader. But the Corbyn programme was not believed either. Competence matters, and Labour had not put in the hard yards on that. Corbyn would have claimed the credit for a win, so he must accept the blame for the defeat.</p> \n<p>Did Labour win the argument? No, it did not. Some aspects of Labour\u2019s campaign cut through, but not by enough. The election result tells the story: Labour lost. To say otherwise is to be in denial. Too many still are.</p> \n<p>Was it the media\u2019s fault? No \u2026 but. Britain\u2019s media is politically biased and not as good as it thinks it is.

The management consultants couldn\u2019t quite bear this, so they devised a scheme where one person was always checking night-time emails, while the rest of their colleagues had the evening off.

It replaces its previous strategy, <a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Great_art_and_culture_for_everyone.pdf\">Great Art and Culture for Everyone</a>, which covered the years 2010-20.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Serota recalled a \u201csalutary\u201d survey of 5,000 people who were asked what the arts meant to them, to which a number replied \u201cnot very much\u201d. People were also asked if they listened to music and replied \u201call the time\u201d.</p> <p> Serota said: \u201cThere\u2019s obviously an idea about the arts which is about it being elitist. In sport they don\u2019t have any difficulty at all in recognising the difference between a knockabout game and the Premier League. They recognise there is the professional game and something they can be involved with on a Sunday morning.</p> <p>\u201cIf we could get to the same position in the arts we would be well placed.

      "bodyText": "More artists, writers and composers at an early stage of their careers should get public money from Arts Council England, the body\u2019s chairman, Sir Nicholas Serota, has said. The east of England could also benefit from extra investment in the coming years and libraries are set to get more help to play a larger role in their communities. ACE will next month publish its 10-year strategy for the arts outlining its strategic visions and goals. It replaces its previous strategy, Great Art and Culture for Everyone, which covered the years 2010-20. In an interview with the Guardian, Serota recalled a \u201csalutary\u201d survey of 5,000 people who were asked what the arts meant to them, to which a number replied \u201cnot very much\u201d. People were also asked if they listened to music and replied \u201call the time\u201d. Serota said: \u201cThere\u2019s obviously an idea about the arts which is about it being elitist. In sport they don\u2019t have any difficulty at all in recognising the difference between a knockabout game and the Premier League. They recognise there is the professional game and something they can be involved with on a Sunday morning. \u201cIf we could get to the same position in the arts we would be well placed. It [arts and culture] is just something that is part of life rather than something which is over there and separate.\u201d Serota said a priority in the strategy would be \u201cto try to reach those people who are not participating. There are too many places that in order to see something of real quality you have to travel long distances.\u201d That could include more money for the arts in eastern England. \u201cIt is interesting, looking at where the big investments have been made in recent years,\u201d Serota said. \u201cFrankly there has been more on the west side of the country than on the east, for various reasons. Manchester has been very successful.

Serota said: \u201cThere is big scope when you talk about what is happening in high streets and communities for libraries to play a much larger role. Many are already. Libraries are trusted places. They are places people feel safe in. Sustaining libraries and helping them move into the 21st century is an important part of what the Arts Council should be doing.\u201d Many in the arts are nervous about the future, unsure of the consequences of Brexit, how pro-arts a Boris Johnson government will be, and whether the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport will be scrapped or merged into another government department.

It has meant seeing far more theatre and dance than visual arts previews, which has been a thrill, he said. Asked which shows he had enjoyed recently, he mentioned The Arrival at the Bush theatre in London, Matthew Bourne\u2019s The Red Shoes at Sadler\u2019s Wells and the National Theatre\u2019s production of Three Sisters, a retelling of Chekhov by Inua Ellams that relocates the action to late-1960s Nigeria. It was a really bold production, he said, and a joy \u201cto see the NT filled with a different kind of audience from the one that would normally be there.

While Tesco\u2019s bottom-of-the-table performance may have been partially self-inflicted, the company could also point to general sector issues, as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl increased their influence during the decade. The rival supermarkets Sainsbury\u2019s (which gave investors a 12.9% total return in the past 10 years) and Morrisons (+9.1%) were also in the top 10 of FTSE 100 worst performers.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report from Jacob Steinberg. Just because another picture of that goal is required. Here\u2019s the report from Turf Moor. Report from the Amex to follow shortly. Neal Maupay and Alireza Jahanbakhsh speak. NM: It\u2019s a massive point for us. It\u2019s a busy period, we had a lot of games. I am very happy for the team and happy for Ali\u2019s goal. I think we controlled the whole game and they are a good team so we are quite happy with the point. AJ: It is a great feeling to be involved with such important games. I have been working hard. It has been a long time coming but I am happy to help the team. It has been a hard time for me and I am happy to turn it around. It has been tough. I had a good feeling. The last game and now this game, I had a feeling I could make the difference. When Dunky gave me the ball I tried to hit it as hard as possible and then the only thing was the bicycle kick. I have done it and it went in the right direction, I think it was the best goal of my career. Safe to say that Alireza Jahanbakhsh has scored the goal of the decade so far, with apologies to Jack Grealish. Final score: Burnley 1-2 Aston Villa. Great news for Dean Smith and a poor result for Sean Dyche. Jahanbakhsh\u2019s goal deserves the plaudits. It was spectacular, and a deserved equaliser for Brighton who took the game to Chelsea, who suffered somewhat after Graham Potter made some attacking changes. Chelsea slackened off rather too much; Frank Lampard is likely to be peeved at his team\u2019s performance but relieved at the full-time whistle. Full-time: Cheers as Reece James is booked for fouling Trossard. It sets up the last kick of the game, a free-kick chance from the edge of the area. Lewis Dunk takes it and it\u2019s too tame to beat Kepa. 90+4 min: Might Kovacic have been sent off? Trossard had spun away and that looked a tactical foul, and the Croatian had been booked. Lenient from the referee. 90+3 min: There\u2019s been some four minutes added on and the action has only just got more frenzied. Hudson-Odoi almost made amends for his earlier miss by heading back across goal for Abraham only for Webster to read the intentions and clear. 90 min: Some handbags. The ball, and not the game, had gone flat so a drop-ball is called. Maupay chose to contest it, which is against the rules these days and is thus booked. No, I didn\u2019t know that rule, either. 89 min: Kepa saves Chelsea! The ball came in from the right and Maupay had chance to score from eight yards out. He did everything right but Kepa had also guessed right, making a fine save with his legs and knocking the ball back out from danger. 88 min: What a chance for Chelsea, and what a peeved expression from Frank. Abraham worked the space for Hudson-Odoi, who had the whole goal begging but missed. 87 min: It was the classic overhead kick, by the way. Like Rooney v Manchester City, and perhaps with a little less shin involved. 85 min: Jahanbakhsh took 18 months to score his first Brighton goal and then, jusy days later, followed it up with one of the best of the season. That was spectacular. Chelsea are still reeling from it, and Frank Lampard again looks peeved. What an overhead kick from Jahanbakhsh! Dunk won the header and he launches it into the net. 82 min: Trossard, Sussex\u2019s answer to Eden Hazard, tries some kind of Gordon Strachan-esque free-kick routine. He plays a short one, then hits the resultant pass, a moving ball, away from everyone. Wasteful. 81 min: Connolly has been a livewire and it is his defiance that forces another attack from which Maupay is fouled by a Kovacic for another yellow card. 80 min: Close! Brighton have a free-kick, taken by Trossard. Connolly controls the ball in a tight space and then turns to scuff a shot that Kepa has to deal with. That\u2019s as close as Brighton have come. 78 min: Connolly at last gets some space but then he loses his touch at a vital moment and the ball spills off for a throw. Brighton have suffered rather for a lack of composure. Montoya shows the same by smashing the ball willy nilly when a cross needed to caressed rather than walloped. 76 min: Tammy Abraham takes a kick where the sun doesn\u2019t shine - unless you are an advocate of perineum sunning - from Bernardo in a clash by the sideline. Hopefully not too much harm done. 74 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi comes off the left and looks to have an open chance at goal, only for Adam Webster to smell the danger and clear. 73 min: Jahanbakhsh swings and misses the target as the ball spills. He cannot help but lean back and screw the ball wide. 72 min: Chelsea\u2019s free-kick after that Dunk foul drifts out of play. Off goes Mason Mount, and he will be replaced by Kovacic, who will try and protect the defence a little more than Mount might be capable of. 70 min: Nice skill from Bernardo got Jahanbakhsh away but the Iranian was rather less than speedy. The breakdown of that move allows Tammy Abraham to buy Lewis Dunk the second booking of the game. 69 min: First booking sees Zouma pile into Connolly and bounce the Irishman off his feet. 68 min: Brighton change: Jahanbakhsh on for Mooy. That suggests Graham Potter sees speed being off the essence. 66 min: First Chelsea sub: off goes Pulisic, who did OK, for Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is still yet to show his best since coming back from that admittedly awful injury. Both players may have the spectre of Wilfried Zaha to contend with if those transfer types are right. 64 min: Jorginho makes an error in midfield and Maupay has the chance to play in Connolly, whose legs are pumping, only for Rudiger to come across. At the other end, James\u2019 shot is deflected after Pulisic and Mount set up an attack. 63 min: This game has heated up nicely. Not a huge amount of quality but there is a competitive edge. 61 min: Rudiger enraged as he commits another foul on Connolly. His ire is not with the ref but Tammy Abraham for being too loose with the ball. 60 min: Mooy tries to get the speed of Connolly away but Reece James shows real defensive anticipation in realising the danger and running the ball out of play for a goal kick. 59 min: Brighton forge on but Propper\u2019s attempt at a cross swerves behind. In truth, the final ball has been poor rather too often from them. 58 min: Kante fires in a snap shot that is saved by Ryan. Chances and openings at both ends now. 57 min: Near daylight for Trossard, only for the Belgian to overrun the ball. There\u2019s disappointment among the home fans over that one. That combo of Trossard, Maupay and Connolly carries a threat. 55 min: Pulisic appears to be the out-ball of choice for Chelsea and he shows off his party trick in cutting inside, and blamming an effort at goal. And it\u2019s wide this time. 53 min: A rare Chelsea sojourn, with Azpilicueta on the burst. It comes to nothing. Then Rudiger is accused of a handball from a long pass forward for Dunk for Connolly...but Chelsea get an attack away and Pulisic powers the ball into the arms of Mat Ryan. Signs are that this is opening up. 52 min: Chelsea have been unsettled by Brighton\u2019s energy though Albion have not exactly threaded much together themselves. This game has betrayed the bleariness of the time of year; there is too much football. 50 min: Connolly now chases down Rudiger. Good work from him. The plan appears to be stopping Chelsea being able to settle and Connolly is one of those players ideal for that approach, a ratter. 49 min: Rudiger fouls Connolly by the touchline, with the young Irishman showing admirable strength for someone who is giving away at least half a foot in height. 47 min: The belief appears that Chelsea can be got at so Brighton are going to try and attack. The opening moments, though, have been cagey. 46 min: They are back underway and Graham Potter has made an adventurous change: on comes Aaron Connolly for Yves Bissouma. Brighton go for something approaching 4-4-2. Chelsea closed out the half on the attack, just as they began it but they were under pressure from a Brighton side that got better as the game went on and once Graham Potter made a tactical change. Cesar Azpilicueta\u2019s goal separates the two teams. 45+2 min: Reece James still getting booed. Kante creates space and his switch of play gives Pulisic the chance to ping a shot on goal, just wide of Mat Ryan\u2019s dive and the left-hand post. 45 min: Three added minutes, mostly for that shoulder injury for poor Dan Burn. 44 min: Brighton have gone like for like on Chelsea and look to have the stronger team at this point. Some ragged defending blocks off the excellent Maupay from having a chance. 43 min: Brighton go close! Maupay goes down the channel and lays up Trossard, whose shot is whipped across goal and Kepa has to make a full-length save. Montoya\u2019s attempt at the rebound goes wide. 41 min: Aston Villa are 2-0 up on Burnley and Jack Grealish does have his goal this time. Life during VARtime can be terribly confusing. 40 min: Brighton continue to dominate possession without ever looking like creating danger. Pulisic works back well to break up play and the pitchside mic catches a bit of his American twang. 38 min: Chelsea trying to slow things down and take the sting out of a resurgent Brighton, though the home team do look a little short on the final ball. They are rather less than poised. 35 min: Chelsea concede a corner after a Zouma brainfart, and Brighton force another when Kepa looks similarly panicked. Mooy took both of them and dangerously so, and another is forced for him to ping the ball into the area of uncertainty. Mooy gets another attempt when the third corner spills out but Abraham gets back for a fine defensive header; better from Brighton, who have at last stepped it up. 33 min: Davy Propper got a little too excited when playing a through-ball and it drifts out. That may speak to Chelsea getting this game by the neck and forcing their opponent into anxious moments like that. 32 min: Some rare territory for Brighton, though they have been edging into a Chelsea team keen to play on the break. They haven\u2019t looked like creating a chance for a while, mind you. 30 min: In other news, Aston Villa have actually scored now, and no VAR so Wesley\u2019s goal has been allowed to stand. That\u2019s a big goal in the relegation battle. 28 min: Reece James is getting booed for his clash with Dan Burn...Tammy Abraham shows his coltishness when he shoots instead of playing in Willian who was burning up alongside him and would have had a far better chance of scoring. Frank Lampard\u2019s expression is peeved. 26 min: Joe Pearson writes in: \u201cThe man-bra is actually a high tech monitor, with gps and everything. They\u2019re really pretty cool.\u201d 24 min: Pulisic, who has been decent so far, gets to ping in a cross, but there was nobody reading his mind. 23 min: Bernardo took a while to come on. He needed to put on his shirt and that man bra thing that the players all wear these days. Are they a bit like those nose strips that Robbie Fowler and others used to wear back in the 1990s? 22 min: The tall tree of Dan Burn has been felled by an aerial clash with Reece James, who went up for a header and caught his opposite number in the chest, though it\u2019s his shoulder that appears to have sustained a problem. This is lengthy treatment and Burn leaves the field to be replaced by Bernardo who comes on at left-back. 18 min: Aaron Mooy has been kept quiet but seems to have moved a bit deeper. He attempts a run but is cut off but that may be a signal that Graham Potter has changed things up. 17 min: Willian looks to have a knock after running into the dreadnought also known as Dan Burn but should be OK to continue. 15 min: It\u2019s been a decent start for Chelsea, this. Brighton have rather let them play with their narrow midfield... In other news: Jack Grealish\u2019s goal has been cancelled out for VAR. 13 min: Some rather sleepy Brighton fans singing \u201cAlbion, Albion\u201d as their team tries to find a way back into the game. In other news: Jack Grealish has scored for Aston Villa at Burnley. 11 min: There was a slight delay there when Azpilicueta thought there was a tinge of VAR but he was onside and there was no push from the corner. A cheap goal to concede but Brighton had shown a soft underbelly. Pulisic spreads the play, with James again in acres of space to force a corner. Jorginho takes and it\u2019s flicked on. Abraham shoots, and the ball spills loose, and Azpi converts from close range. 8 min: It\u2019s an open game, with Brighton allowing those full-backs to run on and Chelsea looking, as ever, a little vulnerable in defence. 6 min: Both teams go close! Kante creates space for himself with a pirouette, and he slips on Reece James on the overlap. The shot goes wide but there is a warning sign for Brighton, who have narrow midfield. And straight at the other end, Alzate might have scored but for a deflection; Maupay had set him up. 4 min: Willian, the key man against Arsenal, goes on a scurry, but Brighton cut off the danger this time around. 2 min: Abraham escapes to the byline and his cross is deflected to Mason Mount, who hits the ball full on the volley but not past the first defender. 1 min: Pulisic, down the left, is quickly involved, but he is crowded out equally as quickly. A toy town rave version of Johnny Cash\u2019s Ring of Fire gets us underway as referee Stuart Attwell gets wired for sound; looks like he was cut off from the VAR, which might not have been a great loss to the game depending on your point of view. The teams are out at the Amex. It looks like Chelsea are going four at the back, having made a couple of switches during the Christmas period. In fact, it\u2019s pretty much 4-3-3 versus 4-3-3. Frank Lampard speaks. Ten years ago, he was Super Frank, Super goals. I think the overriding factor from the Arsenal game was the spirit and the fight. We have been waiting for the players to do that which is just pure spirit and fight. There are things we can always improve and this game is a different animal, different opponent, a footballing team, one that will try and plau. I have a lot of respect for what Graham Potter\u2019s done....(On ten years ago) I would say no chance, it was a thought maybe. The honour of managing this club is huge. Graham Potter speaks. Ten years ago, he was working at Leeds Carnegie University. It would be nice to start off the year with a positive performance and a positive result. We are playing against a good team and it\u2019s going to be a tough game but we are in a good place. We gave been struggling a little for results but performances have been good. It was nice to get a win in our previous game so hopefully we take that forward...It\u2019s been some decade. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to see the journey; it\u2019s been a nice time. All is quiet on New Year\u2019s Day. That Brighton team news seems tough on Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who scored his first goal for the club against Bournemouth after 18 months of trying. Chelsea have made three changes since Arsenal, where they didn\u2019t play too well until late on, with Reece James, Christian Pulisic and Jorginho coming in for Azpilicueta, Mateo Kovacic and Emerson dropping out. Emerson has been linked with a move in the transfer rumour mill while another player who seems almost definite to be leaving, Olivier Giroud, has been left out altogether. New Year, new VAR? All the talk at Chelsea is of transfers, with their Fifa ban now revoked. Brighton: Ryan, Montoya, Webster, Dunk, Burn, Propper, Bissouma, Alzate, Mooy, Trossard, Maupay. Subs: Duffy, Stephens, Gross, Jahanbakhsh, Button, Bernardo, Connolly. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, James, Rudiger, Zouma, Azpilicueta, Kante, Jorginho, Willian, Mount, Pulisic, Abraham. Subs: Christensen, Caballero, Kovacic, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi, Emerson Palmieri, Lamptey. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire) Here are the teams. What did we learn about Chelsea over Christmas? Well, they aren\u2019t quite as bad as Jonathan Wilson thought they might be, but then came that home defeat to Southampton to remind that the Bridge is rather less than a fortress these days. Then came that win at Arsenal which Frank Lampard really enjoyed, though he admitted his team had ridden their luck against an opponent who self-destructed almost as if as to show their new manager the depth of the challenge that awaits him. For the final match of their festive flurry, a nice trip to the South Coast and a swill of some Sussex ales for the fans, but Brighton may be a tricky proposition. \u201cPotterball\u201d has taken the imagination of Albion fans, and results like the weekend\u2019s defeat of Bournemouth, a peer club of greater Premier League cachet, will do nicely. Graham Potter\u2019s task was to maintain safety and entertain the public far more than under Chris Hughton. So far, so good for the Premier League manager most likely to declare himself a fan of Ocean Colour Scene. What better way to wake up those tired eyes and add ballast to those sagging dewlaps than this curtain raiser to the Roaring Twenties? Kick-off is at 12.30pm, GMT.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Doing music as a career didn\u2019t even register as something that was possible,\u201d recalls DJ, producer and composer David Holmes. \u201cGrowing up in the Troubles, you just never felt things like that happened to people like you.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty years ago, Holmes was working as a hairdresser in a Belfast salon with fellow music obsessive Iain McCready. Holmes had been booking bands since the age of 15 and McCready was running underground hip-hop nights in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re both blessed with a personality of not waiting around for things to happen,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cSo we put on our own nights.\u201d On 23 December 1989, the pair launched Sugar Sweet \u2013 initially called Base and then briefly The Face \u2013 a night that brought acid house and rave culture to Belfast with a mighty thump. Earlier this month, the pair threw a one-off 30th anniversary party to celebrate.</p> <p>Throwing such parties wasn\u2019t straightforward, given the Troubles were still ongoing. Holmes was born in 1969, the same year British troops were first deployed in Northern Ireland (in an operation that lasted until 2007). \u201cWe were a Catholic family living in a majority Protestant neighbourhood so we were open targets,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy house was pipe-bombed when I was four. I was in the bath. The Troubles was just a fucking lottery of death \u2013 people dying because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p> <p>While there had been a small and committed community of \u201cfreaks\u201d running underground nights before this, things escalated with Sugar Sweet. \u201cWhen acid house came in, things really [changed],\u201d says McCready. Like everywhere else in the UK, the musical explosion came with a spike in ecstasy consumption. \u201cWhen the ecstasy boom hit, that turned so many people on to the music for the very first time,\u201d Holmes says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03b78d442fad4ac2b89dcc1c46778b9c8acd6aca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03b78d442fad4ac2b89dcc1c46778b9c8acd6aca/0_0_5631_3739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children playing among debris from hijacked burning vehicles after riots in west Belfast, August 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children playing among debris from hijacked burning vehicles after riots in west Belfast, August 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alain Le Garsmeur/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The combination of political tension, exhilarating new music, euphoric new drugs and a brand new place to experience them was a potent concoction. \u201cEverything was so fresh and raw,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cAll week you\u2019re getting searched, there\u2019s roadblocks, it takes three hours to get home \u2013 people are being shot on your fucking doorstep. But when you\u2019re living in that moment, you don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re being affected by it.\u201d</p> <p>Holmes and McCready could immediately sense the crowd letting go. \u201cIf you spend Monday to Saturday living in fear and paranoia, once you cross into that club and you\u2019re hearing this music from all over the world, while being psychedelically intoxicated, all that shit just disappears,\u201d Holmes says.</p> <p>\u201cThe Troubles manifests itself in your psyche in ways that you cannot even understand, so when you\u2019re on that dancefloor and religion isn\u2019t a barrier any more \u2013 the atmosphere was just beautiful.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Doing music as a career didn\u2019t even register as something that was possible,\u201d recalls DJ, producer and composer David Holmes. \u201cGrowing up in the Troubles, you just never felt things like that happened to people like you.\u201d Thirty years ago, Holmes was working as a hairdresser in a Belfast salon with fellow music obsessive Iain McCready. Holmes had been booking bands since the age of 15 and McCready was running underground hip-hop nights in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re both blessed with a personality of not waiting around for things to happen,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cSo we put on our own nights.\u201d On 23 December 1989, the pair launched Sugar Sweet \u2013 initially called Base and then briefly The Face \u2013 a night that brought acid house and rave culture to Belfast with a mighty thump. Earlier this month, the pair threw a one-off 30th anniversary party to celebrate. Throwing such parties wasn\u2019t straightforward, given the Troubles were still ongoing. Holmes was born in 1969, the same year British troops were first deployed in Northern Ireland (in an operation that lasted until 2007). \u201cWe were a Catholic family living in a majority Protestant neighbourhood so we were open targets,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy house was pipe-bombed when I was four. I was in the bath. The Troubles was just a fucking lottery of death \u2013 people dying because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d While there had been a small and committed community of \u201cfreaks\u201d running underground nights before this, things escalated with Sugar Sweet. \u201cWhen acid house came in, things really [changed],\u201d says McCready. Like everywhere else in the UK, the musical explosion came with a spike in ecstasy consumption. \u201cWhen the ecstasy boom hit, that turned so many people on to the music for the very first time,\u201d Holmes says. The combination of political tension, exhilarating new music, euphoric new drugs and a brand new place to experience them was a potent concoction. \u201cEverything was so fresh and raw,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cAll week you\u2019re getting searched, there\u2019s roadblocks, it takes three hours to get home \u2013 people are being shot on your fucking doorstep. But when you\u2019re living in that moment, you don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re being affected by it.\u201d Holmes and McCready could immediately sense the crowd letting go. \u201cIf you spend Monday to Saturday living in fear and paranoia, once you cross into that club and you\u2019re hearing this music from all over the world, while being psychedelically intoxicated, all that shit just disappears,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cThe Troubles manifests itself in your psyche in ways that you cannot even understand, so when you\u2019re on that dancefloor and religion isn\u2019t a barrier any more \u2013 the atmosphere was just beautiful. There was all this energy released. These communities fucking hated each other but among them you had groups of people whose religion was music.\u201d Many DJs were too scared to come and perform but the likes of Andrew Weatherall and the Dust Brothers (before they became the Chemical Brothers) played.

      "body": "<p>Aston Villa bounced back from their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/watford-aston-villa-premier-league-report\" title=\"\">drubbing at Watford</a> to record only their second away win of the season at Burnley, outclassing their opponents to succeed at a venue where they have not won in 14 attempts since 1959. A late Burnley goal flattered the home side a little, for in the first half in particular Villa were full of running and attacking ideas, with Jack Grealish pulling most of the strings.</p> <p>The only downside for Villa was the sight of Wesley and Tom Heaton departing on stretchers with knee injuries. Both may be out for some time. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to have scans before we know anything,\u201d Dean Smith said. \u201cThose are two big players for us and if we lose them it will take the gloss off this win a little bit. We haven\u2019t been great on the road but we knew we had to be better than we were at Watford. We spoke a lot about that game and came up with a hell of a response.\u201d</p> <p>Villa enjoyed most of the possession in the first half, used it well and would have turned round even further in front but for the latest VAR outrage. Grealish was most certainly not offside when he skipped away from Phil Bardsley to meet Ezri Konsa Ngoyo\u2019s 11th-minute cross with a glancing header but \u2013 after the goal had been given and the ball placed on the centre spot ready to restart \u2013 it became clear Stockley Park scrutineers were checking whether Wesley\u2019s heel was closer to goal than that of James Tarkowski. They decided it was, though the fact the deliberations lasted more than two minutes gave a clue as to how tiny was the margin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/01/newcastle-united-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live\">Newcastle United v Leicester City: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Villa fans at the other end of the ground vented their anti-VAR feelings in the now familiar way, as well they might.

      "bodyText": "Aston Villa bounced back from their drubbing at Watford to record only their second away win of the season at Burnley, outclassing their opponents to succeed at a venue where they have not won in 14 attempts since 1959. A late Burnley goal flattered the home side a little, for in the first half in particular Villa were full of running and attacking ideas, with Jack Grealish pulling most of the strings. The only downside for Villa was the sight of Wesley and Tom Heaton departing on stretchers with knee injuries. Both may be out for some time. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to have scans before we know anything,\u201d Dean Smith said. \u201cThose are two big players for us and if we lose them it will take the gloss off this win a little bit. We haven\u2019t been great on the road but we knew we had to be better than we were at Watford. We spoke a lot about that game and came up with a hell of a response.\u201d Villa enjoyed most of the possession in the first half, used it well and would have turned round even further in front but for the latest VAR outrage. Grealish was most certainly not offside when he skipped away from Phil Bardsley to meet Ezri Konsa Ngoyo\u2019s 11th-minute cross with a glancing header but \u2013 after the goal had been given and the ball placed on the centre spot ready to restart \u2013 it became clear Stockley Park scrutineers were checking whether Wesley\u2019s heel was closer to goal than that of James Tarkowski. They decided it was, though the fact the deliberations lasted more than two minutes gave a clue as to how tiny was the margin. The Villa fans at the other end of the ground vented their anti-VAR feelings in the now familiar way, as well they might. The way the technology is being used in this country is anti-goals and anti-excitement, and you don\u2019t get up early on New Year\u2019s Day and brave the M6 to put up with that sort of nonsense. \u201cBaffling,\u201d was Smith\u2019s verdict. Not that Villa let the injustice bother them. They kept pressing forward, kept catching Burnley\u2019s defence square with the accuracy of their passing, and just before the half\u2011hour were rewarded with a splendid goal. Predictably Grealish was again involved, interpassing with Wesley on the edge of the area before his lofted return found the striker with room to turn and volley past Nick Pope. The Turf Moor crowd started to berate the home defence for allowing Villa too much time and space on the ball, though the message went unheeded. On the stroke of half-time Burnley stood back and watched as Villa moved the ball smartly from right to left across the edge of the area, until Douglas Luiz\u2019s pass gave Grealish the opportunity to weigh up his shooting options. Bardsley unwisely stood off the Villa captain as he first shaped to attempt a curler into the top\u2011right corner before summoning the accuracy to find the top-left instead. Grealish has shown time and again this season what he can do in these situations and closing him down quickly is a defensive imperative. Sean Dyche sent on Jay Rodriguez for the second half and he nearly pulled a goal back almost immediately, shooting too high with little time to react to Tarkowski\u2019s driven cross, though at the other end Villa might have extended their lead but for Pope keeping out an effort from Douglas Luiz. Burnley put the Villa defence under sustained pressure in the second half without ever really looking like scoring until Wood popped up at the far post to nod in a cross from Ashley Westwood, the tall striker\u2019s glaring miss from a good position a few minutes earlier being more typical of their afternoon. \u201cWe were a long way short today, especially in the first half,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cIt looked like we were waiting for someone to give us something, and you can\u2019t play like that in the Premier League.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Ed Smith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/15/england-first-test-pakistan-lords-ed-smith-jos-buttler-dom-bess\" title=\"\">named his first England Test squad</a> as national selector, it was notable for two contrasting cricketers from Somerset. The first, Jos Buttler, had long since left that nest and his wings expanded yet further from that point. As of this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/27/englands-cricketers-and-exceptional-women-in-sport-honoured\" title=\"\">he has MBE next to his name</a> but the other who turned out for England against Pakistan last summer, Dom Bess, has been invisible since. That is until Friday in Cape Town, where he has bolted back into the box seat for inclusion.</p> <p>That he was called up to this squad on the basis of a veritable pandemic \u2013 now striking 17 of the touring party and support staff \u2013 suggests a mood of desperation given how far Bess, now 22, had ventured from prominence. However, they are also similar circumstances to those that won him his debut. Then, Moeen Ali was out of favour having placed white ball above red after a shocking Ashes series and Jack Leach, who took over as principal spinner, was injured. Now, the former is again on the T20 circuit after losing his Test spot and contract after Australia tore his confidence apart in the Ashes opener last August, while the latter has spent the past week in quarantine, hit hardest by the bug that has decimated the ranks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/jofra-archer-injury-doubt-second-cricket-test-south-africa\">England\u2019s Jofra Archer an injury doubt for second Test against South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bess found out about his debut selection when Smith called him as he was sofa shopping. To then, in a whirlwind two years he had claimed five bags of five with his off-spin in his first six County Championship starts, another on debut for the England Lions in Antigua, before making a ton for the MCC in the annual season-opening fixture. Suddenly, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/20/dom-bess-england-first-test-pakistan-lords\" title=\"\">readying himself to become the youngest finger spinner</a> to represent his country in a Test with Vic Marks \u2013 the Lord of this Parish, and another Somerset tweaker \u2013 presenting the cap.</p> <p>The next fortnight was eventful. At Lord\u2019s he was wicketless and largely ineffective with the ball but compiled an assured 57 with the bat \u2013 mostly alongside Buttler \u2013 to give the hosts faint hope from an otherwise dire match. At Headingley, Bess made 49 further impressive runs (coming in as the nightwatchman) before claiming his first three England wickets. He also snaffled a spectacular one-handed catch off Jimmy Anderson\u2019s bowling, the veteran superstar who he could well end up replacing as Joe Root\u2019s side reconfigure for the second Test.</p> <p>But when the Test side reassembled to play India in August 2018, he was overlooked for the returning Moeen. There were comforting words from Smith of Bess\u2019s \u201coutstanding all-round contribution\u201d against Pakistan but there was a problem: he was no longer getting a game for his county. Already into the wilderness, Bess was demoted to Somerset\u2019s second XI barely a month after contributing to a Test win. So often the lot in life of a spinner when competing for one spot, Leach \u2013 his county teammate too \u2013 was the senior man with no further room at the inn. Bess\u2019 dismount from 2018 was a nightmare against Lancashire, given only four overs with the ball then dismissed to a wild heave with the scores level in a game that would be tied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af0e0321bd652e1d2eb3b4bf00c4f0b41e9a015\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af0e0321bd652e1d2eb3b4bf00c4f0b41e9a015/0_148_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dom Bess in action at Headingley against Pakistan in June 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dom Bess in action at Headingley against Pakistan in June 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI got to the top of Mount Everest with the Test stuff and then fell off,\u201d Bess later reflected of the chastening experience. Somerset\u2019s coach, Jason Kerr, observed that first\u2011hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you are that\u2019s incredibly tough,\u201d he says of the acute fall. \u201cHe had this meteoric rise where everything he touched turned to gold and was playing at Lord\u2019s in a Test Match. To deal with that immense high and playing second-team cricket just a few weeks later, it was a turbulent time and he found it very difficult. But he has matured a hell of a lot and is much clearer in terms of knowing there are only certain things he can control. He\u2019s a much stronger character now and will be a much better cricketer for it in the long term.\u201d</p> <p>The turbulence morphed into a move during 2019, albeit on a temporary basis, to Yorkshire. A product of the Somerset Academy, he was now on loan at the ground where he played most recently for England. Alas, after four starts (and a later spell at Leeds in the T20 Blast), Bess was back to Taunton for the final stretch of the season. On his return, he claimed his first five-wicket haul for two seasons, finishing with 26 scalps at a useful average of 26.</p> <p>\u201cIt is easy to get his head turned regarding having certain opportunities,\u201d Kerr says of Yorkshire\u2019s interest in Bess, with Kent also apparently sniffing around. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously very ambitious and wants to get back to the giddy heights of international cricket sooner rather than later. But we have been very transparent with him: we think he is an incredibly talented cricketer. We certainly want him to be at Somerset for the long haul. He obviously has competition at Somerset but is still one of the better spinners in the country. We have to try to find a way to keep them both.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/player-resistance-the-major-hurdle-to-crickets-proposed-four-day-tests\">'Ridiculous \u2013 I'm not a fan': four-day Tests plan meets player resistance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the volatility, Bess remained in the thinking of decision-makers to the extent he was taken on a Lions spin camp in Mumbai this winter. There, under the tutelage of Sri Lanka\u2019s Rangana Herath and the former England twirler Richard Dawson, he impressed sufficiently to become the man to call for when Leach fell ill. Coming in hot, he has already bowled himself ahead of Matt Parkinson, the leg-spinner originally sent on tour in support of Leach. His strength with the bat surely stands out in the memory too, given the long tail who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/29/england-south-africa-day-four-first-test-report-new-ball\" title=\"\">exposed twice against South Africa</a> when an all-pace attack was deployed.</p> <p>Whether Bess is ripe for the challenge at Newlands \u2013 especially for bowling long, frugal spells to keep the seamers fresh \u2013 the coming days will tell. Yes it\u2019s likely that, unless he can win selection as much for his batting as his bowling, come April he will be back to second-team cricket \u2013 again behind Leach \u2013 and it may take a while before this is no longer the status quo for club or country. Or he may bowl the house down and turn that thinking on its head. After the past 18 months, what is certain is that he won\u2019t be lacking for motivation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "When Ed Smith named his first England Test squad as national selector, it was notable for two contrasting cricketers from Somerset. The first, Jos Buttler, had long since left that nest and his wings expanded yet further from that point. As of this week he has MBE next to his name but the other who turned out for England against Pakistan last summer, Dom Bess, has been invisible since. That is until Friday in Cape Town, where he has bolted back into the box seat for inclusion. That he was called up to this squad on the basis of a veritable pandemic \u2013 now striking 17 of the touring party and support staff \u2013 suggests a mood of desperation given how far Bess, now 22, had ventured from prominence. However, they are also similar circumstances to those that won him his debut. Then, Moeen Ali was out of favour having placed white ball above red after a shocking Ashes series and Jack Leach, who took over as principal spinner, was injured. Now, the former is again on the T20 circuit after losing his Test spot and contract after Australia tore his confidence apart in the Ashes opener last August, while the latter has spent the past week in quarantine, hit hardest by the bug that has decimated the ranks. Bess found out about his debut selection when Smith called him as he was sofa shopping. To then, in a whirlwind two years he had claimed five bags of five with his off-spin in his first six County Championship starts, another on debut for the England Lions in Antigua, before making a ton for the MCC in the annual season-opening fixture. Suddenly, he was readying himself to become the youngest finger spinner to represent his country in a Test with Vic Marks \u2013 the Lord of this Parish, and another Somerset tweaker \u2013 presenting the cap. The next fortnight was eventful. At Lord\u2019s he was wicketless and largely ineffective with the ball but compiled an assured 57 with the bat \u2013 mostly alongside Buttler \u2013 to give the hosts faint hope from an otherwise dire match. At Headingley, Bess made 49 further impressive runs (coming in as the nightwatchman) before claiming his first three England wickets. He also snaffled a spectacular one-handed catch off Jimmy Anderson\u2019s bowling, the veteran superstar who he could well end up replacing as Joe Root\u2019s side reconfigure for the second Test. But when the Test side reassembled to play India in August 2018, he was overlooked for the returning Moeen. There were comforting words from Smith of Bess\u2019s \u201coutstanding all-round contribution\u201d against Pakistan but there was a problem: he was no longer getting a game for his county. Already into the wilderness, Bess was demoted to Somerset\u2019s second XI barely a month after contributing to a Test win. So often the lot in life of a spinner when competing for one spot, Leach \u2013 his county teammate too \u2013 was the senior man with no further room at the inn. Bess\u2019 dismount from 2018 was a nightmare against Lancashire, given only four overs with the ball then dismissed to a wild heave with the scores level in a game that would be tied. \u201cI got to the top of Mount Everest with the Test stuff and then fell off,\u201d Bess later reflected of the chastening experience. Somerset\u2019s coach, Jason Kerr, observed that first\u2011hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you are that\u2019s incredibly tough,\u201d he says of the acute fall. \u201cHe had this meteoric rise where everything he touched turned to gold and was playing at Lord\u2019s in a Test Match. To deal with that immense high and playing second-team cricket just a few weeks later, it was a turbulent time and he found it very difficult. But he has matured a hell of a lot and is much clearer in terms of knowing there are only certain things he can control. He\u2019s a much stronger character now and will be a much better cricketer for it in the long term.\u201d The turbulence morphed into a move during 2019, albeit on a temporary basis, to Yorkshire. A product of the Somerset Academy, he was now on loan at the ground where he played most recently for England. Alas, after four starts (and a later spell at Leeds in the T20 Blast), Bess was back to Taunton for the final stretch of the season. On his return, he claimed his first five-wicket haul for two seasons, finishing with 26 scalps at a useful average of 26. \u201cIt is easy to get his head turned regarding having certain opportunities,\u201d Kerr says of Yorkshire\u2019s interest in Bess, with Kent also apparently sniffing around. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously very ambitious and wants to get back to the giddy heights of international cricket sooner rather than later. But we have been very transparent with him: we think he is an incredibly talented cricketer. We certainly want him to be at Somerset for the long haul. He obviously has competition at Somerset but is still one of the better spinners in the country. We have to try to find a way to keep them both.\u201d Amid the volatility, Bess remained in the thinking of decision-makers to the extent he was taken on a Lions spin camp in Mumbai this winter. There, under the tutelage of Sri Lanka\u2019s Rangana Herath and the former England twirler Richard Dawson, he impressed sufficiently to become the man to call for when Leach fell ill. Coming in hot, he has already bowled himself ahead of Matt Parkinson, the leg-spinner originally sent on tour in support of Leach. His strength with the bat surely stands out in the memory too, given the long tail who were exposed twice against South Africa when an all-pace attack was deployed. Whether Bess is ripe for the challenge at Newlands \u2013 especially for bowling long, frugal spells to keep the seamers fresh \u2013 the coming days will tell. Yes it\u2019s likely that, unless he can win selection as much for his batting as his bowling, come April he will be back to second-team cricket \u2013 again behind Leach \u2013 and it may take a while before this is no longer the status quo for club or country. Or he may bowl the house down and turn that thinking on its head. After the past 18 months, what is certain is that he won\u2019t be lacking for motivation.",

Equal pay cases allege that a woman was paid less than a man for doing the same or equivalent work for reasons of gender. At least a dozen long-running cases are understood to be still active, the former BBC China editor Carrie Gracie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/28/samira-ahmed-employment-tribunal-over-equal-pay-gets-underway\">said in October</a>.</p> \n<p>During Ahmed\u2019s landmark case, she argued she was owed almost \u00a3700,000 in back pay because of the difference in pay between her \u00a3440-an-episode pay for the BBC\u2019s Newswatch and the \u00a33,000 an episode Jeremy Vine received for Points of View. Both are short television programmes of similar length that deal with viewer feedback about BBC output. Ahmed claimed the pay difference was an example of gender discrimination.</p> \n<p>The BBC denied the claim, insisting Newswatch was a journalistic programme that attracts a lower fee and requires a different type of presenter to Points of View, which is an entertainment programme. Its lawyer said the higher salary was justified because the show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/07/bbc-deliberately-failed-to-call-key-witnesses-in-samira-ahmed-dispute\">required a host</a> such as Vine with a lighthearted \u201ccheeky\u201d manner who would \u201coften dress up\u201d, citing occasions when he wore a hat.</p> \n<p>At the tribunal, in which Ahmed was supported by other female BBC presenters in a show of solidarity, the corporation was left in the uncomfortable position of trying to talk down the importance of its own programming. At one point the BBC\u2019s legal team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/30/bbc-mounts-defence-in-samira-ahmed-equal-pay-case\">described the entire BBC News </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/30/bbc-mounts-defence-in-samira-ahmed-equal-pay-case\">channel</a> \u2013 the flagship 24-hour service \u2013 as \u201crelatively niche\u201d, angering some of those who work there.</p> \n<p>To make matters worse, an unredacted document <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/31/bbc-error-reveals-names-of-120-women-who-sought-equal-pay\">featuring the names of more than </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/31/bbc-error-reveals-names-of-120-women-who-sought-equal-pay\">100 BBC female employees</a> who were supposedly bringing equal pay cases against the corporation was included in the documents made available to journalists reporting on the case.</p> \n<p>Both the National Union of Journalists and the BBC blamed each other for the failure to redact the documents, which led to some of those named complaining to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and senior BBC bosses phoning those affected to offer their apologies.</p> \n<p>There were also embarrassing details about the BBC\u2019s pay negotiations with Vine\u2019s agent, in which he ended up with a deal worth about \u00a31m a year, while Ahmed claimed she had been told by a senior executive the BBC \u201cdoesn\u2019t do equal pay\u201d \u2013 something the corporation strongly denied.</p> \n<p>Ahmed\u2019s tribunal verdict is due early this year, with potentially major consequences for the BBC and those bringing equal pay cases as they await the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/12/equality-commission-investigate-bbc-gender-pay-gap\">result of an investigation into the broadcaster\u2019s</a> handling of such cases by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The corporation is already facing pressure to reduce costs and further cuts could be on their way if the new Conservative government presses ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee.</p> \n<p>A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had made significant changes to pay and grading over recent years, resulting in a large number of pay queries that were \u201cmainly addressed through internal processes\u201d and did not result in any changes to individuals\u2019 pay, although \u201ca tiny percentage end up in dispute or tribunal\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur approach to these cases has not changed. We continue to try to engage with our staff to resolve disputes where it is possible and appropriate. However, mindful of our obligations to the licence fee payer, we will robustly defend our position at tribunal if necessary.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC has approached women who are bringing equal pay cases against it to discuss potential settlements, in an apparent attempt to head off a repeat of Samira Ahmed\u2019s employment tribunal in which embarrassing details of the corporation\u2019s inner workings were made public. Individuals with knowledge of the equal pay cases said some women who were preparing to follow Ahmed and take their cases to tribunal, having exhausted internal BBC processes, were being approached and asked if they would be interested in a settlement. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent huge amount of money telling women they don\u2019t have a claim \u2013 but now they\u2019re approaching women as they head to tribunal and offering to make it go away,\u201d said one. The cases involve alleged incidences of unequal pay, which is separate to the wider problem of the gender pay gap. Equal pay cases allege that a woman was paid less than a man for doing the same or equivalent work for reasons of gender. At least a dozen long-running cases are understood to be still active, the former BBC China editor Carrie Gracie said in October. During Ahmed\u2019s landmark case, she argued she was owed almost \u00a3700,000 in back pay because of the difference in pay between her \u00a3440-an-episode pay for the BBC\u2019s Newswatch and the \u00a33,000 an episode Jeremy Vine received for Points of View. Both are short television programmes of similar length that deal with viewer feedback about BBC output. Ahmed claimed the pay difference was an example of gender discrimination. The BBC denied the claim, insisting Newswatch was a journalistic programme that attracts a lower fee and requires a different type of presenter to Points of View, which is an entertainment programme. Its lawyer said the higher salary was justified because the show required a host such as Vine with a lighthearted \u201ccheeky\u201d manner who would \u201coften dress up\u201d, citing occasions when he wore a hat. At the tribunal, in which Ahmed was supported by other female BBC presenters in a show of solidarity, the corporation was left in the uncomfortable position of trying to talk down the importance of its own programming. At one point the BBC\u2019s legal team described the entire BBC News channel \u2013 the flagship 24-hour service \u2013 as \u201crelatively niche\u201d, angering some of those who work there. To make matters worse, an unredacted document featuring the names of more than 100 BBC female employees who were supposedly bringing equal pay cases against the corporation was included in the documents made available to journalists reporting on the case. Both the National Union of Journalists and the BBC blamed each other for the failure to redact the documents, which led to some of those named complaining to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and senior BBC bosses phoning those affected to offer their apologies. There were also embarrassing details about the BBC\u2019s pay negotiations with Vine\u2019s agent, in which he ended up with a deal worth about \u00a31m a year, while Ahmed claimed she had been told by a senior executive the BBC \u201cdoesn\u2019t do equal pay\u201d \u2013 something the corporation strongly denied. Ahmed\u2019s tribunal verdict is due early this year, with potentially major consequences for the BBC and those bringing equal pay cases as they await the result of an investigation into the broadcaster\u2019s handling of such cases by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The corporation is already facing pressure to reduce costs and further cuts could be on their way if the new Conservative government presses ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee. A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had made significant changes to pay and grading over recent years, resulting in a large number of pay queries that were \u201cmainly addressed through internal processes\u201d and did not result in any changes to individuals\u2019 pay, although \u201ca tiny percentage end up in dispute or tribunal\u201d. \u201cOur approach to these cases has not changed. We continue to try to engage with our staff to resolve disputes where it is possible and appropriate. However, mindful of our obligations to the licence fee payer, we will robustly defend our position at tribunal if necessary.\u201d",

However, German media reported that 48-year-old Massa, the oldest living silverback gorilla in the European endangered species breeding programme, had perished in the flames. Investigators believe it is highly likely the fire was was caused by Chinese sky lanterns, also known as Kongming lanterns, which had been illegally set off in the city, police said at a press conference on Wednesday. Several witnesses had reported low-flying lanterns in the city on Tuesday night, and three lanterns with handwritten messages had been found near the zoo enclosure, a police spokesperson said. Setting off rockets and firecrackers in the streets is a key part of Germany\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve ritual, and the law allows citizens to light their own fireworks in public on 31 December and 1 January. In recent years there has been a growing debate about a ban on pyrotechnics, and about 30 German municipalities imposed partial bans on private fireworks this year. The sale of Chinese sky lanterns is already illegal in all German states bar the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, however. The Krefeld zoo\u2019s management said several employees were still in shock and the site would remain closed to the public on 1 January.",

But Brexit, the US presidential election and the US trade war with China could all spring nasty surprises over the next 12 months and give the long-running bull market a jolt.</p> <h2>The UK and Brexit</h2> <p>Relief that Brexit is resolved will be replaced by anxiety over the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the transition period due to end in December 2020.</p> <p>Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts UK GDP will only rise by 0.9% in 2020, even weaker than the 1.2% in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that there will be some bounce in activity given the clarity on Brexit, but any improvement in sentiment is likely to fade as the next Brexit deadline draws closer,\u201d Turner says.</p> <p>Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, believes the UK will get a \u201cfiscal boost\u201d from the forthcoming budget, due in February. This could include an increase in the threshold for paying national insurance \u2013 in effect a tax cut.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy has been facing the twin headwinds of Brexit uncertainty, which has almost certainly depressed business investment and could also have undermined the consumer, and the weaker global economy, especially in the eurozone. Having said that, there still seems to be growth,\u201d Lea says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83385b62f48ff34eddb6094f1b1383749b0733a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83385b62f48ff34eddb6094f1b1383749b0733a8/361_0_3806_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson faces further tough talks with Brussels that could hit sterling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pier Marco Tacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The London stock market shrugged off Brexit anxiety during 2019 to post its best year since 2016. Several analysts predict it will rally in 2020 as relatively unloved UK shares are embraced by investors again.</p> <p>Jeremy Podger, who manages Fidelity\u2019s \u00a32.7bn global special situations fund, says the City should benefit from the increased certainty created by the Conservative win in last month\u2019s election.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears to be the case that, in general, investors have been taking money out of the UK stock market since the referendum and that it is generally underrepresented in many international portfolios. This result could be a trigger for these investors to \u2018neutralise\u2019 their exposure while existing investors are unlikely to sell for now,\u201d Podger explains.</p> <p>But the prospect of fresh tough negotiations between London and Brussels over their future relationship will probably weigh heavily on sterling in 2020.</p> <p>The UK could crash on to World Trade Organization trade rules in a year\u2019s time if it cannot reach an agreement and refuses to extend the transition period. This would be \u201ca significant step down from the current arrangement and an arrangement that investors fear will negatively impact the UK economy,\u201d says Fiona Cincotta of City Index.</p> <h2>Takeovers in the UK</h2> <p>This year there could also be a rise in takeover activity. Jonathan Boyers, the head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG, predicts a flurry of deals in the next six months now the UK has a stable government.</p> <p>\u201cMany of those who have been mulling over an exit have done their early prep work and are set to launch processes in the new year. Meanwhile, I expect there will be a significant amount of demand, keeping prices high, as the market makes up for some of the lost volume,\u201d Boyers says.</p> <p>Ben Higson, the head of the London corporate practice at law firm Hogan Lovells, also expects a \u201cdynamic\u201d mergers and acquisitions market in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cThe removal of political uncertainty in the UK has resulted in early signs of confidence returning to deal-making activity, keeping boardrooms and other decision-makers busy in the final weeks of the year and, we expect, early in the new year,\u201d says Higson.</p> <h2>Trump and US markets</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to win a second term is likely to dominate the headlines for much of the next 12 months.</p> <p>Markets often do well in an election year \u2013 partly because the White House incumbent has every incentive to make people feel richer.

A Republican win has been Wall Street\u2019s \u201cbase case for a while\u201d, so a Democratic win could startle the markets.</p> <p>\u201cDespite the strong economy, key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania all have Biden leading Trump in recent polls. A Biden presidency would still be positive for US stocks but perhaps a few percentage points lower than a Trump victory,\u201d Moya points out.</p> <p>But if Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders were to beat Trump, tech stocks, banks and pharmaceuticals firms could all face tougher regulation, triggering a sell-off.</p> <p>John Moore, a senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says political concerns are already being priced into some stocks.</p> <p>\u201cElizabeth Warren, for example, has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/elizabeth-warren-facebook-break-up\">no secret of her feelings about Facebook</a> and a desire to break up some of the other tech giants.

In an instant, Rooney will become the Football League\u2019s biggest superstar.</p> <p>Last season it was Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, this time around Cocu and Rooney are the coups, high-profile signings and headline arrivals orchestrated by the Derby owner, Mel Morris. The club are 17th, nine points off the play-off places, but they hope Rooney, a Champions League and five-times Premier League winner, can ignite an indifferent season.</p> <p>Rooney, too, is desperate to make a difference and finish his playing career on a high. Since arriving he has trained with the rest of the squad as planned but has also been on a tailor-made fitness programme \u2013 a mini pre-season regime \u2013 to help him get up to speed. Where Rooney plays remains to be seen but the 34-year-old is expected to operate in midfield, possibly as a No 10 in Cocu\u2019s preferred 4-2-3-1 system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dafbf82bebe729d3b48b46a663cfbf771323737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dafbf82bebe729d3b48b46a663cfbf771323737/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rooney trains at Derby\u2019s Moor Farm training centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rooney on the ball at Derby\u2019s Moor Farm training centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Clarke/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rooney may no longer be in his pomp but Derby are rightfully excited to unleash their not-so-secret weapon.

      "bodyText": "The family of a man whose body was found in a former bank in Yorkshire have said they have been devastated by his death. Asghar Badshah, 39, who had been missing for a month, was discovered after police forced entry into the building in Batley on Sunday. Two men, aged 27 and 30, and a 41-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Both men have since been released under investigation, while the woman is on bail pending further inquiries. DCI Heather Whoriskey, from West Yorkshire police, said Badshah, who was from Bradford, had been reported missing on 4 December. She added: \u201cWe believe he was last seen in the early hours of 30 November and I would appeal to anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in Commercial Street around that time or since to contact my team, so we can establish if this is linked to our investigation.\u201d In a statement, his family said: \u201cWe as a family are deeply shocked and devastated by the loss of our dear brother Asghar Badshah. His beautiful smile and charisma, as well as his generosity will never be forgotten. \u201c[We] please ask for privacy during our time of grief as our elderly mother is deeply upset at this time. We pray for justice for Asghar and appeal to the public for any assistance they can provide to the police in this investigation.\u201d The building on Commercial Street had been previously occupied by Yorkshire Bank, but has been disused since the branch closed in 2016. Neighbouring shops and businesses were temporarily closed following the discovery. Tracy Brabin, the MP for Batley and Spen, told the Telegraph &amp; Argus: \u201cThis was a serious and worrying incident and I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like for the friends and family of the victim.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>With food politics, it is tempting to want to categorize dishes as your own, especially as a second- or third-generation Asian American. Growing up in southern California, 20 minutes from Orange county\u2019s famous Little Saigon district, I was raised on ph\u1edf restaurants with linoleum floors, Formica tables and servers who openly chided my weak accent. You can\u2019t get more Vietnamese than that, and I took pride in it.</p> <p>Later, as a college student in New York, I started work at a ph\u1edf restaurant in Greenwich Village. I applied to the job, where I still work today, in part because I wanted to be a starving artist without actually starving, but also because I thought it would connect me to a Vietnamese community that was otherwise difficult to find in New York, where there is only a small Vietnamese population.</p> <p>On my first day of work, I clocked in to discover that almost all the workers were Chinese or Latinx. There was not much of an ethnic connection, but I stayed anyway and was trained by the two owners, a pair of half-Vietnamese, half-Chinese men who had gentrified the menu for the Greenwich locals and college students.

Growing up in southern California, 20 minutes from Orange county\u2019s famous Little Saigon district, I was raised on ph\u1edf restaurants with linoleum floors, Formica tables and servers who openly chided my weak accent. You can\u2019t get more Vietnamese than that, and I took pride in it. Later, as a college student in New York, I started work at a ph\u1edf restaurant in Greenwich Village. I applied to the job, where I still work today, in part because I wanted to be a starving artist without actually starving, but also because I thought it would connect me to a Vietnamese community that was otherwise difficult to find in New York, where there is only a small Vietnamese population. On my first day of work, I clocked in to discover that almost all the workers were Chinese or Latinx. There was not much of an ethnic connection, but I stayed anyway and was trained by the two owners, a pair of half-Vietnamese, half-Chinese men who had gentrified the menu for the Greenwich locals and college students. Fish sauce was generously renamed \u201cVietnamese chili,\u201d and pig\u2019s feet became \u201cspicy pork knuckles\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Pop, rock, rap and more Krept and Konan Krept and Konan\u2019s last UK live show was at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, a rapturously received home town extravaganza with guest appearances from Stefflon Don and Stormzy. These dates, however, will find Britain\u2019s most successful rap duo in more intimate surroundings. Their recent album, Revenge Is Sweet, meanwhile, showed an increasing maturity, with ruminations on mental health, suicide and loss amid the bragging. Tour begins 21 January, Stylus, Leeds Schoolboy Q Finally released after a series of delays \u2013 not to mention three albums that were apparently recorded, then scrapped \u2013 Schoolboy Q\u2019s CrasH Talk completed his transformation from gangsta rapper to golf-playing proud father. Amid the bass-heavy party anthems, the lyrics were frequently agonised and self-baiting, marking out the rapper \u2013 an affiliate of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Black Hippy collective \u2013 as one of hip-hop\u2019s more thoughtful, conflicted figures. Tour begins 25 January, O2 Academy, Glasgow Madonna The Madame X Tour \u2013 in which Madonna plays small venues for the first time since 1985 \u2013 has had good reviews and bad publicity in equal measure. The audience in Las Vegas booed her when her show started two hours late, and one US fan attempted to sue her for it \u2013 but critics rushed to acclaim the performances. We shall see when she comes to London, where the most expensive tickets are an eye-watering \u00a31,200. 27 January\u201316 February, London Palladium Fatoumata Diawara The Malian singer-songwriter has carved out a unique niche for herself, combining an acting career with an impressively wide-ranging approach to music that\u2019s seen her collaborate with everyone from Herbie Hancock and Bobby Womack to Damon Albarn and Disclosure. It highlights a disinclination to be pinned down that also informs her solo work: her last album, 2018\u2019s Fenfo, ran the gamut from traditional Malian kora to 60s soul influences. Tour begins 30 January, Roundhouse, London Carly Rae Jepsen Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s career has never again scaled the commercial heights of her 2012 hit Call Me Maybe \u2013 the song with the greatest chorus of the 21st century according to Billboard \u2013 but she has instead developed into one of pop\u2019s more intriguing characters, wresting control of her own artistic direction, making consistently fascinating albums, including 2019\u2019s Dedicated, and gaining a noticeably older audience than her peers. Tour begins 7 February, Victoria Warehouse, Manchester The Hu Never let it be said that rock music no longer throws up anything unexpected: the Hu garnered 25m YouTube views for their 2018 debut single Yuve Yuve Yu, on which the Ulaanbaatar quartet melded heavy metal with Mongolian throat singing. Their debut album The Gereg became a global hit in 2019, a sign that they\u2019d hit on something truly unique. Tour begins 8 February, Chalk, Brighton Tame Impala: The Slow Rush The Slow Rush is the first album by the expansive Australian psychedelicists for five years, and the follow-up to Currents, which established them not merely as an adventurous musical force but an influence on mainstream pop. Rihanna covered one of its tracks, New Person, Same Old Mistakes; frontman Kevin Parker went on to collaborate with Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Travis Scott. Judging by the tracks that have trailed it, The Slow Rush elaborates on the synth-heavy direction of its predecessor. 14 February N\u00e9rija A one-off gig for the largely female septet whose debut album Blume \u2013 a rare foray into jazz, or rather, a convincing blend of jazz, Afrobeat, funk, surf guitar and all points in between, for noted indie label Domino \u2013 was released to loud applause in August. But the band really come into their own on stage, adding a rawness and dynamism to their improvisations. 18 February, Village Underground, London The 1975: Notes on a Conditional Form The three singles thus far released from the 1975\u2019s delayed fourth album have encompassed everything from two-step garage and distorted, yowling punk rock to monologues from Greta Thunberg. Who knows what else it might contain? Not every avenue the 1975 try to head down yields perfect results, but there\u2019s something laudable about an arena-packing band so determined to avoid resting on their laurels. 21 February Grimes: Miss Anthropocene Grimes\u2019 fifth album has had a tortuous gestation: initially scheduled for 2018, it was delayed amid arguments with her record label and considerable personal strife, including the death of her former manager and negative media coverage of her relationship with Elon Musk. It is apparently a dark concept album about \u201can anthropomorphic goddess\u201d, which aims to make the notion of climate change \u201cfun\u201d. We shall see. 21 February Lana Del Rey 2019 was a good year for the former Lizzy Grant. Her sixth album, the Joni Mitchell-influenced, Laurel Canyon-set Norman Fucking Rockwell!, topped a lot of critics\u2019 end of year lists. Some publications went so far as to suggest it is one of the albums of the decade. The tour that bears its name has already visited the US and the Middle East. Her career-spanning set apparently ends with the album\u2019s epic, 10-minute long centrepiece Venice Bitch. Tour begins 25 February, O2 Arena, London Jpegmafia Barrington Hendricks promoted his third album of experimental hip-hop under the Jpegmafia name as \u201ca disappointment\u201d. No one else seemed to agree with that assessment, though. It was more approachable and melodic than his past work, yet its sound remained chaotically eclectic \u2013 he\u2019s claimed influences from both Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard and Throbbing Gristle \u2013 and his stream-of-consciousness vocal style was as manic and provocative as ever. How its glitchy collage approach works live remains to be seen. Tour begins 27 February, EartH, London Michael Kiwanuka The Guardian called Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s eponymous third album \u2013 a song cycle displaying the influences of gospel, psychedelic soul and Jimi Hendrix, co-produced by Danger Mouse and London hip-hop auteur Inflo \u2013 \u201cone of the greatest albums of the decade\u201d, evidence of how finely crafted its songs were, and how perfectly it balanced the retro and contemporary. In addition, he is a gripping live performer, capable of expanding his material without seeming indulgent. Tour begins 1 March, O2 Academy, Birmingham SEED Ensemble Saxophonist and composer Cassie Kinoshi\u2019s 10-piece band are in the thick of London\u2019s young jazz revival: their lineup shares members with Sons of Kemet, Kokoroko and Maisha. Their Mercury-nominated debut album Driftglass was an uncompromising, politically engaged yet accessible melding of 60s Blue Note and South African jazz with funk, hip hop and neo-soul, marked out by the sharpness of Kinoshi\u2019s writing. Tour begins 15 March, Blue Arrow, Glasgow Kelis Kelis\u2019s 1999 debut album Kaleidoscope marked not just her own arrival but a leap in the profile of producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, AKA the Neptunes. Her career since has been uneven, pinballing from chart-friendly EDM to collaborations with TV on the Radio\u2019s David Sitek, but on this tour she returns to her debut, now 20 years old and still sounding, as she would put it, young, fresh and new. Tour begins 16 March, Albert Hall, Manchester The Who Despite being recorded without the pair ever actually meeting up in the studio, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey\u2019s most recent album, Who, proved an unexpected triumph: a tough, bolshy collection of songs and a distinct improvement on 2006\u2019s Endless Wire. Their recent live shows have been impressive too, spiking the usual classics with deeper dives into their back catalogue. Tour begins 16 March, Manchester Arena Baxter Dury: The Night Chancers Baxter Dury already had a cult following, but his last album, Prince of Tears, was a considerable step forward and one of 2017\u2019s best: musically eclectic, its lyrics alternately thoughtful and scabrously funny, the sound of an artist finally coming into his own. The menacing, darkly comic single Slumlord \u2013 a jaded view of the world of social media, packed with \u201cscary people saying silly shit\u201d \u2013 suggests its follow-up is of the same standard. Released 20 March Caribou It\u2019s five years since Dan Snaith released an album under the Caribou name, the brilliant Our Love. In the interim, he has seemed more preoccupied by his straightforwardly dancefloor-facing alias Daphni. All of which makes Caribou\u2019s forthcoming return with a new album, Suddenly, and a series of live dates, all the more welcome. The single You and I suggests there has been no dip in the quality of his warm, melancholy electronica. Tour begins 30 March, Brighton Dome Trippie Redd 2019 was a good year for Ohio-born, LA-based rapper Trippie Redd. His mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 entered the US charts at No 1, evidence of his shift from Soundcloud cultdom to mainstream success. Stylistically varied or hopelessly unfocussed, depending on your perspective, its best moments suggested an artist who could turn his hand to anything from guitar-heavy emo rap to straight-up club bangers. Tour begins 4 April, Brixton Academy, London Harry Styles Styles has by some distance the most successful solo career of any ex-One Directioner. There have been more takers for his brand of pop-by-way-of-classic-rock than his former bandmates\u2019 dalliances with R&amp;B and Sheeran-esque acoustic whimsy. Whether recently released second album Fine Line will repeat the commercial performance of his eponymous debut remains to be seen, but the level of devotion Styles inspires suggests it will. Tour begins 15 April, Birmingham Arena Nick Mason\u2019s Saucerful of Secrets Saucerful of Secrets, in which the Pink Floyd drummer and a range of musical associates including Spandau Ballet\u2019s Gary Kemp charge through key tracks from Pink Floyd\u2019s pre-Dark Side of the Moon repertoire, could well have flopped. Instead, it\u2019s been a huge success, garnering praise from his former bandmates and fans alike. These gigs come under the banner of More Games for May, a reference to Pink Floyd\u2019s 1967 gig at the Royal Festival Hall. Tour begins 23 April, G Live, Guilford Bon Iver Justin Vernon\u2019s musical progress from his folky debut For Emma, Forever Ago has been one of the more interesting in alt-rock, taking in detours to electronica, R&amp;B and hip-hop: his most recent album i,i featured cameo roles for everyone from rap producer Wheezy to Bruce Hornsby, which gives you an idea of its breadth. It\u2019s also pleasing that experimental music can end up in venues this big. Tour begins 26 April, Wembley Arena, London Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Nick Cave\u2019s most recent live activities have involved solo performances and an unmoderated audience Q&amp;A \u2013 a kind of IRL version of his Red Hand Files website, where fans are invited to ask him anything. This tour, however, brings back backing band the Bad Seeds, in the wake of their wildly acclaimed 2019 album Ghosteen. It will be intriguing to see how that album\u2019s beatless songs work in arena-sized venues. Tour begins 2 May, Birmingham Arena Unclassified Live An offshoot of Radio 3\u2019s beloved Unclassified show, this series of gigs at the Southbank Centre pitches modern classical composers against artists working in the field of electronica. Owen Pallett and Daniel Avery offer new compositions in earlier instalments, but this final show features electronic sound artist Tim Hecker alongside composer Daniel Elms. 7 June, Royal Festival Hall, London Thom Yorke The Radiohead frontman\u2019s solo tour is named after his 2014 album Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes rather than its 2019 successor Anima. He is accompanied by producer Nigel Godrich and visual artist Tarik Barri providing live projections. Thus far, the setlist has occasionally taken in Radiohead tracks, but largely concentrated on Yorke\u2019s solo oeuvre and the work of his supergroup Atoms for Peace. By all accounts, the live performances add a drive and focus to his experimental electronica. Tour begins 19 June, SEC Centre, Glasgow Diana Ross The news that Diana Ross will fill the Sunday afternoon \u201clegend\u201d slot at this year\u2019s Glastonbury festival was greeted with widespread delight: it\u2019s a combination that looks about as close to a nailed-on success as it\u2019s possible to get. But Glastonbury is merely one stop on a UK tour, and if the setlist is anything like that of her acclaimed Vegas residency \u2013 heavy on Supremes hits and her Chic-produced disco era \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a treat. Tour begins 30 June, Leeds Arena Taylor Swift This year\u2019s British Summertime gigs in Hyde Park include a pop extravaganza headlined by Little Mix, and Pearl Jam performing with the Pixies as support, but the pick of them may be the arrival in the UK of Taylor Swift\u2019s self-styled Lover Fest, wherein she eschews her usual stadiums in favour of taking her most recent album around the world\u2019s festivals. \u201cThe Lover album is open fields, sunsets, + SUMMER,\u201d she explained on Instagram. \u201cI want to perform it in a way that feels authentic.\u201d 11 July, Hyde Park, London Billie Eilish The breakout teen sensation of 2019, whose debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? spawned five US platinum singles, returns to the UK for a series of arena gigs. The sense that her home-produced brand of dark electronics, adolescent psychodrama and gothic sci-fi imagery is a cut above has been bolstered by critical acclaim and comparisons not to her pop peers, but Nirvana \u2013 the latter courtesy of Dave Grohl. Tour begins 21 July, Manchester Arena Stormzy You can get a sense of how far Stormzy has outstripped his UK hip-hop peers by the sheer geographical variety of dates on the tour supporting his second album, Heavy Is the Head. His sound is still rooted in British grime, as evidenced by recent single Wiley Flow, but his gigs take in not just Europe but the Middle East, China and Australasia. The biggest shows, however, will be in Britain: a stadium-sized victory lap. Tour begins 2 September, O2 Arena, London Elton John The mammoth Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour enters its third year with a string of UK dates. Thus far it has proved notable not merely for its vast commercial success \u2013 the first leg alone grossed $125m \u2013 but the degree of acclaim it\u2019s received. It is a beautifully staged two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza in which the hits are rolled out with considerable gusto \u2013 apparently for the final time. Tour begins 2 November, O2 Arena, London Classical and opera Prisoner of the State Beethoven will dominate the concert schedules in his 250th anniversary year, and his only opera, Fidelio, gets a new production at Covent Garden, with Lise Davidsen and Jonas Kaufmann heading the cast.

Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog <a href=\"https://youngmoneyblog.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Young Money</a>. After all, she points out, \u201csaving is only possible with motivation\u201d.</p> <p>If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: \u201cSaving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that it\u2019s still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Clear the decks</strong></h2> <p>Don\u2019t start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off \u2013 you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg.</p> <p>One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/nov/24/the-smartphone-apps-that-will-change-the-way-you-bank\" title=\"\">including Revolut, Starling </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/nov/24/the-smartphone-apps-that-will-change-the-way-you-bank\" title=\"\">and Monzo</a>, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest \u00a31 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend \u00a31.45, you will be debited \u00a32, of which 55p will be squirrelled away.</p> <p>Monzo lets you transfer to an interest-earning account once you have at least \u00a310, while Starling pays up to 0.5% on all balances. Lloyds and Halifax give you a choice of accounts.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but <a href=\"https://www1.firstdirect.com/banking/current-account/\" title=\"\">First Direct\u2019s 1st account</a> can be set up to do this automatically.</p> <h2><strong>Have a goal</strong></h2> <p>As with <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/\" title=\"\">Couch to 5K</a>, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it.</p> <p>Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going.</p> <p>Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at <a href=\"https://savingschampion.co.uk/best-buys/personal/easy-access/\" title=\"\">easy-access accounts</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Think long term</strong></h2> <p>If you are saving for a property, think about using a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/16/what-is-a-lifetime-isa-budget-2016\" title=\"\">Lifetime Isa</a>. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as \u00a31, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile \u2013 \u00a325 a month is more typical and meaningful.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,\u201d says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. \u201cThis is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.\u201d</p> <p>A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-buy-investments\" title=\"\">how to buy investments</a>, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases.</p>",

So, if you spend \u00a31.45, you will be debited \u00a32, of which 55p will be squirrelled away. Monzo lets you transfer to an interest-earning account once you have at least \u00a310, while Starling pays up to 0.5% on all balances. Lloyds and Halifax give you a choice of accounts. Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Direct\u2019s 1st account can be set up to do this automatically. Have a goal As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it. Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going. Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts. Think long term If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as \u00a31, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile \u2013 \u00a325 a month is more typical and meaningful. \u201cIf you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,\u201d says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. \u201cThis is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.\u201d A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on how to buy investments, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases.",

The cast \u2013 featuring Zach Woods, Suzy Nakamura, Rebecca Front and Himesh Patel \u2013 is extraordinary. The writing will be spectacular. You are going to watch the hell out of this. 22 January Mrs Fletcher (HBO/Sky Comedy) Any show that starts with a deaf 80-year-old man pumping out hardcore porn in a packed retirement lounge is sure to catch your attention. In this sparky comedy, Eve (Kathryn Hahn) is left with a case of empty nest syndrome when her son heads off to college. But instead of lighting scented candles and sinking into blissful baths like her friends, she takes the parental road less travelled of chain-smoking and getting into porn. Read our interview with Kathryn Hahn. February Noughts and Crosses (BBC One) Malorie Blackman\u2019s series of novels finally gets a television adaptation, and a splashy one at that. Set in a world where Africa has developed technology faster than Europe and ended up as the dominant superpower, Noughts and Crosses is a coming-of-age story that explores race and privilege. It\u2019ll be enormous and, just to seal the deal, Stormzy is in it. Spring The Mandalorian (Disney+) Look, you already know about The Mandalorian, because all the US culture sites you read haven\u2019t shut up about it since it started. A big-budget Star Wars series created by Jon Favreau for the new streaming service Disney+. The Mandalorian is set five years after Return of the Jedi and follows the adventures of a bounty hunter. It stars Pedro Pascal, Nick Nolte, Werner Herzog \u2013 and a Baby Yoda that has already gone viral. 31 March The Boys (Channel 4) Following the nightmarish sci-fi explosion of Years and Years, The Boys is a return to more grounded but no less devastating territory for Russell T Davies. Three young gay men in the 1980s find themselves affected by the Aids crisis. Davies has hinted that this might be his most personal work yet, saying of the characters: \u201cThey\u2019re all based on my experiences. They\u2019re all 18 years old in 1981. That was my age in 1981. In a sense, they\u2019re all part of me.\u201d Summer A Suitable Boy (BBC One) The BBC\u2019s first period drama featuring an entirely non-white cast. Based on Vikram Seth\u2019s breeze block of a novel, A Suitable Boy ostensibly follows a family\u2019s efforts to find a husband for their 19-year-old daughter, though it broadens out into a stark state-of-the-nation look at post-partition India. Andrew Davies adapts, Mira Nair directs, Ishaan Khatter, Tanya Maniktala and Tabu star. This is going to be big. Summer The Plot Against America (HBO/Sky Atlantic) The Wire mastermind David Simon executive produces this adaptation of Philip Roth\u2019s chilling novel, which imagines what life might have been like in the US if Franklin D Roosevelt had lost the 1940 election to the controversial aviator Charles Lindbergh. Winona Ryder plays a Jewish woman, Evelyn Finkel, with John Turturro also starring as rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf, a man with unexpected connections to Lindbergh, thought by many to be a Nazi sympathiser. To be confirmed Alan Partridge travelogue (BBC One) After the wonderful This Time, Alan Partridge returns to the BBC with an as-yet-untitled travelogue that seems destined to be another success, if only because Steve Coogan used its filming to worm his way out of a driving ban. And if it isn\u2019t a success? He and Rob Brydon also have The Trip to Greece coming out this year. To be confirmed Hunters (Amazon) Riding high from his showy turn in The Irishman, Al Pacino moves to the small screen with his best work of the past 15 years. The year is 1977, a team of Nazi-hunters uncover the beginnings of a Fourth Reich in the US and set off on a bloodthirsty quest to stop them. It\u2019s timely, outlandish and Jordan Peele is executive producing. To be confirmed January 22nd (BBC Two) Described as \u201ca fearless, frank and provocative drama that explores the question of sexual consent in contemporary life\u201d, January 22nd is Michaela Coel\u2019s hugely awaited follow-up to Chewing Gum. In contemporary London, a novelist\u2019s drink is spiked with a date-rape drug, and as a result she is forced to embark on a painful journey of self-discovery. To be confirmed Lovecraft Country (HBO/Sky Atlantic) Another Jordan Peele series \u2013 although here he\u2019s working with JJ Abrams \u2013 Lovecraft Country is a horror drama about a man travelling across Jim Crow territory to find his missing father. There are two things standing in his way: the first is the harrowing racism of white America in the 1950s. The second is monsters. To be confirmed Normal People (BBC Three) Her 2017 debut Conversations with Friends catapulted millennial author Sally Rooney to the literary big leagues. But it was her follow-up \u2013 about school friends Marianne and Connell whose lives intersect for years after they\u2019ve left their small town \u2013 that confirmed the Irish writer as a master of quietly devastating yarns. With the producers of The Favourite and Oscar-nominated director Lenny Abrahamson on board, quality seems assured for this small-screen version. To be confirmed Quiz (ITV) Remember when Charles Ingram and his wife Diana landed the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire jackpot back in 2001 via a scam that saw the Major go 50-50 with a coughing accomplice? Stephen Frears directs this imagining of their unlikely heist, with Matthew Macfayden and Sian Clifford playing the Bonnie and Clyde of prime-time ITV and Michael Sheen as oblivious quizmaster Chris Tarrant. To be confirmed Ratched (Netflix) Sarah Paulson is sure to be equally electrifying and terrifying in this retelling of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest from Ryan Murphy. An origin story of the titular Nurse Ratched, it will show her descent from normal nurse to menacing matriarch of the mental health ward. Expect evil deeds and high camp. To be confirmed Run (HBO/Sky Comedy) Now that Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an all-conquering superstar, it\u2019s time for her DryWrite partner Vicky Jones to have a go. Described as a romantic comedy thriller, Run is the story of \u201ca woman living a humdrum existence, who one day gets a text inviting her to fulfil a youthful pact promising true love and self-reinvention by stepping out of her life to take a journey with her oldest flame\u201d. Definitely worth a punt, especially as Waller-Bridge has a recurring role and is executive producer. To be confirmed Small Axe (BBC One/Amazon) A Turner prize-winning artist and an Oscar-winning director, Steve McQueen tries his hand at the small screen with this anthology series delving into the history of London\u2019s West Indian community. Spanning the late 60s to the early 80s and starring Star Wars actor John Boyega and Letitia Wright (Black Panther, Avengers), the show offers a window into the triumphs and hardships of black Britons. To be confirmed The Eddy (Netflix) Jack Thorne and Damian Chazelle unite for a Netflix musical drama about a jazz club in Paris. And, listen, I know. You\u2019ve already made your mind up about this one. You\u2019re either going to stream it the second it arrives online, or avoid it like the plague. Would it kill you to give it a try? To be confirmed The Undoing (HBO/Sky Atlantic) The great Hugh Grantaissance continues. Following his delightful work in Florence Foster Jenkins, Paddington 2 and A Very English Scandal, Grant teams up with Nicole Kidman for this HBO drama from the creators of Big Little Lies. Kidman stars as a rich therapist whose life is torn apart when her husband is accused of murder and disappears. It sounds a bit boilerplate, but with Kidman and Grant both in the middle of television-aided purple patches, you would be silly to miss it. To be confirmed This Is Going to Hurt (BBC Two) \u201cThis morning I delivered little baby Sayton \u2013 pronounced Satan, as in king of the underworld.\u201d Never less than laugh-out-loud funny, Adam Kay\u2019s bestselling memoir about life as a junior doctor in obstetrics and gynaecology gets the BBC treatment \u2013 and he promises it will make us laugh, cry and vomit. If you haven\u2019t read his tales of women burning their vaginas by stuffing fairy lights inside and trying to turn them on (\u201cbringing new meaning to the phrase \u2018I put the Christmas lights up myself\u2019\u201d), start bracing yourself now.

      "body": "<p>The other night I dreamed it was my last day of high school. I was gathering schoolbooks when something caught my eye: lettuce leaves, lying on the carpet. Perfect!<em> </em>I thought, scooping them up and packing them. Now I won\u2019t be hungry at university next year! I woke still glowing with pride.</p> <p>Since that dream, I\u2019ve been thinking about how neatly education arranges life into endings and beginnings. You finish one segment, take a summer holiday, and step into the next \u2013 nervous, excited \u2013 and equipped, if you have my sort of foresight, with a handful of rotting lettuce leaves. But grownup life is more chaotic. There are plenty of potential beginnings \u2013 jobs, partners, dietary changes, but nobody has drawn up a schedule. Changes tend to be flung at you, or depend on your own efforts.</p> <p>In my novel <a href=\"https://atlantic-books.co.uk/book/gravity-is-the-thing/\">Gravity Is the Thing</a>, changes are both flung at and chosen by Abigail, owner-manager of the Happiness Cafe. Back when she was a teenager, Abigail\u2019s brother vanished. Around the same time, she started receiving chapters in the mail from a self-help book called The Guidebook. Now, 20 years later, she\u2019s invited to a retreat to learn \u201cthe truth\u201d about The Guidebook.</p> <p>The absence of Abigail\u2019s brother is central to her story. A missing loved one is a particularly traumatic loss because it isn\u2019t entirely a loss. At any moment, the person could reappear. There\u2019s no ending, so there can\u2019t be a new beginning: life without the loved one cannot start. In Gravity, I wanted to explore the promises of the self-help industry in this context of ambiguous loss: much like hope, self-help can be both transformative and destructive.</p> <p>At first, the idea of choosing 10 books about new beginnings alarmed me. I couldn\u2019t think of any. Then I realised that all novels have at least one crisis, discovery or transformation, and each of these triggers new beginnings. Essentially, then, this is a list of books that have been special to me (not the most special, those would be the books of my sisters, Liane and Nicola) or that have shaped me as a writer or person, angled to catch the light.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_Blues_(novel)\">Cocaine Blues by Kerry Greenwood</a><br></strong>Phryne Fisher, sexy, sassy and newly arrived in Melbourne, Australia, decides to become a private detective.

Case Histories, the first of Brodie\u2019s stories, has him embarking on his new career as private detective.

Bloom\u2019s writing is exquisite, and her meticulous dissection of a relationship frayed by secrets and trauma is reminiscent of Henry James (without the excessive sub-clauses).

In the succinctly titled How, we learn how to start a doomed love affair: \u201cBegin by meeting him in a class, in a bar, at a rummage sale.\u201d Moore\u2019s prose is poetic, sharp and devastatingly funny.

My favourites are funny, emotionally authentic and contain practical magic. Wynne Jones\u2019s books, like those of Ellen Raskin and Sally Gardner, make my soul breathe a sigh of relief. The Chrestomanci books are set in parallel worlds to ours, and feature protagonists discovering<em> </em>their magical abilities and setting out to develop them.

This is an eviscerating study of the beginnings of Australian colonialism. It collects compelling evidence that Indigenous Australians were not, as the prevailing historical narrative maintains \u2013 and as required by the law of <em>terra nullius</em> \u2013 wandering hunter gatherers, but had established both agriculture and dwellings.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-the-waves-by-virginia-woolf-1945744.html\">The Waves by Virginia Woolf</a><br></strong>This novel opens with a group of children starting out on their life journeys, and has them guide us through to their old age and death in six exquisite, first-person accounts.

I\u2019d found him.\u201d A marvel of humour and heartbreak, Eleanor Oliphant reveals how a new friendship can begin to unravel the traumas that are knotted deep within us. 9. Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe A book about new beginnings that stopped my breath and knocked me sideways. This is an eviscerating study of the beginnings of Australian colonialism. It collects compelling evidence that Indigenous Australians were not, as the prevailing historical narrative maintains \u2013 and as required by the law of terra nullius \u2013 wandering hunter gatherers, but had established both agriculture and dwellings. 10. The Waves by Virginia Woolf This novel opens with a group of children starting out on their life journeys, and has them guide us through to their old age and death in six exquisite, first-person accounts. I read it in high school and it was my first encounter with language so intensely beautiful. It is lyrical, inventive, self-referential and determined to excavate relentlessly in pursuit of truth. \u2022 Gravity Is the Thing by Jaclyn Moriarty is published by Allen &amp; Unwin.",

Like a pig sniffing for truffles, I am going to hunt out humour and hope in the new year, and plan to reread Douglas Adams\u2019s<em> </em>Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy quartet, which I haven\u2019t done since I was a teenager.</p> <p>I have been told that <em>Mr Fox</em> by Helen Oyeyemi is very funny, so I will get that too. I also want to read Pablo Neruda\u2019s <em>Odes to Common Things</em> as I am a fan of Neruda and have never read it. It is about the pleasure we can take in everyday items in the world around us, from soap to tomatoes, and I am thinking it will be the perfect antidote to all the big-picture worrying the world is encouraging us to do. I feel a lot of us need to reconnect with the immediacy of the world around us, and so I will seek out books like this, in order to stay (relatively) hopeful about life.</p> <p>That said, I will also be pre-ordering <em>The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis</em> by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, which will be a must-read for anyone interested in the politics and practicalities of the next stages for the environmental movement. Figueres was the public face of the Paris climate agreement and knows better than anyone the political landscape of environmentalism so it should be essential reading.</p> <p><em>Matt Haig\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/notes-on-a-nervous-planet-9781786892690.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Notes on a Nervous Planet</em></a><em> is published by Canongate.</em></p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cressida-cowell\" title=\"\"><strong>Cressida Cowell</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63ccdfd6ec259b83646ffa21df887997e774dca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ccdfd6ec259b83646ffa21df887997e774dca2/0_278_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cressida Cowell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t have reading \u201cresolutions\u201d, because it\u2019s reading for the joy of it that\u2019s important \u2013 both for children and for adults.

Akala\u2019s first book for young adults, <em>The</em> <em>Dark Lady</em>, sounds intriguing. It\u2019s an adventure story set in Elizabethan England, and I love the idea that reading is a superpower.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t read Onjali Ra\u00faf\u2019s <em>The Boy at the Back of the Class</em>, it\u2019s a great choice for new year optimism \u2013 a brilliant book for encouraging empathy.</p> <p>The school holidays can be a great time to reset if you are struggling to get your children into books. Reading together beyond the age your kids can read for themselves can be an incredible tool \u2013 it sends a message that books are important, because they can make my mum laugh or my dad cry.

My own writing is non-fiction, so my pile of books to read in 2020 is dominated by history titles. At the very top is William Dalrymple\u2019s acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/23/the-anarchy-the-relentless-rise-of-the-east-india-company-william-dalrymple-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company</em></a>.

Reading Dan Jackson\u2019s <em>The Northumbrians</em>, I was reminded that Zamyatin had based aspects of the dystopian future society he creates in that novel on my home town of Newcastle, where he spent time during the first world war. As a historian the one genre I never allow myself to read is historical fiction. But I gleefully break that rule when a new Hilary Mantel novel comes out.

First, I want funny. Percival Everett\u2019s <em>I Am Not Sidney Poitier</em> will bring me that. Its hero, Not Sidney Poitier, was delivered after a 24-month pregnancy following an immaculate conception. I think I\u2019m going to like him.</p> <p>Next, back to my life\u2019s work of sussing out my Trinidadian side. I\u2019ll be sucking up the beautiful prose of Trini writers Anthony Joseph and Monique Roffey. Joseph\u2019s <em>The Frequency of Magic</em> is about a butcher who has been writing his novel for 41 years but \u201cdistractions are aplenty\u201d. The cast of Roffey\u2019s <em>The Mermaid of Black Conch</em> includes a mermaid, a fisherman, an artist and a benevolent white landowner.</p> <p>I am a sucker for London books.

      "bodyText": "Matt Haig I have been very dark and gloomy with my reading habits this year, perhaps in tune with the social mood. Like a pig sniffing for truffles, I am going to hunt out humour and hope in the new year, and plan to reread Douglas Adams\u2019s Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy quartet, which I haven\u2019t done since I was a teenager. I have been told that Mr Fox by Helen Oyeyemi is very funny, so I will get that too. I also want to read Pablo Neruda\u2019s Odes to Common Things as I am a fan of Neruda and have never read it. It is about the pleasure we can take in everyday items in the world around us, from soap to tomatoes, and I am thinking it will be the perfect antidote to all the big-picture worrying the world is encouraging us to do. I feel a lot of us need to reconnect with the immediacy of the world around us, and so I will seek out books like this, in order to stay (relatively) hopeful about life. That said, I will also be pre-ordering The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, which will be a must-read for anyone interested in the politics and practicalities of the next stages for the environmental movement. Figueres was the public face of the Paris climate agreement and knows better than anyone the political landscape of environmentalism so it should be essential reading. Matt Haig\u2019s Notes on a Nervous Planet is published by Canongate. Cressida Cowell I don\u2019t have reading \u201cresolutions\u201d, because it\u2019s reading for the joy of it that\u2019s important \u2013 both for children and for adults. This is top of my Children\u2019s Laureate Charter: if reading feels enforced then we know from academic studies that we don\u2019t get the same benefits. Enjoyment is the key. But I am looking forward to reading Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet, because her writing is wonderful, and I adore Shakespeare. Akala\u2019s first book for young adults, The Dark Lady, sounds intriguing. It\u2019s an adventure story set in Elizabethan England, and I love the idea that reading is a superpower. If you haven\u2019t read Onjali Ra\u00faf\u2019s The Boy at the Back of the Class, it\u2019s a great choice for new year optimism \u2013 a brilliant book for encouraging empathy. The school holidays can be a great time to reset if you are struggling to get your children into books. Reading together beyond the age your kids can read for themselves can be an incredible tool \u2013 it sends a message that books are important, because they can make my mum laugh or my dad cry. Just 10 minutes a day can make a difference. I remember every book read aloud to me in an adult\u2019s voice. Cressida Cowell\u2019s Emily Brown and Father Christmas is published by Hodder. David Olusoga Next year I\u2019m making a documentary about African literature for the BBC, so I\u2019m looking forward to rereading novels I first read as a teenager: Buchi Emecheta\u2019s Second Class Citizen, Ayi Kwei Armah\u2019s The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born, Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart and Weep Not, Child by Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o. My own writing is non-fiction, so my pile of books to read in 2020 is dominated by history titles. At the very top is William Dalrymple\u2019s acclaimed The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company. When I get a holiday I\u2019m planning to read We by the Russian novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin. Reading Dan Jackson\u2019s The Northumbrians, I was reminded that Zamyatin had based aspects of the dystopian future society he creates in that novel on my home town of Newcastle, where he spent time during the first world war. As a historian the one genre I never allow myself to read is historical fiction. But I gleefully break that rule when a new Hilary Mantel novel comes out. So like a lot of people I am counting down the days to the publication of The Mirror and the Light, the final book in the astonishing Wolf Hall trilogy. David Olusoga\u2019s Civilisations: First Contact/The Cult of Progress is published by Profile. Patrice Lawrence Next year, I need books to remind me how funny, compassionate, resilient and lyrical my fellow human beings can be. First, I want funny. Percival Everett\u2019s I Am Not Sidney Poitier will bring me that. Its hero, Not Sidney Poitier, was delivered after a 24-month pregnancy following an immaculate conception. I think I\u2019m going to like him. Next, back to my life\u2019s work of sussing out my Trinidadian side. I\u2019ll be sucking up the beautiful prose of Trini writers Anthony Joseph and Monique Roffey. Joseph\u2019s The Frequency of Magic is about a butcher who has been writing his novel for 41 years but \u201cdistractions are aplenty\u201d. The cast of Roffey\u2019s The Mermaid of Black Conch includes a mermaid, a fisherman, an artist and a benevolent white landowner. I am a sucker for London books. Kamala Markandaya\u2019s The Nowhere Man is a tough but necessary read. Set in 1968, the year of Enoch Powell\u2019s \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, it is about an elderly Indian widower befriended by an English woman, until their life is shattered by racist violence. On a completely different note, I am shamefully excited about False Value, the next book in Ben Aaronovitch\u2019s fantasy series Rivers of London, out in February. Finally, I\u2019ll be diving in and out of the African American poet and activist June Jordan\u2019s Civil Wars: Observations from the Front Lines of America. Because. Patrice Lawrence\u2019s Rose, Interrupted is published by Hodder. Jenny Colgan I am looking for jollity in 2020. If Craig Brown\u2019s One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time is half as brilliant, gossipy and revealing as his book about Princess Margaret, I will be delighted.

Last year he reached the final of the world championships, only to lose to the Russian Andrey Zamkovoy. But with question marks over Russia\u2019s participation, he could go off as favourite in Tokyo. SI Kylie Masse Canada Swimming The 23-year-old from Ontario has won every major 100m backstroke race she has entered since capturing a surprise bronze at the distance as a teenager in Rio, becoming the first Canadian swimmer to win back-to-back world titles in the same event. Masse, who has been tipped to become her country\u2019s first Olympic backstroke champion since Mark Tewksbury in 1992, will headline a Canadian team including Penny Oleksiak, Maggie MacNeil, Taylor Ruck and Sydney Pickrem that will enter Tokyo with medal chances up and down the programme. BAG Shaunae Miller-Uibo Bahamas Athletics Remember Michael Johnson winning 200m and 400m gold at Atlanta? Well, 24 years on, Miller-Uibo has a live chance of repeating Johnson\u2019s extraordinary feat. Not only is she the reigning 400m Olympic champion, she was also the fastest over 200m in 2019 \u2013 beating Dina Asher-Smith easily when they met. However, the schedule might yet thwart her in Tokyo. As things stand she would have to run a 400m heat on the morning before trying to win gold in the 200m final in the evening. Yet don\u2019t bet against it being Miller-Uibo time in 2020. SI Naomi Osaka Japan Tennis Osaka has had an up and down 2019 but she is still the reigning Australian Open champion and ranked No 3 in the world. And crucially, her decision in October to represent the country of her birth, Japan, rather than the US \u2013 a country where she has dual citizenship \u2013 means she will be one of the stories of the Games. \u201cIt is a special feeling to aim for the Olympics as a representative of Japan,\u201d she said recently. \u201cI think that playing with the pride of the country will make me feel more emotional.\u201d SI Teddy Riner France Judo Japan might have invented judo, but no one has dominated the sport more than Big Teddy Riner. The 6ft 8in and 20st Frenchman not only has two Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016 to his name, along with a bronze in Beijing as a teenager in 2008, but has won a record 10 world titles. The last time he was beaten? September 2010. If the Frenchman takes gold again he will join Tadahiro Nomura on three Olympic titles \u2013 and the ominous news for his rivals is that he intends he continue until Paris 2024. SI Duncan Scott Great Britain Swimming Of course Adam Peaty will be the fulcrum of Team GB in the pool, having blasted to 100m breaststroke gold \u2013 and followed it up with 4x100m medley silver \u2013 in Rio. But don\u2019t forget Scott. Not only did he anchor Britain to 4x100m relay gold at last year\u2019s world championships and win bronze in the 200m freestyle, he also made global headlines by refusing to shake hands with the controversial Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. If Yang survives his doping case, the rematch in Tokyo will be tasty. SI Ariarne Titmus Australia Swimming Australian swimming has been in the doldrums, but the wonderkid Titmus is determined to propel them back up the medal table in Tokyo. The teenager spectacularly beat Katie Ledecky in the 400m freestyle at the world championships in 2019, in an event in which the American superstar had been undefeated since 2012. The rematch should be thrilling, and Titmus is also a strong contender in the 200m, 800m and relays. After winning three golds and a silver at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Tasmanian will hope for an even more bountiful haul. KP",

      "body": "<p>Without wishing to sound too Prince Andrew about this, there are hotels in New York where I won\u2019t stay. One is called the Casablanca, and is extolled in this book as a fine example of how to stick it to the \u201cpower of bad\u201d.</p> <p>By \u201cbad\u201d, the authors don\u2019t mean moral or aesthetic bad, but what they call negativity bias. That bias means an unfortunate impression outweighs a good one; a financial loss is more painful than an equivalent gain; and that a hotel\u2019s many five-star reviews on TripAdvisor have no clout over potential customers who have read the single one-star review \u2013 particularly if it mentions rats\u2019 droppings in the bed.</p> <p>Something had to be done against this online bias. And so the Casablanca launched a charm offensive. \u201cIf you manage to connect with every single guest, you\u2019ve given yourself an insurance policy against bad reviews because they\u2019re unlikely to say something negative about someone who\u2019s their friend,\u201d argued the hotel\u2019s Adele Gutman, who initiated a policy of what she calls \u201csparkling sunshine\u201d.</p> <p>John Tierney and Roy F Baumeister eulogise this offensive: \u201cFrom the doorman to the bellhop everyone is supposed to beam \u2013 \u201cWelcome to our hotel\u201d \u2013 and treat the guest\u2019s arrival as a singularly delightful treat: \u2018This is your first time in New York? We\u2019re going to have fun with you!\u2019 The favourite part of our job is helping people make the most of New York!\u201d Maybe I\u2019m overcome by negativity bias but just kill me now.</p> <p>The bellhop studies how you react to seeing your room and reports back to central control, who offer you a new suite if you\u2019ve disclosed disappointment. Every evening there is free wine and cheese in the lounge so staff can take your spiritual temperature, learn of your every hitherto unexpressed whim and satisfy it. If, presumably, it\u2019s legal. The hotel\u2019s replies to online reviews are often longer than the reviews themselves. This minimises the risk of one-star reviews by obeying psychology\u2019s peak-end rule, which is to leave customers thinking that even if their stay was all blocked toilets and cold showers, at least the staff seemed to care. \u201cWe\u2019re devastated to hear that you did not enjoy your one-night stay with us,\u201d went the Casablanca\u2019s reply to a one-star review complaining about street noise.</p> <p>The result? The Casablanca has conquered bad. It has had a five-star ranking on TripAdvisor for more than a decade. Even so, I\u2019d rather stay in Fawlty Towers than be haunted by irrepressible extrovert staff sparkling non-stop sunshine during my stay and nice-trolling me online.</p> <p>What Tierney and Baumeister don\u2019t realise is that there is not just a power of bad but a curse of good too. That\u2019s the sequel right there. But they would be ill-equipped to write it since they are professional Pollyannas who have read too little Adorno and listened to too much Bing Crosby, so they accentuate the positive to the point of complacency. \u201cWe really are living in a golden age,\u201d they write, \u201ceven if most people believe otherwise.\u201d Elsewhere they add: \u201cWe are richer, healthier, freer and safer than our ancestors could have ever hoped to be, yet we don\u2019t enjoy our blessings. The Great Enrichment continues and it will proceed even faster if we can overcome the real crisis by learning to ignore the fearmongers.\u201d</p> <p>Walter Benjamin wrote of the angel of history moving backwards into the future with debris piling up around his feet, eyes on the ruin of the past. Tierney and Baumeister don\u2019t roll that way. Ignore the debris and the naysayers. Keep your eyes on the prize. Only Cassandras like me doubt there is a prize.</p> <p>Clearly I need to cultivate a positivity bias. But how? The authors have an idea. Each Thanksgiving, diners should write down things they are grateful for on a tablecloth. \u201cThe effect gets stronger every Thanksgiving that you reuse the tablecloth and it makes for good reading the rest of the year too.\u201d I\u2019m grateful for every Thanksgiving I don\u2019t spend counting my blessings with Tierney and Baumeister.</p> <p>If their cure to me seems worse than the disease, they are at least astute at diagnosis. The adaptive traits that served our ancestral hunter-gatherers on the savannah hobble us in the 21st century. Those of our ancestors who survived sensibly focused more on avoiding poisonous berries rather than finding the delicious ones. Today we\u2019ve become Chicken Littles, so irrationally fearing that the sky will fall that we hurry into the Fox\u2019s lair where, ironically, we get murdered.</p> <p>The authors capitalise Fox in making this point, and I hoped they were subtly indicting Trump\u2019s favourite news medium. One reason, after all, for the power of bad is what they call the crisis industry of journalists, politicians and social media blowhards. Consider terrorism: \u201cRandomly murdering a few innocent civilians was strategically pointless until the late 19th century. Only then, as the telegraph and the cheap printing presses began quickly spreading news, did terrorists discover the power of a single horrendous act.\u201d Yet like several reactionary, improbably upbeat analyses of current politics in the book, this perspective serves neocon values. It wasn\u2019t scaremongering hacks who created Isis; invading Iraq had something to do with it. No matter. The crisis industry makes us worry about jihadists when we should be more concerned about bathtubs. Those killed worldwide by Al Qaeda and Isis is fewer than the number of Americans who died in their baths, Tierney and Baumeister contend. The irrational negativity bias explains how, as they put it, \u201ccountries blunder into disastrous wars, why neighbours feud and couples divorce, how economies stagnate, why applicants flub job interviews, how schools are failing pupils\u201d. And why American taxpayers bankroll spiralling defence expenditure instead of spending a few bucks on non-slip bath mats.</p> <p>For the authors, our task is to use innovative rational thought to stop such flubbing, stagnating and blundering. They chart in engaging detail how Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgarten overcame his (quite understandable) negative thoughts about plummeting to death from space by means of cognitive behavioural therapeutic techniques such as repeating mantras and deep breathing. As a result, he acquired the power of positive jumping, falling from a helium balloon in the stratosphere in 2012, reaching 843.6 mph before he touched down in New Mexico 24 miles and four minutes 19 seconds later. Good for Felix: he\u2019ll never be my role model.</p> <p>The authors believe we shouldn\u2019t eliminate the negative but harness it for good. They rip into the 1970s self-esteem movement that was devised to thwart the power of bad but that led, they claim, to schools ringfencing students from failure. It\u2019s nuts, they argue, for alienated schoolboys to be chided for playing violent video games. Why? Because being killed online and forced to begin again better prepares them for overcoming failure in the real world than having fragile egos incessantly massaged with school prizes and no real competition.</p> <p>The moral? Sticks work better than carrots. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to reward your children for good report cards,\u201d Tierney and Baumeister counsel, \u201cbut you should also deduct something from their allowance if the grades show they\u2019ve been shirking.\u201d That way kids learn to shape up. Sometimes it\u2019s good to be bad.</p>",

We feel really afraid of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/17/free-rein-rio-residents-police-violence-far-right-rule\">intensifying repression of the black population</a> and the increasing militarisation of the favelas.

This is now a mainstream debate in a country like Brazil \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/20/history-of-free-african-strongholds-fires-brazilian-resistance-to-bolsonaro\">a country founded on the myth of racial democracy</a> that denied the existence of racism for so long. This debate already existed. But now people are discussing and speaking out about these issues like never before.</p> <p>\u201cBolsonaro has thrown wide open things that social movements have been talking about for centuries and people are starting to wake up. In 2020, the struggle goes on.\u201d</p> <h2>Patr\u00edcia Campos Mello \u2013 award-winning journalist from Brazil\u2019s Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85be08b328eb08a2a8b75b73c387bd76d46361fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85be08b328eb08a2a8b75b73c387bd76d46361fe/0_66_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patr\u00edcia Campos Mello\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis year confirmed our worst fears about the Bolsonaro government\u2019s relationship with the press. We\u2019ve seen it take an increasingly hostile stance, not just towards journalists but also critical and independent media outlets.</p> <p>\u201cThere hadn\u2019t been any kind of censorship since the end of the military dictatorship [in 1985] \u2013 and now we\u2019ve started to see a gradual erosion of freedom of expression. The other day I was talking to Nicaraguan and Venezuelan colleagues and they told me: \u2018Four years ago, we were going through exactly what you\u2019re going through. This is how it begins.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cEvery time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/18/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-whatsapp-fake-news-campaign\">you write a critical piece</a>, you become a target for Bolsonaro supporters. I\u2019d never been a target before \u2013 even when covering conflicts. I didn\u2019t even feel like a target in Syria. But here, it\u2019s personal. </p> <p>\u201cThe aggressive messages and the fake news never stop. This is our new normal \u2013 especially for female journalists. I\u2019ve become used to being called a whore. Each time I\u2019m about to publish an article that\u2019s critical of the government, I prepare myself because I know the next day will be hell.\u201d</p> <h2>Celso Amorim \u2013 former foreign minister, 2003-10</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7de77dc2eb1de508f46f539b67a64aa968916d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7de77dc2eb1de508f46f539b67a64aa968916d48/0_598_6389_3834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celso Amorim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe last time I felt ashamed of Brazil was in the late 1960s.</p> <p>\u201cI was going up the escalators near the London School of Economics and I opened a magazine and it had a story about a Brazilian student who had been killed and tortured by the dictatorship. I had the impression everyone on the underground was looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cNow, again, I feel ashamed \u2013 for many reasons, but especially by what is being done in foreign policy. In 50 years I\u2019ve never seen anything like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/25/brazilian-diplomats-disgusted-bolsonaro-pulverizes-foreign-policy\">what is happening in Brazilian diplomacy today</a>. Not even during the military government.</p> <p>\u201cTerrible things happened back then in Brazil. But our diplomacy was more skilful, more cautious and sought dialogue whenever possible. Now it has embarked upon an all-out ideological war against everything that is not western or Christian \u2013 according to their conception.</p> <p>\u201cI feel sorry for my colleagues in the foreign service because I know some of them are being forced to do what they do because it\u2019s their only job.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very different from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/ukraine-trump-texts-state-department\">US state department under Trump</a> \u2013 only more exaggerated, more ridiculous.

So for me, this has been a disappointing year given the positive expectations I had before the elections.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two different people: Captain Jair Bolsonaro is someone I highly respect [and] miss greatly\u2026 But President Jair Bolsonaro is a disappointment for the way he has betrayed his country and much of what he promised in the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cHe started to see himself as a some sort of mythological entity, blessed by God. He became extremely arrogant and wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone.</p> <p>\u201cYou can agree with him about 99 things. But if you disagree on one and argue or try to offer another point of view, you are seen as a traitor.

      "bodyText": "It has been a year since a pro-gun, anti-indigenous far-right former army captain took power in Brazil and began sending shockwaves through the country\u2019s government and society. In those 12 months, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who is openly homophobic and allied to Brazil\u2019s hardline religious right \u2013 has declared war on film-makers, journalists and the environment; put a conspiracy theorist in charge of the foreign service; and greenlit a new era of police repression and rainforest destruction. Here, six prominent Brazilian voices from the arts, media, diplomacy and the Amazon offer their thoughts on Bolsonaro\u2019s dramatic first year as president. Djamila Ribeiro, feminist philosopher, publisher and activist \u201cIt has been such a tough year \u2013 above all when it comes to public security. We feel really afraid of the intensifying repression of the black population and the increasing militarisation of the favelas. The number of black people being murdered in poor communities has increased, as has the number of indigenous leaders being killed. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember how many people have resisted and how many [resistance] movements exist. \u201cIf there\u2019s a positive side to this government, it\u2019s that issues of race and gender have never been talked about so much. This is now a mainstream debate in a country like Brazil \u2013 a country founded on the myth of racial democracy that denied the existence of racism for so long. This debate already existed. But now people are discussing and speaking out about these issues like never before. \u201cBolsonaro has thrown wide open things that social movements have been talking about for centuries and people are starting to wake up. In 2020, the struggle goes on.\u201d Patr\u00edcia Campos Mello \u2013 award-winning journalist from Brazil\u2019s Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper \u201cThis year confirmed our worst fears about the Bolsonaro government\u2019s relationship with the press. We\u2019ve seen it take an increasingly hostile stance, not just towards journalists but also critical and independent media outlets. \u201cThere hadn\u2019t been any kind of censorship since the end of the military dictatorship [in 1985] \u2013 and now we\u2019ve started to see a gradual erosion of freedom of expression. The other day I was talking to Nicaraguan and Venezuelan colleagues and they told me: \u2018Four years ago, we were going through exactly what you\u2019re going through. This is how it begins.\u2019 \u201cEvery time you write a critical piece, you become a target for Bolsonaro supporters. I\u2019d never been a target before \u2013 even when covering conflicts. I didn\u2019t even feel like a target in Syria. But here, it\u2019s personal. \u201cThe aggressive messages and the fake news never stop. This is our new normal \u2013 especially for female journalists. I\u2019ve become used to being called a whore. Each time I\u2019m about to publish an article that\u2019s critical of the government, I prepare myself because I know the next day will be hell.\u201d Celso Amorim \u2013 former foreign minister, 2003-10 \u201cThe last time I felt ashamed of Brazil was in the late 1960s. \u201cI was going up the escalators near the London School of Economics and I opened a magazine and it had a story about a Brazilian student who had been killed and tortured by the dictatorship. I had the impression everyone on the underground was looking at me. \u201cNow, again, I feel ashamed \u2013 for many reasons, but especially by what is being done in foreign policy. In 50 years I\u2019ve never seen anything like what is happening in Brazilian diplomacy today. Not even during the military government. \u201cTerrible things happened back then in Brazil. But our diplomacy was more skilful, more cautious and sought dialogue whenever possible. Now it has embarked upon an all-out ideological war against everything that is not western or Christian \u2013 according to their conception. \u201cI feel sorry for my colleagues in the foreign service because I know some of them are being forced to do what they do because it\u2019s their only job. \u201cIt\u2019s not very different from the US state department under Trump \u2013 only more exaggerated, more ridiculous. And of course Trump has 4,000 nuclear weapons \u2013 he can do whatever he wants.\u201d Gustavo Bebianno \u2013 former Bolsonaro ally \u201cThe way the president is behaving is disastrous. So for me, this has been a disappointing year given the positive expectations I had before the elections. \u201cThere are two different people: Captain Jair Bolsonaro is someone I highly respect [and] miss greatly\u2026 But President Jair Bolsonaro is a disappointment for the way he has betrayed his country and much of what he promised in the campaign. \u201cHe started to see himself as a some sort of mythological entity, blessed by God. He became extremely arrogant and wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone. \u201cYou can agree with him about 99 things. But if you disagree on one and argue or try to offer another point of view, you are seen as a traitor. His administration became a sect of fanatics \u2013 and I\u2019m not a fanatic. \u201c[Bolsonaro] is surrounded by radicals [and] is scared of everything. He is constantly afraid of being betrayed. That\u2019s why he\u2019s aggressive. He\u2019s scared of journalists. He is scared of politicians.\u201d Davi Kopenawa Yanomami \u2013 indigenous intellectual, shaman and author \u201cIndigenous people in Brazil feel a lot more fear under this president. This year, many illegal miners have entered our land. They pollute our rivers and kill our fish. Our people are starting to get malaria again. \u201cBolsonaro is a garimpeiro [illegal miner].

It\u2019s not regular Brazilians in the cities. It\u2019s politicians who are selling the wealth of Brazil to foreigners. \u201cI hope people outside can understand this and help us to defend ourselves and preserve nature.\u201d Karine Teles \u2013 actor \u201cFor Brazilian cinema, 2019 represented a gigantic pause. Nothing advanced. Everything was suspended. This is a massive loss for an industry that employed more than 300,000 people. It\u2019s not just a cultural loss, it\u2019s an economic loss too.

      "bodyText": "1917 An epic of Lean-ian proportions is delivered in this spectacular from director and co-writer Sam Mendes, who has developed a real-life story of heroism involving his grandfather, the novelist Alfred Mendes, and his first world war experiences on the western front in 1917. 10 January (All details marked are UK release dates) Bombshell A key event in the ongoing #MeToo movement is the case of TV executive, Republican media consultant and serial abuser Roger Ailes. This movie tells the story of three women at Fox News, played by Margot Robbie, Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman, who set out to expose him for sexual harassment. 17 January Waves A much acclaimed portrait of an African-American family in Florida trying to stay together. Kelvin Harrison Jr plays Tyler, a teenager struggling under the fierce expectations of his demanding father, played by Sterling K Brown, while pursuing a relationship with Emily, a girl in his class played by Alexa Demi. The ensemble playing has been praised, as has the bold non-linear storytelling style. 17 January The Personal History of David Copperfield Armando Iannucci brings his masterly satirical touch to this classic, working with co-writer Simon Blackwell and bringing in a diverse cast headed by Dev Patel to tap into Charles Dickens\u2019 humanity, optimism and fun. 24 January A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood Tom Hanks stars in this heartwarmer about the children\u2019s TV star Fred Rogers \u2013 a legend in the US, though little known in the UK \u2013 who presented an afternoon show called Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood and was America\u2019s answer to John Noakes, John Craven and Tony Hart all rolled into one. 31 January The Lighthouse For the followup to his much-admired chiller The Witch, Robert Eggers delivers a brutal, gripping nightmare. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson give sledgehammer performances as two lighthouse-keepers on a remote island going slowly and then quickly mad. 31 January Parasite South Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho won the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or for this satirical gem. It\u2019s an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers about a wealthy family who hire live-in servants without realising that they are all one family, a cuckoo-in-the-nest gang of predators planning to take over. 7 February Portrait of a Lady on Fire A superbly elegant, enigmatic period drama from French film-maker C\u00e9line Sciamma. Ad\u00e8le Haenel plays an 18th-century young noblewoman whose mother hires her a \u201ccompanion\u201d, Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant), without revealing that she is an artist who has been commissioned to paint a secret portrait of her young mistress. A tense relationship develops. 28 February Misbehaviour Gaby Chiappe and Rebecca Frayn are the screenwriters for this comedy about the 1970 Miss World competition in which Miss Grenada (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) won and, under controversial and chaotic circumstances, became the first black winner. Greg Kinnear plays the host, Bob Hope, horrified by a flour-throwing protest from feminist campaigners. 13 March The Perfect Candidate Saudi film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour comes from a country in which there are very few women working in cinema \u2013 or anywhere \u2013 so this is a personal project for her. It\u2019s the story of a female doctor who causes a sensation by making a successful run for office in the local municipal elections. 13 March No Time to Die Daniel Craig hangs up his Beretta, his tux and sky-blue swimming briefs and bows out as Bond. Veteran 007 screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have teamed up with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge for what is purportedly a funny, savvy last hurrah for Craig. 3 April Rocks Screenwriters Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson and director Sarah Gavron team up to create a joyful film: a social realist adventure about a bunch of Year 11 girls at an east London secondary school. Newcomer Bukky Bakray is a Nigerian-British girl who has to look after her kid brother when her mum goes awol. There\u2019s a rush of energy and creativity in this film. 10 April Black Widow Cate Shortland, who made the great Australian film Somersault, takes the helm of this superhero movie, in which Black Widow from Avengers takes centre stage. Scarlett Johansson returns in the title role. 1 May Deerskin Possibly the strangest film of the year, from French film-maker, musician and DJ Quentin Dupieux, AKA Mr Oizo. Jean Dujardin stars as a serial killer who is obsessed with his vintage 60s deerskin jacket. 8 May Wonder Woman 1984 This is another superheroine instalment in the DC Extended Universe, and features Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in the 1980s who comes up against a new foe: Cheetah, an evil British archaeologist played by Kristen Wiig. 5 June Ghostbusters: Afterlife Whoever it is you were gonna call, you\u2019d better call \u2019em again. This new Ghostbusters returns to the classic all-male template, in effect a sequel to Ghostbusters 2, with such veterans as Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver reprising their roles and Jason (son of Ivan) Reitman directing. 10 July Top Gun: Maverick Still speedy, still needy, still eerily boyish, Captain Pete \u201cMaverick\u201d Mitchell returns \u2013 the US Navy pilot played by Tom Cruise who could be piloting a desk by now but is still a badass warrior of the skies. Jennifer Connelly is now Tom\u2019s love interest, a mere nine years his junior. 17 July Last Night in Soho One of Britain\u2019s brightest movie talents, Edgar Wright, returns with a psychological London horror avowedly in the classic style of Nicolas Roeg, set in the glamorous and seedy world of swinging 60s London and co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns (who also co-scripted 1917). 18 September The Trial of the Chicago 7 Renowned screenwriter and director Aaron Sorkin has created a comic crime thriller based around the story of the Chicago Seven \u2014 the counterculture protesters charged with conspiracy to riot. Sorkin is famed for his machine-gun dialogue, so a fast-talking defence of the seven could be on offer. 25 September The Many Saints of Newark David Chase has co-written a movie follow-up to his iconic HBO series The Sopranos, featuring Michael Gandolfini as the young Tony Soprano \u2013 Michael being the son of the late James Gandolfini who played the New Jersey crime boss on the small screen. But who will play the ruthless matriarch Livia? 25 September The Eternals Chlo\u00e9 Zhao is the film-maker lauded for her tough docu-realist picture The Rider. This couldn\u2019t be more different. It\u2019s a Marvel superhero film about a mighty race of aliens, featuring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and Gemma Chan. 6 November Dune Another adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. It takes some chutzpah to take on a story last adapted by David Lynch, but this is what Denis Villeneuve has done \u2013 having already shown he has the sci-fi chops with his films Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Oscar Isaac, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star. 20 November West Side Story Steven Spielberg takes on the classic with its immortal Leonard Bernstein score \u2026 but will it follow the Broadway revival in dropping the song I Feel Pretty? Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler are the star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria. 18 December News of the World Paul Greengrass\u2019s latest film is based on the western novel by Paulette Jiles about a young girl returning to her family in 1860s Texas after being kidnapped by the Kiowa tribe. Helena Zengel plays the girl, Johanna, and Tom Hanks plays the man who must look after her: Captain Kidd, an army veteran who makes a living reading newspapers to illiterate townsfolk and who is now in the middle of a very big news story. 25 December Antebellum Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz make their feature debut with this much-hyped new supernatural horror starring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, with a story set both in a slave plantation and also in the present day. It\u2019s a satirical chiller which could be in the same vein as Get Out. Spring Ammonite An intriguingly Fowlesian story is on offer from writer-director Francis Lee (the author of God\u2019s Own Country): in Victorian Britain, Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) is a geologist and fossil hunter who has fallen on hard times, and when a rich tourist asks her to look after his wife (Saoirse Ronan), a complex relationship ensues.

Honor Swinton Byrne and Tilda Swinton reprise their original roles. To be confirmed The Man Who Killed Don Quixote For three decades, Terry Gilliam\u2019s epically delayed attempt to make a film version of Don Quixote has been one of the great what-ifs and whens of film history, an ordeal of bad luck, wrecked sets and lost funding that has outlived two of the actors cast: John Hurt and Jean Rochefort.

      "body": "<p>Here are our bold predictions for the next decade in sports. Please note the bold (or should that be <strong>bold</strong>?): these are to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p> <h2>Tom Brady plays just one or two games this decade</h2> <p>The New England Patriots\u2019 ageless talisman has continually purported that he wants to play until he\u2019s 44 or 45 or whenever Father Time physically tosses him out of football. But 42-year-old Brady is quickly looking like a player with nothing more to gain by playing. While still a master tactician, his physicality and productivity are diminishing. His 6.6 yards per completion this season were his lowest since 2002 and there\u2019s little to indicate an upward tick is on the horizon. Brady has absolutely nothing left to prove. Quite frankly, every season he spends looking less like Brady in his prime and more like Peyton Manning in his very gimpy final season is a disservice to his TB12 brand which is founded on beating back the clock. Brady the savvy businessman will come to grips with this reality and bid football goodbye soon after getting ousted this postseason. <strong>MJ</strong></p> <h2>The end of total US dominance in women\u2019s gymnastics</h2> <p>The US women led by Simone Biles will head into the 2020 Olympics as odds-on favorites to win their third consecutive team title. But Biles has already announced that she is planning to retire after 2020, leaving the future of US women\u2019s gymnastics dominance in doubt. The past decade of US gymnastics dominance is not entirely due to Biles \u2013 they won the 2011 and 2012 team titles without her \u2013 but since she arrived on the senior scene in 2013, the wins have felt a lot more comfortable. But the decade started with a Russian win at the 2010 world championships and with Aliya Mustafina being crowned all-around champion. And in a Biles-less world, Russia could find themselves on top again. At the inaugural junior world championships, the US placed third behind teams from Russia and China. While success in the juniors doesn\u2019t always translate to senior wins, other countries clearly have a lot of talent in their pipeline. While the US women will still win in the coming decade, it will no longer be as certain as the sun rising in the east. <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2>The NBA will agree to shorten the regular-season schedule</h2> <p>Even hardcore basketball fans tend to find the 82-game slate an unnecessarily long slog. With ratings on the decline and teams resting their stars to keep them fresh for the postseason, it\u2019s time for a change, Yes, teams will be hesitant to sacrifice the game-day revenue, but it could be vital for the long-term health of the league. (For the record. however, shortening the season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/21/nba-schedule-changes-in-season-tournament\">just to add an in-season tournament</a> isn\u2019t a solution to anything.) <strong>HF</strong></p> <h2>Promotion and relegation will (finally) come to Major League Soccer</h2> <p>With the announcement that Charlotte will soon be home to a MLS franchise, North American soccer\u2019s top flight swelled to 30 teams. That will make the division by some distance the largest in world soccer and with no fewer than four expansion spots being awarded in 2019 it\u2019s unlikely that growth will stop there. At 26 clubs large, MLS is already experiencing issues, with the 2020 season the first to feature a completely lopsided fixture list - not every team will face each other, essentially rendering the Supporters\u2019 Shield pointless. It seems infeasible that MLS could go beyond 30 teams without splitting into two tiers and so 2020 could be the year that the league finally announces its intention to implement promotion and relegation at some point in the not-so-distant future. It\u2019s long been speculated whether or not MLS would integrate itself into North America\u2019s soccer pyramid. Now it\u2019s getting big enough to be the pyramid all on its own. <strong>GR</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"815f84df788052dc777675157013642129e708fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/815f84df788052dc777675157013642129e708fa/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Biles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russia\u2019s women\u2019s gymnastics team stands to make up ground once Simone Biles moves on from American duty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Robots will call balls and strikes in at least one MLB game</h2> <p>In December, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d8760e52b8ced5b8436c60891ea6e877\">reported</a> that the Major League Umpires Association agreed to cooperate with the development and testing of an automated ball-strike system as part of a five-year labor agreement.

Tom Brady plays just one or two games this decade The New England Patriots\u2019 ageless talisman has continually purported that he wants to play until he\u2019s 44 or 45 or whenever Father Time physically tosses him out of football. But 42-year-old Brady is quickly looking like a player with nothing more to gain by playing. While still a master tactician, his physicality and productivity are diminishing. His 6.6 yards per completion this season were his lowest since 2002 and there\u2019s little to indicate an upward tick is on the horizon. Brady has absolutely nothing left to prove. Quite frankly, every season he spends looking less like Brady in his prime and more like Peyton Manning in his very gimpy final season is a disservice to his TB12 brand which is founded on beating back the clock.

But Scotland\u2019s goalkeeper Lee Alexander does not celebrate, she just gets up and glares.</p> <p>It turned out that was the right decision. Within a minute Alexander\u2019s heroics had been snuffed out.

The technology has been applied inconsistently (and slowly) by people with limited experience. As for new rules that have not helped matters, try on the handball law for size.</p> <p>In November, during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/var-premier-league-pitchside-monitor-no-change\" title=\"\">notably bullish presentation</a> about VAR\u2019s first few months, the Premier League\u2019s refereeing chief, Mike Riley, admitted to the technology having made four errors. One of them seemed to capture all the aspects of VAR that have proved contentious: a goal scored by Sokratis Papastathopoulos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/27/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">for Arsenal against Crystal Palace</a>.</p> <p>The score was 2-2 and the match entering its final period when the centre-half smashed in what looked like a winning goal from a corner. It was scrappy, a Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 kick flicked on at the near post into a crowd on the edge of the six-yard box, before spilling out to Papastathopoulos 10 yards out. His shot crossed the goalline at 82:18. Only when the clock hit 84.15 did the referee, Martin Atkinson, rule it out, for a perceived foul by Arsenal\u2019s Callum Chambers in the buildup.</p> <p>Riley would later admit that Chambers had committed no such foul. But for fans \u2013 especially those in the stadium \u2013 that was little consolation. They had been denied a goal and potentially two league points. They had also endured the mortifying experience of having celebrated a goal that turned out never to have happened. The final indignity was that the decision to overturn took two minutes to make, a period that can feel like a lifetime in a stadium. The question many fans were asking was this: even if there had been a foul (which there had not) if it took two minutes to spot with a bank of video screens at your disposal, could the referee\u2019s mistake really have been \u201cclear and obvious\u201d?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36022476a6734d5b13a284bb28deba6ed0471c53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36022476a6734d5b13a284bb28deba6ed0471c53/192_0_2462_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland v Argentina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s Lee Alexander saves a penalty from Florencia Bonsegundo but VAR ordered a retake from which Argentina scored.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clear and obvious, clear and obvious. During the autumn those three words were repeated more often than \u201cboy done good\u201d. This was the high bar the Premier League had set itself, the criterion any incident would have to fulfil before the VAR would intervene in a referee\u2019s decision. Alongside the original motto for the technology \u2013 minimum interference for maximum benefit \u2013 it seemed simple and straightforward enough.</p> <p>But it did not turn out like that. One problem with \u201cclear and obvious\u201d was that it was not supposed to apply in every situation. In decisions regarding offside or handball there was nothing subjective about it, according to Riley and co. So, if a decision was marginally wrong, it was still wrong and should be overturned.</p> <p>This led to initial confusion among fans and pundits alike. The same could be said of the phrase more broadly, with many people thinking a moment that was, say, clearly and obviously a foul, should require the VAR\u2019s involvement when, in fact, it was only if the referee had made a clear and obvious error in not seeing it.</p> <p>That VARs themselves should interpret what was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d in a number of different ways should not, therefore, have proved surprising. But they did and sometimes it would result in minutes spent poring over details (see PastathopoulousPapastathopoulos\u2019s goal) before coming to a conclusion that might flip a match on its head. VARs and the \u201cvideo operatives\u201d working alongside them also had varying levels of aptitude in applying the technology at their disposal. New 3D representations of an offside decision could take an age to be crafted, something that became even more frustrating when it turned out the cameras that had taken the original pictures were not fast enough to capture split-second actions in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fans in the ground rarely got to see these images; they were more often served up on TV. And it was the match-going fan who really got the short straw in VAR\u2019s first few months. The rules, mostly established not by the Premier League but by the International Football Association Board (Ifab), which oversees the laws of the game, prevented footage being shown unless a decision had already been overturned. The body also prevented the crowd from receiving any communication from the referee. Fans were not only left sitting in a state of frustrated limbo for minutes at a time but often had no clue as to why.</p> <p>Amid all this frustration the fact that VAR had significantly improved the number of correct decisions (reducing what they call errors in Key Match Incidents from 47 by November 2018 to 24 at the same point in 2019) was by the by. Come November the Premier League went into listening mode, meeting fans groups and stakeholder clubs. Changes were promised. Big ones would have to wait for Ifab but small ones arrived in time for Christmas.</p> <p>Now at a Premier League match (at any ground bar Old Trafford and Anfield as they do not have big screens), when the VAR is in operation, the crowd are not just informed but given a reason why: \u201cVAR checking penalty \u2013 possible handball\u201d being one such example. It\u2019s a small step but when it\u2019s applied in the ground the response is at least no longer one of incandescence. All people want is to understand what is happening.</p> <p>VAR may be here to stay but it seems fair to say there is more learning to be done before it can be called the finished item.</p>",

His shot crossed the goalline at 82:18. Only when the clock hit 84.15 did the referee, Martin Atkinson, rule it out, for a perceived foul by Arsenal\u2019s Callum Chambers in the buildup. Riley would later admit that Chambers had committed no such foul. But for fans \u2013 especially those in the stadium \u2013 that was little consolation. They had been denied a goal and potentially two league points. They had also endured the mortifying experience of having celebrated a goal that turned out never to have happened. The final indignity was that the decision to overturn took two minutes to make, a period that can feel like a lifetime in a stadium. The question many fans were asking was this: even if there had been a foul (which there had not) if it took two minutes to spot with a bank of video screens at your disposal, could the referee\u2019s mistake really have been \u201cclear and obvious\u201d? Clear and obvious, clear and obvious. During the autumn those three words were repeated more often than \u201cboy done good\u201d. This was the high bar the Premier League had set itself, the criterion any incident would have to fulfil before the VAR would intervene in a referee\u2019s decision. Alongside the original motto for the technology \u2013 minimum interference for maximum benefit \u2013 it seemed simple and straightforward enough. But it did not turn out like that. One problem with \u201cclear and obvious\u201d was that it was not supposed to apply in every situation. In decisions regarding offside or handball there was nothing subjective about it, according to Riley and co. So, if a decision was marginally wrong, it was still wrong and should be overturned. This led to initial confusion among fans and pundits alike. The same could be said of the phrase more broadly, with many people thinking a moment that was, say, clearly and obviously a foul, should require the VAR\u2019s involvement when, in fact, it was only if the referee had made a clear and obvious error in not seeing it. That VARs themselves should interpret what was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d in a number of different ways should not, therefore, have proved surprising. But they did and sometimes it would result in minutes spent poring over details (see PastathopoulousPapastathopoulos\u2019s goal) before coming to a conclusion that might flip a match on its head. VARs and the \u201cvideo operatives\u201d working alongside them also had varying levels of aptitude in applying the technology at their disposal. New 3D representations of an offside decision could take an age to be crafted, something that became even more frustrating when it turned out the cameras that had taken the original pictures were not fast enough to capture split-second actions in the first place. Fans in the ground rarely got to see these images; they were more often served up on TV. And it was the match-going fan who really got the short straw in VAR\u2019s first few months. The rules, mostly established not by the Premier League but by the International Football Association Board (Ifab), which oversees the laws of the game, prevented footage being shown unless a decision had already been overturned. The body also prevented the crowd from receiving any communication from the referee. Fans were not only left sitting in a state of frustrated limbo for minutes at a time but often had no clue as to why. Amid all this frustration the fact that VAR had significantly improved the number of correct decisions (reducing what they call errors in Key Match Incidents from 47 by November 2018 to 24 at the same point in 2019) was by the by. Come November the Premier League went into listening mode, meeting fans groups and stakeholder clubs. Changes were promised. Big ones would have to wait for Ifab but small ones arrived in time for Christmas. Now at a Premier League match (at any ground bar Old Trafford and Anfield as they do not have big screens), when the VAR is in operation, the crowd are not just informed but given a reason why: \u201cVAR checking penalty \u2013 possible handball\u201d being one such example. It\u2019s a small step but when it\u2019s applied in the ground the response is at least no longer one of incandescence. All people want is to understand what is happening. VAR may be here to stay but it seems fair to say there is more learning to be done before it can be called the finished item.",

      "bodyText": "Canberra has experienced its worst air quality on record, as bushfire smoke became trapped by atmospheric conditions and residents were told to stay indoors and brace for more smog in the coming days. The ACT\u2019s acting chief health officer, Dr Paul Dugdale, said the smoke was the worst since the 2003 bushfires and was \u201ccertainly the worst\u201d since air quality monitoring started in the city 15 years ago. Air quality index readings in Canberra city were at 3,463 on Wednesday afternoon, according to the ACT Health website. Ratings of more than 200 are considered hazardous. The suburb of Monash showed levels at 4,650 and Florey was at 3,508. An ACT health spokesperson said the AQI reading for fine particles peaked at 7700 at 1am on Wednesday at the Monash monitoring site. The Canberra-based University of NSW climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis was out in the city with her two-year-old daughter and said the conditions were \u201clike nothing I have experienced before\u201d. She was planning to leave the city. \u201cIt\u2019s permeating everything. It is the fine particulates that get through everything. This is the worst it has been,\u201d she said. \u201cLast night it started to blow in and you do start to feel quite anxious and stressed. Smoke just makes us all panic.\u201d Families and children visiting Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre, had a look of shock, said Lewis, with many people wearing masks and checking phone apps for air quality and fire updates. She said a pattern in recent weeks had been for the smoke from bushfires burning to the east to arrive on cooler sea breezes in the evening. On Tuesday night and Wednesday, a phenomenon known as a \u201ctemperature inversion\u201d had caused warmer air above to trap the smoke, making conditions especially bad. The Bureau of Meteorology was expecting a similar temperature inversion to cause further problems in the ACT on Wednesday night. On Wednesday morning Dugdale said 12 people had gone to Canberra hospital with smoke-related illnesses in the previous 24 hours. Dugdale said it was not the time for people to start any new year fitness resolutions and they should stay indoors instead. \u201cThis is an exceptional time for Canberra \u2013 usually our air quality is among the best in the world,\u201d he said. The ACT\u2019s health directorate also issued fresh advice on Wednesday, saying all Canberrans should \u201cavoid physical activity outside\u201d. The public was advised to stay indoors with windows and doors closed and to turn evaporative air conditioners off. The \u201cextremely thick\u201d smog was forecast to linger for several days, with conditions expected to remain poor, and temperatures on Saturday forecast to climb to 42C. A statement said: \u201cWe also strongly advise people who are sensitive to smoke, especially those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during these conditions. \u201cPeople who are sensitive to smoke and air pollution can be more vulnerable to heat-related illness as well, so staying hydrated and cool is important. \u201cPeople who are able to do so, are also encouraged to check on others who they think might need extra help, to see that they are okay.\u201d In NSW on Wednesday, the air quality index was at very high hazardous levels of 2,300 around Goulburn, caused by smoke from nearby bushfires. Hazardous conditions were also detected in regions of Sydney\u2019s south-west (352), and in the central tablelands (394) and southwest slopes (360).",

A central thesis of Biden\u2019s campaign \u2013 which he increasingly states in blunt terms on the campaign trail \u2013 is that he is the candidate most likely to reassemble a Democratic coalition by appealing to white working class voters who Trump won over in 2016 and to black voters who are critical to the Democratic base.</p> <p>But rising in second place is Sanders, who rebounded from a heart attack in October and sinking poll numbers earlier this year.

On the campaign trail and the debate stage, the candidates will make their closing arguments to voters. After months of debating policy and politics, their final pitches are expected to focus on the issue that matters most to Democrats: why they are the party\u2019s best hope of beating Trump. \u201cRight now, the biggest priority for Democratic voters is who can beat Donald Trump,\u201d said Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist who previously worked on John Delaney\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not the whole game but it\u2019s the most important part of it because if you thought what Trump did in his first term was bad, imagine what he is capable of in a second term.\u201d",

This is <strong>Helen Davidson</strong> here to take you through the rest of the day\u2019s live coverage of the continuing Australian bushfire crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>In NSW</strong> there is one emergency-level fire in the Snowy Valleys. <strong>The Dunns Road fire </strong>has burned more than 100,000 hectares. Conditions are easing but it is burning south of the Snowy Mountains Highway in the Ellerslie Range, and the south-westerly change is pushing the fire towards the areas of Kunama, Wondalga and surrounds. People there are urged to leave now towards Tumut if they aren\u2019t prepared.</p> \n  <p>There are six watch and act fires in the state, all in the south.</p> \n  <p><strong>In Tasmania</strong> there is one emergency warning for a fire in the north-east at <strong>Fingal through to Mathinna</strong>. The alert was issued about two hours ago and warned of high risk to the area, with the fire difficult to control. People north of Moonameeta were urged to evacuate to Mathinna. There are six other watch and act alerts, mainly in the north-east but also one north-west of Hobart.</p> \n  <p><strong>In Victoria</strong> there are currently no emergency warnings, as the Sunbury fire has been downgraded. There are 11 watch and act warnings issued. </p> \n  <p>There is one watch and act fire in <strong>South Australia</strong>, on Kangaroo Island.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-01T06:51:43.469Z\">at 6.51am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e0c379f8f087e8308e66c69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-01T06:11:32.265Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And there are months to go.</p> \n  <p>Today we had both NSW and Victoria\u2019s emergency chiefs tell us they could not get around these fires.

Their only protection is the fire chief, Charmaine Sellings; her two volunteers, and one ute with a slip-on tank. They will have to fill the ute out of the water from her daughter\u2019s pool, Sellings says, unless the power and water is switched back on.

The community began as a church mission in 1863 and Lake Tyers residents were granted the freehold in 1971, under the Aboriginal Lands Act.

They have received no further information other than what was listed on the VicEmergency app, and watched the flames at Nowa Nowa on Monday night knowing they were only 8km away and not knowing whether they would get close.

My father and I took a side of the house each, fighting off the embers that managed to spread incredibly fast straight up the hill we live on. The damage that was done to our property is insane, absolutely everything is burnt, we lost a few shacks and other bits and pieces out the back but saved the house, shed, our cars, tanks and some-f*cking-how the garden. It was a long hard fight through thick smoke, starting around 6.30, and by 11.30 we were settling down trying to sleep. We watched the fires take off south toward our other home in Orbost, only 80km away.... so to everyone out there who are under threat, get out of you can, stay safe, keep hydrated, and just bloody take care!!!

      "bodyText": "We are ending this blog for today. While fires continued to burn today they were not as catastrophic as Tuesday. Instead, we learned a lot about the absolute devastation wrought along the NSW south coast and Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region. Nine people have died since Monday, and five are missing. Across NSW, Victoria, and South Australia, 17 people have been confirmed dead in bushfires since October. NSW RFS commissioner, Shane FitzSimmons, warned the NSW death toll would rise, as further cases were confirmed. Fitzsimmons said the lack of communication is making it difficult for authorities to determine who is still missing. At least 200 homes were destroyed on the South Coast yesterday, and at least 60 in East Gippsland. \u201cIf we had 10,000 firefighters we wouldn\u2019t be able to put these fires out,\u201d said deputy RFS commissioner Rob Rogers. Authorities said the majority of the south coast fires were the result of \u2018natural\u2019 activity \u2013 like lightning. Saturday is forecast to be worse than yesterday in NSW, across a broader geographic area, with extreme conditions dominating the regions where there are already some of the most damaging and destructive fires burning. Two bushfires have merged on South Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island and are expected to burn for weeks. HMAS Choules is expected to arrive at Mallacoota tomorrow morning, for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capability. It\u2019s among a large deployment of ADF assets to assist in evacuations of the thousands of people still stranded, and to replace exhausted fire crews. Power is slowly being restored to small parts of the NSW south coast, but is likely to be out for weeks in many places. Some roads are beginning to reopen to very restricted traffic this afternoon, as authorities work to have currently stranded people \u2013 especially tourists \u2013 leave the area before conditions worsen again this weekend. Scott Morrison hosted Australian and New Zealand cricketers at Kirribilli House. There is an active emergency level fire in Western Australia. The warning was issued for parts of Orelia in the city of Kwinana. Homes on Colchester Avenue were under threat from a fire in Sandringham Park which started near the intersection of Colchester Avenue and Dunrobin Avenue and was moving north east. FitzSimmons says the Dunn Road fire is going be upgraded again to an emergency fire as the fire behaviour was increasing and spreading. These fires are in some of NSW\u2019s \u201cmost beautiful yet most rugged and difficult-to-access terrain.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the enormity of damage and destruction which unfolded yesterday and unfortunately Saturday is likely to be worse.\u201d From the premier, Gladys Berejiklian: \u201cJust because you can\u2019t see flames doesn\u2019t mean the road is safe to use. Having seen the number of trees burnt out, having seen the bring alongside these roads, I completely understand why the emergency authorities need to make sure they are safe before people can use them. \u201cHaving said that, we are grateful for milder weather conditions over the next few days and where roads can be accessed, we will be encouraging tourists especially to move out of those areas while it\u2019s safe to do so, because we are concerned what the weather might bring us on Saturday, given what has been forecast and given what we\u2019ve experienced over the last few days.\u201d There is an evening update with the NSW premier and senior fire and police chiefs at the NSW RFS headquarters. \u201cWe are getting indications with the forecast for Saturday that it is going to present a broader geographic area worse than what we saw yesterday when it comes to fire danger, with a fairly widespread area of extreme conditions which will dominate the south eastern corner of the state, through the southern slopes, southern ranges, parts of the high country and through to places like the Illawarra and Shoalhaven,\u201d Shane FitzSimmons says. \u201cUnfortunately that also correlates with where we\u2019ve got some of the worst and most damaging and destructive of fires burning in New South Wales at the moment.\u201d Firefighters are keeping a close eye on the Green wattle Creek fire where it has flared up in the north-east corner. Firefighters are addressing it ahead of the worsening conditions later this week. Access from Batemans Bay north will be open to some very restricted access from this afternoon, says NSW police deputy commissioner Worboys. \u201cTowards south of Batemans Bay, we will also work with some local roads down the coast that will bring people down in through Bega, and across Brown Mountain, into Coomera, Canberra, and they can make their way up towards Goulburn, up the Hume towards Sydney and out further west.\u201d He says there\u2019s \u201ca long way to go\u201d but they are working to restore power, with some back on in places like Ulladulla and near Batemans Bay. He says everyone has been very patient and he\u2019s grateful. \u201cIn our evacuation centres that are full, it is trying times, and people have heeded the warnings, they\u2019ve cooperated well, and we just ask them again to continue in that spirit through tonight, into tomorrow, and we look forward to some further power restoration, some more road openings, and of course increased communications up and down the south coast.\u201d Two bushfires have merged on South Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island and are expected to burn for weeks, as firefighters prepare for a dangerous wind change, AAP reports. The fires started about five kilometres apart in the inaccessible Ravine Des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area and have burnt through more than 7500 hectares of native vegetation, timber plantations and private property. On Wednesday afternoon the combined fire was uncontrolled and burning in a northerly direction towards Snug Cove. Firefighters and water-bombing aircraft are focused on protecting assets, but the Country Fire Service said efforts might be hampered by changing weather conditions and poor visibility. If the blaze remains uncontained, northerly winds forecast for Friday could push it towards the Flinders Chase National Park. For the safety of tourists and the community, the CFS and SA National Parks and Wildlife Service have closed the park from midnight Wednesday until further notice. Extensive road closures are also in place on the western end of the island. The CFS has confirmed the Cudlee Creek fire, which broke out on December 20 and destroyed at least 70 homes, has been contained. The Dunns Road fire has been downgraded to a watch and act, which means there are currently no emergency level fires or warnings in NSW or Victoria. Having said that, the ABC has just reported the Currowan fire has jumped the Shoalhaven river in spots, which is not great news for people around Wingello, Penrose and Bundanoon. The RFS last provided an update on that fire a few hours ago, so I\u2019ll bring more info when we have it. Shane Kelly has sent in these photos, taken somewhere east of Canberra. I work for an airline and have been flying in and around this smoke for a while now, it\u2019s absolutely devastating to have this overview of these fires. You feel helpless. The enormity of the fires really impresses on you when you can see the extent of the fires from the air flying up and down the east coast of Australia. Guardian Australia would like to hear from you about your encounter with the fires in this summer\u2019s unprecedented fire season. If you would like to get in contact with us, details are here. Further details from NSW police about the seven confirmed deaths in the southern NSW fires. Since Monday, emergency services have responded to the following fatal incidents: A 28-year-old RFS volunteer firefighter, Sam McPaul, died at a property on River Road, Jingellic, just before 6pm on Monday. A father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway \u2013 aged 63 and 29 \u2013 died at a property at Wandella, about 10km north-west of Cobargo, on Monday. A 70-year-old man was found dead outside a home at Yatte Yattah, about 6km west of Lake Conjola, on Tuesday. The body of a man was found in a burned-out car on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah about 7.30am today. The body of a man was found in a vehicle on Wandra Road, Sussex Inlet about 11.30am today. He is yet to be formally identified. A body has been found outside a home at Coolagolite, about 10km east of Cobargo, today. ( I believe this is the person found by ambulance officers. We did not have a location earlier.) A 72-year-old man at Belowra and a 70-year-old woman at Conjola Park are still both unaccounted for. This particularly grim video shows the level of destruction to a line of shops in Mogo, on the NSW south coast. Good afternoon. This is Helen Davidson here to take you through the rest of the day\u2019s live coverage of the continuing Australian bushfire crisis. In NSW there is one emergency-level fire in the Snowy Valleys. The Dunns Road fire has burned more than 100,000 hectares. Conditions are easing but it is burning south of the Snowy Mountains Highway in the Ellerslie Range, and the south-westerly change is pushing the fire towards the areas of Kunama, Wondalga and surrounds. People there are urged to leave now towards Tumut if they aren\u2019t prepared. There are six watch and act fires in the state, all in the south. In Tasmania there is one emergency warning for a fire in the north-east at Fingal through to Mathinna. The alert was issued about two hours ago and warned of high risk to the area, with the fire difficult to control. People north of Moonameeta were urged to evacuate to Mathinna. There are six other watch and act alerts, mainly in the north-east but also one north-west of Hobart. In Victoria there are currently no emergency warnings, as the Sunbury fire has been downgraded. There are 11 watch and act warnings issued. There is one watch and act fire in South Australia, on Kangaroo Island. And there are months to go. Today we had both NSW and Victoria\u2019s emergency chiefs tell us they could not get around these fires. That 10,000 firefighters on the ground would not be enough to stop the blazes. All that is going to help is a change in conditions, but instead we are facing Saturday being worse than what we saw on Tuesday. And there are months to go in this season. MONTHS. On that dour note, I am going to hand you over to Helen Davidson for the evening coverage. Stay safe and pay attention to the warnings in your area. And please \u2013 take care of you. QUEENSLAND * 7 bushfires burning * 250,000 hectares burned * 45 homes confirmed destroyed WESTERN AUSTRALIA * More than 40 bushfires burning, two of significance * 1.2 million hectares burned * One home confirmed destroyed TASMANIA * More than 30 bushfires burning, seven of significance * 8,000 hectares burned * One home confirmed destroyed AAP has put together a wrap of the bushfire season so far.

He\u2019s also putting on this: That emergency warning for Sunbury comes after a bushfire on Canterbury Avenue began burning out of control. Authorities are urging residents on Settlers Way and Enterprize Drive to leave now, with the fire expected to hit within the next 20 minutes. An emergency warning has been issued for Sunbury in Victoria \u2013 leave now if you can. The Australian Defence Force helicopters sent from Townsville to help with the Victorian fires should arrive this afternoon. This smoke pollution is showing no sign of moving on today: And here is the Choules leaving Sydney Harbour: Victorian police have also sent vessels to Mallacoota: Meanwhile, fires are merging in South Australia. From AAP: Two bushfires have merged on South Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island and are expected to burn for weeks, as firefighters prepare for a dangerous wind change. The fires started about 5km apart in the inaccessible Ravine Des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area and have burnt through more than 7,500 hectares of native vegetation, timber plantations and private property. On Wednesday afternoon the combined fire was uncontrolled and burning in a northerly direction towards Snug Cove. Firefighters and water-bombing aircraft are focused on protecting assets, but the Country Fire Service said efforts might be hampered by changing weather conditions and poor visibility. If the blaze remains uncontained, northerly winds forecast for Friday could push it towards the Flinders Chase National Park. For the safety of tourists and the community, the CFS and SA National Parks and Wildlife Service have closed the park from midnight Wednesday until further notice. Extensive road closures are also in place on the western end of the island. A watch-and-act alert remains active and local residents are being urged to leave the area if not confident of defending property. The defence department has just provided an update through the ABC on when the humanitarian ship, HMAS Choules, will arrive in Mallacoota. It\u2019s making better than faster time and should be there tomorrow morning. It sailed this morning, or shortly before lunch. She\u2019s embarked an amount of what I\u2019d call humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capability and she should be off the Mallacoota Beach some time very early tomorrow morning. She has capability that includes a helicopter that\u2019s embarked and a range of disaster relief stores and equipment and personnel that can support and respond to other coastal areas where there might be isolated communities and render support and assistance to them. We would do so at the behest of the Victorian emergency management authorities. People are still coming to terms with the devastation they are returning to: There is a bit of confusion around the number of dead and missing. Since Christmas, nine people have died in bushfires across NSW and Victoria, and at least four people are missing. The firefighter Sam McPaul, 28, died when his fire truck was overturned by extreme winds east of Albury on Monday. The father and son Robert and Patrick Salway were found dead inside their house in Cobargo on Tuesday. A man is unaccounted for and presumed dead in Belowra. The NSW police deputy commissioner, Gary Worboys, said authorities had been unable to access the location west of Narooma to confirm a report. A man has died in his home on Myrtle Gully Road, west of Lake Conjola, police also confirmed. The man\u2019s body showed no signs of trauma or burns and police don\u2019t believe it is suspicious. In Buchan, Victoria, 67-year-old Mick Roberts died in the East Gippsland fires. On Wednesday Worboys confirmed three further deaths in the south coast fires. The police have confirmed at Yatte Yattah, a body found in a vehicle there, which is near Lake Conjola. One at Sussex Inlet and a body in a vehicle. And ambulance officers have told us about a body that they have located as well deceased. There remains concern over another person, also in Lake Conjola, where a house has been destroyed by fire and the occupant reported missing. \u201cWe\u2019re sifting through that now with RFS, forensics and fire and rescue New South Wales to work out what\u2019s occurred there,\u201d Worboys said. Three people are still believed to be missing in fire areas in Victoria. The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane FitzSimmons, warned the NSW death toll would rise, as further cases were confirmed. It is not the first time Scott Morrison has brought the bushfires and the cricket together \u2013 you may remember this tweet from November: Scott Morrison finished with this: But the fires do rage on. It is a time of great challenge for Australia. Whether they\u2019re started by lightning storms or whatever the cause may be, our firefighters and all of those who have come behind them to support them, whether they\u2019re volunteering in the front line or behind the scenes in a great volunteer effort, it is something that will happen against the back drop of this Test match. But at the same time, Australians will be gathering, whether it\u2019s at the SCG or around television sets all around the country, and they\u2019ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they\u2019ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians and the way that people have gone about remembering the terrible things that other Australians are dealing with at the moment. The prime minister continued: We\u2019ve been so well supported by those from so many other nations during these terrible fires and none more so than our Kiwi cousins. And as you go out there on Friday, I know you will be going out there, and particularly the Australian team, thinking of the terrible fires that are under way at the moment and I want to thank you, Tim [Paine] and the team and both captains, for the commemoration that you\u2019ll make in wearing the black armbands for those who we\u2019ve lost over the course of these fires. In particular, having lost Sam McPaul just the other day in just a dreadful, terrible incident just outside of Albury, but also Geoff Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer who we lost earlier in the fire season. And your recognition of them during the course of this Test match I think will mean a lot to their families and a lot to their mates who served alongside them in these terrible fires. Scott Morrison has made a speech about the fires to cricketers who are at Kirribilli House for a function: Here in Australia, and also in New Zealand, with the White Island tragedy, and those terrible events to this very day, and they\u2019ll be ongoing during the course of this Test match. And in all of these terrible events, be it the fires or the White Island tragedy, as in so many times before, Australia and New Zealand have always stood together. And that has been very true on this occasion as well. I today want to particularly recognise the contribution of New Zealand\u2019s firefighters and what they have done to support their Australian mates here at this testing time. Since November, more than a hundred firefighters and incident manager team, aviation specialists have supported our teams battling the blazes in New South Wales. The Bega MP and NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, who was briefly unaccounted for yesterday after defending his home from fires, has urged people to not return to their homes until it is judged safe. One thing, you\u2019ve just got to take your hats off to the RFS and the volunteers and the staff incident team. I mean, they had to deal with hell yesterday. Our police, everyone, we just need everyone to keep listening to each other and the message that needs to go out is \u2013 and I experienced this yesterday, the trees are coming down like there\u2019s no tomorrow and I\u2019ve got a photo of someone who drove under a tree and they\u2019re lucky to be alive because it\u2019s come down on their boot. So people just need to listen. The roads are closed for a reason, they\u2019re so trees don\u2019t come down and kill someone. You know, I don\u2019t want that. People have to wait an extra day or two so we can save lives \u2013 then just do it. The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says the lack of communication is making it difficult for authorities to determine who is still missing. He says people need to brace themselves for more confirmed deaths. This conversation will not, and can\u2019t be, stopped: Power in some of those NSW south coast areas is likely to remain out for some time to come. From AAP: Fire-ravaged communities along a 180km stretch of NSW\u2019s south coast are likely to be without power and some telecommunications for an \u201cextended period\u201d after at least 40 power poles were destroyed. NSW police said power had been lost from South Nowra to Moruya and \u201cpotentially beyond\u201d on Tuesday, affecting at least 46,000 people. The outage also affected communication lines, including landlines and internet. Endeavour Energy on Wednesday said more than 18,000 of its customers remained powerless and were likely to remain so for some time. At least 40 power poles have been destroyed, as have conductors. The RFS must grant workers permission to access the scorched areas. \u201cWhere it is safe and feasible to do so, we recommend residents find alternative accommodation until power supply can be safely restored to their homes,\u201d the energy company said in a statement. Endeavour said it had restored power to Ulladulla customers. The NSW police deputy commissioner, Gary Worboys, on the deaths: Today we have the three deaths. The police have confirmed at Yatte Yattah, a body found in a vehicle there, which is near Lake Conjola. One at Sussex Inlet, a body in a vehicle. And ambulance officers have told us about a body that they have located as well deceased. In terms of the situation down on the south coast, we have three emergency operation centres operating locally up and down the coast that are dealing with any amount of local issues and doing their best to solve those problems for people down there. There is no magic wand to wave across this and fix it in a short amount of time. AAP has this update on Tasmania: An emergency alert has been issued for a suspicious bushfire in Tasmania. The alert was issued on Wednesday afternoon for Mathinna Road because of the threatening Mingana fire. \u201cBurning embers, falling on Mathinna Road, Fingal through to Mathinna will threaten your home before the main fire,\u201d the alert reads. The fire has been burning since Monday and police believe it was arson. \u201cPolice have reason to believe the main fire, as well as other fires in the area, have been deliberately lit,\u201d Northern District Commander Brett Smith said. \u201cBushfires are devastating, destructive, and in this case has displaced people from their homes. Someone must know something about who is responsible for this fire.\u201d Watch and act alerts are also still in place for the fire at Pelham, north of Hobart, where a home was destroyed and other property damaged on Tuesday. A look at what happened in Victoria yesterday: Rob Rogers on whether or not there is enough resources: Well, I guess, you can always use more but at the end of the day the amount of fire trucks that we throw at these fires from all the agencies, fire rescue, they threw everything they had, RFS did, National Parks were doing that, so were State Forests. There were thousands and thousands of firefighters at these fires. You can\u2019t say you\u2019ll always have enough for every scenario. It\u2019s an impossible situation. If we had 10,000 firefighters we wouldn\u2019t be able to put these fires out. Where we\u2019re at at the moment, the support we\u2019ve had from both interstate and overseas has helped enormously. We\u2019ve got a huge amount of aircraft. We\u2019ve never had five large air tankers in this state before. So we\u2019re well resourced but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to be able to do everything and protect everyone. I think we\u2019ve been upfront as these situations unfolded. Unfortunately, like we\u2019ve seen down the south coast, we were starting to lose property at 3.30 in the morning. We were getting calls for people that were stuck in their homes and that\u2019s the sort of scenario that unfortunately we\u2019re faced with. People that are being woken to fire threatening their homes. That\u2019s why we keep saying to people, don\u2019t wait for a message. Don\u2019t wait for the fire to be there \u2013 if it\u2019s going to be a bad day, just be away from that area. That\u2019s the safest thing we can do to try and prevent more loss of life. Unfortunately I hate the number of homes we\u2019ve lost but at the end of the day this is about people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s the most important thing right now. And on the question of whether there is much more to burn, the RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, says: Most of the area that\u2019s been impacted certainly in the south has been on the ranges and fires that have then impacted in the coastal area. There\u2019s a lot of area around the Snowy Mountains, Kosciuszko area, a lot of area south and west of Canberra that hasn\u2019t burned. There\u2019s lightning that\u2019s started and that\u2019s a concern. There\u2019s still significant amounts of bushland that can still burn. We\u2019re very concerned about the threat that poses on Saturday given the amount of fire we have in the landscape now and our inability to be able to get containment on those fires. We would not be able to get around these fires. Just because where they\u2019re burning is in such an area that\u2019s not easy to get to. There\u2019s no easy containment lines. We would have to get earth moving equipment in to try and create containment lines. It isn\u2019t just as simple to try and get around these fires. That\u2019s why we\u2019re being upfront \u2013 we can\u2019t get around them. Saturday is not looking like it\u2019s going to be a good day at all. A tough day. Deputy NSW RFS commissioner Rob Rogers: All these fires, these sort of fires, the only way we stop them is by back burning. That\u2019s the only way to actually do it. These fires are burning in the middle of nowhere. Our choices are to backburn or sit there and wait for them to hit us. We to try and do something. It doesn\u2019t always work. At the end of the day that\u2019s the only thing we can try and do to contain these fires. We like to have a few days before bad weather hits these fires. But at the moment we\u2019re in less than ideal circumstances. So we have to try our best and do whatever strategies we think are the best things to try and protect the most people. Authorities said the majority of the south coast fires were the result of \u2018natural\u2019 activity \u2013 like lightning. They have not heard of any deliberately lit fires in that area. All the main ones have been started by lightning. I think that brings the total number of deaths, since the season began, to 15. Two bodies have been found by police in two separate vehicles, while a third person has been found in a house. The occupant of another home destroyed by fire has been reported as missing \u2013 police and firefighters are now going through what is left of the home. Just a reminder that a Public Information and Inquiry Centre has been opened in regards to the south coast fires. The telephone number to call is 1800 227 228. A further three people have been confirmed as dead in yesterday\u2019s fires, the RFS says. That comes on top of the four deaths which have been reported previously. Fires at Werri Berri in the Bega Valley and about 20km east of Cooma are still burning. There is a lot of lightning in the Cooma area, which has fire authorities concerned. There are still fires in the Albury and Jingellic area. Three people just west of Moruya were airlifted for medical treatment. Another two were taken by ambulance, with an RFS escort. The RFS has also confirmed 176 homes have been lost. Lake Conjola Park: 89 homes. Malula Bay: 40 homes. Rosedale: 15. The NSW RFS is giving an update on today\u2019s fires: For a recap of the day\u2019s events, you can head here: And neither will images like this: I don\u2019t think these images are going to leave anyone\u2019s minds anytime soon: Firefighters are taking advantage of the slightly cooler conditions to try and get ahead of what is coming on Saturday - these are some of the backburning operations underway at the moment. There are a lot of people desperately trying to get information \u2013 or let loved ones know they are OK. By the by \u2013 Telstra\u2019s contract to run Australia\u2019s payphone network, ends this year. The report of Mick Roberts\u2019 death brings the fire death toll, since Monday, to four. Twelve people have lost their lives this season, including three RFS volunteers. Almost 1,000 homes have been lost since July, when the fires began. From Townsville to Victoria: More tragic news \u2013 from AAP: A man has been found dead in his home in bushfires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland. Mick Roberts had not made contact with family on Tuesday and on Wednesday and his niece Leah Parson said he had been found dead. \u201cHe\u2019s not missing anymore ... sorry but his body has been found in his house ... very sad day for us to [start] the year but we\u2019re a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick,\u201d Ms Parsons wrote on the East Gippsland fire season 2019-2020 Facebook page. Victoria police said they are en route to the area and are aware of the situation. Speaking of Australia and climate change, David Littleproud doubled down on that on ABC AM radio this morning. Kim Landers: After all of this, we\u2019ve seen incident controller, after incident controller, and plenty of experts say that they have seen nothing like this before. Do you acknowledge that the federal government now has to do more about climate change? David Littleproud: Well, we are and continue to, we\u2019ve made our commitments, internationally and we intend to [keep them]. Landers: You\u2019ve made those commitments internationally, I know the government says it will live up to those commitments, but there are a lot of people saying more needs to be done, something more than just meeting those commitments. Littleproud: That\u2019s what we will have to do to meet those commitments and we continue to make those endeavours and that is what we continue to look to, to actually supplement renewable energies, we have given subsidies to those to get them up to a point, to get them competitive from a market prospective, so the reality is the government continues to work through it. All industries, even in agriculture, which equates to 17% of reductions of emissions are looking to get to carbon neutrality by 2030 themselves, so industry and government are working together to ensure we do our bit. Landers: Do you think the public is going to think that is enough though? Littleproud: It\u2019s not just ... it is also important, it would be unrealistic to think Australia can do it by ourselves. We are leading by example and we expect the rest of the world to come with us, because we are 1.3% of emissions and we expect the rest of the world to do their bit as well, because if we all work globally together \u2013 and we are working globally in these fires, we have US firefighters, Canadian, New Zealanders. If we work together, collaboratively as a world community, then we will be able to meet our emissions reduction targets as a globe, not just Australia. AAP has an update on what is happening in Western Australia at the moment: More than 220 firefighters and 100 support personnel are battling a large bushfire in Western Australia\u2019s south, with a watch and act warning in place for residents and tourists. The blaze at Stirling Range national park, in the state\u2019s Great Southern region, has blackened more than 33,000 hectares since being sparked by lightning on Boxing Day. Firefighter numbers have been bolstered from the 175 who were working to build and strengthen containment lines on Tuesday. A watch and act message remains in place for people in the park as well as parts of the Shire of Gnowangerup, City of Albany, Shire of Plantagenet and Shire of Cranbrook. \u201cThere is a possible threat to lives and homes as the fire is still uncontrolled,\u201d the Department of Fire and Emergency Services warned on Wednesday. He finishes that answer with this: That action by Australia alone will not change everything but if everyone has that attitude, if every nation state says it is not me, I won\u2019t make a difference, it is a bit like any form of pollution \u2013 if everyone just think they can throw the rubbish out the car and it does not make a difference, the rubbish around our cities and regions and towns, then where will we end up? We will end up with a hell of a mess! What we\u2019re seeing here is that ... there is a need for Australia to take domestic action and at the moment they do not have an energy policy, they do not have a climate change plan and what we also need them to do then is to take that, that will come from a national program, and take that into international forums and argue for stronger international action. Because we know that the predictions are also that the nature of the Australian continent, with the impact we are seeing as a result of the drought, the dryness, will mean that we will be particularly impacted by climate change. This is why we need global action. At the moment we do not have domestic action that is appropriate and we have Australia playing a negative role in the international forums. Anthony Albanese on coal: Climate change is affected by fossil fuel burning. We know that anthropogenic climate change is caused by human intervention, the industrial revolution and in human times, we know that this has impacted, just the way we knew that CFCs were having an impact on the ozone layer, and the world came together, the world came together to find solutions. I am confident we can find solutions, but we need to avoid dangerous climate change. What we\u2019re seeing at the moment is dangerous. We are seeing that the predictions of the scientists, unfortunately, played out. The scientists told us that the fire seasons will be longer and more intense, that there would be more intense cyclones, more intense extreme weather events. Tragically, we are seeing that occur and that is why it needs a response that does not play games with accountancy fiddlers in conferences, that lowers emissions and that is relative to global emissions, of course, it is accurate. Anthony Albanese on whether or not he believes Scott Morrison is taking the situation seriously enough: Obviously he is treating it seriously, all Australians are treating it seriously. But what we are not getting is the sort of coordination that we need and I think that the prime minister has continued over a range of issues, is one of his go-to media talking points, to speak about \u2018we don\u2019t want to panic, we do not want to have any alarm, young people should not be scared by climate change.\u2019 I tell you what, young people watching the footage on the news at the moment would be pretty scared, it is scary, it is scary for everyone. That means that we need a considered response but I think that the prime minister, in terms of some of his tone, could accurately reflect the views I am getting back from the community, where ever I go. Addressing the Greens\u2019 calls for a royal commission into the bushfires, which Luke posted about a little earlier today, Anthony Albanese says Labor is open to it, but wants something which will result in action \u2018now\u2019: Well, I think it\u2019s immediate action that is required, not something that will report in six months, which is the minimum time for a royal commission normally. They take years rather than months, and what we need right now is for Coag to be convened. I wrote to the prime minister in November calling for that. I called for that and it has not happened. We have seen that there has been, therefore, a lack of coordination, a lack of a national approach, for example, to the compensation for volunteer firefighters. A call for, that was one of the elements I said should be discussed there. We should discuss the resourcing and we have seen changes in terms of the amount of defence assets which have been applied here. It is appropriate that we actually convene all the levels of government for what is a national crisis, we see that these bushfires do not respect state boundaries and nor should we when it comes to the response to this issue. Anthony Albanese: They want leadership on the economy, they want leadership on bushfires, and they want an end to complacency. This is not business as usual, this fire season. Climate change is certainly having an impact as well, and they expect more than newspaper articles, whether it be from Scott Morrison today, or the quite remarkably misleading piece by Angus Taylor, that Australia is somehow pulling our weight. They expect actually a bit of fair dinkum truth about what is going on because they can see it. They can smell it. And we are seeing the impact of complacency. Australia cannot do it all on our own. That is absolutely right. But the truth is Angus Taylor went to the Madrid conference and argued along with a few other countries for less action, not more. Argued for an accounting trick rather than reducing emissions. Anthony Albanese: I want to express my condolences to the family and friends and community who lost Robert and Patrick Salway at Cobargo yesterday. Today there is news of another fatality, a man found in a burnt-out car near Lake Conjola. But it\u2019s been four deaths in recent days, but 14 over this horrendous bushfire season. It is time for the prime minister to convene Coag. I wrote to him in November and we saw with the issue of him coming to an arrangement with Gladys Berejiklian, the New South Wales premier, and then belatedly contacting the other states that what we actually need is national leadership and a national approach. Of course, the prime minister had said that it was a distraction, the issue of volunteer firefighters being given economic compensation. He then said it was a state issue. And then he said, most remarkably, they want to be there. They do not want to be there. No one wants these horrendous scenes that have been played out that look like something that is quite unbelievable. The prime minister also says, in a piece today, in the tabloid newspapers, he speaks about not panicking. He speaks about the quiet Australians. Well, the Australians I have met here in Queensland and, indeed, throughout the country are not that quiet at the moment. They actually want leadership. Mike Bowers is in Batemans Bay. He says it has taken an hour and a half to navigate traffic heading north on the Princes Highway and there are almost no petrol stations open and those that are only accept cash. \u201cBut the ATMs are down, so you can\u2019t get cash,\u201d Bowers says. Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers are in Brisbane, as part of Labor\u2019s Queensland \u2018reset\u2019 and holding a press conference. Let\u2019s see if now is the time for Albanese to talk about coal, because yesterday, apparently, was not. The Lake Tyers Aboriginal community has begun to run out of water this morning. The Aboriginal-owned Gunai/Kurnai community, which is only 11km east of Lakes Entrance as the crow flies but about 25 minutes by road, has been cut off since Monday. About 45 people chose to remain in the community as the fire threatened and retreated to the health centre. Their only protection is the fire chief, Charmaine Sellings; her two volunteers, and one ute with a slip-on tank. They will have to fill the ute out of the water from her daughter\u2019s pool, Sellings says, unless the power and water is switched back on. Their second fire truck was comandeered by the local CFA, of which Sellings is a volunteer, to fight fires north of Lakes Entrance. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fuel, it\u2019s really dry, most of the dams are dry, and our water has gone on the blink again,\u201d Sellings says. The community is cut off from the Princes Highway by a broad stretch of forest, which turns into farmland about 2km from the settlement. The community began as a church mission in 1863 and Lake Tyers residents were granted the freehold in 1971, under the Aboriginal Lands Act. Many residents were born on the mission, and it\u2019s a \u201chaven\u201d for many other Koori, Suzie Squires, the CEO of the local housing corporation, says. Their last visit from emergency services was on Sunday, Sellings says. They have received no further information other than what was listed on the VicEmergency app, and watched the flames at Nowa Nowa on Monday night knowing they were only 8km away and not knowing whether they would get close. Sellings\u2019 biggest concern is the health of elderly residents, many of whom have respiratory problems. If the fire is blown towards them and reaches the community centre, Kerry Tregonning says, they plan to take to the water. \u201cWe have got the boats out the back we can use to accomodate about 20 people, we have 20 life jackets for everyone to evacuate if we have to go to the water,\u201d Tregonning says. \u201cWe are trying to source more life jackets now.\u201d If fire does reach the forest surrounding the community, evacuation by water will be the only option. The Australian bushfire crisis continues to lead international news coverage: Friends in the UK, where Australia has just launched a multimillion-dollar tourism campaign, said it led last night\u2019s news bulletins, ahead of New Year\u2019s Eve coverage. Meanwhile, in the New England north-west, residents in the small town of Manilla are coming together as a blockade to stop water being taken from their town to \u2018fill up Tamworth swimming pools\u2019. A deadly bushfire went through nearby Glen Innes in November. The Victorian emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, was just asked about resources for firefighters: I think what was demonstrated when these fires came through and when the change happened overnight on Monday, you will not stop these fires. What we talk about, when you start to get ratings into the extreme area, fires are fast moving, uncontrollable, unpredictable. You won\u2019t put them out. That\u2019s a fact. That is why in the lead-up to Monday, that\u2019s why we were putting out that messaging. We drew a line on a map. We said that people were in danger and we wanted people to be out of that particular area. So you are not going to put those fires out, not going to put the fires out now. It was nature which started the fires and it will be nature that stops these fires. And in Moruya: Power has been out at Ulladulla on the NSW south coast. Residents are being urged not to \u2018panic buy\u2019 and just get what they need, with authorities reassuring people they will not run out of food. Scott Morrison is at Kirribilli. He is hosting the New Year\u2019s Day Cricket Australia-The McGrath Foundation reception a little later today. The Sky News reporter Trudy McIntosh is on the ground in Cobargo: The NSW education minister has confirmed Cobargo and Quaama public schools have been destroyed by the south coast fires. That follows the loss of the Clifton Creek primary school in the East Gippsland fires yesterday. And for an idea of some of that \u2013 here is a satellite representation of what happened in eastern Victoria over the last few days: So there you have it \u2013 a unique and complex set of circumstances in Victoria \u2013 people isolated in the middle of fire grounds, people displaced by the fire and unable to return to their communities, and existing fires joining up to create bigger fires. Firefighters being brought in by air. Five Australian states have been impacted by this fire season. It\u2019s not like the previous fire seasons that have scarred the landscape and the nation\u2019s consciousness \u2013 fast-moving fires that devastated one particular area \u2013 this is hitting everything at once. The emergency commissioner finishes with this: We\u2019ve got a huge team doing absolutely everything to keep everyone safe, from our firefighters and emergency services on the ground. You heard mention of the Red Cross, the Victorian Council of Churches, the government departments, the wonderful people working in the regional, state control centres \u2013 we\u2019re focused on keeping communities safe from existing and potential fires we might see, but also to support our communities that are now heavily impacted. And on the additional Australian Defence Force support, Andrew Crisp says: When we forecast what could have happened on Monday and Tuesday, we did some thinking and planning in relation if we had isolated communities. One of the requests we put to Emergency Management Australia and the ADF was about, if we had isolated communities on the coast, how will we get them out, if we don\u2019t have road access? One way would be by air, but as we know, smoke can be an issue and the other way would be by sea. As a result of that there\u2019s been a commitment from the Australian Defence Force to move naval assets towards Mallacoota. Similarly they\u2019re moving in some larger helicopters \u2013 two Black Hawks will arrive in East Sale this afternoon and a larger Taipan later today. Those two Black Hawks will be able to fly later today until 8.30 and then they rest. They give us additional capability. They\u2019re able to fly at night. Although not dropping water on fires at night, that will give us a great intelligence capability overnight. Along with that, there will be two of the large Chinooks, so the heavy-lift helicopters coming from Townsville, and they will be here on Friday. So a significant ADF contingent based in East Sale, supporting the efforts in this part of the state. We know we\u2019ve got a long way to go with this. On supplies and resources, Andrew Crisp says: So what we\u2019re doing in terms of assets, we\u2019ve moved some of our bigger helicopters and as you heard from the premier, we will use some of those helicopters for a shift change of firefighters in and out of Mallacoota today. We will also be using the helicopters to get into communities, so we can listen to what they need. We know, for example, with Mallacoota, we know they have a significant amount of water, but we know we need to get supplies to them. There was a police boat that came down from New South Wales yesterday. It brought in a small amount of water, but it was a nice touch to show we\u2019re all in this together. The Victoria police water police, a boat should have gone in taking 1.6 tonnes of water. Again, at about this time, we\u2019re loading up a large barge in Melbourne. It will have food and water and 30,000 litres of fuel. It will be making its way to Mallacoota. It will have supplies for about two weeks. Andrew Crisp: At this stage it looks like we have a fire danger rating of very high across the whole state. We might have some of the weather districts up to severe. Saturday is a significant day for us. It\u2019s about what we do to enable us to be in the best position we can to Saturday. If we get a run of new fires, we will find that they will be travelling down and they will join up with the East Gippsland fires. What we saw with the Mallacoota fire also, it took a run last night and there\u2019s a finger of that fire that\u2019s pushed over the border along the highway into New South Wales. So it is dynamic, there\u2019s a lot going on. We\u2019re focused on the fire. Our primary responsibility is to protect communities and to save lives. At the same time, seeing as we had such significant fires, equally important for us is the support we provide community. What we do in terms of supporting those isolated communities. So we\u2019re very, very focused on that. Andrew Crisp: Along with those structural losses up in that particular fire, we\u2019ve been made aware there\u2019s potentially significant stock losses and fencing and pasture and everything that goes with that. It\u2019s not just about houses, it\u2019s also about those parts of local business, of the agricultural sector, that are so important. That\u2019s their pasture. We\u2019ve got those fires up in the north-east. We\u2019ve got the going fires down here, in East Gippsland. What we\u2019ve seen over the last 24 hours is a significant number of lightning strikes up in the alpine regions, so Mount Hotham, Mount Bulla, into Jamieson. Across the state, the last time I looked, we had more than 45 fires going \u2013 a lot of the new fires in that part of the state. We are doing absolutely what we can to round as many up as quickly as we can. We\u2019re warming up into Friday and then what we term as spike days \u2013 Saturday is looking like a high-risk day for us again. The emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is now giving the nuts and bolts update of the fire situation on the ground: We have three months of hot weather to come. We do have a dynamic and a dangerous fire situation across the state. What we\u2019ve seen up to this point of time is more than 500,000 hectares burned in Victoria predominantly in the East Gippsland area. With the East Gippsland fires, we know that basically what we used to talk about as three fires have become one. You add that Mallacoota fire into the mix, and there\u2019s a significant amount of fire activity across all of East Gippsland. What we have up in the north-east of the state, what we\u2019re referring to as the Corryong fire\u2019s a fire that started on the other side of the border and then on that hot northerly, travelled down and impacted on an area where we believe we lost 10-15 structures and moved into Corryong and past there. Some great work to basically save the town of Corryong, and some additionally great work to open up that road quickly, that enabled a convoy of 68 vehicles to get people out of Corryong. Our concern\u2019s in the Corryong area, another fire started in NSW, further east. It\u2019s been travelling in a southerly direction. The Corryong fire is over 100,000 hectares, the other fire is about 98,000 hectares. There\u2019s the potential for them to come together today. Daniel Andrews says he wants to assure everyone he is in constant contact with Scott Morrison and the state and commonwealth are working well together. He said all levels of government have come together: I\u2019ve been in contact with mayors in the three local government areas affected by the fires, offering to them any and all support they need. This now and in the weeks and months ahead. This is still very dangerous, it is changing ever, it is complex. I know everyone wants it to be simple. We do, too. It is not. This is a complex set of fires and the coming days and week will also be very challenging. Daniel Andrews gives some examples of how firefighters are having to work differently, because of the complex set of circumstances: This will be an active fire and a very challenging and complex environment for weeks and therefore we have to do things differently. For instance, today, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever done this before, using Victorian assets, we\u2019ve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can\u2019t be removed any other way \u2013 we\u2019re essentially doing a shift change by the air. We\u2019ve never done that before, getting firefighters that are essentially isolated in that Mallacoota community out and fresh teams going in. That\u2019s not something we\u2019ve done before, it\u2019s one example of how complex and how challenging these East Gippsland fires are now and will be for a considerable period of time. Daniel Andrews: The first point I want to make is that this is a particularly unique set of circumstances. We\u2019ve got people that are isolated in the middle of the fire, we\u2019ve got people who have left and can\u2019t get back in. We\u2019ve got fires that are not out. We have got some very significant weather coming our way on Friday and Saturday. That makes this a long and dangerous and complex fight, a long and dangerous process to support everyone who\u2019s been impacted by it. I want to thank the community and thank everybody who\u2019s been touched by these fires for the patience they\u2019ve shown, for the way they look out for, for the fact they understand this is not like other bushfires where we had fires move through a devastated community, the fire is out and then you begin the next process of recovery and rebuilding. This is very different to that. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is holding his press conference. I\u2019ll bring you most of what he has to say. Canberra\u2019s air quality remains hazardous. For those needing updates, you can follow the rating here. AAP has written up the latest Victorian fire advice: Five emergency alerts have been downgraded in Victoria\u2019s fire-ravaged East Gippsland, but a significant risk remains with forecast worsening conditions. The warning for Buchan, Bruthen, Ensay, Cann Valley and Mallacoota moved to a watch-and-act alert on Wednesday morning, while the fire in the Upper Snowy area was recategorised to an advice alert. \u201cThe cooler weather has slowed the movement of fire however the fire is still active (with) a risk of spot fires and embers,\u201d the alert for Buchan, Gelantipy, Suggan Buggan, Timbarra, W Tree, Wulgulmerang reads. \u201cThe weather predicted for Saturday could result in significant fire movement.\u201d In what is becoming an all too frequent announcement, bushfire assistance has now been extended to the local government areas of East Gippsland and Towong. From David Littleproud\u2019s office: Households in the local government areas of East Gippsland and Towong can now access the following emergency payments to relieve personal hardship: Emergency Relief Assistance Payments, which provide payments of up to $560 per adult and $280 per child (up to a maximum of $1,960 per eligible household) are available to help meet immediate needs, including emergency food, shelter, clothing and personal items. Emergency Re-establishment Payments provide up to $42,250 per eligible household experiencing financial hardship, who have been affected by fire at their primary place of residence. The grants will be available for clean-up, emergency accommodation, repairs, rebuilding (a principal place of residence), and replacing some damaged contents.The funding arrangements will allow for state government agencies and the East Gippsland and Towong councils to apply for funding to help cover the restoration of essential public assets such as roads and public hospitals. Households should contact their local council, or visit a relief centre, to discuss assistance options. The Gilmore MP Fiona Phillips just had a chat to the ABC about what has happened in her part of the south coast of NSW: Yeah, look, absolutely devastating destruction on properties there. We know that there is literally hundreds of properties that have been impacted. We know around Batemans Bay, significant damage at the back of the Batemans Bay industrial area, and obviously Mogo, as people have said to me, is almost unrecognisable. We know that the fire has impacted right along the coast. We\u2019ve got so many beautiful coastal villages. We don\u2019t know the full extent of the property damage. We know that there are building impact assessment teams out there now, both in that area and in the Shoalhaven. This fire is so big now that it\u2019s broken up into two different emergency centres. It is massive. There has been devastating impact for people. But I just want to say that our community has been fantastic in supporting our volunteer firefighters and all our emergency services workers and volunteers. A very big thank you to Luke for all his work this morning. You\u2019ve got Amy Remeikis covering the blog now. We are standing by waiting for the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, to update us. This is a heartbreaking interview with a man who has lost almost everything at Mallacoota. Here is a statement from NSW police confirming the tragic news that a body has been found at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola. It takes the death toll this week to four following the deaths of two men at Cobargo and a volunteer firefighter near Albury. Police have confirmed a third man has died in bushfires impacting the state\u2019s south coast. About 7.30am today (Wednesday 1 January 2020), officers from South Coast Police District were informed the body of a man had been located in a burnt-out car on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah, about 6km west of Lake Conjola. The man has not been formally identified. A report will be prepared for the information of the coroner. Meanwhile, a 72-year-old man remains unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north west of Cobargo. As the bushfire emergency continues, people are urged to obey direction of emergency services and to monitor the Rural Fire Service NSW website www.rfs.gov.au and www.livetraffic.com for road closures. Emergency services are also reminding the community not to contact Triple Zero (000) unless there is an emergency. If you are concerned about a loved one in a bushfire impacted area, visit https://register.redcross.org.au. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or https://nsw.crimestoppers.com.au. Information is treated in strict confidence. The public is reminded not to report crime via NSW police social media pages. At least three people have died in NSW, while another person remains unaccounted for in that state. In addition, Nine News reported in the past 10 minutes that a body had been found west of Conjola. Authorities in Victoria hold grave fears for four people after fires tore through large swathes of East Gippsland yesterday. The two men killed in fires at Cobargo yesterday have been named as Patrick Salway and his father, Robert Salway. It\u2019s expected hundreds of homes have been destroyed on the NSW south coast, though the RFS says it is still conducting assessments. The ABC reported 50 properties lost in the town of Conjola Park. Victorian authorities say about 50 properties have been lost across Buchan, Sarsfield and Mallacoota, but that figure is expected to rise. More than 100 fires are burning in NSW, but conditions have eased and all fires have been downgraded to watch and act level. Three fires are burning at emergency level in Victoria as dozens burn across the east and north-east. Firefighters in NSW are using the improved conditions to contain existing fires and prepare for Saturday, which is tipped to rival yesterday\u2019s fire danger levels. Towns across the NSW south coast are still without power. We\u2019re waiting for further confirmation on this. The ABC has spoken to the Labor MP Mike Kelly, who says he\u2019s been briefed by the RFS and has been told at least 200 homes have been destroyed on the NSW south coast. Fiona Phillips, a local Liberal MP, says hundreds of buildings across Batemans Bay and Mogo are also gone. The ABC quizzed a local RFS official about these figures about 15 minutes ago, but he said authorities were still conducting assessments. Great work from this firefighter. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has issued a statement describing the bushfire crisis as a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d for Scott Morrison. I\u2019m going to reproduce parts of it below for you, but the key point is that the Greens want a royal commission into the bushfire crisis. Di Natale said: \u201cOur hearts go out to those who have lost their lives and property in this latest tragedy and for the huge ecological damage and loss of native and domestic animals.\u201d He said Scott Morrison should \u201cimmediately convene an emergency summit, as proposed by former fire chief Mullins, to ensure that everything is being done to address the immediate crisis\u201d. But he also said: \u201cWe must also accept that Australia\u2019s climate has changed and we need to make sure that our land management, disaster response and climate policies are relevant to the new reality we face.\u201d That is why the Greens are calling on the prime minister to immediately declare a royal commission into the bushfire crisis. If he refuses to do so, we will be moving for a parliamentary commission of inquiry with royal commission-like powers as soon as parliament returns. While we need a national response to the bushfire crisis, any process that does not have at its heart a commitment to phase out fossil fuels like coal and rapidly transition to a renewable energy economy is doomed to fail from the start. A new figure for you: the fires in East Gippsland have burned through 500,000ha. The Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, told ABC News earlier today: The fire threat in our state has increased overnight. There were some more thunderstorms come through with dry lightning and we have a number of new fires in Mount Hotham, King Valley and we have 45 going fires in the east of the state. There was some debate about the fireworks being in Sydney last night. I wonder if there might be some controversy about this, too. In New Zealand, meanwhile, people have been sharing photos showing how the smoke and haze from the Australian fires has reached Aotearoa. However, the town of Mallacoota will remain cut off. You\u2019ll remember about 4,000 people were taking shelter on the beach yesterday as fires tore through the area. Police say they will be taking a boat with four paramedics and water into the town. Later, there will be a larger barge that will bring food, fuel and other supplies to the residents who remain hunkered down there. The Australian Defence Force will also arrive later with Black Hawk helicopters to drop off supplies. Some good news from Victoria. The Princes Highway is going to be reopened for a few hours (10am-12pm) between Orbost and Bairnsdale. On the ABC, Victorian man Myles Nicholls is speaking from the ruins of his house at Sarsfield, which was razed in the East Gippsland fires. \u201cThe house doesn\u2019t come above my ankles,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is totally destroyed.\u201d Nicholls runs a short-stay accommodation business and native flower farm from his 55-acre (22-hectare) property. \u201cBut everything is gone. It\u2019s literally just gone. It will take us some time to re-establish it.\u201d He says it will take three to five years to re-establish the native flowers. Guardian Australia photographer Mike Bowers has been on the road as the fires have ravaged New South Wales. Last night he snapped this beautiful shot south of Nowra as the Currowan fire approached. That fire, which is 229,000ha, is currently at a watch and act. Air quality in Canberra is reportedly now the worst in the world. And there is some more dramatic footage here. If you scroll through this Instagram post you will see some incredible footage shot by Goongerah resident India MacDonell using a GoPro. She fought to save her family home with her father as a terrifying inferno closed in on them. The MacDonells are safe, but their property is currently isolated. The two men killed in fires at Cobargo yesterday have been named as Patrick Salway and his dad, Robert Salway. \u201cWe are broken,\u201d Renee Salway told friends via Facebook on Tuesday night after her husband\u2019s death was confirmed. \u201cI will see you again Patrick, my best friend.\u201d Police have also also been unable to reach the property of a 72-year-old man who is missing 50km north of Cobargo. If you\u2019re affected by the bushfires, we\u2019d like to hear from you. You can share your stories, pictures and videos directly with our journalists via our form here. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian. Though we\u2019d like to hear from you, your security is most important.

Shane Fitzsimmons confirms that Conjola Park has been \u201cheavily impacted\u201d by the fires. The ABC reported that about 50 properties have been destroyed. Fitzsimmons does not put a figure on it, but says \u201cinitial reports are that it\u2019s had heavy impact and there are significant damage and destruction to property\u201d. The deputy police commissioner, Gary Worboys, provides some important information for people in fire-affected areas. The Public Information and Inquiry Line in NSW is 1800-227-228. It\u2019s for people looking for about where they should go or what they should do. \u201cWe would ask people to use it only when they need to.\u201d He also points people to the Register. Find. Reunite website. It is a Red Cross initiative that allows people to put details in there of themselves and those people they have concerns about. Fitzsimmons says efforts are focused on shoring up as \u201cmuch protection and as much consolidation as we can ahead of deteriorating weather conditions expected on Saturday\u201d. The worst of the conditions will be concentrated along the ranges and the south-east corner of NSW. The NSW rural fire service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, says more than 3,000 people were deployed to the fires yesterday. We are aware of heavy tolls in terms of damage and destruction, particularly up in the South Nowra area, and places to the east of the fire burning in South Nowra, but also the very significant activity on the bottom end of the Currowan fire, the Clyde Mountain fire, that burned down into Batemans Bay. A heavy toll has been occasioned as a result of that very fast moving fire front. The Badja fire has inflicted heavy damage throughout towns including Cobargo, Fitzsimmons says. Not only are we seeing outbuildings and homes but we\u2019re seeing considerable community infrastructure. We\u2019re looking at businesses, halls, there\u2019s reports of a number of schools, two or three schools that have been heavily impacted as a result of these fires. Berejiklian warns that the community should brace for worsening conditions on the weekend: \u201cWeather conditions on Saturday will be as bad as they were yesterday.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is speaking at a press conference right now. She describes yesterday as a \u201chorrible day\u201d. Crews are working on containing the existing fires as they make the most of improved conditions, she says. Authorities are also working on restoring power to communities on the south coast and clearing roads. Crisp also provided some information on homes lost in East Gippsland. That included: 24 structures in Buchan, 19 in Sarsfield and more than 10 in Mallacoota. The Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, spoke on the ABC earlier this morning. He confirmed that four people remain unaccounted for in Victoria. Those appears to be the same people that the premier, Daniel Andrews, said authorities held grave fears for yesterday. Crisp said he was still unable to provide more details. In some good news, Crisp said there were no reported lives lost in Mallacoota, where thousands were forced to take shelter on the beach yesterday. The ABC is reporting that 50 properties and structures have been destroyed in Conjola Park on the NSW south coast. The properties were lost when the Currowan fire tore through the town, which is south of Nowra. The town is among those that remains without power this morning. More than 100 fires were still burning across NSW at midnight, while in Victoria there were dozens of blazes alight in the East Gippsland region. In Victoria, there are seven fires still burning at emergency level, but all fires in NSW have been downgraded to watch and act. Good morning. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining us and happy new year to you. Yesterday was a day of destruction as fires throughout Victoria and New South Wales claimed two lives and razed homes in East Gippsland and the southern coast. Four people remain unaccounted for in Victoria. More residents will be returning to their communities today while the defence force will also be involved in the expanding recovery effort. We\u2019ll be with you throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "Nine people are confirmed dead, with four still missing, and more than 200 properties have been lost since Christmas Day in Australia\u2019s catastrophic bushfires. Smoke still hung thick over the south-east of the country on Wednesday evening, even as weather conditions offered a reprieve to take stock of the destruction. On Wednesday afternoon, authorities in New South Wales and Victoria said another five people were confirmed dead, and another man presumed dead. They warned the death toll was likely to continue to rise. At Malua Bay, on the NSW south coast, survivors spoke of how 1,000 people spent the night on the beach in a bid to seek shelter from the flames. \u201cEveryone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke,\u201d Al Baxter, the former Wallaby, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere was a strange calmness. People were as close to the water\u2019s edge as they could [be]. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash. In Victoria, Mick Roberts from Buchan in the East Gippsland region had been unaccounted for since Monday. He was found dead in his home on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s not missing any more ... sorry but his body has been found in his house,\u201d Roberts\u2019s niece Leah Parsons said on social media. \u201cVery sad day for us to (start) the year but we\u2019re a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick,\u201d she wrote. In NSW, police have now confirmed deaths at Lake Conjola, Yatte Yattah, Sussex Inlet and Coolagolite. Authorities been unable to reach a property at Belowra in NSW where a 72-year-old man is presumed dead. As relatively calm conditions set in on Wednesday, the sheer scale of the fire emergency was laid bare. People returned to find their homes damaged or destroyed. Thick smoke was visible more than 2,000km away, on the south island of New Zealand. Authorities confirmed 176 homes have been lost on the NSW south coast; 89 in Conjola Park, 40 at Malua Bay and 15 in Rosedale. Another 50 properties have been destroyed in Victoria since Sunday. It is expected the final figures may be much higher. The small inland communities of Cobargo, Quaama and Mogo in NSW were severely affected by the fires. While most of the destruction occurred on Tuesday, the ferocity of the fires meant many people were unable to find out basic information until New Year\u2019s Day. Electricity and communications lines were cut for extended periods in many areas. Roads in and out of towns remain closed. The disaster has brought out stories of community and efforts to battle on in the face of unprecedented adversity in Victoria and NSW. In Bairnsdale, donations flooded in for those who had lost everything, who even then were reluctant to accept help. \u201cWe had a couple with three kids here, and he [the father] started crying,\u201d said helper Wendy McPhan. \u201cI said, \u2018here\u2019s a $300 voucher for Woolies,\u2019 and he said \u2018no, I can\u2019t take that, there\u2019s people worse off.\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018Mate, you have lost everything. You have lost your house. There is no one worse off.\u2019\u201d Many people are now concerned they might not be able to escape affected areas for days; a fear compounded by forecasts that the calm weather on Wednesday is but a brief reprieve. Forecasters predict very hot and windy conditions for South Australia on Friday and dangerous bushfire conditions for eastern Victoria and New South Wales on Saturday, with temperatures again set to reach into the mid-40s. \u201cWe are assuming that on Saturday weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,\u201d the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said. \u201cThat is something all of us have to brace ourselves for.\u201d The likelihood of extreme conditions returning has added to the urgency to assist people who remain hemmed in by closed roads and uncontrolled firegrounds. The Australian Defence Force has been deployed to attempt to evacuate residents from isolated communities by air or sea, and drop off supplies. A ship with supplies for two weeks \u2013 1.6 tonnes of water, food, and 30,000 litres of fuel \u2013 has already left Melbourne. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews, on a visit to Bairnsdale on Wednesday, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever done this before \u2026 we\u2019ve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can\u2019t be removed any other way \u2013 we\u2019re essentially doing a shift change by the air.\u201d The three major fires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region now cover about 500,000 hectares and have \u201cessentially combined into one\u201d, state emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp said.

Crisp said it would not be possible to put out those fires before the weather worsened. \u201cIt was nature which started the fires and it will be nature that stops these fires,\u201d he said. On Wednesday afternoon two fires burning on Kangaroo Island in South Australia merged, and firefighters have warned it could burn for weeks. Forecast northerly winds could push the fire towards the Flinders Chase national park. Since the start of July, 15 people have been killed by the bushfires and more than 1,000 homes lost. Firefighter Sam McPaul, 28, died when his fire truck was overturned by extreme winds east of Albury on Monday. Father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway, were found dead inside their house in Cobargo on Tuesday. The nature and scale of this bushfire season in Australia is unprecedented. Scientists have cited the lack of moisture in the landscape \u2013 following years of drought \u2013 as a key reason the fires have been so severe. Intense heat, dry conditions and strong winds have created conditions where the fire risk is considered extreme or catastrophic. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, at a reception for the Australian and New Zealand cricket sides at Kirribilli House, acknowledged the fires were \u201ca time of great challenge for Australia\u201d. Morrison reiterated comments from a New Year comment piece that focused on the resilience of communities and deflected debate about the underlying cause of the fires. \u201cWhether they\u2019re started by lightning storms or whatever the cause may be, our firefighters and all of those who have come behind them to support them, whether they\u2019re volunteering in the front line or behind the scenes in a great volunteer effort, it is something that will happen against the backdrop of this Test match. \u201cBut at the same time, Australians will be gathering, whether it\u2019s at the SCG [Sydney cricket ground] or around television sets all around the country, and they\u2019ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they\u2019ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians and the way that people have gone about remembering the terrible things that other Australians are dealing with at the moment.\u201d",

Following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and a rise in renewable and low-carbon energy, 2019 was the cleanest year for electrical energy on record for Britain, according to National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and also runs the Scottish networks. National Grid\u2019s latest data shows that wind farms, solar and nuclear energy, alongside energy imported by subsea cables, delivered 48.5% of Britain\u2019s electricity in 2019. This compares to 43% generated by fossil fuels \u2013 coal, gas, and other carbon sources such as oil and diesel. The remaining 8.5% was generated by biomass, such as wood pellets.

By the end of this winter, the UK will be left with only four coal fired power plants. EDF Energy\u2019s Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire closed this year and two other coal plants, RWE\u2019s Aberthaw B and SSE\u2019s Fiddler\u2019s Ferry, are due to close in March 2020.

Since then, wind power reached fresh highs during blustery weather in early December to generate almost 45% of the UK\u2019s electricity on one day. In December, National Grid unveiled plans to invest almost \u00a310bn in the UK\u2019s gas and electricity networks over the next five years. Of this, almost \u00a31bn has been earmarked for the transition to a net zero carbon electricity system by 2025, including investments in new equipment and technology. A further \u00a385m will support changes to the ways people heat their homes, switching away from gas boilers to technologies such as electric heat pumps and hydrogen boilers. National Grid estimates that more than 23 million homes will need to install new low-carbon heating solutions by 2050. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to make clear, for avoidance of doubt, that various references to energy and power meant electricity only.",

At the battles of Naseby, Marston Moor and the \u201ccrowing mercy\u201d of Worcester, God blew and the royalists were scattered. Providence justified the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords, just as it explained Cromwell\u2019s clean sheet of victories. After his seemingly miraculous defeat of the Scots at Dunbar in 1650, he was seen laughing excessively \u201cas if he had been drunk; his eyes sparkled with spirits\u201d.</p> <p>Others thought he was high on hubris. In December 1653, having forcibly dissolved two parliaments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jan/04/features11.g26\" title=\"\">Cromwell accepted the title of Lord Protector</a>, which was written into a constitution known as the Instrument of Government. It was resisted by the first protectorate parliament and so, in a constitutional contortion that might make even today\u2019s politicians blush, Cromwell dissolved parliament by counting its minimum period in lunar months, rather than the conventional, longer, calendar months. \u201cI speak for God and not for men,\u201d he told MPs. He was beginning to sound a lot like Charles I.</p> <p>Cromwell\u2019s fundamental goal was liberty of conscience, but his challenge was to keep his army standing, deliver strong and stable government (\u201chealing and settling\u201d) and shape the people into a nation worthy of Christ\u2019s imminent return. In that great gross line, he described the English as \u201cunder circumcision, but raw\u201d. Above all, he strained to hear God\u2019s voice once the guns had fallen silent.</p> <p>The answer, he decided, was global. He would take God\u2019s fight back to the Caribbean, seize the island of Hispaniola, avenge the loss of Providence and return with enough bullion to pay the army. The expedition commander was so buoyed by the venture that it doubled as his honeymoon. He returned to Portsmouth \u201calmost a skeleton\u201d and was dispatched to the Tower of London. The \u201cWestern Design\u201d was an abject failure. The subsequent conquest of Jamaica was a face-saving afterthought and, it would turn out, the inversion of liberty.</p> <p>In that crucial year, 1655, Cromwell also suppressed an ineffectual royalist rebellion. Spurred by John Lambert, the hero of Dunbar, he surmised that God would be placated by a clampdown on security and sin. England was divided into military districts. Former royalists had to register their movements and pay for the privilege in the form of a decimation tax. Vagrants were apprehended. Meetings at racecourses and bear-baiting rings, where conspiracies might fester, were dispersed. War was waged on fornication, drunkenness and gambling: \u201cwars unwinnable\u201d, Lay notes. In Altham, Lancashire, 200 unlicensed alehouses were closed within three months of the arrival of Major-General Worsley, a fundamentalist who drove himself to death in his maniacal pursuit of vice. The major generals lacked the resources to effect a moral reformation and were soon rejected by the electorate. It was, nevertheless, a dystopian time and not forgotten: \u201cNo man in uniform has ruled Britain since Cromwell,\u201d Lay points out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98a7ed65eca510ed96cba92de81ce7f50e0ec1b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98a7ed65eca510ed96cba92de81ce7f50e0ec1b6/0_0_2764_3241/853.jpg\" alt=\"Charles II by John Michael Wright.\" width=\"853\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Charles II</em> by John Michael Wright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dea Picture Library/De Agostini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Providence Lost</em> is a learned, lucid, wry and compelling narrative of the 1650s as well as a sensitive portrayal of a man unravelled by providence. Lay\u2019s Cromwell is dithering and ambiguous, too slippery to pin down, but almost likable, almost true. He welcomed Jews back to England, even if he aimed to convert them to Christianity (Sigmund Freud named his son Oliver). He regretted, on a personal and procedural level, the Commons\u2019 retrospective judgment of James Nayler, a priapic, lank haired Quaker with messianic pretensions, who was branded for blasphemy and whipped until his back was a sheet of raw flesh. (One MP even mooted the obscure Roman punishment of stitching him into a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper and an ape, and tossing him into the river.)</p> <p>As Cromwell settled into his reign \u2013 an accurate enough word \u2013 he displayed shades of hypocrisy. \u201cLascivious\u201d songs and stage plays were forbidden, but the elite could enjoy dancing and the first English opera. Cromwell dipped into Charles I\u2019s art collection and had a room at Hampton Court draped in sinful tapestries. And yet: when, in the wake of a royalist-leveller gunpowder plot in 1657, the issue of the succession led to parliament offering Cromwell the crown, he turned it down: \u201cI would not seek to set up that which providence hath destroyed.\u201d </p> <p>On Cromwell\u2019s death in 1658, the Protectorate passed to his son Richard, who had that rare gift in politics of realising when he was not up to the job. He did not resist when army radicals ousted him in May 1659. The following year, having lost any semblance of order or legitimacy, they too were gone. The Protectorate was too out of touch, too reliant on the sword and far too expensive to be missed. Its failure ensured that whichever randy prince might come along, monarchy would endure.</p> <p>Two contemporary works capture the contrasting tempers of the time. The Anglican Izaak Walton\u2019s <em>The Compleat Angler</em> is a fishing manual that rejoices in the beauty and bounty of the land. It reflects still waters and a contented patience beyond the ken of Puritanism. Lay doesn\u2019t discuss John Milton\u2019s <em>Paradise Lost</em>, but the title and its themes of tyranny and failed revolution shadow every page of his book. Milton gave his life to the Puritan cause and was crushed by its betrayal, but even when he went blind, he did not lose sight of liberty, or God. <em>Paradise Lost</em> closes with Adam and Eve wiping their tears and venturing out of Eden with \u201cprovidence their guide\u201d. It is an epic, eloquent scream into the cataclysm and a testament to the intellectual ferment of the republic, but it is the quiet little fishing book that has been reprinted more often.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Providence Lost: The Rise and Fall of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Protectorate is published by Head of Zeus (RRP \u00a330).

Cromwell\u2019s fundamental goal was liberty of conscience, but his challenge was to keep his army standing, deliver strong and stable government (\u201chealing and settling\u201d) and shape the people into a nation worthy of Christ\u2019s imminent return. In that great gross line, he described the English as \u201cunder circumcision, but raw\u201d. Above all, he strained to hear God\u2019s voice once the guns had fallen silent. The answer, he decided, was global. He would take God\u2019s fight back to the Caribbean, seize the island of Hispaniola, avenge the loss of Providence and return with enough bullion to pay the army. The expedition commander was so buoyed by the venture that it doubled as his honeymoon. He returned to Portsmouth \u201calmost a skeleton\u201d and was dispatched to the Tower of London. The \u201cWestern Design\u201d was an abject failure. The subsequent conquest of Jamaica was a face-saving afterthought and, it would turn out, the inversion of liberty. In that crucial year, 1655, Cromwell also suppressed an ineffectual royalist rebellion. Spurred by John Lambert, the hero of Dunbar, he surmised that God would be placated by a clampdown on security and sin. England was divided into military districts. Former royalists had to register their movements and pay for the privilege in the form of a decimation tax. Vagrants were apprehended. Meetings at racecourses and bear-baiting rings, where conspiracies might fester, were dispersed. War was waged on fornication, drunkenness and gambling: \u201cwars unwinnable\u201d, Lay notes. In Altham, Lancashire, 200 unlicensed alehouses were closed within three months of the arrival of Major-General Worsley, a fundamentalist who drove himself to death in his maniacal pursuit of vice. The major generals lacked the resources to effect a moral reformation and were soon rejected by the electorate. It was, nevertheless, a dystopian time and not forgotten: \u201cNo man in uniform has ruled Britain since Cromwell,\u201d Lay points out. Providence Lost is a learned, lucid, wry and compelling narrative of the 1650s as well as a sensitive portrayal of a man unravelled by providence. Lay\u2019s Cromwell is dithering and ambiguous, too slippery to pin down, but almost likable, almost true. He welcomed Jews back to England, even if he aimed to convert them to Christianity (Sigmund Freud named his son Oliver). He regretted, on a personal and procedural level, the Commons\u2019 retrospective judgment of James Nayler, a priapic, lank haired Quaker with messianic pretensions, who was branded for blasphemy and whipped until his back was a sheet of raw flesh. (One MP even mooted the obscure Roman punishment of stitching him into a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper and an ape, and tossing him into the river.) As Cromwell settled into his reign \u2013 an accurate enough word \u2013 he displayed shades of hypocrisy. \u201cLascivious\u201d songs and stage plays were forbidden, but the elite could enjoy dancing and the first English opera. Cromwell dipped into Charles I\u2019s art collection and had a room at Hampton Court draped in sinful tapestries. And yet: when, in the wake of a royalist-leveller gunpowder plot in 1657, the issue of the succession led to parliament offering Cromwell the crown, he turned it down: \u201cI would not seek to set up that which providence hath destroyed.\u201d On Cromwell\u2019s death in 1658, the Protectorate passed to his son Richard, who had that rare gift in politics of realising when he was not up to the job. He did not resist when army radicals ousted him in May 1659. The following year, having lost any semblance of order or legitimacy, they too were gone. The Protectorate was too out of touch, too reliant on the sword and far too expensive to be missed. Its failure ensured that whichever randy prince might come along, monarchy would endure. Two contemporary works capture the contrasting tempers of the time. The Anglican Izaak Walton\u2019s The Compleat Angler is a fishing manual that rejoices in the beauty and bounty of the land. It reflects still waters and a contented patience beyond the ken of Puritanism. Lay doesn\u2019t discuss John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, but the title and its themes of tyranny and failed revolution shadow every page of his book. Milton gave his life to the Puritan cause and was crushed by its betrayal, but even when he went blind, he did not lose sight of liberty, or God. Paradise Lost closes with Adam and Eve wiping their tears and venturing out of Eden with \u201cprovidence their guide\u201d. It is an epic, eloquent scream into the cataclysm and a testament to the intellectual ferment of the republic, but it is the quiet little fishing book that has been reprinted more often. \u2022 Providence Lost: The Rise and Fall of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Protectorate is published by Head of Zeus (RRP \u00a330).

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>London mayor Sadiq Khan has promised tonight\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations will feature the \u201cbest fireworks London has ever seen\u201d in a statement that verged on the political and which will annoy his Brexiteer detractors.</p> \n  <p>The capital will \u201cproject confidence\u201d on the world stage through the impressive display, Khan said. \u201cHand on heart, these are going to be the best fireworks London has ever seen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The mayor, a key opponent of Brexit, added that the \u201cworld\u201d will be watching the display and he hoped it would show London was a \u201cglobal city\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cFairly or unfairly, people around the world saw the Brexit referendum vote as the UK somehow turning its back on the rest of the world, including Europe.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe fear was, we would become insular, inward-looking, and what I\u2019m keen to show is the opposite.</p> \n  <p>\u201cYes we may be leaving the EU, but very much as a city we are still a European global city. We will continue to be open to people\u2019s trade and ideas.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat tonight\u2019s fireworks are about is demonstrating our confidence.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s really important that we show the world who will be watching our fireworks that we are a confident, global, outward-looking European city.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The theme of this year\u2019s display will look ahead to the

homes curtailed</a> by the official celebrations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/30/edinburgh-blames-hogmanay-organiser-curfew-underbelly\">This seems to have been resolved</a> but has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many worried about the over-commercialisation of Hogmanay.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s report on the evening so far in the Scottish capital:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39995797e21dba1bb03b9d783080c6fe337688b5\"> \n   <img

party.</p> \n  <p>The streets of Edinburgh are filling up as Hogmanay revellers prepare to welcome in the start of a new decade and enjoy the UK\u2019s biggest street party.</p> \n  <p>Performances from Idlewild, Rudimental and Marc Almond will take place on stages throughout the city centre, while DJ Mark Ronson will usher in the new year, creating a new soundtrack ahead of the clock striking 12.</p> \n  <p>Approximately 100,000 visitors are expected to attend the event, according to organisers who billed the Hogmanay celebrations as the UK\u2019s biggest New Year\u2019s Eve street

main throughfare Princes Street and its adjacent gardens, while ceilidhs danced their way into the night in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle.</p> \n  <p>There had been criticism of the event\u2019s organisation, amid uncertainty around how many passes residents were allowed, with Underbelly \u2013 which also runs the Edinburgh Festival Fringe \u2013 accused of creating \u201cunnecessary confusion\u201d by the council leader.</p> \n  <p>The festivities began in the city on Monday as around 40,000 people joined a torchlit procession which culminated in them forming the shape of two humans reaching out a \u201chand of friendship\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Leading the parade down the Royal Mile and into Holyrood Park was a 40-strong cast from Celtic Fire Theatre company PyroCeltica.</p> \n

<h2>London</h2> \n  <p>Londoners were making their way to the banks of the River Thames to jostle for position to watch a spectacular fireworks display launched from the London Eye and of barges near Parliament.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c0d17eedd52ea3c964e1641cb3170f692fb4dbc\"> \n   <img

but said the arrests were not related to the celebrations.<br><br></p> \n  <h2>South Africa</h2> \n  <p>Thousands gathered at Cape Town\u2019s Waterfront area to ring in the new year with music, dancing and fireworks in front of the city\u2019s iconic Table Mountain.</p> \n  <p>In past years, residents of Johannesburg\u2019s Hillbrow neighbourhood would celebrate the new year by tossing furniture, appliances and even refrigerators from the balconies of high-rise apartment buildings. Police have issued stern warnings and it appears the curious tradition has declined.</p> \n  <h2>Rome</h2> \n  <p>Pope Francis took a stroll in St Peter\u2019s Square on Tuesday night to admire the Nativity scene. Shouts of \u201cPope! Pope!\u201d and \u201cHappy new year!\u201d resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1e36f35488882f36145a902d0468f22221ccbc5\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1e36f35488882f36145a902d0468f22221ccbc5/0_21_2350_1411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pope Francis visits the nativity scene in Saint Peter\u2019s Square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pope Francis visits the nativity scene in Saint Peter\u2019s Square.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>One woman grabbed the pope\u2019s hand and pulled him toward her to shake it.

Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, January 1 marks Reiwa\u2019s first new year\u2019s day, the most important holiday in Japan.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4104827a50d5775f2da93652a758f652b9772b0e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4104827a50d5775f2da93652a758f652b9772b0e/0_103_5111_3068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese priestesses prepare for new year prayers at Kanda Myojin Shrine in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese priestesses prepare for new year prayers at Kanda Myojin Shrine in Tokyo.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Stalls at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo sold sweet rice wine, fried noodles and candied apples, as well as little amulets in the shape of mice, the zodiac animal for 2020.

      "bodyText": "Having mentioned how much confetti was strewn around Times Square, it seems only fair to recap some of the other celebrations around the world in numbers. In Rio, around 3 million people welcomed 2020 at the famous Copacabana beach where 15 tonnes of colorful fireworks were set off for nearly 15 minutes after midnight. In Paris, large crowds gathered to watch a light show at the Arc de Triomphe followed by a fireworks display at midnight. But the interesting number in the French capital was that Tuesday marked the 27th consecutive day of transport strikes against president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans to overhaul the French pension system. All metro lines in the French capital were closed except for two automatic lines, and only a few night buses were running. The world\u2019s tallest building, Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, was lit up by a spectacular firework display. All 828 metres (2,716feet). It\u2019s now 2020 in another chunk of the USA, with Central Time now well past midnight. They\u2019re having a party in Nashville where Stevie Nicks and Keith Urban have been performing Secondhand News together. Jason Isbell, one of Music City\u2019s finest, has been up there too. Not everyone is enjoying it though, with some on Twitter appearing to call for the CNN event to be moved back to New Orleans where presenters Don Lemon and Brooke Baldwin have been based in previous years. About 1,360kg (3,000lb) of confetti has been showered on Times Square tonight where revellers also had to contend with some rain earlier in the evening. Headline act Post Malone had some difficulties as well when he fell off the stage and had to be hauled up by security staff. He seemed to recover his poise and see the funny side though. One member of the crowd, Mariemma Mejias, 48, told AP that she had flown to New York from Puerto Rico to join the party. \u201cIt was a dream, I wanted to do it so this year ... a lot of people helped me to get here so I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m thankful for that,\u201d she said. Here are some pics from the party. A little earlier, the Korea boyband BTS were one of the main acts in Times Square in what they\u2019re officially calling Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2020 (snappy title that). You might say that\u2019s proof that K-pop has conquered the world. Post Malone was the headline act just before midnight. First we had a cheesy version of Auld Lang Syne and now Frank Sinatra croons New York, New York to the delighted crowds... Joyous scenes in Times Square, New York as the clock hits midnight. It\u2019s already 2020 in South America where celebrations are well under way in cities such as Rio de Janeiro where fireworks have lit up Copacabana beach. In the Chilean capital of Santiago, people have combined anti-government protests with ringing in the new year in Plaza Italia. There have been weeks of protests in the city. There\u2019s about 75 minutes to go before the clock ticks past midnight in Times Square in New York and the celebrations are already in full swing with music from, inter alia, Alanis Morissette and Sam Hunt. There\u2019s also a big party going on in Los Angeles where there\u2019s music from Dua Lipa and Dand and Shay. And in case you missed it, Mariah Carey\u2019s Twitter account was hacked this New Year\u2019s Eve. The Guardian\u2019s Andre Wheeler writes: Carey\u2019s Twitter account shared numerous racist slurs and comments with the singer\u2019s 21.4 million followers on the platform. It\u2019s unclear who\u2019s behind the hack, and the pop star did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the tweets published on Tuesday afternoon were quickly deleted. Many verged on the nonsensical and appeared to troll the singer\u2019s fans. The hack comes at an interesting time. Carey has become a renewed focal point of pop culture in recent weeks, through her record-breaking achievements on the Billboard Chart. The singer\u2019s modern classic All I Want For Christmas hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time this month \u2013 25 years after its original release. And on Monday, Billboard announced Carey is projected to become the first artist to have number-one hits in four consecutive decades, when All I Want For Christmas tops the 4 January 2020 Hot 100 list. \u201cWhat\u2019s a decade?\u201d the singer jokingly tweeted after the news broke, when she was allegedly still in control of her account. Read Andre\u2019s full story here. Earlier this evening, Pope Francis delighted tourists and local residents in Rome when he took a stroll to admire the Nativity scene on St. Peter\u2019s Square. Shouts of \u201cPope! Pope!\u201d and \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks, the AP reports. One woman grabbed the pope\u2019s hand and pulled him toward her to shake it. Francis, 83, exclaimed and then struck the woman\u2019s hand twice to free his hand. At a New Year\u2019s Eve Vespers service in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Francis urged people to practice more solidarity and to \u201cbuild bridges, not walls.\u201d Security officers in New York were on high alert on Tuesday evening, as revelers arrived to celebrate the new year in Manhattan\u2019s Times Square. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said spectators should feel safe but encouraged them to remain vigilant and alert officers if they feel something is amiss. Law enforcers were monitoring the situation with more than 1,000 security cameras, police helicopters and drones. Several of the NYPD\u2019s drones are equipped with thermal-imaging and 3D-mapping capabilities and strong camera lenses that can greatly magnify a subject. Streets in and around Times Square were closed to car traffic hours before the ball drop and police cars and sand-filled sanitation trucks were positioned to stop vehicles from driving into the crowd. Preparations are in full swing in New York City\u2019s famous Times Square, where thousands are expected to gather to count down the final moments of 2019. The city has been on edge this week following a string of attacks during Hanukah, but Tuesday celebrations may offer some relief. The AP reports: A Chinese dance performance, punctuated with red and gold pyrotechnics, will usher in a host of stars at Times Squares six-hour New Years Eve extravaganza. The throng of revelers in the heart of Manhattan will get to see rap-pop star Post Malone, K-pop group BTS, country singer Sam Hunt and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette during the big street party. While giddiness will likely prevail at the televised event, some important global issues will be driven home, as well. High school science teachers and students, spotlighting efforts to combat climate change, will press the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to next year. Then comes the 3,000lb (1,360 kilograms) of confetti, accompanied by more pyrotechnics. The Associated Press reports from Paris: A joyful crowd of Parisians and tourists walked, biked and used scooters to reach the Champs-Elysees for the new year celebrations, in a city with almost no public transport amid massive strikes. Revelers converged at the famous avenue to watch a light show at the Arc de Triomphe, followed by a fireworks display at midnight. Paris police set up a security perimeter around the Champs-Elysees area with a ban on alcohol and traffic restrictions. All metro lines in the French capital were closed except for two automatic lines, and only a few night buses were running, as Tuesday marked the 27th consecutive day of transport strikes against President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans to overhaul the French pension system. Here\u2019s PA Media\u2019s report on the firework display on the banks of the River Thames in central London: Thousands of people lined the Thames as London kicked off the new decade to the roar of football anthems such as Three Lions with the festivities providing a prelude to the Euro 2020 football tournament. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had promised the display \u2013 which also featured music from Stormzy, Wiley and Bastille \u2013 would be the best the capital \u201chas ever seen\u201d. Big Ben rang out 12 times to mark the start of the new year despite the bell falling mostly silent in 2019 while renovation work is completed. London\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display was sold out, with about 100,000 revellers packed into the streets around Victoria Embankment. Around 2,000 fireworks set off during the display were fired from the London Eye, with the remainder coming from barges moored in a central location along the River Thames. The show celebrated London\u2019s role in hosting this summer\u2019s international football tournament, which will take place in countries across the continent rather than being hosted by a single nation \u2013 and will see the capital host more fixtures than any other city. Seven of the competition\u2019s matches are set to be played in the capital, with Wembley Stadium scheduled to host the final and semi-finals. \u201cFootball\u2019s coming home\u201d blared out as the Baddiel, Skinner and Lightning Seeds\u2019 favourite accompanied the spectacular show, followed by The White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army and classical hit Nessun Dorma. Speaking in the city centre ahead of the celebrations on Tuesday night, Mr Khan told the PA news agency the \u201cworld\u201d will be watching the display, and he hoped it would show London was a \u201cglobal city\u201d. He said: \u201cFairly or unfairly, people around the world saw the Brexit referendum vote as the UK somehow turning its back on the rest of the world, including Europe. \u201cThe fear was, we would become insular, inward-looking, and what I\u2019m keen to show is the opposite. \u201cYes we may be leaving the EU, but very much as a city we are still a European global city. We will continue to be open to people\u2019s trade and ideas. \u201cWhat tonight\u2019s fireworks are about is demonstrating our confidence. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important that we show the world who will be watching our fireworks that we are a confident, global, outward-looking European city.\u201d The archbishop of Canterbury will urge people to make personal connections with others in 2020 to create a new unity in a divided society. In his new year message, to be broadcast on BBC One at 1pm on Wednesday, Justin Welby will say: \u201cLet\u2019s go for a heroic new year\u2019s resolution. Let\u2019s resolve to reconnect. To reach out to just one person we don\u2019t know, or from whom we have drifted apart. \u201cPick one person. Pick up the phone. Send them a text. Meet them for a cup of tea. Make that connection. Let\u2019s begin cementing our unity one brick at a time.\u201d Read Harriet Sherwood\u2019s story here. The former directors of both the leave and remain campaigns in the EU referendum have joined cultural and religious leaders across the UK in an open letter calling for a \u201cdecade of reconnection\u201d. The letter, released on New Year\u2019s Day, describes the 2010s as \u201cthe decade of division\u201d, and says the country is \u201cpolarised\u201d and \u201cmore fragmented than any of us would like\u201d. The heads of the British Olympic and Paralympic Associations, Scouts and Guides are among those calling for greater social integration and cohesion, and are encouraging Britons to make a new Year\u2019s resolution to engage meaningfully with those around them. \u201cOur resolution is to reconnect,\u201d the letter says. \u201cTo reach out to just one person we don\u2019t know, or from whom we have drifted apart. To start rebuilding connections between neighbours and fellow citizens.\u201d Read more in Molly Blackall\u2019s story here. Happy New Year from London, welcome to 2020! French president Emmanuel Macron somewhat provocatively used his traditional New Year\u2019s Eve address to pledge that he would push through an overhaul of the pension system despite the country having grinded to a halt after weeks of nationwide strikes by trade unions. The 42-year-old, who has faced a bruising year of protests including weekly demonstrations by the gilets jaunes movement which have frequently turned violent, said he expected his government to quickly find a compromise with unions on the reform, but that the original principles laid out by ministers would be adhered to. \u201cThe retirement reform that I\u2019ve committed myself to before you will be carried through because it is a project of social justice and progress,\u201d Macron said in the prime-time televised address to the nation. \u201cWe will take into account difficult tasks so that those who do them can leave earlier,\u201d Macron said. Hundreds of thousands of people took the streets of the French capital to watch an awe-inspiring son et lumi\u00e8re show on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the chic Parisian street which has become the focal point of ferocious clashes between anti-Macron protesters and the CRS riot police. German chancellor Angela Merkel has used her New Year message to tell her countrymen that everything humanly possible must be done to tackle climate change. She said that there is good reason to be confident about the 2020s in her annual televised message, but she pointed to challenges such as the effect of digitization on people\u2019s jobs and, above all, climate change. \u201cThe warming of our Earth is real. It is threatening. It and the crises arising from global warming were caused by humans,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we must do everything humanly possible to deal with this challenge for humanity. That is still possible.\u201d Merkel said that was the principle behind a recently agreed German package of measures aimed at addressing climate change, which include a carbon dioxide pricing system for the transport and heating sectors and lowering value-added tax on long-distance rail tickets. She acknowledged criticism both from people who are worried about being overburdened by the measures and from those who think they don\u2019t go far enough, but said they provide the necessary framework. \u201cIt\u2019s true that, at 65, I am at an age where I personally won\u2019t experience all the consequences of climate change that would arise if politicians didn\u2019t act,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is our children and grandchildren who will have to live with the consequences of what we do or don\u2019t do today,\u201d Merkel added. \u201cSo I am putting all my energy into Germany making its contribution ecologically, economically, socially to getting a grip on climate change.\u201d Europe must also raise its voice more strongly in the world, the four-term chancellor said, pledging to work for that during the EU presidency. She pointed to planned meetings with Chinese and African leaders. Merkel, Germany\u2019s leader since 2005, has said that her current term will be her last. Russian president Vladimir Putin used his New Year\u2019s address to call on his countrymen to unite for the sake of the nation\u2019s future in an address that marked two decades since his ascent to power. Appearing outside the Kremlin in a televised message that was broadcast just before midnight, the 67-year-old leader spoke to Russians for the 16th time since Boris Yeltsin\u2019s shock New Year\u2019s resignation in 1999. \u201cWe live in an eventful, dynamic and controversial time, but we must do everything to make sure Russia develops successfully,\u201d Putin said. \u201cOnly together can we solve the problems ahead for the country, for our society. Our unity is the foundation for accomplishing the highest of goals,\u201d he said. \u201cOur personal plans and dreams are indivisible from Russia\u2019s. Its present and future depend on the efforts and contributions of each of us.\u201d Putin said he looked forward to celebrating the 75th anniversary of Russia\u2019s World War II victory in 2020 and thanked veterans. Moscow is planning to host world leaders during festivities on 9 May, one of Russia\u2019s biggest official holidays. An address to the nation from leaders in Moscow has been a tradition since the 1970s and is shown around midnight in Russia\u2019s 11 time zones. In Moscow, Russians celebrating on New Year\u2019s Eve watch the speech as they wait for a live broadcast of the Kremlin clock striking midnight and a spectacular fireworks display. British prime minister Boris Johnson, enjoying a winter sun break on the exclusive privately owned island of Mustique with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, has released his New Year\u2019s message, saying that the country can look forward to a decade of \u201cprosperity and opportunity\u201d as it finally ends the \u201crancour and uncertainty\u201d of Brexit. \u201cAs we say goodbye to 2019 we can also turn the page on the division, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can start a new chapter in the history of our country, in which we come together and move forward united, unleashing the enormous potential of the British people.\u201d The prime minister, who won a thumping majority in December 12\u2019s general election, said that he was determined to be a \u201cprime minister for everyone\u201d, including the millions who backed remain or did not vote Conservative in the general election.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has somewhat soured the global party vibe by accusing the Trump administration of dragging its feet in nuclear negotiations and warning that his country will soon unveil a new strategic weapon. North Korea\u2019s state media said on Wednesday that Kim declared during a key political conference that the North will not give up its security for economic benefits and will never denuclearise unless the United States discards its hostile policy. Kim\u2019s comments came after a months-long standoff with Washington over exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament measures, which dimmed hopes for denuclearising the North through diplomacy. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have posted a New Year\u2019s message on Instagram, accompanied by a new photograph of Harry holding their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. The picture appears at the end of a short video, little more than a minute long, recapping the couple\u2019s year to the tune of Coldplay\u2019s Clocks. The message said: \u201cWishing you all a very Happy New Year and thanking you for your continued support! We\u2019ve loved meeting so many of you from around the world and can\u2019t wait to meet many more of you next year. We hope 2020 brings each of you health and continued happiness. \u201cSpecial thanks to Chris Martin and Coldplay for allowing us to use one of their songs.\u201d Celebrations in Red Square in Moscow took place at 9pm GMT, and saw a spectacular firework display over the Kremlin. London mayor Sadiq Khan has promised tonight\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations will feature the \u201cbest fireworks London has ever seen\u201d in a statement that verged on the political and which will annoy his Brexiteer detractors. The capital will \u201cproject confidence\u201d on the world stage through the impressive display, Khan said. \u201cHand on heart, these are going to be the best fireworks London has ever seen.\u201d The mayor, a key opponent of Brexit, added that the \u201cworld\u201d will be watching the display and he hoped it would show London was a \u201cglobal city\u201d. He said: \u201cFairly or unfairly, people around the world saw the Brexit referendum vote as the UK somehow turning its back on the rest of the world, including Europe. \u201cThe fear was, we would become insular, inward-looking, and what I\u2019m keen to show is the opposite. \u201cYes we may be leaving the EU, but very much as a city we are still a European global city. We will continue to be open to people\u2019s trade and ideas. \u201cWhat tonight\u2019s fireworks are about is demonstrating our confidence. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important that we show the world who will be watching our fireworks that we are a confident, global, outward-looking European city.\u201d The theme of this year\u2019s display will look ahead to the capital hosting several key games in the Euro 2020 football tournament. The pyrotechnics show will feature more than 12,000 fireworks, with the display being set to a soundtrack \u201cinspired by London and Europe\u201d, according to a spokeswoman for the mayor. The event has sold out after more than 100,000 tickets were snapped up, and travel on Transport for London (TfL) services will be free until 4.30am on 1 January. And here\u2019s some more about events in Edinburgh. You may followed our reporting of the row over residents of the city having access to their own homes curtailed by the official celebrations. This seems to have been resolved but has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many worried about the over-commercialisation of Hogmanay. Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s report on the evening so far in the Scottish capital: Celebrations have begun in Edinburgh, as crowds gathered to witness the New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks set to illuminate the skies above the city\u2019s street party. The streets of Edinburgh are filling up as Hogmanay revellers prepare to welcome in the start of a new decade and enjoy the UK\u2019s biggest street party. Performances from Idlewild, Rudimental and Marc Almond will take place on stages throughout the city centre, while DJ Mark Ronson will usher in the new year, creating a new soundtrack ahead of the clock striking 12. Approximately 100,000 visitors are expected to attend the event, according to organisers who billed the Hogmanay celebrations as the UK\u2019s biggest New Year\u2019s Eve street party. TV stars Ant and Dec took to the stage in Princes Street Gardens early on Tuesday evening as crowds gathered, playing music and introducing the first firework display of the night. Street theatre, circus acts and musical performances also took place up across more than a dozen streets, including the city\u2019s main throughfare Princes Street and its adjacent gardens, while ceilidhs danced their way into the night in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle. There had been criticism of the event\u2019s organisation, amid uncertainty around how many passes residents were allowed, with Underbelly \u2013 which also runs the Edinburgh Festival Fringe \u2013 accused of creating \u201cunnecessary confusion\u201d by the council leader. The festivities began in the city on Monday as around 40,000 people joined a torchlit procession which culminated in them forming the shape of two humans reaching out a \u201chand of friendship\u201d. Leading the parade down the Royal Mile and into Holyrood Park was a 40-strong cast from Celtic Fire Theatre company PyroCeltica. Here\u2019s a good round-up from our friends at the Associated Press about events across the globe: London Londoners were making their way to the banks of the River Thames to jostle for position to watch a spectacular fireworks display launched from the London Eye and of barges near Parliament. The familiar chimes of Big Ben will ring in the new year, even though they have been silent for most of 2019 because of extensive restoration work. Edinburgh The multi-day Hogmanay celebrations began on Monday night with a torchlight parade through the streets of the Scottish capital. Security was tight in both cities and elsewhere in Britain after police arrested five men on suspicion of terrorism offences on Monday, but said the arrests were not related to the celebrations. South Africa Thousands gathered at Cape Town\u2019s Waterfront area to ring in the new year with music, dancing and fireworks in front of the city\u2019s iconic Table Mountain. In past years, residents of Johannesburg\u2019s Hillbrow neighbourhood would celebrate the new year by tossing furniture, appliances and even refrigerators from the balconies of high-rise apartment buildings. Police have issued stern warnings and it appears the curious tradition has declined. Rome Pope Francis took a stroll in St Peter\u2019s Square on Tuesday night to admire the Nativity scene. Shouts of \u201cPope! Pope!\u201d and \u201cHappy new year!\u201d resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks. One woman grabbed the pope\u2019s hand and pulled him toward her to shake it. Francis, 83, exclaimed and then struck the woman\u2019s hand twice to free his hand. United Arab Emirates A 10-minute firework display will light up the sky over Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building, with hundreds of thousands of people gathering to watch. It will be one of seven different events taking place in the city. Japan People flocked to temples and shrines in Japan, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the the first new year of the Reiwa era. Under Japan\u2019s old-style calendar, Reiwa started in May after Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor. Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, January 1 marks Reiwa\u2019s first new year\u2019s day, the most important holiday in Japan. Stalls at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo sold sweet rice wine, fried noodles and candied apples, as well as little amulets in the shape of mice, the zodiac animal for 2020. Since the Year of the Mouse starts off the Asian zodiac, it\u2019s associated with starting anew. Indonesia Tens of thousands turned out in Indonesia\u2019s capital of Jakarta and were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for fireworks while others in the country were wary of an active volcano. Festive events along coastal areas near the Sunda Strait were dampened by a possible larger eruption of Anak Krakatau, an island volcano that erupted last year just ahead of Christmas Day, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 430 people. Germany Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to turn out in Berlin\u2019s traditional spot in front of the Brandenburg Gate. Several German cities including Munich and Hamburg have banned private fireworks amid concerns about the danger and environmental impacts from the increasingly powerful fireworks. Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay celebrations got off to an explosive start with early fireworks as revellers enjoyed the funfair and other attractions in the historic heart of the city. It\u2019s now 2020 in India, where there have been events up and down the country to mark the new year. Areas of the country have been hit by unseasonably cold weather: New Delhi recorded its chilliest day in more than a century amid a severe cold wave across the north of India. It may be notionally be the depths of winter in the United Kingdom but three days ago a new provisional maximum temperature of 18.7C (65.66F) was recorded at Achfary in the Highlands by the Met Office. If validated it would be the highest temperature officially recorded in the UK during the month. Inevitably, the crossing into the new year saw protests break out in Honk Kong, which police moved to suppress by firing tear gas volleys just minutes into 2020. Pro-democracy protesters took their movement into the new year with midnight countdown rallies and a massive march planned for January 1. The city has been battered by more than six months of unrest with marches attended by millions, as well as confrontations in which police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets \u2013 and protesters have responded with petrol bombs. Before midnight on Tuesday, thousands of protesters gathered across the financial hub, including along the waterfront of Victoria Harbour and at nightlife hotspot Lan Kwai Fong. Protesters at the harbour front counted down chanting \u201cTen! Nine! Liberate Hong Kong, revolution now!\u201d as they lit up their phones in a sea of lights. Smaller crowds of protesters in the Mong Kok district set fire to barricades \u2013 and riot police unleashed 2020\u2019s first tear gas cannisters in response. Earlier police had used water cannon to disperse protesters in the same area while, in nearby Prince Edward neighbourhood, officers arrested several protesters staging a candlelight vigil. It\u2019s Seth Jacobson taking over the blog until past midnight London time. The next set of celebrations we\u2019re waiting on will be in India\u2019s major cities in 20 minutes time. Many in the country will use the opportunity to hold protests against a citizenship law, despite prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s attempts to dampen demonstrations that have run for nearly three weeks, according to Reuters. The country has been rocked since 12 December, when Modi\u2019s government passed legislation easing the way for non-Muslim minorities from the neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain Indian citizenship. Many Indians fear the move will discriminate against the minority Muslim community and chip away at the country\u2019s secular constitution. Protesters plan demonstrations in New Delhi, including the area of Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of residents have blocked a major highway for 18 days. Poetry recitals and speeches are planned by organisers at a protest outside the capital\u2019s Jamia Millia university, which was stormed by police this month. \u201cNew Year\u2019s resolution to defend the constitution,\u201d read the schedule for another protest planned in New Delhi, now in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century. Police said they planned to deploy additional forces in New Delhi on New Year\u2019s Eve, with traffic curbs imposed in some parts of the capital. \u201cAll precautionary measures are in place,\u201d said police official Chinmoy Biswal, who oversees the southeastern part of the city that includes Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia University. \u201cRecently, there have been no incidents. So we hope things will remain fine,\u201d he told Reuters. With just under 12 hours to go before New Year there, people have been filing into New York\u2019s Times Square, which the city\u2019s counterterrorism czar says will probably be \u201cthe safest place on the planet Earth on New Years Eve\u201d. Thousands of police officers will be on duty for Tuesday night\u2019s festivities, along with specialized units armed with long guns, bomb-sniffing dogs and other measures. For the first time, police drones are expected to keep watch over the big, confetti-filled celebration a year late after rain grounded the department\u2019s unmanned eye-in-the-sky last year. This year\u2019s forecast calls for some clouds, but no rain and none of the bitter cold that iced out spectators two years ago. The NYPDs Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism, John Miller, said stacking various security tools and techniques gives police multiple chances to catch something coming through. \u201cTimes Square is probably going to be the safest place on the planet Earth on New Year\u2019s Eve because nobody else puts that kind of effort into an event like this,\u201d Miller said. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said there are no specific, credible threats to the event, which brings hundreds of thousands of people to midtown Manhattan and attracts millions of TV viewers. Post Malone, BTS and Alanis Morissette are scheduled to perform on stages in the heart of Times Square. The New Year is being celebrated in countries including Thailand and Vietnam. Tens of thousands of revelers in Indonesias capital of Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks. Festive events along coastal areas near the Sunda Strait were meanwhile dampened by a possible larger eruption of Anak Krakatau, an island volcano that erupted last year just ahead of Christmas Day, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 430 people. The country\u2019s volcanology agency has warned locals and tourists to stay 2 kilometers (1.3 miles) from the volcano\u2019s crater following an eruption Tuesday that blasted ash and debris up to 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) into the air. Global stock markets have posted their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago, as US technology investors and shares in eurozone and Asia-based companies drove a worldwide rally. The MSCI World Index, which tracks stocks across the developed world, jumped by almost 24% during 2019 \u2013 the strongest performance since 2009. London fared relatively badly compared to other markets in 2019, however. The S&amp;P 500 index of top US companies has surged by 28% this year, hitting a series of record highs, as Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, share buybacks and optimism about US growth prospects boosted markets in the world\u2019s largest economy. The tech-dominated Nasdaq index, whose stocks include Netflix, Facebook and Amazon, posted a rise of 35% over the year \u2013 with Apple leading the way by surging 84%. Eurozone stocks also outperformed, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC both up 25%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 18%, helped by the prospect of new stimulus by Shinzo Abe\u2019s government. One of North Korean TV\u2019s few live broadcasts of the year has been underway to ring in the new year. North Korea expert Martyn Williams has tweeted this video footage taken in the centre of Pyongyang. Williams adds that Kim Jong Un is expected to make new year address later on as usual and is likely to announce his intentions regarding next steps in relation to North Korea\u2019s fraught relationship with the US and neighbours. State media reported earlier this week that the North Korean leader had called for \u201cpositive and offensive measures\u201d to ensure security at a ruling party meeting ahead of a year-end deadline he has set for denuclearisation talks with the United States. New Year has arrived in Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul and other cities in the same timezone. Some of the stunning images of 2019 which were captured by photographers working with Guardian US have been collected here. They include photos taken as part of reporting ranging from the stories of a besieged abortion clinic in Alabama to an indigenous community in northern California practicing prescribed burning. It\u2019s new year in Hong Kong, where protests continued as the clock counted down to midnight. From Notre Dame\u2019s spire collapsing in flames to sled dogs wading through Greenland\u2019s melted ice water and Stormzy triumphant at Glastonbury \u2013 photographers have been recalling how they captured some of the defining images of the year. It includes a recollection from Jorge Guerrero of the haunting photo he took of people being rescued of the coast of Malaga after an an inflatable boat carrying 132 migrants was rescued by the Spanish coastguard in the Alboran Sea. Guerrero added: The reason they make the journey to Europe is complex, but it is often because of extreme poverty, exploitation and conflict in their countries of origin. You see in their faces, tiredness, despair and at the same time an expression of hope. Every time I photograph immigration, I feel sadness. In Japan, which has just been celebrating the arrival of 2020, people have been flocking to temples and shrines, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the first new year of what is known as the Reiwa era. Under Japan\u2019s old-style calendar, linked to emperors\u2019 rules, Reiwa started in May, after Emperor Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor. Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, 1 January still marks Reiwa\u2019s first new year, the most important holiday in Japan. \u201cWe have a new era and so I am hoping things will be better, although 2019 was also a good year because nothing bad happened,\u201d said Masashi Ogami, 38, who ran a sweet rice wine stall at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo, told the Associated Press news agency Other stalls sold fried noodles and candied apples, as well as little figures and amulets in the shape of mice, the zodiac animal for 2020. Since the Year of the Mouse starts off the Asian zodiac, it is associated with starting anew. Tokyo host the 2020 Olympics in the first year of the decade, an event that is creating much anticipation for the capital and the entire nation. In London, those attending a New Year\u2019s Eve party hosted by the couple who changed the law to allow mixed-sex couples in England and Wales to form civil partnerships are being invited \u201cto bring the food that they love to cook or makes them feel loved up\u201d. Earlier today, I went to Chelsea Town Hall to report on how they joined thousands of others who have been entering into the new form of legal unions today. \u201cToday, as one decade ends and another dawns, we become civil partners in law,\u201d Steinfeld, 38, said outside the building. \u201cOur personal wish to form a civil partnership was rooted in our desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, focus on equality, and mutual respect. \u201cSo today is a unique, special and personal moment for us, a moment that we\u2019ve been able to affirm our love and commitment to one another in the company of our beautiful children, Eden and Ariel, and close friends.\u201d Following Steinfeld and Keidan\u2019s victory at the supreme court in 2018, it is expected that as many as 84,000 ceremonies will be conducted in 2020 as couples take advantage of a right originally legislated for LBTQI couples. Hong Kong\u2019s tourism board has been in touch to share details of what has been planned for the new year celebrations in less than an hour, when the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour will take centre stage. An \u201cenhanced edition\u201d of one of the world\u2019s largest light and music shows \u2013 A Symphony of Lights \u2013 is set to ring in 2020 with a kaleidoscope of lighting effects.. A minute before midnight the fa\u00e7ade of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) will turn into a giant clock to count down to the new year. \u201cOnce the clock strikes midnight, an enriched version of the multimedia show, A Symphony of Lights, will commence,\u201d according to the tourism board. \u201cIn addition to lasers, searchlights, LED screens and other lighting effects at numerous harbour-front buildings, the new year countdown special edition will be synchronised with pyrotechnics launched from building rooftops and the display of \u20182020\u2019 on the fa\u00e7ade of the HKCEC.\u201d Reuters is reporting that thousands of protesters briefly blocked one of Hong Kong\u2019s main roads after forming human chains across the city, urging people not to give up the fight for democracy in 2020. The protesters fled when police came to clear the road of objects such as umbrellas, street furniture and the metal skeleton of a Christmas tree decoration but then occupied other parts of the road. At least one man was arrested. Authorities have cancelled the popular midnight fireworks for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A \u201cSymphony of Lights\u201d is planned instead, involving projections on to the city\u2019s tallest skyscrapers after a countdown to midnight. Tuesday began with small-scale lunchtime rallies, followed by marches through several prime shopping malls and giant human chains in various districts across the city. On Nathan Road, an important artery on the Kowloon peninsula, protesters in a chain stretching for several kilometres raised lit-up smartphones as passing cars and buses honked in support and tourists in party hats and 2020-shaped glasses took pictures. Many protesters held up cards reading \u201cLet\u2019s keep fighting together in 2020\u201d. The chain later spilled over into the road, and some protesters built barricades and hid behind umbrellas, blocking traffic. The Pope has tweeted to mark the new year. London is also gearing up for its NYE celebrations. Police have warned people not to attend the celebrations on the River Thames without a ticket, urging them to watch from home or attend other events in the city. The fireworks display on the river is sold out, with more than 100,000 tickets sold. As part of our \u2018the world in 2020\u2019 series, Guardian reporters are looking ahead to the coming year. Lily Kuo in Beijing reports on how the Chinese government will seek to boost nationalist sentiment by blaming foreign influences, while the Guardian Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, writes about how US isolationism is leaving the region on the edge. You can read the series here. One of Sydney\u2019s most controversial New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks displays has gone off without a hitch as almost $1m was raised for bush communities, reports the Australian Associated Press. Crowds lining the city\u2019s harbour watched the display as Indigenous electronic duo Electric Fields kicked off an all-Australian musical playlist. The pylons of the centrepiece Sydney Harbour Bridge earlier lit up with messages calling for donations to the Red Cross\u2019s disaster relief fund. By midnight, more than $700,000 had been raised. Here are some photographs of the New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations in Sydney. Happy New Year, Sydney. It is nearly midnight in much of Australia (in cities like Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra). Tens of thousands of Victorians have gathered in Melbourne to enjoy an early new year celebration, reports the Australian Associated Press. As the city darkened and the weather settled near 20C, families gathered next to Melbourne cricket ground to watch movies, listen to music and witness an early seven-minute firework show that will serve as an appetiser for the midnight show. Police heavily secured the surrounding area. Many officers relaxedly patrolled the streets and walkways, takings pictures with some of the attendees. More than 500 security guards, 118 marshals and 22 area wardens are employed for the celebration, which has five kilometres of fencing across the city. Along the Yarra River bend, skaters spent the last hours of the night practising their tricks while groups of friends secured a spot to watch the spectacular fireworks that will fill the city with light at midnight. More than 14 tonnes of fireworks will be used for the City of Melbourne\u2019s show, called Reach for the Stars. The city council says New Year\u2019s Eve 2019 will help raise funds for the Salvation Army emergency services responding to bushfires in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Western Australia. Here are some photographs from the new year celebrations in Auckland, New Zealand, which welcomed the dawn of 2020 just over an hour ago. Looking for a way to kill some time before this evening\u2019s new year\u2019s celebrations? Take our, very hard, TV quiz of the decade. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has issued a new year\u2019s message, saying the world is entering 2020 with \u201cuncertainty and insecurity\u201d all around. \u201cWe cannot afford to be the generation that fiddled while the planet burned,\u201d he said, adding that there was hope in the power of youth around the planet. \u201cFrom climate action to gender equality to social justice and human rights, your generation is on the frontlines and in the headlines,\u201d he said. \u201cI am inspired by your passion and determination.\u201d Preparations are under way in Edinburgh for its Hogmanay festival amid a row over the rights of residents in the city\u2019s centre to access their homes. The leader of Edinburgh council, Adam McVey, has accused Underbelly, the events company that runs Edinburgh\u2019s winter and Hogmanay festivals, for the dispute over access rights for people who live within the large security zone covered by the festival. The row erupted last week after it emerged that the festival\u2019s organisers had said applications by residents for any more than six access passes would be screened by the police. This is from the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell. About 75,000 revellers are expected to converge on the Hogmanay festival site, called the arena by Underbelly, for performances featuring Mark Ronson, Marc Almond and other acts spread over several stages. Residential and shopping areas such as Rose Street, Princes Street, Mound Place, Castle Street, Frederick Street and Hanover Street will be cordoned off with steel barriers and security checks. One of its biggest events is the Hogmanay fireworks display from Edinburgh Castle. But residents inside the zone will be barred from viewing it at street level unless they have bought festival tickets. To the anger of community groups, Underbelly also suggested that if residents wanted larger numbers of access passes for their own Hogmanay parties, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service would be asked to check that was within safety limits for their property. You can read the full story here. The Guardian\u2019s community team wants to know what your hopes for the next decade are. As 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade. The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency. There have been huge people movements from the Arab spring to Black Lives Matter, MeToo and the Global climate strikes. It was a defining decade for LGBTQ people from the very start, with Argentina legalising same-sex marriage and communities grappling with how gender should be constructed. The advancement of tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon has dramatically altered how people connect with media and each other. In the UK, love it or hate it, Brexit, became one of the most defining moments of British political history. In such complex and turbulent times it is almost impossible to know what the future holds for us all. Nonetheless, we want to know what you hope the future will bring \u2013 also what you expect to see more of and any solutions you think may work. Share your thoughts with us here. And happy new year to everybody in New Zealand. The countdown to new year has started in Auckland, New Zealand. You can watch it here. \u201cFamily Fireworks\u201d have been launched over Sydney Harbour as part of New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations. The smaller fireworks display is launched at 9pm local time for children and families. Wondering what 2020 might have in store for us here in the UK? Here\u2019s the Observer\u2019s guide to who and what to look out for. It is now 2020 in Samoa. The South Pacific country battled a measles outbreak in 2019, having to impose a six-week state of emergency in November. The highly infectious disease killed 81 people, most of them babies and young children, and left more than 5,600 others ill. The country\u2019s prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele, has also been outspoken about climate change, which is affecting the island nation more than most. \u201cClimate change crosses borders uninvited and does not discriminate by size or economic status,\u201d he said earlier this year. \u201cIt impacts every country, though some more extensively than others; like small island developing states, because of their particular and unique vulnerabilities.\u201d Sydney\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks became contentious this year as the country faces an unprecedented bushfire crisis. With 100 fires burning in New South Wales and a total fire ban across Sydney, more than 275,000 people signed a petition calling for the fireworks to be cancelled and the money donated to fire relief. But authorities insisted the money had already been spent and signalled the event generates $130m for the NSW economy. The state\u2019s fire service granted an exemption from the fire ban for Sydney\u2019s fireworks while many other events around the state had to be cancelled. Sydney\u2019s lord mayor said the council had already donated $620,000 to bushfire and drought-affected communities and the broadcast of the event would also act as a fundraiser for further relief money. Good morning \u2013 or evening, depending on your perspective \u2013 and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve live blog. We\u2019ll be covering the festivities as people celebrate the dawning of the year 2020 around the globe, starting in the Pacific on Christmas Island and Samoa, where the clock will strike midnight in 15 minutes. It\u2019s been an astonishing year, from the impeachment of the US president to the landslide Conservative victory in the UK general election. There was unrest in Hong Kong as well as global climate change protests, major terror attacks from New Zealand to Sri Lanka, and natural disasters \u2013 most recently the bushfires in Australia \u2013 kill thousands. We\u2019ll be bringing you reflections on 2019 \u2013 and indeed the past decade \u2013 as the day progresses.",

From 1 January 2020, ships will only be allowed to use fuel oil with a very low sulphur content, under rules brought in by the International Maritime Organisation. This cut in sulphur content has been more than a decade in the planning, and almost all shipping around the world is expected to comply, or face penalties. \u201cMember states, the shipping industry and fuel oil suppliers have been working for the past three years to prepare for this major change \u2013 I am confident that the benefits will soon be felt and that implementation will be smooth,\u201d said Kitack Lim, the secretary general of the IMO. \u201cThis [is a] hugely important change which will have significant positive benefits for human health and the environment.\u201d The new regulations are aimed at cleaning up sulphur emissions, which can cause acid rain and other forms of air pollution, rather than tackling the climate emergency.

The IMO estimates that the new limit \u2013 of 0.5% sulphur content compared with the previous limit of 3.5%, enforced under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships \u2013 will cut sulphur oxide emissions from ships by 77%, an annual reduction of about 8.5m tonnes.

It\u2019s hard to see from the track above, and the squelchy route down and the cliff-scramble mean that, even in summer, there\u2019s rarely anyone else there. The bay is a great gatherer of driftwood (as well as less-flammable flotsam \u2013 random shoes, gloves, bath toys, broken fish boxes and cobles\u2026). We build a fire and drink hot soup and cook sausages. If there\u2019s a swell running, and the tides are low, some of us will tug on wetsuits and boots and try the surf \u2013 others might dash in for a new year\u2019s baptismal dip.</p> <p>To one side of the beach, the cliff has been cut into, forming gullies \u2013 or \u201czawns\u201d, from the Cornish.

Egged on by my adventurous cousins, this is where I first got a taste for winter swimming. The first day of the year always involves a swim off Goat Island, in County Waterford, as sausages cook in the sand.</p> <p>Last August I decided to make Dover my home. I moved into a Regency crescent by the castle and from here I can see the waves crash into the harbour below. To beat creeping feelings of isolation I started tentatively dipping myself into the sea; but as autumn has turned to winter these outings have become a necessary daily fix, where no day feels complete without a half-hour swim in the Channel.</p> <p>I now structure my work hours around tide timetables and, come rain or shine, I clip on my fluorescent tow float, pull on my neoprene gloves, and roll into the waves. Often going in naked \u2013 to titillate the looming border patrol \u2013 I dodge the ferries and aim for France.

      "bodyText": "Sea swimming, Cornwall Philip Marsden, writer The important thing on New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 as on most days over Christmas \u2013 is to get out. If you don\u2019t manage it by about midday, suddenly it\u2019s dusk and too late. Living in Cornwall makes you a sitting target for visitors, and we normally have an assortment of friends and family packed into our house. There\u2019s a favourite cove a few miles away, behind Nare Head. It\u2019s hard to see from the track above, and the squelchy route down and the cliff-scramble mean that, even in summer, there\u2019s rarely anyone else there. The bay is a great gatherer of driftwood (as well as less-flammable flotsam \u2013 random shoes, gloves, bath toys, broken fish boxes and cobles\u2026). We build a fire and drink hot soup and cook sausages. If there\u2019s a swell running, and the tides are low, some of us will tug on wetsuits and boots and try the surf \u2013 others might dash in for a new year\u2019s baptismal dip. To one side of the beach, the cliff has been cut into, forming gullies \u2013 or \u201czawns\u201d, from the Cornish. You can swim into these and feel the sea surge in and rise and fall against the rocks while you bob, cork-like, upon them, contemplating the ups and downs of the coming year. \u2022 Philip Marsden\u2019s most recent book is The Summer Isles: A Voyage of the Imagination A walk in the woods, Dartmoor Miriam Darlington, writer The flanks of Dartmoor are always whitened with frost and hidden icicles on new year\u2019s morning. This is where I set out to, with snow boots, flasks of hot tea and my loved ones. Often, we make our way up to Wistman\u2019s Wood. This grizzled place is one of the few original ancient oak woods left on the moor, and it feels enchanted. From a distance, its furze of stunted oaks set among the clutter of granite boulders looks unremarkable, but inside is a muscular wood-world of moss boulders and ankle-turning tangles of trunks, roots and loopy beards of lichen. Here, we sit in the stillness between weather patterns and think about our resolutions \u2013 what the old year has been and what we wish for the new. Among the trees, we listen to the high, glassy crepitation of twigs conversing from their coatings of ice, poised for the next incoming skitter of cold. There is something safe about a wood in winter: its spacious leaflessness allows you to see your way out, and in the \u201cdimpsey\u201d light we drink steaming tea and watch shadows move around us. Wistman\u2019s Wood is a sheltering place \u2013 very slightly uncanny, and good for invoking wishes \u2013 but not one in which to linger too long. \u2022 Miriam Darlington is author of Otter Country Plant hunting, Suffolk Melissa Harrison, nature writer and novelist For the decade between my mid-twenties and mid-thirties, I missed every single New Year\u2019s Day. Often I was out dancing and doing shots and chatting nonsense with friends and strangers: in a dark, windowless club, perhaps, or at a raucous house party with all the blinds drawn. Sometimes I spent it spark out under a duvet, recovering from the night before. Either way, the day just didn\u2019t exist for me: events like the Oxford Street sales, or London\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day Parade, were purely mythical. I never even saw the sun. Another decade on and things are different. Since moving to Suffolk, I\u2019ve made a point of going for a proper walk on 1 January so I can think, and feel, and breathe, and see the new year in. More than once on my rambles I\u2019ve come across people botanising, which may seem unlikely given the time of year. But it turns out the New Year Plant Hunt, now nine years old, is fast becoming A Thing: volunteers across the country head out and record whatever\u2019s flowering at nyph.bsbi.org, the results analysed by the Botanical Society of Britain &amp; Ireland to shed light on our changing weather. It seems to me a powerful ritual, as well as providing useful data: like the clubs I\u2019ve left behind, it\u2019s a quest for life and promise and colour at the chill, drab turning of the year. \u2022 Melissa Harrison\u2019s All Among the Barley won the European Union Prize for Literature in 2019 Triathlon, Edinburgh John Whittaker, Silent Running Scotland On 1 January at Holyrood Park in Edinburgh you might expect to see families taking a refreshing stroll, or folks walking off hangovers from their big night. But you will be surprised: hundreds of Lycra-clad triathletes will be thundering through the park, cycling and running. Yes it is likely to be cold, wet and windy, possibly even snowy, but for 25 years the park has hosted a sprint-distance triathlon \u2013 there have been Olympic- and world-level athletes out on course alongside many hundreds of first-time triathletes. Each year, around half the field are first-timers, and in the past few years the number of women competing has overtaken the men. The swim is over 400 metres indoors at the Royal Commonwealth Pool (breaking ice on the local lochs is just a step too far). Then the hardy souls take to their bikes for a three-lap, 10-mile route around Arthur\u2019s Seat, with a substantial hill to be climbed on each lap. Lastly, it\u2019s one more run around the park, before heading for the finish line to be rewarded with a medal and to bask in the glory of becoming a New Year\u2019s Day triathlete. \u2022 edinburghtri.org Birding, Bristol Tim Dee, nature writer Birders often keep year-lists and I have spent the scant daylight of many new year\u2019s days kickstarting my annual tally. Some occasions have given me 60 or more species and have been scintillating \u2013 the bright sparks of jack snipe flushed at Whiteford Burrows in South Wales; a great grey shrike like an altar candle on the Isle of Sheppey; the grey powder-puff drift of six male hen harriers coming to roost at Wicken Fen. But many first days are cold and dreary, as haggard and hungover as I often am, and my list then has stalled at a few blue and great tits coming to some stale Christmas pudding on my bird table in Bristol. It pays not to set too much store \u2013 no augury \u2013 by the numbers you achieve by dusk\u2026 the year can still be won. Nowadays, I twitch less, and go to the Clifton Downs instead for any signs of spring that are already abroad. Snowdrops help to hurry up the year, there are aconites often in these days of milder winters, and if you can hear a mistle thrush belting out its steely-cold spring song from the chilled top of a bare tree on the cliffs of the Avon Gorge, the good life feels within the grasp of all once more. \u2022 Tim Dee\u2019s new book Greenery: Journeys in Springtime is out in March (Jonathan Cape) Midnight vigil, Inner Hebrides Jim Crumley, nature writer Midnight: a beach and a driftwood fire, South Skye or west coast Mull. Starlight, moonlight, then the aurora. Then listen. To the night, to the sea, to the voices of the winter dark. Grey seals singing as the tide ebbs and frees the haul-out rocks. Owl-to-owl call, kee-wick to whoo-oo. Then try and count the owls. Fox, triple bark (the dog), mating season scream (the vixen, hair-raising). Whooper swan restlessness scored for muted brass on a hidden lochan just above the beach. And listen to the fire talking to itself through the wee hours, and to each other. The tenor of New Year\u2019s Day is established between the hours of midnight and sunrise. Then, stir the fire, make porridge, and through the daylight hours walk the island until you find an unplanned destination (you know it when you get there). Then, a cottage with the sea across the street. Bath with good whisky. Dinner with good wine. Toast: Bliadhna mhath ur dhuinn \u2013 A good New Year to Us. Who with? Oh, she knows, she knows. \u2022 Jim Crumley\u2019s latest book is The Nature of Spring A walk in the Downs, Kent Maryanne Grant Traylen, writer Because I am a ritual sun ray-gatherer \u2013 particularly at this winter solstice time of year, when the sun\u2019s early descent is so fiery and intense \u2013 my lone spirit plus dog will long for the hills on New Year\u2019s Day. My children and I raise our heads above the parapet of festive fugs. The coast will be clear. We\u2019ll turn away from the glistening sea to head inland to elevations west of the Folkestone Downs near Peene Quarry or Etchinghill. For a while we\u2019ll walk and talk. Then, from across the flow and glow of golden-flanked Down, we\u2019ll be dazzled by an ever-changing veil of rose-tinted ambers and yellows that sweep across our vision, till the orb, departed behind Summerhouse and Tolsford Hills, turns the once-gilded grasses white and colourless in the not-yet-dark. Raising our gaze to whisks of peach-pink ribboning in the sky, we\u2019ll cherish the belief that all must be conceived of, if not done, on New Year\u2019s Day, if it is to happen at all. And up here you can give it your best, letting words tumble, wishing for well-being everywhere. As we look down again we\u2019ll contemplate the sprouting sappiness of earth to be, and a pint of beer alongside a welcome at the Radnor Arms in Folkestone! \u2022 Maryanne Grant Traylen is author of A Dog on the Downs Pirates and foragers, Dorset Jade and Dan Scott, adventure guides New Year\u2019s Day for us isn\u2019t about making up guilt-ridden resolutions as punishment for indulging in too many mince pies; it\u2019s an opportunity to pause and look back at the year behind, to celebrate all the little wins in life and all the happy moments that we made happen for us and others \u2013 to remind ourselves of what makes us who we are and what we need to keep doing in the future to keep happy. We like to be with our favourite people, doing simple things, sharing time in nature, no big gestures. We gather up family and friends and head down the South West Coast Path to one of our special places, Pondfield Cove, at Worbarrow Bay beneath the watchful eye of Worbarrow Tout. This is the smaller and lesser-known beach of the two that our children like to think is their own secret cove, and we like to let them think that.. We light fires and play pirates, search for sea glass and driftwood, seaweed and wild herbs. We cook a warming stew over the flames and eat it out of tin mugs. The kids get filthy and run free and there\u2019s always one mad person in the party who can\u2019t stay out of the sea! \u2022 Jade and Dan Scott run sea kayaking and bushcraft courses in Dorset, foreadventure.co.uk Winter dips, Ireland and Dover Nicolas Deshayes, artist For the past few years I\u2019ve spent New Year\u2019s Day on the south coast of Ireland. Egged on by my adventurous cousins, this is where I first got a taste for winter swimming. The first day of the year always involves a swim off Goat Island, in County Waterford, as sausages cook in the sand. Last August I decided to make Dover my home. I moved into a Regency crescent by the castle and from here I can see the waves crash into the harbour below. To beat creeping feelings of isolation I started tentatively dipping myself into the sea; but as autumn has turned to winter these outings have become a necessary daily fix, where no day feels complete without a half-hour swim in the Channel. I now structure my work hours around tide timetables and, come rain or shine, I clip on my fluorescent tow float, pull on my neoprene gloves, and roll into the waves. Often going in naked \u2013 to titillate the looming border patrol \u2013 I dodge the ferries and aim for France. Every day feels like New Year\u2019s Day. Flights of fancy, West Country Kate Rew, founder of The Outdoor Swimming Society I like a good time but New Year\u2019s Eve has always been too much pressure for my wayward ways. I prefer New Year\u2019s Day. I like starting the year relatively fresh, and ending the day in a clean bed, beaten and battered by exertion and weather. At some point I generate inconceivably long lists that boil down to \u201cget fit, drink less, write something and do yoga\u201d. Maximum time outside is different every year. Three years ago my husband and I double-dipped, first in fancy dress at the Lyme Lunge in Lyme Regis, Dorset, then under a supermoon. Two years ago we walked up and down Sugarloaf mountain in Monmouthshire. Last year we cycled what felt like the whole of Somerset. A swimmer I know puts her resolutions in a frame in the downstairs loo, so she (and everyone else) can see them. This year I\u2019m doing the same, which is already making me reframe them in other ways. The same four core points will undoubtedly be the same, but I\u2019m 50 now and this year \u2013 this year! \u2013 those dreams are coming true. \u2022 To find a New Year\u2019s swim, see outdoorswimmingsociety.com Seeds of hope, Gog Magog Hills, Cambridge Olivia Laing, author New Year\u2019s Eve is my worst night of the year. I always feel like I\u2019m in the wrong place, or not having enough fun. By contrast, New Year\u2019s Day is my favourite. I love the quiet, the sense that the world has temporarily fallen still. I\u2019ve developed a tradition of using it to plan next year\u2019s planting in my garden. First I walk at Wandlebury Park in the Gog Magog Hills in Cambridge, through the neglected orchards of a former stately home, and then I settle down with tea and the last of the sausage rolls, and sort through seed catalogues, sketching out border designs in my battered garden diary. My favourite is the austere Chiltern Seeds, which has no pictures, only wonderfully vivid and knowledgeable mini-essays. I love old-fashioned cottage garden plants: opium poppies, sweet peas like Black Knight and King Edward VII, candy-striped cosmos and tagetes. But like the Talented Mr Ripley, my true passion is for dahlias, especially the ones that look like sea anemones. It\u2019s the best kind of dreaming to do at the hinge of the year, an investment in summer that always comes good, no matter what else 2020 might bring. \u2022 Olivia Laing\u2019s collected essays, Funny Weather, is published by Picador in April Skirting the border Richard Skelton and Autumn Richardson, writers and musicians On New Year\u2019s Eve we usually make a list of aspirations for the coming year, as well as reflecting on those of the year just gone. We often try to spend at least part of New Year\u2019s Day trying to put those objectives into practice: beginning a new piece of writing, art or music. We also try to get outdoors, and for the past two winters we\u2019ve been in the Scottish Borders, living close to Liddel Water \u2014 the river that further downstream forms the boundary between Scotland and England. There\u2019s a path along its edge that we like to walk, skirting a threshold as we cross over into a new year. \u2022 corbelstonepress.com London soundtrack Raymond Antrobus, poet I feel fresher if I\u2019ve written down all the unhelpful and hurtful things that my mind has accumulated over the year (harsh and unkind things said to my face, online or behind my back, including things I\u2019ve said about myself), then gone to a river, a forest or garden \u2013 in London this will be Regent\u2019s Park or Victoria Park \u2013 and burned them like a pile of paper grudges. This ritual helps me move forward, otherwise I become a wheel that has accumulated too much from old roads and I\u2019ll never let them go. I go for long walks alone and listen to music with no lyrics: jazz, dance, funk, electronic, dub. Then I roll into the new year with friends and family and food \u2013 ackee and salt fish, and if dessert is going, it\u2019s apple crumble and custard. \u2022 raymondantrobus.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Donations began arriving at Lucknow Memorial Hall, on the outskirts of Bairnsdale, at 1pm on Tuesday. Within 24 hours a second donation point had been set up at Lucknow primary school, because the hall was full. Clothes are stacked on three trestle tables in the centre of the hall, blankets are lined up on the floor, and food \u2013 staples such as cereal and long-life milk \u2013 are against one long wall. \u201cThis is all social media,\u201d Wendy McPhan says. She made a Facebook post on Tuesday inquiring if there was anything she could do locally to help victims of the devastating bushfires, that have destroyed more than 200 homes and are still burning out of control in East Gippsland and southern NSW. Suddenly she had donations arriving from Melbourne, 280km away. On the heels of the donations came those who had lost everything, but were reluctant to say they needed help. People are proud in Gippsland, McPhan says. \u201cWe had a couple with three kids here, and he [the father] started crying,\u201d she says. \u201cI said, \u2018here\u2019s a $300 voucher for Woolies,\u2019 and he said \u2018no, I can\u2019t take that, there\u2019s people worse off.\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018Mate, you have lost everything. You have lost your house. There is no one worse off.\u2019\u201d The vouchers and cash donations go into McPhan\u2019s handbag, to be distributed to those worst affected. While we speak, a woman walks over and hands her a $50 supermarket voucher, with another to be given directly to a woman who is gently weeping on the shoulder of one of the volunteers. \u201cI might be back on Saturday to get it back,\u201d the woman with the voucher says. \u201cI am at Sarsfield \u2013 we might lose the lot.\u201d The Barmouth Spur fire is only 10km north of the hall, at Mount Taylor and Sarsfield. Nineteen structures, including about a dozen houses, have been confirmed destroyed at Sarsfield. With hot conditions and a northerly wind forecast again for Saturday, the donation centre may have to move. Many of those who have lost everything are single men who are reluctant to accept the assistance they desperately need. A man whose house burned down at Buchan South arrived at the hall and quietly told a volunteer that no one had come looking for him. He accepted a hug and some food while helping to carry boxes: for those reluctant to seek help, it is easier to be able to give help at the same time. Volunteers are gently ensuring that everyone who accesses the donated goods also registers with emergency services. Local MP Tim Bull has promised to organise a truck to send donations 230km east to Mallacoota as soon as the Princes Highway is opened. That is expected to take days. The Australian Defence Force has been deployed to attempt to evacuate residents from isolated communities by air or sea, and drop off supplies. A ship with supplies for two weeks \u2013 1.6 tonnes of water, food, and 30,000 litres of fuel \u2013 has already left Melbourne. Fuel shortages, power cuts Further up the east coast, in New South Wales, locals and tourists are queuing for the supermarket to get basic supplies, and queuing for a payphone that, before the mobile phone towers ran out of both power and batteries, many would have considered obsolete. At Moruya, the IGA had to be barricaded to prevent people from looting. Some roads out of the fire-affected region in NSW opened on Wednesday, but some towns had run out of fuel. Many who wish to leave do not have enough in the tank to reach the next petrol station, and to drive in an area with active bushfires without a full tank is to risk getting stuck in an inferno. At Batemans Bay, petrol stations on the Princes Highway are either closed, or only accepting cash, because EFTPOS machines are down. But some ATMs are also down, making it impossible to get cash. Power remains cut to much of East Gippland and the far south coast of NSW. Gippsland Water were working on Tuesday to restore generator power to ensure the water would come back on, but the work is slow and made slower by the constant use of sprinklers by those still under direct fire threat. At Cann River, 50km west of Mallacoota, about 100 people are sheltering in the school and awaiting the arrival of a fire burning towards them from Goongerah. Local businesses are providing food for everyone, a Cann River local told the ABC, and they are all sharing water, but both electricity and mobile phone signal are patchy. They are cut off, as is the town of Buchan. A fire that started east of Cann River burned through Mallacoota on Tuesday night, destroying dozens of houses and leaving that town cut off as well. At Lake Tyers, an Aboriginal community about 25 minutes drive east of Lakes Entrance, the water ran out at 11am. Charmaine Sellings, who is both a paramedic and fire chief for the Gunai/Kurnai community, says she will have to fill the slip-on fire fighting unit from her daughter\u2019s pool before the northerly wind and high temperatures return on Saturday. That small firefighting tank, which sits on the back of her ute, is the only appliance to protect a community of more than 40 people, many of whom are elderly and have respiratory problems. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s a few houses out there without electricity, and as you can see we have just run out of water in the tanks,\u201d Sellings says. \u201cI am getting no information \u2013 the last visitor we had with fire information was on Sunday.\u201d Outside the community health centre, which has become the evacuation centre, a trailer full of canoes stands ready should the fire, which reached Nowa Nowa, 12km due north through thick and \u201cvery dry\u201d forest, reach the edge of the oval on Saturday. \u201cWe have got the boats out because we can accommodate at least 20 people, with 20 life jackets, if we have to get to the water,\u201d community member Kerry Tregonning says.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Defence Force will deploy a massive navy supply ship designed to deal with humanitarian crises to eastern Victoria and the NSW south coast as authorities struggle with the devastating bushfires in both states. Emergency services officials in Victoria said they may use that vessel, the 176-metre-long HMAS Choules, to evacuate residents who have been left stranded at the coastal town of Mallacoota after a large blaze forced 4,000 people to take shelter on the foreshore. It is due to arrive by Friday. Residents and visitors in Mallacoota, an inlet close to the NSW border, awoke to a scene of devastation on Wednesday, and some have reportedly been forced to sleep in their cars or public buildings. They have reported running low on food and water. At a media conference on Wednesday, Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said authorities were considering an evacuation by sea and would prioritise those in most need. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the current capacity for everyone at Mallacoota,\u201d he said. \u201cMy understanding it has a capacity of 1,000 people. If we were to do that, we would be prioritising those. \u201cWe are exploring all our options \u2026 and certainly to look at evacuating some people from Mallacoota by sea is an option we\u2019re seriously considering.\u201d On Tuesday the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, revealed the state had requested assistance from the military and on Wednesday the defence force outlined its plans. The role of defence has drawn increasing attention as some claim Australia requires a more coordinated, national response to the fires. In a lengthy statement, defence said it had been providing support to bushfire efforts in all states except Tasmania since 8 November. Later on Wednesday it was due to deploy an MRH-90 Taipan and two S-70A Black Hawk helicopters to an RAAF base at East Sale in Victoria. Those helicopters will be used to support firefighting efforts and humanitarian assistance and will later be joined by two CH-47 Chinooks and two Spartan aircraft to help firefighting efforts and to provide humanitarian assistance to isolated communities. Defence said HMAS Choules would be sent to the NSW south coast as well as Victoria, though it had not yet been determined how it would be used north of the border. Crisp said the Black Hawk helicopters would help crews get on top of the fires that have burned through more than 500,000 hectares across East Gippsland. \u201cThey give us additional capability,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re able to fly at night. Although not dropping water on fires at night, that will give us a great intelligence capability overnight.\u201d Fire crews remained concerned that a blaze at Corryong in north-east Victoria would merge with other fires on the NSW border. More than 7,000 homes across East Gippsland and 1,800 in the north-east of the state were without power and many were without phone coverage on Wednesday afternoon. It may take days to restore electricity to these communities. Residents in Mallacoota were told to boil their water to reduce public health risks. In NSW, the deputy police commissioner, Gary Worboys, said on Wednesday defence had been assisting state authorities for some time, including by providing military aircraft when local equipment was required. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple process of [crews] putting an application in to myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t knocked back one yet.\u201d Victorian police have been using boats to ferry water, food and other supplies to those isolated in Mallacoota. Andrews said on Wednesday the state had also taken the unprecedented step of using its own fleet of helicopters to transport fire crews in and out of the isolated areas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can\u2019t be removed any other way \u2013 we\u2019re essentially doing a shift change by the air,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>The last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people\u2019s vision of hell: a drunken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a> club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.</p> <p>I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business \u2013 sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it looms large.</p> <p>I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.</p> <p>But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/technology-happiness-found-in-app\" title=\"\">Nataly Kogan</a>, the author of <a href=\"https://www.happier.com/book/\" title=\"\">Happier Now</a>, says: \u201cHappiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves \u2013 they\u2019re actually at the core of what helps us live well.\u201d</p> <p>Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/happiness-feel-good-sleep-bpme-how-to-be-happy-a9000386.html\" title=\"\">better sleep</a>, better weight management, lower stress levels, <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-happiness-doctor/201706/happiness-and-your-immune-system\" title=\"\">an improved immune system</a> and even increased life expectancy.</p> <p>Despite the myriad benefits of joy \u2013 and the obvious incentive that it feels good \u2013 many of us don\u2019t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite; what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority \u2013 which may mean you need to let go of other commitments \u2013 and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.</p> <p>As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives \u2013 lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean \u2013 fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.</p> <p>Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. \u201cI lived with this idea of: \u2018I\u2019ll be happy when ...\u2019 as I know so many people do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.\u201d</p> <p>The gains have been established in research into baseline happiness \u2013 what in psychological literature is called our \u201chedonic set point\u201d. It varies from person to person, but the key point is that our baseline is only half determined by genetics. \u201cThat means the other 50% is up to us,\u201d says Kogan. \u201cI think that is incredibly empowering.\u201d</p> <p>So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?</p> <h2>Identify the problem</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3f6913c1388e0b2c9b2c967dabe9b6c4b24cc79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f6913c1388e0b2c9b2c967dabe9b6c4b24cc79/0_0_1181_1264/934.jpg\" alt=\"Segmented circle\" width=\"934\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Draw a large circle, divide it into segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Adam Higton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the \u201cwheel of life\u201d, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, divide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.</p> <p>There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.</p> <p>The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily the one you\u2019ve marked the lowest; it\u2019s the one you really value the most,\u201d says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.</p> <p>The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This \u201cnegativity bias\u201d distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. \u201cPeople can focus on things that are not \u2018as they should be\u2019 \u2026 We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.\u201d But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Kogan\u2019s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. \u201cBe specific, think broadly and don\u2019t judge your list as you write it.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what they are, or how many there are; the idea is to shift your mindset.</p> <p>Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it\u2019s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.\u201d</p> <p>Just three weeks of this consistent \u201cgratitude practice\u201d has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says <a href=\"https://www.shamashalidina.com/\" title=\"\">Shamash Alidina</a>, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness \u2013 and more attainable than people may think.</p> <p>Many equate mindfulness with clearing one\u2019s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina \u2013 but \u201cit\u2019s not about not thinking, it\u2019s about being aware\u201d. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your \u201cflexibility of attention\u201d, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. \u201cPeople associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it\u2019s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>What does it all mean?</h2> <p>Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose \u2013 to find what she calls \u201cthe bigger why\u201d among our deadlines and meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to be a happy human being if you don\u2019t feel like what you\u2019re doing is meaningful,\u201d she says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/05/how-to-tackle-your-to-do-lists-oliver-burkeman\" title=\"\">Assessing your to-do list</a> \u2013 particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating \u2013 through the lens of \u201cWho does this help?\u201d can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. \u201cWhen you say: \u2018This project is going to help a lot of people\u2019 \u2013 my team, customers, readers, whatever \u2013 your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.\u201d</p> <p>Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships \u2013 one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Play is an effective mood\u2011booster that is often neglected in adulthood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mindset shift encouraged by practising \u201cintentional kindness\u201d means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to \u201cbe kind\u201d. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn\u2019t spoken to in a while and telling them that she\u2019s thinking of them: \u201cI cannot tell you how much that means to people.\u201d</p> <h2>Family fortunes</h2> <p>It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like \u2013 and how to forge them \u2013 can be ambiguous. \u201cHappiness can feel very abstract,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/11/gretchen-rubin-want-to-be-happier-four-tendencies\" title=\"\">Gretchen Rubin</a>, the author of <a href=\"https://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-happiness-project/about-the-book/\" title=\"\">The Happiness Project</a>. \u201cMy approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin\u2019s family email each other an update on the \u201cboring everyday stuff\u201d of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. \u201cWe realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected \u2013 and it\u2019s absolutely working.\u201d</p> <p>Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (\u201cI always think that I don\u2019t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,\u201d says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up \u2013 and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. \u201cMy way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year \u2013 are there things you can do to be happier?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if there are, why not do them?\u201d</p> <h2>Home truths</h2> <p>If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, \u201couter order contributes to inner calm\u201d, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. \u201cIt feels trivial \u2013 and yet over and over people say: \u2018When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,\u2019\u201d says Rubin. \u201cLike making your bed every morning \u2013 it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>Often this is understood as minimalism \u2013 but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests \u201ccan be very pleasing\u201d.</p> <p>Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of <a href=\"https://www.aestheticsofjoy.com/\" title=\"\">The Aesthetics of Joy</a>, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what\u2019s trendy, what the design books say,\u201d she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own \u201cjoy meters\u201d. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0be42ac8eed492a57905f0bf2b51b3bed98742b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0be42ac8eed492a57905f0bf2b51b3bed98742b/0_0_1181_1264/934.jpg\" alt=\"Bunk beds\" width=\"934\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Control is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Adam Higton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: \u201cNot only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you\u2019re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.\u201d</p> <p>Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/st-patricks-day\" title=\"\">St Patrick\u2019s Day</a> with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness\u2019s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.</p> <p>To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: \u201cNotice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?\u201d</p> <p>The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. \u201cOwning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,\u201d says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog <a href=\"https://www.becomingminimalist.com/becoming-minimalist-start-here/\" title=\"\">Becoming Minimalist</a>. Being intentional with the things that we own \u2013 and, by extension, our money \u2013 means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. \u201cMinimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,\u201d says Becker.</p> <h2>Early to bed</h2> <p>Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management.

      "bodyText": "The last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people\u2019s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago. I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business \u2013 sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it looms large. I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control. But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: \u201cHappiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves \u2013 they\u2019re actually at the core of what helps us live well.\u201d Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy. Despite the myriad benefits of joy \u2013 and the obvious incentive that it feels good \u2013 many of us don\u2019t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite; what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority \u2013 which may mean you need to let go of other commitments \u2013 and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously. As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives \u2013 lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean \u2013 fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm. Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. \u201cI lived with this idea of: \u2018I\u2019ll be happy when ...\u2019 as I know so many people do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.\u201d The gains have been established in research into baseline happiness \u2013 what in psychological literature is called our \u201chedonic set point\u201d. It varies from person to person, but the key point is that our baseline is only half determined by genetics. \u201cThat means the other 50% is up to us,\u201d says Kogan. \u201cI think that is incredibly empowering.\u201d So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year? Identify the problem Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the \u201cwheel of life\u201d, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, divide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess. There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction. The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily the one you\u2019ve marked the lowest; it\u2019s the one you really value the most,\u201d says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled. The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This \u201cnegativity bias\u201d distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. \u201cPeople can focus on things that are not \u2018as they should be\u2019 \u2026 We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.\u201d But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds. The big picture Kogan\u2019s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. \u201cBe specific, think broadly and don\u2019t judge your list as you write it.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what they are, or how many there are; the idea is to shift your mindset. Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it\u2019s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.\u201d Just three weeks of this consistent \u201cgratitude practice\u201d has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness \u2013 and more attainable than people may think. Many equate mindfulness with clearing one\u2019s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina \u2013 but \u201cit\u2019s not about not thinking, it\u2019s about being aware\u201d. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your \u201cflexibility of attention\u201d, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. \u201cPeople associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it\u2019s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,\u201d he says. What does it all mean? Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose \u2013 to find what she calls \u201cthe bigger why\u201d among our deadlines and meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to be a happy human being if you don\u2019t feel like what you\u2019re doing is meaningful,\u201d she says. Assessing your to-do list \u2013 particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating \u2013 through the lens of \u201cWho does this help?\u201d can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. \u201cWhen you say: \u2018This project is going to help a lot of people\u2019 \u2013 my team, customers, readers, whatever \u2013 your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.\u201d Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships \u2013 one of the most common factors in job satisfaction. The mindset shift encouraged by practising \u201cintentional kindness\u201d means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to \u201cbe kind\u201d. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn\u2019t spoken to in a while and telling them that she\u2019s thinking of them: \u201cI cannot tell you how much that means to people.\u201d Family fortunes It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like \u2013 and how to forge them \u2013 can be ambiguous. \u201cHappiness can feel very abstract,\u201d says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. \u201cMy approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.\u201d In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin\u2019s family email each other an update on the \u201cboring everyday stuff\u201d of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. \u201cWe realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected \u2013 and it\u2019s absolutely working.\u201d Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (\u201cI always think that I don\u2019t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,\u201d says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up \u2013 and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. \u201cMy way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year \u2013 are there things you can do to be happier?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if there are, why not do them?\u201d Home truths If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, \u201couter order contributes to inner calm\u201d, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. \u201cIt feels trivial \u2013 and yet over and over people say: \u2018When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,\u2019\u201d says Rubin. \u201cLike making your bed every morning \u2013 it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.\u201d Often this is understood as minimalism \u2013 but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests \u201ccan be very pleasing\u201d. Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what\u2019s trendy, what the design books say,\u201d she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own \u201cjoy meters\u201d. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door. Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: \u201cNot only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you\u2019re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.\u201d Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick\u2019s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness\u2019s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults. To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: \u201cNotice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?\u201d The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. \u201cOwning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,\u201d says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own \u2013 and, by extension, our money \u2013 means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. \u201cMinimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,\u201d says Becker. Early to bed Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. \u201cSometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,\u201d says Rubin. \u201cA happy life is not one that\u2019s focused only on the present.\u201d Embracing boredom In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as \u201cbaths and candles\u201d: \u201cI love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.\u201d It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette. Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like \u2013 and recognising that it is down to you. \u201cPart of this exercise is to recognise that there isn\u2019t anything out there that is going to make you feel good 100% of the time,\u201d says Kogan. \u201cThat\u2019s actually great news, because when we let go of this particular idea of happiness we give ourselves more opportunities to be in alignment with our lives.\u201d",

London fashion week went ahead as planned but the final day was marked by a symbolic funeral where XR Fashion members grieved for the industry.</p> <p>Never has the fashion and textile industry been such a focus of attention, primarily because of its disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2019/09/12/fast-facts-about-fast-fashion/\">according to Greenpeace</a>, more than that produced by international shipping. In August, 32 companies representing around 150 brands signed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/23/fashion-pact-houses-launch-manifesto-to-improve-green-credentials\">Fashion Pact at the G7 summit</a>, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to ban virgin plastic from packaging \u2013 by 2030.

The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-50703659\">fire in December at the New Delhi bag factory</a>, where around 100 people were sleeping overnight, resulted in more than 40 deaths. \u201cSix years on from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/24/bangladeshi-police-target-garment-workers-union-rana-plaza-five-years-on\">Rana Plaza factory collapse</a>, most brands still have far too little visibility of their supply chains,\u201d said Carry Somers, co-founder of the organisation behind the #whomademyclothes campaign, Fashion Revolution. \u201cTransparency leads to accountability which leads to change.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/24/the-fashion-transparency-index-2019-report-ranks-worlds-biggest-brands\">Fashion Transparency Index</a> is also pushing the industry towards greater transparency with year on year improvement for many of the brands listed.

      "bodyText": "Twenty nineteen was a year of reckoning for the fashion industry, during which it was forced to take stock of its waste, pollution, senseless burning of excess product, and exploitative business practices. But 12 months on, what has changed? Has there been any tangible improvement? Well, yes and no. After all, this was the year when a \u00a31 bikini went on sale in the name of \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d, a staggering piece of double-speak from its maker, the aptly named Missguided, which was criticised over the potential environmental and social costs of such a product. While some brands continue to pump out clothes like there is no tomorrow (which if they carry on, there won\u2019t be), many of us are rethinking the quantities of clothes we buy. Greta Thunberg was i-D\u2019s most memorable cover star, \u201cthe girl who changed the world\u201d, who turned up for the interview dressed in a purple puffer jacket, bright-pink snow trousers and rubber boots. \u201cHer wardrobe is limited, she doesn\u2019t want new things,\u201d the magazine reported. In July, the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled Stockholm fashion week to explore more sustainable options, and Extinction Rebellion called for London Fashion Week to do the same. London fashion week went ahead as planned but the final day was marked by a symbolic funeral where XR Fashion members grieved for the industry. Never has the fashion and textile industry been such a focus of attention, primarily because of its disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year according to Greenpeace, more than that produced by international shipping. In August, 32 companies representing around 150 brands signed the Fashion Pact at the G7 summit, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to ban virgin plastic from packaging \u2013 by 2030. Considering that, according to the UN, we only have 10 years left to limit global warming to 1.5C, these are hollow targets. It\u2019s not only the environment that the industry continues to disregard. The fire in December at the New Delhi bag factory, where around 100 people were sleeping overnight, resulted in more than 40 deaths. \u201cSix years on from the Rana Plaza factory collapse, most brands still have far too little visibility of their supply chains,\u201d said Carry Somers, co-founder of the organisation behind the #whomademyclothes campaign, Fashion Revolution. \u201cTransparency leads to accountability which leads to change.\u201d The Fashion Transparency Index is also pushing the industry towards greater transparency with year on year improvement for many of the brands listed. In a welcome move towards transparency, H&amp;M announced back in April that it would share details such as production country, supplier names, and names and address of factories with its customers. It has been a year of big statements by famous names, perhaps the boldest being Gucci\u2019s claim in September that it was now carbon neutral. The greenwash radar went into overdrive. \u201cThe best way to get to zero emissions is to close the company, but then 18,000 people will lose their jobs. When we talk about the environment, we need to keep that in mind as well,\u201d said CEO Marco Bizzarri. \u201cOffsetting is better than not doing anything\u2026\u201d While some industry leaders are at least starting to send out positive messages, policy makers are not so enthusiastic. In June, the government rejected recommendations made by the environmental audit select committee to regulate the fast fashion industry, including a charge of 1p for each garment to fund better clothing collection and sorting, and a ban on incinerating unsold clothes or sending them to landfill. \u201cThe government is out of step with the public, who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill,\u201d said the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chaired the committee. Despite the government\u2019s inability to legislate, fashion activism was on the rise. In September, 62,000 people took part in Oxfam\u2019s Secondhand September campaign, pledging to buy nothing new in an attempt to stem the flow of the 11m items of clothing sent to landfill every week in the UK. And an alternative to Black Friday is gaining momentum in the form of Buy Nothing Day. \u201cIn a world of overconsumption and fast fashion, one of the most radical things we can do is to keep our clothes in use for as long as possible,\u201d declared the designer Christopher Raeburn, who closed the tills at his two stores and spent the day doing on-the-spot clothing repairs instead. The willingness to embrace new ways of shopping that disrupt the high-volume, fast-fashion model, such as resale platforms (Vestiaire Collective and Depop both popped up at Selfridges this year and continue to grow their audiences) and rental (witness the takeover of the (British) Fashion Awards in December by rental platform My Wardrobe HQ) \u2013 is tangible.

      "bodyText": "In 2004, the Guardian correctly predicted that the developed world\u2019s overreliance on meat would be one of the most pressing issues for the survival of our species. \u201cBritons need to say goodbye to burgers and meat,\u201d we wrote, \u201cbecause the overemphasis on meat in the western diet is one of the things that stifles sustainable food production.\u201d Thankfully, the past decade and a half has seen an unprecedented interest in meat-free diets. In 2004, veganism was seen as a fussy, faddish lifestyle choice. Now, buoyed by blockbuster documentaries such as Cowspiracy and What the Health, and celebrities such as Ellie Goulding and Ariana Grande, it has never been so popular. According to the Vegan Society, 600,000 Britons are vegan. In 2006, this figure was just 150,000. Demand for vegan food is at unprecedented levels: in 2018, the UK launched more vegan products than any other nation; in 2019, 250,000 people signed up for the Veganuary challenge, pledging to avoid all meat and dairy for the month of January. For those not willing to make the jump to full veganism, one in three Britons had at least reduced their meat consumption in 2018. But there is still a long way to go. The west\u2019s overconsumption of meat and dairy continues to fuel global warming. Livestock is responsible for approximately 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions; 70% of global deforestation takes place in order to grow animal feed. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet and Health determined that substantial dietary shifts must take place by 2050. \u201cGlobal consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes will have to double, and consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar will have to be reduced by more than 50%,\u201d the panel of experts judged. By 2050, meat-eating could seem like a throwback, according to some experts. \u201cOur current method of growing crops to feed to animals so we can eat animals is shockingly inefficient,\u201d says Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute, which works to develop alternatives to meat. \u201cBy 2050, [almost] all meat will be plant-based, or cultivated.\u201d Plant-based \u201cmeat\u201d is already here. The Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger are widely available, but Friedrich predicts a widening of the products on offer to consumers. \u201cWe\u2019ll have plant-based meat that doesn\u2019t exist yet, whether it\u2019s pork chops, steaks, tuna or salmon.\u201d Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation, thinks that plant-based substitutes will find their way into processed foods, without consumers being any the wiser. \u201cPlant-based alternatives to animal protein will appear automatically in foods we eat, without consumers having to change their habits.\u201d The real challenge will be persuading consumers to embrace cultivated meat. Also known as lab-grown meat, this is developed from animal or fish cells in the nutrient bath of a \u201cbioreactor\u201d. It is not yet on the market, but at least 40 private companies are working on cultivated-meat alternatives. In the UK, scientists at the University of Bath are growing bacon on blades of grass. The California startup JUST has created chicken nuggets in a bioreactor. Friedrich is optimistic that we will all be eating cultivated meat by 2050. \u201cThere won\u2019t be factory farms or abattoirs in 2050,\u201d he predicts. \u201cPeople will look back at the idea of growing live animals for meat in the same way that we look back at horse-drawn carriages for getting from London to Brussels.\u201d But we won\u2019t entirely stop eating meat from animals reared for slaughter. \u201cThere will be some heritage breed farms and slaughterhouses where the animals are treated well,\u201d Friedrich concedes. But it will be a limited market. If this all sounds like science fiction, strap yourselves in for the predictions of the food designer and futurist Chlo\u00e9 Rutzerveld. \u201cWe\u2019ll skip all of our current existing foods and switch towards a whole new eating system where we build food with microorganisms,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of growing crops or raising animals, we\u2019ll use microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, yeast and microalgae to directly produce the carbs, proteins and fats we need.\u201d This food will again be produced in bioreactors, before being filtered and dried into powders.

At Malua Bay in New South Wales, children, their parents and grandparents were trapped for a day and night between fires and the sea. They\u2019re safe now but it was a close call. Already, these scenes are part of the national imagination. Among Australians of a certain age, they stir memories of a Hollywood potboiler about the end of the world filmed 60 years ago in Melbourne. On the Beach starred Ava Gardner, Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire. The remake stars us. One of the duties of a leader is to find the words in times like these. So many have died. So much has been destroyed. But how can Scott Morrison speak to the experience of the country if he can\u2019t admit we are living through unique times? He says instead: \u201cWe have faced these disasters before.\u201d Watch and act, prime minister. Watch and act. If Morrison could face the truth, he might speak not only to his country but the world. If Australia were taking effective action against climate change, this catastrophe would give us the right to demand better of the great rogue states on climate, China and the US. We\u2019re doing our bit, he says as the country burns and the world looks on with a mix of pity and scorn. For empathy, we turn to the plain speech of fire chiefs as they count the toll, giving long lists day after day of destruction, bravery, death and lucky escape in the face of fires these men and women have never seen before. And on television every night, with looks of professional apology, weathermen and women standing in front of scarlet maps of Australia tell us over and over again the news that makes sense of all these woes: according to the best forecasts, we have at least weeks to wait for rain.

The North Korean leader told a four-day meeting of party officials in Pyongyang that the test ban, which Kim agreed to in talks with the US president, was no longer needed, state media said on Wednesday.

We\u2019ve lived up to our commitments. We continue to hold out hope that he will live up to his as well.\u201d North Korea has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland and has carried out six nuclear tests. A self-imposed ban has been at the centre of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has involved three meetings between him and Trump, but little tangible progress. The US had made \u201cgangster-like demands\u201d in the talks process, Kim said, including continuing joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions. \u201cThe world will witness a new strategic weapon possessed by [North Korea] in the near future,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US and guaranteeing our long-term security.\u201d Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile \u201cto Donald Trump\u2019s head\u201d but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire. Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim\u2018s \u201cpromise\u201d to him not to carry them out, and played down launches of shorter-range weapons. Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North Korean leader\u2019s announcement on Wednesday came after the United States missed a year-end deadline for a restart of denuclearisation talks. Kim convened the rare meeting of the ruling party\u2019s policy-making committee on Saturday as the US had not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations, dismissing the deadline as artificial. \u201cThere is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,\u201d the official KCNA news agency cited Kim telling top ruling party officials. \u201cThe world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,\u201d he added, using the acronym for the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The announcement preceded Kim\u2019s annual new year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future. It will be Kim\u2019s eighth such address after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather \u2013 North Korea\u2019s founding leader, Kim Il-sung \u2013 but discontinued during his father\u2019s rule. Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability. \u201cThe US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,\u201d KCNA cited him as saying. Washington had \u201cconducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop\u201d and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North. \u201cWe can never sell our dignity,\u201d he added, saying Pyongyang would \u201cshift to a shocking actual action to make [the US] pay for the pains sustained by our people\u201d. For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up. \u201cNorth Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump\u2019s head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,\u201d said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington. \u201cKim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,\u201d he added. \u201cHe is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions.\u201d But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with \u201cmore sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury threats coming from Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account\u201d. The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test. An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the North\u2019s key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its backyard. But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues. In December China and Russia \u2013 another key economic partner for the North \u2013 proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts said Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow.",

He said: \u201cWe could see some widespread showers and thunderstorms through the south-east of the country, but it\u2019s going to be patchy and it\u2019s uncertain whether it gets to those fire sites.\u201d How said Wednesday was much cooler across the south-east after a run of hot days, bringing brief relief for Tasmania, Victoria and NSW. \u201cFrom tomorrow, we start to see the heat build again from southern parts of WA and South Australia. \u201cFriday is a very hot day across South Australia and Victoria with Adelaide getting up to 42C on Friday. Inland Victoria and South Australia will be getting into the mid-40s.\u201d He said South Australia would experience \u201celevated fire dangers\u201d on Friday, with forecast high temperatures including 45C for Renmark and 46C for Port Augusta. Mildura in Victoria could reach 44C. Saturday was already shaping up to be a day of high fire risk for eastern Victoria and New South Wales with temperatures in the high 30s and early 40s across areas that are currently burning. \u201cThat is going to push up fire dangers in Gippsland and southern parts of New South Wales,\u201d How said. Canberra may reach 42C on Saturday, with temperatures in the western suburbs of Sydney forecast to rise as high as 45C. The best chance of rainfall over the next week could come on Sunday, with lower temperatures and patchy showers and thunderstorms moving from South Australia and into northern parts of Victoria and southern NSW. In the north and north-west of the country, there could be more significant rain as a monsoon trough moves south over the next two days, that will be \u201cgood news for those in the Top End,\u201d How said. Forecasters were also watching for a possible tropical low developing in waters south of Indonesia towards the end of this week and early next week.",

Here is what we know so far about the state of the fires on 1 January 2020. At least four people have died in NSW, while another person remains unaccounted for in that state. Authorities in Victoria hold grave fears for four people after fires tore through large swathes of East Gippsland on Tuesday. NSW police confirmed the fourth death on Wednesday, saying in a statement that a body had been found at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola. The two men killed in fires at Cobargo have been named as Patrick Salway and his father, Robert Salway. It is expected hundreds of homes have been destroyed on the NSW south coast, though the RFS says it is still conducting assessments. The ABC reported 50 properties lost in the town of Conjola Park. Victorian authorities say about 50 properties have been lost across Buchan, Sarsfield and Mallacoota, but that figure is expected to rise. More than 100 fires are burning in NSW, but conditions have eased and all fires have been downgraded to watch and act level. Three fires are burning at emergency level in Victoria as a dozen burn across the east and north-east. Firefighters in NSW are using the improved conditions to contain existing fires and prepare for Saturday, which is tipped to rival Tuesday\u2019s fire danger levels.",

My honest summer reading stack would look something like this: The first two chapters of a weighty tome I keep saying I\u2019ll read but will more than likely never finish Three Georgette Heyer romances, back to back (sleep optional) Sundry articles spat up by algorithm on Facebook Half of a trashy thriller found on the sparse bookshelf of a beachside AirBnB The new Ann Patchett, because there\u2019s an exception to every rule and she can do no wrong I am an advocate of reading widely and well. I\u2019m an advocate of reading important books, not just fun ones. I\u2019m even an advocate of occasionally filtering day-to-day life through a flattering sepia lens. But I\u2019ve come to think of reading like a muscle: it needs regular exercise in order to be capable of running a marathon or getting through that doorstopper \u2013 but it also needs rest. Sometimes you just need to do an easy lap of the neighbourhood, maybe stopping to look at the birds for a bit instead of keeping track of your pace, then eat a good meal and zonk out. And sometimes you need to do absolutely nothing whatsoever. And that\u2019s OK too.",

Yet every time we reach out and connect with someone, it is an act of heroism. Don\u2019t underestimate it.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be someone you know. It could be someone you\u2019ve always wanted to connect with but never have. It could be someone you really disagree with.\u201d</p> <p>Connecting with others could involve joining a voluntary organisation or a charity, sorting donations at a food bank or joining a lifeboat crew, Welby says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we hear someone described as a good Samaritan, we think about that person taking the time to help another. But it\u2019s a story told by Jesus about someone taking the risk of reaching out to another who was very different to them. Yes, the person needed help \u2013 but they also needed connection.\u201d</p> <p>He says Jesus \u201ctook the risk of connecting with people who were separated from him\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viamedia.news/2019/12/31/a-low-dishonest-decade/\">In a forthright article</a> marking the start of a new decade, Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said the past decade had been \u201clow and dishonest\u201d.</p> <p>He wrote on Viamedia: \u201cJust as in 1939 (or still earlier, in 1914), the complacent assumptions of a sunny liberalism have been shaken out.
