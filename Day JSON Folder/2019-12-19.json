This damages the institution of the presidency, damages the reputation of our country, and damages both the spirit and the future of our people.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Trump won the 2016 election with <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/\">81% of the white Christian evangelical vote</a>, and support of evangelicals like Jerry Falwell Jr., <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/21/evangelical-christians-trump-liberty-university-jerry-falwell\">president of Liberty University</a>. Evangelical supporters were able to make peace with Trump\u2019s history of marital infidelity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">\u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d</a> comments with his hard-right court appointments and Supreme Court nominees, but Galli pointed out the hypocrisy of this in his editorial, writing, \u201cthis president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals,\u201d Galli wrote. \u201cHe himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Galli noted that Christianity Today typically does not weigh in on politics, but that the magazine wrote a similar editorial in 1998, when <strong>Bill Clinton </strong>was impeached. \u201cUnfortunately, the words that we applied to Mr. Clinton 20 years ago apply almost perfectly to our current president,\u201d he wrote. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTo the many evangelicals who continue to support Mr. Trump in spite of his blackened moral record, we might say this: Remember who you are and whom you serve,\u201d Galli wrote. \u201cConsider how your justification of Mr. Trump influences your witness to your Lord and Savior. Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump\u2019s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency. If we don\u2019t reverse course now, will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come?\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfbfac38f08c3972263dac0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T22:37:34.915Z\">10.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> weighs in on <strong>Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/dec/19/donald-trump-impeachment-news-house-of-representatives-senate-live?page=with:block-5dfba3d28f085eda5c10ac88#block-5dfba3d28f085eda5c10ac88\">comments</a> on US Representative <strong>John Dingell</strong>:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1207789548027162624\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump is a coward who tears down others to make himself feel powerful.

Christianity Today, the evangelical Christian magazine founded by televangelist Billy Graham, called for Donald Trump\u2019s removal from office following the president\u2019s impeachment, marking a significant split from what has typically been Trump\u2019s staunch base. Editor-in-chief Mark Galli wrote that \u201cthe facts in this instance are unambiguous: The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president\u2019s political opponents.\u201d \u201cThat is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe believe the impeachment hearings have made it absolutely clear, in a way the Mueller investigation did not, that President Trump has abused his authority for personal gain and betrayed his constitutional oath,\u201d Galli continued. \u201cThe impeachment hearings have illuminated the president\u2019s moral deficiencies for all to see. This damages the institution of the presidency, damages the reputation of our country, and damages both the spirit and the future of our people.\u201d Trump won the 2016 election with 81% of the white Christian evangelical vote, and support of evangelicals like Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University. Evangelical supporters were able to make peace with Trump\u2019s history of marital infidelity and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d comments with his hard-right court appointments and Supreme Court nominees, but Galli pointed out the hypocrisy of this in his editorial, writing, \u201cthis president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration.\u201d \u201cHe has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals,\u201d Galli wrote. \u201cHe himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.\u201d Galli noted that Christianity Today typically does not weigh in on politics, but that the magazine wrote a similar editorial in 1998, when Bill Clinton was impeached. \u201cUnfortunately, the words that we applied to Mr. Clinton 20 years ago apply almost perfectly to our current president,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo the many evangelicals who continue to support Mr. Trump in spite of his blackened moral record, we might say this: Remember who you are and whom you serve,\u201d Galli wrote. \u201cConsider how your justification of Mr. Trump influences your witness to your Lord and Savior. Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump\u2019s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency. If we don\u2019t reverse course now, will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come?\u201d Bernie Sanders weighs in on Donald Trump\u2019s comments on US Representative John Dingell: \u201cPutin told me.\u201d That\u2019s what a former senior White House official says Donald Trump stated when expressing his theory that Ukraine tried to prevent him from winning the 2016 election, according to the Washington Post. After meeting privately in July 2017 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Trump grew more insistent that Ukraine worked to defeat him, according to multiple former officials familiar with his assertions. The president\u2019s intense resistance to the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 campaign \u2014 and the blame he cast instead on a rival country \u2014 led many of his advisers to think that Putin himself helped spur the idea of Ukraine\u2019s culpability, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Amid speculation that he\u2019ll leave his post to run for Senate, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, gets a new deputy. The Senate voted 90-3 to confirm Stephen Biegun to be the deputy secretary, according to the Associated Press. The position was previously filled by John Sullivan, who was confirmed to be the new ambassador to Russia. Should Pompeo step down to run for Senate in his home state of Kansas next year, Biegun, a former Ford Motor Company executive who currently serves as the US special representative for North Korea, \u201cis widely expected to fill the secretary of state job at least on an interim basis\u201d, the Associated Press reports. Hi all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over the blog very briefly before some adults get on national television to yell about things. Let\u2019s keep it calm, OK? The question remains unanswered, as Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet sent articles of impeachment, the formal charges against Trump, to the Senate. Once in the Senate, lawmakers will begin a trial. A major question surrounding that trial is who the impeachment \u201cmanagers\u201d will be. We know they will be House Democrats, but Pelosi declined to say who she would select on Thursday. She also said she is holding on to articles of impeachment until she knows whether there will be a fair trial in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is certain to be adversarial, and delivered a full throated attack on Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation this morning. Notably, he did not defend President Trump on the facts of the case. Incredibly, it\u2019s also the sixth Democratic presidential debate tonight. The new Democratic presidential field, winnowed by party requirements to qualify for televised debates, will be whiter than in months past. A new Iowa poll shows more voters are beginning to dislike b billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg. Steyer will be on stage tonight. And one last thing... The Democrat-led House also approved the renegotiated US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a win for the Trump administration. The Senate will likely take up the measure in the New Year. More from AP: One day after its historic impeachment votes, the Democratic-led House gave President Donald Trump an overwhelming bipartisan victory Thursday on a renegotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. By a 385-41 vote, the House approved a bill that puts in place terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The legislation passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her colleagues won key concessions from an administration anxious to pass the trade deal before next year\u2019s election season makes that task more difficult. The deal is projected to have only a modest impact on the economy. But it gives lawmakers from both parties the chance to support an agreement sought by farmers, ranchers and business owners anxious to move past the months of trade tensions that have complicated spending and hiring decisions. The GOP-controlled Senate probably will take up the legislation when members return to Washington after the holidays and after dealing with impeachment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s speech this morning, which repeatedly invoked the importance of \u201cprecedent,\u201d has prompted a discussion about former US Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland on Twitter. Garland was President Obama\u2019s nominee for Supreme Court, but McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings, breaking with... ahem, tradition. Anti-impeachment Democrat, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, has officially switched parties to become a Republican. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: President Donald Trump announced Thursday that Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Democrat who broke with his party to vote against Trump\u2019s impeachment, is becoming a Republican. \u201cJeff will be joining the Republican Party,\u201d Trump announced during an Oval Office appearance with Van Drew, who told his staff over the weekend that he would become a Republican. Van Drew on Wednesday voted against the articles of impeachment as a Democrat, a move that aided GOP attempts to depict Democrats as divided on the matter while Republicans voted unanimously against impeachment. \u201cI believe that this is just a better fit for me,\u201d Van Drew said of joining the GOP. Trump announced that he is endorsing Van Drew for reelection, calling him \u201ca tremendous asset for the party.\u201d At this historic moment ... \u2026 a message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what\u2019s at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d When a country\u2019s constitutional foundation is under threat it needs robust, independent institutions to help protect it. If ever there was a need for media oversight and public scrutiny it is now. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. But with your help we can continue to keep it center stage. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. A conservative radio station canceled a show that made a joke about school shootings. Here is more from the Associated Press: A Denver, Colorado radio station has canceled a scheduled program after one of the hosts said a school shooting would help break up media coverage of impeachment proceedings. Chuck Bonniwell from the show \u201cChuck &amp; Julie\u201d was complaining Tuesday about an abundance of media coverage on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. \u201cYou wish for a nice school shooting to interrupt the monotony,\u201d Bonniwell said. His co-host and wife Julie Hayden immediately reprimanded him and told listeners not to call in. Radio executives immediately canceled the show. KNUS-AM gave an official statement on its website stating that the 1-4 p.m. weekday slot would now feature the Salem Network show America First hosted by Sebastian Gorka. Bonniwell said Wednesday his comment was meant as a joke. \u201cMaking a statement like that is just unbelievable to me, especially our family. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said John Castillo, the father of the high school student killed last May at a high school in suburban Denver when two students opened fire and also wounded eight others. Castillo also told KDVR-TV: \u201cPeople always say they\u2019re sorry - we\u2019re sorry for your loss, sorry for the statement we made - make it your life work to prove it. Do something different. Advocate for good.\u201d KNUS-AM is owned by Salem Media Group, which specializes in Christian and conservative content. Here\u2019s more on what to expect from today\u2019s Democratic presidential candidate debate tonight, from Guardian reporter Sam Levin: Looming over the high-stakes debate are those who won\u2019t be in attendance. The Democratic National Committee said candidates had to hit at least 4% in four national polls or at least 6% in two early-state polls in the weeks leading up to the event in order to qualify. The candidates also had to attract at least 200,000 donors. That leaves no black or Latino candidates among the nearly all-white lineup of Democratic frontrunners. Senator Cory Booker and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro both failed to qualify for the debate, and Senator Kamala Harris recently ended her campaign amid polling showing her far behind in California, her home state. Also absent from the event will be Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire who made a late entrance into the race last monthand has poured an estimated $13.5m into TV ads in California. Steyer, the other billionaire in the race, has spent roughly $1.6m on ads in the state. Republicans in Ohio are exploring whether to repeal the death penalty, and Republican State House speaker Larry Householder has provided a description of his deliberations to the Associated Press: Well, I don\u2019t think we want to come back to hanging, and I don\u2019t think shootings would be good,\u201d he said. \u201cElectrocution is sort of off the table. I don\u2019t know what the method would be. It seems like chemical injection is not working out very well for us, so I don\u2019t know what else there is.\u201d State House Republicans are discussing abolition because the drug cocktail used to execute inmates has been difficult to obtain. This is the same state caucus that introduced a bill to make \u201caggravated abortion murder\u201d a capital offense, and would have required doctors to \u201cre-implant\u201d ectopic pregnancies, which is not possible. Former New York City Mayor and billionaire Mike Bloomberg released a plan to fix American healthcare \u201conce and for all\u201d. Just one of the tenets of his plan is to charge retirees $300 per year to receive vision, dental and hearing coverage. Currently, Medicare covers health the majority of health expenses for seniors and the disabled, but exempts those categories. People qualify for Medicare at age 65. Here is more from a 2016 NPR story: What ends up happening is that almost everybody, when they get to be 65, is sort of on their own and they have to pay for dental care out of pocket,\u201d says Dr. Michael Helgeson, chief executive officer of Apple Tree Dental. More than one-third of low-income seniors, or people with incomes of $23,000 or less, have tooth decay NPR reported. At the time the story was published, more than half of all people on Medicare lived with incomes below $26,200. An analysis by Kaiser Family Foundation found 21.4 million seniors live in poverty. The Republican-controlled Senate removed an explicit mention of \u201cwhite nationalists\u201d from screening provision in military spending bill. A new poll suggests Iowans are growing weary of billionaires. The Iowa State University shows a familiar pattern of two tiers of candidates, with billionaires at the bottom. \u201cIowa Democrats have been unwelcoming to [Mike] Bloomberg ever since he announced his candidacy, but the negative opinions of [Tom] Steyer have increased,\u201d said Dave Peterson, a professor and Whitaker Lindgren faculty fellow in political science who organizes the poll. \u201cMany of the respondents seem to think of them as a pair, indicating opposition to the billionaires in the race.\u201d Of the pair, only Steyer will appear on stage tonight. The poll surveyed the attitudes of more than 600 likely Iowa caucus-goers online. At this historic moment ... \u2026 a message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what\u2019s at stake.

A Democrat in a conservative New Jersey district is expected to announce, after days of reporting, he is officially changing parties. Following on our earlier post about Georgia canceling a small portion of its voter purge, New Jersey restored the voting rights of 80,000 people yesterday. The House has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate. What if it never sends them? The lawyers are looking at it. Just a few days after Georgia purged 313,000 voters and roughly 4% of electorate from rolls... Pelosi also addressed President Trump\u2019s comments about former US Representative John Dingell, now deceased. \u201cLet us pray for the president,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe president clearly is insecure when it comes to states-persons... Cruelty is not wit, just because he gets a laugh for saying cruel things doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s funny. It\u2019s not funny at all, it\u2019s sad.\u201d Trump said at a rally in Michigan, Dingell\u2019s home state, that Dingell was \u201clooking up\u201d from Hell. At this historic moment ... \u2026 a message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what\u2019s at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d When a country\u2019s constitutional foundation is under threat it needs robust, independent institutions to help protect it. If ever there was a need for media oversight and public scrutiny it is now. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. But with your help we can continue to keep it center stage. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. The next step in the impeachment proceedings is for House speaker Nancy Pelosi to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, where there will be a trial, and to select \u201cimpeachment managers\u201d from House representatives to present the case to the Senate. She said Thursday she would not announce who might be chosen until terms of the trial are set with the Senate. \u201cWe would hope there would be a fair process just as we would hope they would honor the constitution,\u201d Pelosi said about Senate Republicans. \u201cIt reminded me that our founders, when they wrote the Constitution, they suspected there could be a rogue president. I don\u2019t think they suspected we could have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the senate at the same time,\u201d she said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gets right to the impeachment today: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d Another familiar talking point from McConnell: While we wait for Speaker Pelosi to come on, here\u2019s a couple more things happening in Washington DC today: White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told Good Morning America daily press briefings are not being held because reporters used it as an opportunity for \u201ctheater\u201d and to \u201csell books\u201d. Grisham\u2019s predecessor stopped daily briefings. Trump ally Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina will not seek reelection \u2013 his name is reportedly being floated for positions inside the administration. Democrats will try to pry voter\u2019s attention from impeachment drama tonight, as they hold a primary debate in Los Angeles. The field is narrowing and getting whiter. We are zooming right into the next speech this morning. At 10:45am ET House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will speak at her weekly press conference. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is speaking now, and making the case for the US Senate to hear from four witnesses for four hours each during the trial. He argued McConnell is trying to block testimony from all witnesses. \u201cIs the president\u2019s case so weak that none of the president\u2019s men can defend him under oath?\u201d said Schumer. \u201cThe nation turns its eyes to the Senate, what will it see?\u201d The president, in the past, has argued he has \u201cabsolute immunity.\u201d \u201cIf the Republicans proceed with the majority leaders\u2019 scheme to sweep these charges under the rug, they will be creating a precedent that will long be remembered as one of the senate\u2019s darkest chapters,\u201d said Schumer. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is now responding to McConnell\u2019s speech... We will bring you live updates here. \u201cHouse Democrats may be too afraid to even transmit their shoddy work product to the Senate,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cLooks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country, and second guessing whether they want to do to trial.\u201d A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves just what is at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d There has never been a more urgent demonstration of the need for an independent press in the US. With your support, we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight. At a time when both media and politics are scarred by polarization, the Guardian remains an independent voice. Freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders, our independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. \u201cLong after the partisan fever of this moment has broken the institutional damage will remain,\u201d McConnell argues. McConnell\u2019s speech has broadly argued that the House, by not citing criminal statues, has passed weak articles of impeachment, and that if the Senate convicts the president in a trial it would invite constant impeachment trials. He continued that if \u201cextraordinary tool of last resort could become part of the arms race\u201d of partisanship.\u201d President Trump, he said, is not the first president with a \u201cpopulist streak\u201d and \u201cnot the first to make entrenched elites feel uncomfortable\u201d. Here is more from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: Democrats didn\u2019t have to rush this, but they chose to stick to their political time table at the expense of pursuing more evidence through proper legal channels,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cNobody made Chairman Schiff do this, he chose to.\u201d US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is speaking now and has come out strongly in defense of the president: Democrats, \u201cfinally did what they decided to do a long time ago \u2013 they voted to impeach President Trump,\u201d said McConnell. He called the inquiry \u201cthe most rushed, least thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.\u201d President Trump is the third president in US history to be impeached. US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to begin speaking any moment. You can watch along with us here. Welcome to this epic morning the night after impeachment, US politics watchers. There will be no shortage of action today. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell is about to make an address on the floor. And with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now threatening to delay sending articles of impeachment to the Senate for the congressional trial of the president, this sets up an immediate, major conflict between the two most powerful figures on Capitol Hill. Stay tuned. In a historic vote last night, the House impeached Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. But it is unclear exactly how the impeachment process will move forward. Pelosi must formally deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate for the trial to start, but may be holding on to them until she receives assurances of a fair trial in the Senate. Today is the last day of business in the House before Christmas, with no sign of Pelosi budging. MccConnell announced he will speak on the Senate floor at 9:30am ET. He is known as a master tactician, and has successfully delayed important Democratic initiatives in the past, notably the confirmation hearings of former US Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. The Senate is not in session for several weeks. President Trump is already tweeting about the impeachment this morning, and making it known he is counting on the Senate to save his hide.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has apologised for going on holiday while Australia is in the grip of an extended bushfire crisis and a record-breaking heatwave. In a statement on Friday morning the prime minister explained he had brought forward his leave with his family due to the need to travel to Japan and India in January. \u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\u201d Morrison said. Morrison later confirmed the holiday was in Hawaii, seeking to explain the trip\u2019s secrecy by suggesting he had tried to give his daughters \u201ca bit of a surprise\u201d despite several reporters stating the prime minister\u2019s office had denied reports he was in Hawaii after he and his family had arrived. The holiday \u2013 which was due to conclude on Monday \u2013 will now be cut short, with Morrison expected back in Australia on Saturday. \u201cI have been receiving regular updates on the bushfires disaster as well as the status of the search for and treatment of the victims of the White Island tragedy,\u201d Morrison said in the statement. \u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s responsibilities have been well managed by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister [David] Littleproud and Minister [Marise] Payne. In a separate statement, Morrison expressed \u201csincere condolences and sympathies\u201d to the families of two volunteer firefighters killed when a truck near the town of Buxton late on Thursday hit a tree and rolled off the road. \u201cOur hearts go out to their families, friends and colleagues who have been working tirelessly beside them, particularly during this Christmas period,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven these most recent tragic events, I will be returning to Sydney from leave as soon as can be arranged.\u201d Morrison has described climate change as \u201cone of many factors\u201d in the bushfires, but has been accused of downplaying its threat and not doing enough on climate policy. Although he has repeatedly insisted Australia is meeting its international obligations to reduce carbon emissions, Australia was accused by about 100 countries of thwarting negotiations at last week\u2019s UN climate summit in Madrid by using an accounting loophole to meet its emissions targets. Australia has received broad criticism internationally for its climate policies, with a group of thinktanks recently ranking the nation the worst-performing country on climate change from a list of 57. The Morrison government was specifically singled out as a \u201cregressive force\u201d in the report, but Morrison himself rejected the group\u2019s findings as \u201cnot credible\u201d. He also criticised the widespread student strikes to demand more action on climate change, saying he wanted \u201cless activism in schools\u201d. Morrison has long been a supporter of Australia\u2019s fossil fuel industry. In a high-profile 2017 stunt, he brought a lump of coal into the House of Representatives and urged MPs: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid\u201d. The Liberal government has faced criticism for years over its support for the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland, which experts have said would lock in years of increased carbon emissions, threaten local wildlife and damage the Great Barrier Reef. Michael McCormack has served as acting prime minister since Monday, declaring his hometown of Wagga Wagga was the nation\u2019s capital, while Morrison copped bad press for an international holiday in Hawaii. Morrison told 2GB Radio although he did not normally announce when he was going on leave \u201cor say where we\u2019re going\u201d, he accepted that in the circumstances it had \u201cunderstandably caused a lot of anxiety and I deeply regret that\u201d. \u201cI know Australians understand this and they\u2019ll be pleased I\u2019m coming back, I\u2019m sure, but they know I don\u2019t hold a hose, I don\u2019t sit in a control room.\u201d Morrison said his wife and two girls \u201clike holidaying in Hawaii so we\u2019ve had a few nice days here\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that it\u2019s come at such an awful time, particularly for those living in and around Sydney and New South Wales. And it\u2019s just devastating to be here and seeing what\u2019s happening there.\u201d Reporters including the BBC\u2019s Frances Mao and The New Daily\u2019s Samantha Maiden were advised by Morrison\u2019s office earlier in the week that reports he was in Hawaii were incorrect. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has declined to criticise Morrison for his holiday, although Labor MPs have continued to target him for knocking back calls to pay volunteer firefighters and declining to meet former emergency services chiefs who have demanded more action on climate change. On Friday Albanese suggested the government should look at options to compensate volunteer firefighters such as tax breaks, one-off payments, or support for employers that allow workers to take leave. In a TV interview from Kurrajong Heights, north-west of Sydney Albanese said volunteers \u201cstill had to put food on the table, they still have to pay their mortgage\u201d and the nation should repay their commitment to their communities. On Thursday the Greens senators Sarah Hanson Young and Mehreen Faruqi attended a protest at the prime minister\u2019s Sydney residence, Kirribilli House, targeting Morrison for his absence during the crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, is putting more than \u00a31m a year into the club through sponsorships by entities connected to him which are not currently commercially active companies, the Guardian understands. The Wednesday shirt has Chansiri as the main sponsor across its chest, and Chansiri is branded as Wednesday\u2019s \u201cofficial club partner\u201d, including on the club\u2019s website. Although the owner does have a registered company, Chansiri Ltd, which is registered at Hillsborough, its most recent accounts state that it was dormant, not trading. Another company owned by Chansiri, Sheffield Wednesday Holdings, registered in Hong Kong, has since June 2019 been his vehicle for owning the club. The Chansiri sponsorship on the Wednesday shirt and partnership with the club is simply the owner\u2019s surname, rather than a commercial company bearing his name, according to sources with knowledge of it. The brand name sponsor on the upper right of the club shirt, Elev8, is a clothing company owned by Chansiri and it does manufacture the kit, the club has said. Elev8 is also planned to be an energy drink and Chansiri has a company, Elev8 Energy Drink Ltd, registered in London\u2019s Mayfair in August 2017, but it is understood to be not yet manufacturing an energy drink for public marketing. A third sponsor, D Taxis, whose name is on the scoreboard and other areas of Hillsborough, is not yet set up as a functioning taxi company to drive passengers around; Chansiri is understood to be intending to set it up as a taxi business. A different firm, City Taxis, which does operate in Sheffield and across South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, is currently a main sponsor of the club. The English Football League is clearly aware of these sponsorships but is understood not to be concerned about them in relation to its \u201cprofitability and sustainability\u201d financial fair play rules, because their value is not excessive. The rules, aimed at steadying finances in a ferociously unequal, generally overspending division, limit Championship clubs\u2019 permitted losses to \u00a313m per season. To protect against owners artificially covering losses by over-valued sponsorships, the rules require any connected commercial relationships to be for \u201cfair value\u201d \u2013 comparable to the amounts a club could earn from a commercial brand not connected to an owner. Wednesday\u2019s most recently published accounts, for the 14 months to 31 July 2018, suggest the revenues from the three sponsorships connected to Chansiri were \u00a31.27m, not excessive for a main partner, kit manufacturer and scoreboard sponsor of a major club in the Championship. The club maintains the sponsorships are all for \u201cfair value\u201d. Chansiri, 51, whose family owns the Thai Union Frozen Group, a giant tuna and seafood processing company in Thailand, bought Wednesday in 2015 for a reported \u00a337.5m from Milan Mandaric and has since spent huge amounts of money trying to win promotion to the Premier League. Last month the EFL charged Wednesday with misconduct over Chansiri buying the Hillsborough ground from the club in June this year for \u00a360m. That sale, and a stated \u00a338m profit to the club from it, was included in Wednesday\u2019s accounts, and its submission under the financial fair play rules, for the previous year, 2017-18. The profit helped turn what would otherwise have been a \u00a335.4m loss \u2013 very substantially in excess of the permitted loss so potentially incurring a serious penalty \u2013 into a \u00a32.6m profit. Wednesday responded to the charges this month with an emphatic statement, arguing that EFL executives authorised the sale and that the charges are therefore invalid. \u201cThe club maintains that it consulted with the relevant executive officers of the EFL in connection with the stadium transaction and that it acted in good faith \u2026 The club is accordingly bringing its own claim against the EFL to establish that it is acting unlawfully, as well as standing ready, if necessary, to vigorously defend the charges.\u201d A Wednesday spokesman said the club was making no further comment and it declined to comment on the connected sponsorships to Chansiri. Wednesday finished 15th in the Championship in 2017-18, despite increasing their wage bill to \u00a342m, which along with other costs meant they spent almost double their entire revenues of \u00a325m. The accounts for that period state that Chansiri\u2019s loan to the club more than doubled, from \u00a338m in 2016-17, to \u00a378m. In September last year Chansiri also appears tohave paid \u00a321m for new shares in the club. The accounts note that Chansiri is a director of Elev8 Clothing and Elev8 Energy Drink, and state that the total paid to the club from \u201crelated parties\u201d was \u00a361.27m. As he bought Hillsborough for \u00a360m, that suggests the total from sponsors connected to him, including the name Chansiri itself, was \u00a31.27m. Sales of a stadium to a club\u2019s owner are allowed under EFL financial rules, despite reservations, known to be felt most strongly by the Middlesbrough owner Steve Gibson, about clubs and grounds being in separate ownership, and concerns that such sales are an artificial, one-off way of balancing the books. The EFL is understood to be conducting a review of the \u00a360m valuation for Hillsborough but that is separate from the misconduct charge, which relates to the timing of the sale and allocation of the \u00a360m to the 2017-18 financial year. Wednesday\u2019s accounts for that year were initially required to be published at Companies House by the end of February this year, but then the annual year end for the figures, 31 May 2018, was extended to 31 July 2018, meaning the accounts were for a 14-month period and needed to be published by 30 April this year.

The \u00a360m receipts were included in the 2017-18 accounts whose period had ended on 31 July 2018, 11 months earlier. The EFL said when charging Wednesday that it had undertaken a formal investigation into financial information provided by the club following the sale of Hillsborough, and \u201creviewed a large number of documents\u201d as part of the process. \u201cThe EFL has \u2026 concluded there is sufficient evidence to justify issuing charges of misconduct \u2026 in respect of a number of allegations regarding the process of how and when the stadium was sold and the inclusion of the profits in the 2017-18 accounts,\u201d the league said.",

      "bodyText": "Joshua Boyle, the former hostage who spent five years held by militants in Afghanistan with his family, has been cleared of all charges in a closely watched sexual assault trial. Boyle, 36, faced 19 charges, including criminal harassment, uttering threats, unlawful confinement and administering a noxious substance after his estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman, accused him of abusing her after the family were rescued and returned to Canada. But on Thursday, the Ontario superior court justice Peter Doody said there was not enough evidence to back up Coleman\u2019s testimony. As he dismissed the charges, Doody cast doubt on much of Boyle\u2019s evidence, but also described Coleman\u2019s testimony as \u201cinconsistent\u201d and called into question her credibility and memory. \u201cI do not believe her, just as I do not believe Mr Boyle,\u201d said Doody, arguing that the prosecution failed to present a case that was beyond a reasonable doubt. Boyle and Coleman were already the subject of intense media scrutiny following their dramatic rescue, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent allegations ensured that the case became one of the most high-profile recent trials in Canada. But Thursdays\u2019 verdict highlighted the immense challenges in adjudicating allegations of sexual assault within the justice system, said lawyers in that field. Boyle, who attended each day of the trial and took extensive notes throughout the process, was in court with his parents. \u201cThis is an incredible relief to him,\u201d Boyle\u2019s lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon, told reporters outside the court. Coleman, who lives in the US with her family, travelled to Ottawa to testify in March and April but was not present for the verdict. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to speak with Ms Coleman. She\u2019s devastated by the verdict,\u201d said Ian Carter, her lawyer. \u201cI think the case is an example of the challenges a complainant faces coming forward with allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence \u2026 She needs some time to process what was said today and try and move on with her life.\u201d In 2012, then newlyweds Boyle and Coleman travelled to Afghanistan, where they were kidnapped by a Taliban-linked group shortly after arriving in the restive country. The couple spent five years as captives of the Haqqani network, during which time Coleman gave birth to three children. They were eventually freed by Pakistani soldiers in October 2017, and returned to Canada. In late December, Boyle was arrested in Ottawa and charged with 19 offenses \u2013 including sexual assault, forcible confinement and uttering a death threat \u2013 all of which were alleged to have taken place after the family had arrived in the city. During the trial, which began in March, Coleman testified that during their captivity, Boyle became physically abusive, choking, punching and slapping, as well as threatening to kill her in front of their children. She also told the court how she fled the couple\u2019s Ottawa apartment in fear for her life, wearing only socks on her feet. Boyle admitted he had struck Coleman several times, but said he had done so because she frequently asked to be spanked. Toronto-based lawyer Angela Chaisson, who specializes in sexual assault cases, says complainants often have a difficult time achieving justice in the courts. She pointed to the case of Jian Ghomeshi, the disgraced Canadian radio host who faced accusations of sexual assault from numerous women \u2013 but was acquitted in a controversial 2016 verdict. \u201cThe criminal justice system is in my opinion, a fundamentally flawed way of dealing with sexual assault and domestic violence claims,\u201d she said. In his ruling, Doody acknowledged the toll their kidnapping ordeal had taken on both Boyle and Coleman, saying he had made an effort to disregard their demeanour in the courtroom. With much of the verdict centred on credibility, Doody took issue with evidence submitted by the crown, including a list of \u201crules\u201d which Coleman testified Boyle had drawn up to control her behaviour, diet, exercise and even frequency of sex. When asked by government lawyers if he wrote the document, Boyle told the court he could not recall writing it, nor could he identify his own writing. Doody said Boyle\u2019s testimony was not credible, but \u2013 given contradictions in Coleman\u2019s testimony regarding the list, Doody concluded the document was only circumstantial evidence. Doody also expressed concern over Coleman\u2019s reliability as a witness. She was diagnosed with PTSD following her time as a hostage and testified that she suffered from blackouts and \u201cfits\u201d of anxiety. The judge cautioned that mental health issues do not make a witness unreliable, but nonetheless flagged her \u201cmemory issues\u201d, saying they \u201craise concerns about her ability to accurately recall the events at issue \u2026 and whether the events described took place\u201d. The trial was initially expected to only last weeks, but was repeatedly delayed by procedural questions, including a clash over Coleman\u2019s decision to grant media interviews during the trial, despite Doody\u2019s request not to speak publicly about the case. The various reasons Coleman gave for giving the interviews lacked consistency, said Doody. Given that neither side could provide a compelling case, a legal standard of reasonable doubt meant he was obliged to dismiss the charges, he said. Chaisson said she feared the verdict could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on women who are victims of domestic abuse. \u201cAll the high-profile cases that we see are acquittals and that\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should give us pause, as justice system participants and society at large, and ask us why this is.\u201d Government lawyers did not make a statement to media following the verdict and have not yet indicated if they will appeal. \u201cThis was really, in large part, a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 - there was very, very little confirmatory evidence,\u201d Boyle\u2019s lawyer, Greenspon told Reuters: \u201cUltimately, [the judge] didn\u2019t believe Caitlan and he had many doubts about Josh\u2019s testimony.\u201d",

Labour eventually returned to power, it has long been argued, only because it abandoned its radical policies and marginalised those in the party who had come up with them. After last week\u2019s disaster, say Corbyn\u2019s critics, Labour should do the same.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He cautions against the party tacking too far to the right and blaming last week\u2019s defeat on the left of the party, as Labour grandees such as Alan Johnson have already begun to do.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On election night, the former New Labour minister Alan Johnson began this familiar ritual \u2013 describing the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, which has 40,000 members, as \u201cthis little cult\u201d. \u201cI want them out of the party,\u201d he said on ITV. \u201cGo back to your student politics.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And one thing for Labour supporters to feel optimistic about is their standing among young voters:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Unlike Foot, Corbyn won the support of a cohort of voters that will only become more important. According to the Conservative pollster Michael Ashcroft, last week Labour received almost three times as many votes from the under-35s as the Tories. In 1983, the Tories led Labour comfortably in this group. Then, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s party often seemed more modern than Labour, offering a vision of an individualistic, competitive country, which many young people liked. There was an intellectual ferment on the right, which for years had been producing fresh policy ideas.</p> \n   <p>Few people would say these things about the Tories now. In 2019, their almost content-free manifesto, and massive reliance on older voters, were highly effective as election tactics. Yet, like the airy promises to increase state spending in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, they are also signs of a party with questionable long-term prospects. By contrast, Labour\u2019s youthful support, and policies addressing what are by common consent the biggest contemporary issues \u2013 the climate emergency, the inadequacies of the modern economy and Britain\u2019s proliferating social crises \u2013 suggest a party with the potential to do much better at future elections.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/19/left-labour-michael-foot-tony-blair\">A Labour defeat, yes, but this was not nearly as bad as 1983 | Andy Beckett</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T20:08:40.486Z\">at 8.08pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfbc9628f087e8308e61517\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T19:03:09.329Z\">7.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the Queen\u2019s Speech debate, which has not exactly been troubled by many moments of soaring oratory, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 joint leader <strong>Sir Ed Davey</strong> warned the prime minister that his \u201cwillingness to jump unashamedly over every red line he had previously been willing to die in the ditch for will have been noted in Brussels by Europe\u2019s rather more skilful negotiators\u201d, suggesting that Boris Johnson\u2019s greatest weapon in the negotiations to come would be his \u201cunmatched flexibility with the truth\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHis so-called triumph of achieving a deal for Brexit phase one was only possible because he betrayed his big promise to the DUP,\u201d Davey added, describing the PM\u2019s tactics as \u201cbulldog bluster combined with the record of a turncoat\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the right approach and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll succeed without reneging on almost all of his previous promises to leave voters.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhether or not, in the dark Conservative forests of the Brexit Spartans, his erstwhile friends have yet smelt betrayal.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T20:09:44.987Z\">at 8.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfbc4e18f087e8308e614cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T18:45:15.795Z\">6.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, <strong>Julian Smith</strong>, has announced that there will be no return to power-sharing in the region before Christmas, blaming the DUP for preventing the move which would have seen the government release extra money for the NHS there.</p> \n  <p>Smith said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that we have not got all five parties in agreement,\u201d and asked the DUP, the largest party in Northern Ireland, to reconsider. </p> \n  <p>The party said there were outstanding issues under negotiation that would not be resolved in the coming days, and work remained to be done to achieve a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d agreement.</p> \n  <p>The second largest party, Sinn F\u00e9in, had joined the British and Irish governments in making a push to re-establish devolved institutions, ending a three-year hiatus.</p> \n  <p>Smith said: \u201cWe want all parties to be positively part of the new Stormont.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the extra spending is \u00a34.3bn a year in real-terms</p> \n  <p>From next year some of the extra funding will be distributed by minimum per-pupil funding via the new national funding formula, the Department for Education has announced.

This framework bill does not set the date or question on the ballot, which have to be specified in further primary legislation, and much of the debate has centred around that question and whether it will be the same yes/no as 2014.</p> \n  <p>The draft bill originally stated the Electoral Commission would not be consulted if it had previously assessed or recommended a question, as with the yes/no format for the 2014 referendum.</p> \n  <p>Critics argued yes/no favoured the affirmative side, and the commission subsequently recommended the options of leave and remain for the 2016 EU referendum.</p> \n  <p>While the commission has not ruled out a future yes/no question on independence, it believes the assessment should be based on current evidence and political context, and now a compromise amendment has been accepted which states, in summary: if the question has been asked within the same parliamentary session then the commission does not automatically have to assess the question (though Holyrood can ask for it to do so), and if the question has been asked in the previous parliamentary session then Scottish ministers can lodge a motion to extend the \u2018validity period\u2019 of the question which, if passed, would mean the question did not need to be reassessed.</p> \n  <p>This really only matters if a second independence referendum is held next year \u2013 beyond 2021, the question will not have been asked in the past two sessions and so will automatically have to be assessed again. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T17:23:17.679Z\">at 5.23pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfba5938f087e8308e61313\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T17:06:55.065Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Theresa May</strong>, the former prime minister, spoke in the Queen\u2019s speech debate after Ian Blackford.

She said that following last week\u2019s election victory in which her party took 47 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, the case for another referendum was \u201cunarguable\u201d. In <a href=\"https://www.snp.org/nicola-sturgeons-statement-on-scotlands-right-to-choose/\">a statement</a> delivered at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us.</p> \n   <p>Scotland made it very clear last week it does not want a Tory government led by Boris Johnson taking us out of the European Union.</p> \n   <p>That is the future we face if we do not have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sturgeon has also published <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/publication/2019/12/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/documents/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/govscot%3Adocument/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands.pdf\">a 38-page report (pdf)</a> setting out arguments for why Scotland should have the power to decide for itself to hold a legally valid independence referendum, instead of having to get approval from London under the Scotland Act, as is the case now. </p> \n  <p>The UK government has said it will not give the Scottish parliament the power to hold a second independence referendum, arguing that the matter was settled by the referendum in 2014. But Sturgeon said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The question is often posed to me: what will you do if the prime minister says no?</p> \n   <p>But the document we are publishing today turns the question on its head.</p> \n   <p>It is for the prime minister to defend why he believes the UK is not a voluntary union of equal nations.

We are expecting the speech to be a beefed-up version of what we heard in October, with some of the measures in the phantom Queen\u2019s speech being regurgitated, but some extra legislation added too.</p> \n  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Matthew Weaver</strong>\u2019s preview story.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/queens-speech-nhs-to-be-at-heart-of-legislative-programme-minister\">Queen's speech: NHS to be at heart of legislative programme - minister</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>In the meantime electioneering in the Labour leadership contest continues. Having declared her candidature with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/emily-thornberry-throws-her-hat-into-ring-for-labour-leadership\">an article in the Guardian yesterday</a>, <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, has been giving interviews this morning. In her article she criticised Jeremy Corbyn for ignoring her warning that backing an early election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. Today, though, Thornberry has shifted her focus somewhat, laying the blame for Labour\u2019s failings not so much with Corbyn himself, but with his advisers. </p> \n  <p>This is what she told Sky News when asked if she was willing to blame Corbyn for the election defeat.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m prepared to tell the truth, which is that in 2017 Jeremy was authentic, he spoke clearly, he spoke truthfully, people liked it. And what was the difference between 2017 and 2019? I think it was that we had been triangulating on the issue of Brexit, so people weren\u2019t quite sure where we were. I think we had other issues like antisemitism, like our response to Salisbury, where I think that Jeremy was just very badly advised. And in the end advisers should be there to give advice and politicians should be there to make the decisions. And too often we saw a situation where advisers felt that they were more important and should have more of a steer, in terms of where the Labour party was going, than the elected politicians. And that\u2019s not right.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Thornberry did not name the advisers she was referring to. But people in the Labour party will have understood that she was referring to Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of communications and strategy, and Karie Murphy, who was Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff before being moved to Labour HQ to run the general election, reportedly in response to complaints about how she was running his office. When it was put to Thornberry that she was talking about these two, she did not demur.</p> \n  <p>She also suggested Milne and Murphy should be dismissed. Referring to the fact that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/labour-party-staff-angry-at-handling-of-possible-redundancies\"> staff working in Labour\u2019s HQ, in Corbyn\u2019s office and for the shadow cabinet are facing the sack</a>, but not Milne and Murphy, she said that was wrong. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those redundancies don\u2019t seem to include the most senior people in the Labour party who made the decisions during the election. And that\u2019s not fair. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.15am:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, holds a press conference to mark the publication of a paper making the case for Scotland being given the power to hold a second independence referendum.</p> \n  <p><em>11.25am: </em>The state opening of parliament commences, with MPs and peers gathering in the Lords to hear the Queen\u2019s speech.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn speak in the Queen\u2019s speech debate.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on the Queen\u2019s speech and the subsequent debate.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for us tonight, thanks for all your comments. You can read our main politics article on the Queen\u2019s speech here: Britain\u2019s security agencies are investigating how the leaked NHS dossier which was seized upon - to little ultimate effect - by the Labour party during the election campaign came to be in the public domain. Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor, writes that the inquiry will focus on whether hackers from a hostile state used a personal Gmail account to access the information, which Jeremy Corbyn claimed showed the health service was \u201con the table\u201d in trade talks with the US. It is not clear which country \u2013 if any \u2013 is behind the alleged hack but independent analysts have already suggested that the cache was originally disseminated online by a Russian operation known as Secondary Infektion. One source said that the investigation was focused on events that may have taken place a few months ago. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor Dominic Cummings has reportedly told special advisers not to use such email accounts as \u201cforeign powers\u201d were targeting them. Read the article in full here: \u201cThis was Boris Johnson\u2019s day and nothing was going to spoil it,\u201d writes John Crace in his parliamentary sketch. \u201cHe was world king at last. Free to do whatever he wanted, safe in the knowledge that no one could stop him. If he wanted to decriminalise stealing a journalist\u2019s mobile phone or offer an amnesty to anyone who was late with their child support payments, then he was free to do so. Right now, he was the supreme leader. It would take time for the people to find out that all the People\u2019s Government could be relied on for was to let them down. And by the time they did, it would be far too late.\u201d Read the article in full here: Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, warned in his maiden speech that government plans for an \u201camnesty\u201d for British veterans who served in Northern Ireland was potentially putting the peace process at risk. Eastwood, whose party returned from the electoral wilderness last week in taking a seat apiece from the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, said the proposed policy - in addition to Brexit - threatened stability in Northern Ireland. \u201cEqually damaging to our progress and our peace process is the current proposal to basically give an amnesty for British soldiers for ... whatever they carried out in Northern Ireland during our very, very difficult Troubles. \u201cIs prosecuting those veterans vexatious? No, it is not. We will resist this attempt to undermine our peace process and our political progress and this insult to victims, all of the victims of our terrible, terrible past, and the opportunity that has been denied to them since 1998 to find full truth and full justice. \u201cWe stand by every single one of those victims, no matter who the perpetrator was. People on opposite benches need to understand this. If you begin with an amnesty for the British Army you will end up with an amnesty for everybody. \u201cSo it would better suit this prime minister and this government to stand by all of the victims, all of the innocent victims who have been searching for truth and justice for far too long.\u201d The author of the Queen\u2019s speech was \u201cclearly\u201d Dominic Cummings, with whom the prime minister \u201cis said to be mesmerised\u201d, writes Simon Jenkins. And beyond the headline commitments to getting Brexit done, \u201cthe rest of the speech was intriguing\u201d. Under Johnson-Cummings, the age of \u2018economic man\u2019 is over, replaced by the age of political empathy. The drivers are not \u2018the economy, stupid\u2019 but traditional ideas of national pride, authority, group insecurity and fiscal promiscuity. They are rife in the United States and eastern Europe. Now they have come to Britain. Gone from the Queen\u2019s speech was much trace of Johnson\u2019s once-vaunted social liberalism. Different buttons are now being pushed. The proposal to put \u00a334bn of NHS spending on a statutory basis is a headline gimmick. Prime ministers can spend what they like on the NHS without acts of parliament. The measure will merely confirm the health service as, like defence, beyond budgetary discipline or control. More significant, there was no mention of how to support social care in the long term, beyond an ambition for \u2018cross-party consensus\u2019. Local government remains below the radar. There is scant Christmas cheer for supporters of the Labour party, but as Andy Beckett points out, it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as 1983, when Michael Foot\u2019s party slumped to 27.6% of the vote and the Tories had a thumping 144-seat majority. In that campaign, Labour, led by Michael Foot, offered voters a leftwing manifesto, and was crushed by the Conservatives \u2013 who went on to govern for 14 more years. Labour eventually returned to power, it has long been argued, only because it abandoned its radical policies and marginalised those in the party who had come up with them. After last week\u2019s disaster, say Corbyn\u2019s critics, Labour should do the same. He cautions against the party tacking too far to the right and blaming last week\u2019s defeat on the left of the party, as Labour grandees such as Alan Johnson have already begun to do. On election night, the former New Labour minister Alan Johnson began this familiar ritual \u2013 describing the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, which has 40,000 members, as \u201cthis little cult\u201d. \u201cI want them out of the party,\u201d he said on ITV. \u201cGo back to your student politics.\u201d And one thing for Labour supporters to feel optimistic about is their standing among young voters: Unlike Foot, Corbyn won the support of a cohort of voters that will only become more important. According to the Conservative pollster Michael Ashcroft, last week Labour received almost three times as many votes from the under-35s as the Tories. In 1983, the Tories led Labour comfortably in this group. Then, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s party often seemed more modern than Labour, offering a vision of an individualistic, competitive country, which many young people liked. There was an intellectual ferment on the right, which for years had been producing fresh policy ideas. Few people would say these things about the Tories now. In 2019, their almost content-free manifesto, and massive reliance on older voters, were highly effective as election tactics. Yet, like the airy promises to increase state spending in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, they are also signs of a party with questionable long-term prospects. By contrast, Labour\u2019s youthful support, and policies addressing what are by common consent the biggest contemporary issues \u2013 the climate emergency, the inadequacies of the modern economy and Britain\u2019s proliferating social crises \u2013 suggest a party with the potential to do much better at future elections. In the Queen\u2019s Speech debate, which has not exactly been troubled by many moments of soaring oratory, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 joint leader Sir Ed Davey warned the prime minister that his \u201cwillingness to jump unashamedly over every red line he had previously been willing to die in the ditch for will have been noted in Brussels by Europe\u2019s rather more skilful negotiators\u201d, suggesting that Boris Johnson\u2019s greatest weapon in the negotiations to come would be his \u201cunmatched flexibility with the truth\u201d. \u201cHis so-called triumph of achieving a deal for Brexit phase one was only possible because he betrayed his big promise to the DUP,\u201d Davey added, describing the PM\u2019s tactics as \u201cbulldog bluster combined with the record of a turncoat\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the right approach and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll succeed without reneging on almost all of his previous promises to leave voters. \u201cWhether or not, in the dark Conservative forests of the Brexit Spartans, his erstwhile friends have yet smelt betrayal.\u201d The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has announced that there will be no return to power-sharing in the region before Christmas, blaming the DUP for preventing the move which would have seen the government release extra money for the NHS there. Smith said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that we have not got all five parties in agreement,\u201d and asked the DUP, the largest party in Northern Ireland, to reconsider. The party said there were outstanding issues under negotiation that would not be resolved in the coming days, and work remained to be done to achieve a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d agreement. The second largest party, Sinn F\u00e9in, had joined the British and Irish governments in making a push to re-establish devolved institutions, ending a three-year hiatus. Smith said: \u201cWe want all parties to be positively part of the new Stormont. The DUP is a crucial part of that. \u201cI don\u2019t think time is going to make any difference, I think hanging around, delay, not making decisions is not going to make any difference, it is only going to cause more heartache and problems for citizens in Northern Ireland. \u201cI just hope there is time tonight to reflect on that decision.\u201d People in the DUP did want to break the deadlock, he said, and he asked them to make their voices heard. \u201cI would urge them to move forward so that we can get this done.\u201d The shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, has thrown his hat into the ring to become the next Labour leader. Writing in the Guardian, the 48-year-old MP for Norwich North, who is seen to be on the left of the party, said that Labour had suffered \u201cits own Dunkirk\u201d at the election, but that they could bounce back if they gave activists a stake in any changes. The truth is that despite his enormous achievements in inspiring a new generation of members, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s first promise as leader was never fulfilled. The party was never democratised on the scale or to the extent that members were led to expect \u2013 they were never empowered to campaign, select candidates or determine policy on the scale that was required. This must now change. We don\u2019t need foot soldiers, we need an army of activists who think critically, treat each other with respect and have a serious democratic stake in the movement. I don\u2019t want to manage the labour movement, I want to unleash it. That is the first route to victory. Lewis claims that the party still has to make a clear break with the New Labour era: The party was never able to communicate this to voters in our heartlands. When trying to persuade them of our radicalism and sincerity, we often had the legacy of the 2000s thrown back in our faces. Persuading voters that we understand the sources of their long-held resentment and frustration, of their disappointment in how Labour has conducted itself since the 1990s, will be the first step towards winning back their trust. Yvette Cooper, who has yet to comment on whether she will run for the Labour leadership, has also responded to the lack of a commitment to negotiate an agreement to allow unaccompanied refugee children to come to the UK to join relatives (see 17:27). Paul Golding, the leader of the far-right group Britain First, said that he has attempted to join the Conservative party, to show his support for comments that Boris Johnson has previously made about Islam. Golding told the Press Association that he liked the \u201ccut of the cloth\u201d of Johnson when the prime minister described women wearing the burqa as resembling \u201cletterboxes\u201d in a column in the Daily Telegraph. Golding, who has been convicted and imprisoned for religiously aggravated harassment and is a former British National Party councillor, said: \u201cPrimarily, we had the experience of Momentum joining the Labour party en masse to consolidate the leadership position of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cWe have decided to do the same but in reverse. We are all joining to see if we can consolidate Boris\u2019s leadership over the Tory party. He is getting Brexit done but, as well as that, he has made a lot of comments in the past referring to burqa and niqab-wearing women as \u2018letterboxes\u2019. \u201cAfter the London Bridge attack, he said he wanted to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners. We like the cut of the cloth on Boris Johnson.\u201d Golding added: \u201cHe is more of a populist leader and I think in recent weeks he has nailed his colours to the mast against immigration and being for Brexit.\u201d Golding shared a screenshot of an email from the Tories following his application which was electronically signed by Tory chairmen and MPs James Cleverly and Ben Elliot, welcoming him to the party at 2pm on Thursday. It reads: \u201cYour membership is now activated. You can now attend party events both locally and nationally. Your membership card will be sent out shortly.\u201d However a Tory spokeswoman said today: \u201cPaul Golding\u2019s application for membership of the Conservative party has not been approved. \u201cWhile we welcome new members from a wide variety of backgrounds, we are vigilant against those seeking to join the party who do not share our aims. There is a process in place for local Conservative associations to approve members who apply to join, or to reject those who do not share the party\u2019s values or objects. \u201cWe support local associations with this work to ensure they can and do take action where needed.\u201d The Independent Group for Change, the party formally known as Change UK which launched in February 2019, has announced that it is beginning the process of winding itself up. At its high-water mark the party boasted 11 MPs from the two main parties, but after failing to make any electoral headway in May\u2019s European elections, six of the party\u2019s MPs left, many to join the Lib Dems. Only three MPs stood in last week\u2019s election, all of them losing their seats. Here is Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, responding to the revelation that the new EU (withdrawal agreement) bill does not contain a commitment to negotiate an agreement to allow unaccompanied refugee children to come to the UK to join a relative that was in the original version. LabourList has a full story on this here. No 10 says the absence of this clause from the bill does not mean its policy has changed. A spokesman said: We are committed to ensuring that children who are claiming asylum or international protection will be reunited with specified family members in the EU and vice versa. The government\u2019s policy on child refugees has not changed and we will continue to do all we can to enable children to claim asylum and be reunited with their families, which the legislation published today reaffirms. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Seth Jacobson is now taking over. No 10 is now ruling out making judicial appointments subject to political approval, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn says. An earlier briefing did not rule this out, leaving reporters to conclude it was an option (particularly in the light of the PM\u2019s previous remarks on this). See 5.01pm. The government stuck to its existing priorities for education in the Queen\u2019s speech, ticking off the policies in its manifesto and beforehand. Apart from vague comments on free schools (\u201ccontinue to expand\u201d) and university tuition fees (\u201cdelivering value for money\u201d), it reaffirms the improvement in school funding for pupils aged 4 to 16 in England, eventually increasing the annual schools budget by \u00a37.1bn in 2022-23. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the extra spending is \u00a34.3bn a year in real-terms From next year some of the extra funding will be distributed by minimum per-pupil funding via the new national funding formula, the Department for Education has announced. That helps the most poorly funded schools outside of cities, with \u00a33,750 for each primary pupil and \u00a35,000 for secondary pupils, with primaries rising again to \u00a34,000 per pupil in 2021. Schools in Bedfordshire appear to be the biggest winners by 2021. But the government\u2019s notes on the Queen\u2019s speech also mention its plans to raise starting pay for qualified teachers to \u00a330,000 by 2022, a pledge which will have to be funded out of school budgets. And while the government is correct to claim that the extra \u00a3400m for post-16 education is the biggest increase since 2010, the college sector has been starved of funds in that time. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: The extra money being delivered next year is nowhere near enough to repair this damage and will still leave the funding rate for students a long way short of what it needs to be. While the Commons continues to debate the Queen\u2019s speech, at Holyrood MSPs have been debating the final stage of the referendums (Scotland) bill, the framework bill which paves the way for a second independence referendum, should it be approved by Westminster, as the first minster, Nicola Sturgeon, demanded earlier today. This framework bill does not set the date or question on the ballot, which have to be specified in further primary legislation, and much of the debate has centred around that question and whether it will be the same yes/no as 2014. The draft bill originally stated the Electoral Commission would not be consulted if it had previously assessed or recommended a question, as with the yes/no format for the 2014 referendum. Critics argued yes/no favoured the affirmative side, and the commission subsequently recommended the options of leave and remain for the 2016 EU referendum. While the commission has not ruled out a future yes/no question on independence, it believes the assessment should be based on current evidence and political context, and now a compromise amendment has been accepted which states, in summary: if the question has been asked within the same parliamentary session then the commission does not automatically have to assess the question (though Holyrood can ask for it to do so), and if the question has been asked in the previous parliamentary session then Scottish ministers can lodge a motion to extend the \u2018validity period\u2019 of the question which, if passed, would mean the question did not need to be reassessed. This really only matters if a second independence referendum is held next year \u2013 beyond 2021, the question will not have been asked in the past two sessions and so will automatically have to be assessed again. Theresa May, the former prime minister, spoke in the Queen\u2019s speech debate after Ian Blackford. On election night, when interviewed by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, she had difficulty answering a question from him about why Boris Johnson had been able to win dozens of leave-voting Labour seats when her attempt to do the same thing in 2017 failed. This afternoon she had a clear answer to that question. She said: I hope [Johnson] will forgive me if I just reflect that this was the result that was supposed to happen in 2017. But of course back then people still thought the Labour party was supporting Brexit. Two years on they saw that was a sham, a pretence and a betrayal of millions of traditional Labour voters. Those Labour voters have now elected Conservative members of parliament. This victory brings with it a huge responsibility. Here are some lines from the afternoon No 10 briefing. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn and the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. In an interview at the time of the Conservative party conference Boris Johnson hinted that he was in favour of confirmation hearings of this kind. He said: If judges are to pronounce on political questions [as they did in the prorogation case], then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant. But Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has said he would not be enthusiastic about this. That is a reference to this HuffPost story. Zac Goldsmith, who lost his seat as MP for Richmond Park last week, is being given a peerage, No 10 has announced. This will allow him to carry on as an environment minister based jointly in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and in the Department for International Development, an appointment that No 10 has also confirmed. In this role he will attend cabinet, as he did when he was doing this job before the election, government sources have confirmed. It was widely expected that Goldsmith would get a peerage. A lifelong environmentalist, he was regarded as particularly well qualified for his ministerial post. He is also a committed Brexiter (his billionaire father set up the Referendum party, an early Eurosceptic party that made the case for a referendum on the EU in the 1990s) and he is good friends with the PM\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds, who once worked for Goldsmith as an adviser and who campaigned for him during the election. Like Johnson, Goldsmith is also an Old Etonian. In his speech in the Queen\u2019s speech debate Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, challenged Boris Johnson to explain why he would not allow the Scottish government to hold another independence referendum. Blackford said: This morning Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has written to the prime minister to demand the transfer of legal powers to the Scottish government to hold a second independence referendum under Section 30 of the Scotland Act ... It is for the prime minister to explain to the people of Scotland why he is denying Scotland the right to choose our own future? Why did democracy stop in the prime minister\u2019s world with the independence referendum in 2014? At one point Blackford criticised Johnson for looking at his phone during the speech. It was \u201cnot a good look\u201d, Blackford said. In response, Johnson said Blackford should say something interesting. Blackford replied: The prime minister says \u2018say something more interesting\u2019. Well, prime minister, this is about democracy, this is about the Scottish National party that stood in the election on a manifesto about Scotland\u2019s right to choose. And it was about the Conservatives who said no to indyref2, and what happened? Well the Conservatives lost more than half their members of parliament. Prime minister, you got your answer from the people of Scotland. This is what my colleague Simon Murphy wrote in September on the feasibility of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland may help to explain this reference to a large-scale infrastructure project in a letter (pdf) published this week by the advisory committee on business appointments, approving a part-time job with an iron and steel making company being taken by the former minister Jo Johnson (the PM\u2019s brother). At one point Jo Johnson was a transport minister. Towards the end of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech, the DUP MP Ian Paisley intervened and asked him to go ahead with the proposal to build a \u201cBoris bridge\u201d between Scotland and Northern Ireland. In response, Johnson hinted that he does want to pursue the idea. He said: As for his desire for a bridge to connect the two biggest isles in the British Isles, all I can say is it is a very interesting idea. I advise [Paisley] to watch this space - and indeed, watch that space between those islands, because what he has said has not fallen on deaf ears. Johnson has hinted at his support for the construction of a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland several times in the past, most recently in September, although one expert has described the idea as \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. In the Commons, Boris Johnson is now winding up. He says, after dithering and platitudes, the time has come for action. That is what is is offering, he says. Here is the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, commenting on the revelation in the Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack that the commitment to raise the national living wage to \u00a310.50 is now conditional on the economy continuing to prosper. (See 2.14pm.) Johnson says the system of government at Westminster needs to meet the challenges of a new era. So the government will set up a commission to look at measures that could restore trust in government. As a first step, it will repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he says. Johnson says tomorrow he will \u201cpeel back the plastic wrapping\u201d and present his oven-ready Brexit bill. Then, he says, he wants to focus on the NHS. And he invites the opposition to join in cross-party talks on social care. The government will abolish no-fault eviction for renters, he says. And it will ban strikes that target commuters. He says he wants to revolutionise local transport. Leeds is the biggest city in Europe without an underground or light rail system, he says. Johnson jokes about Corbyn being \u201ca stickler for watching the Queen\u2019s speech at the right time\u201d. He says, as his exchanges with Corbyn come to an end, he wants to say that his personal relations with him have been excellent. And he says Corbyn\u2019s sincerity is not to be doubted. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says this is the moment to repay the people who voted for the government. People do not just want the government to get Brexit done, he says. He says they want it to move on and address other problems. Johnson sums up some of the Queen\u2019s speech proposals. And he says its ambition stretches beyond one parliament. This is not a programme for one year or one parliament; it is a blueprint for the future of Britain. He claims a \u201cnew golden age for this United Kingdom\u201d is on offer. And the government will work flat out to deliver it, he says. The Queen\u2019s speech does nothing for young people worried about tuition fees, and nothing for older people facing poverty, he says. And there is no mention of universal credit, a cruel policy that has ruined many lives, he says. Corbyn says rough sleeping has doubled under the Tories in government. He says everyone who sees people sleeping on the streets knows this is morally wrong. He says that, according to Shelter, there will be 280,000 people homeless at Christmas \u2013 either sleeping rough, or in temporary accommodation. He challenges Johnson to fund the removal of dangerous cladding from blocks of flats, and to pay for the installation of sprinklers. Corbyn says the Queen\u2019s speech contains nothing of substance to deal with the climate emergency. He says many of the big polluters fund the Tories. Corbyn says Labour will oppose the government\u2019s attempt to limit the right of transport workers to go on strike. He claims the proposals on this would contravene the International Labour Organization conventions. Corbyn asks Johnson to deny reports that he wants to merge the Department for International Development. He says setting up DfID was a proud Labour achievement. Turning to Brexit, Corbyn says Johnson has resurrected the threat of a no-deal Brexit, and included it in his bill. Johnson\u2019s priority is a toxic trade deal with Donald Trump, he says. He says the British do not want chlorinated chicken. Under Johnson, trade talks could go on for years, Corbyn says. Back in the Commons Jeremy Corbyn is now on to the serious substance of his speech. He says Labour won the argument on austerity. And he mocks the proposal for an NHS funding bill. He says the last Labour government did not need to pass legislation to force itself to invest in the NHS. He criticises Boris Johnson\u2019s claim to be delivering 50,000 new nurses and 40 new hospitals. There are only 30,000 new nurses, he says, and only six new hospitals. And, referring to what Johnson said about social care when he took office, Corbyn says Johnson\u2019s claim to have a plan (see 1.45pm) was just an empty promise. And this is from MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse. Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, has more on the new version of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now in the debate. He starts with tributes to the backbenchers who proposed and seconded the loyal address. The government has published the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. It runs to 101 pages and you can read it here (pdf). This is from Graeme Cowie, a Commons clerk. No 10 had already announced that the clause allowing the transition to be extended would be removed. And we knew the workers\u2019 rights protections were going - although Michael Gove has claimed that the protections in the employment bill will compensate. (See 1.16pm.) The original bill had a long clause, clause 31, titled \u201cOversight of negotiations for future relationship\u201d. It said the government could not engage in negotiations on the future relationship with the EU unless a statement setting out the negotiating objectives had been passed by MPs. That clause has gone, and the new clause 31 relates to the repeal of section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act. Eddie Hughes, the Conservative MP for Walsall North, is speaking now. He says he normally only gets called right at the end of debate, when the chamber is empty. Crouch says she hopes the Conservatives will govern in the one-nation tradition. She represents Chatham. Charles Dickens lived in Chatham, and she says he was a great social reformer. He also knew the importance of laughter and good humour. She says she hopes MPs will learn from that. Crouch jokes about Penny Mordaunt\u2019s famous \u201ccock\u201d speech in the Commons, and then delivers a very sharp joke about Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, saying he now realises that Dover is an important trading post. It is a reference to this admission from Raab when he was Brexit secretary \u2013 a comment he would rather forget. Tracey Crouch, the Conservative former sports minister, is proposing the loyal address to the Queen. Two backbenchers are invited to propose and second the loyal address. They are expected to give short, witty speeches. Crouch starts by saying this honour normally goes to someone whose career is behind them. Given that it is panto season, she prompts MPs to shout \u201cOh, no it\u2019s not\u201d when she says her career is behind her. Switching to a Christmas Carol theme, she suggests that Philip Hammond (who is no longer an MP) would fit the role of Scrooge. And Jeremy Corbyn could be Marley, she suggests. Corbyn remains stony-faced at this allusion. MPs have now approved the motion to sit tomorrow by acclamation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says he was anxious to ensure that MPs did not have to come back on Monday. From my colleague Libby Brooks MPs are about to start the Queen\u2019s speech debate. But, first, Sir Lindsay Hoyle is explaining why he is allowing the second reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill tomorrow. Normally a bill like this would not have a second reading on a Friday, and certainly not just one day after the Queen\u2019s speech. Hoyle says other parties in the house have been consulted and the circumstances justify this. The Unite union has now responded to the Anna Turley libel decision. (See 2.22pm.) It is going to appeal. A spokesperson for the union said: Unite is very disappointed with the court\u2019s decision. Anna Turley joined a section of Unite which was only open to the unwaged, this was to enable her to hide her membership from Unite and for the sole purpose of voting in the union\u2019s general secretary election. She then chose to sue for comments released by a Unite press spokesperson which appeared in a publication that we maintain we did not have responsibility for. We note how critical the judgment is of how Ms Turley\u2019s legal team handled this case in so far as they delayed the disclosure of evidence crucial to how Ms Turley came to join Unite, disclosure that revealed the existence of a secretive grouping of MPs. However ultimately the union does not agree with the court\u2019s findings on several points of law, including the finding as to the meaning of the statement originally made by Unite and including the finding as to whether the commentary was a matter of public interest. Unite will therefore be appealing the decision. Turning back to social care, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the World at One that he hoped to start cross-party talks aimed at finding a consensus on the way forward \u201cimmediately in the new year\u201d. But, given that at that point the Labour leadership contest will just be properly getting under way, Hancock may find that the opposition is not in a position to engage at that point. The Lib Dems are also without a permanent leader at the moment. Anna Turley has released this statement about the libel case. (See 2.22pm.) A former Labour MP who sued a union for libel has won a high court fight and been awarded \u00a375,000 damages, the Press Association reports. Anna Turley \u2013 who lost her seat in Redcar, North Yorkshire, in the general election on 12 December \u2013 had sued Unite and blogger Stephen Walker over an item on the Skwawkbox blog. When Sajid Javid, the chancellor, told the Tory conference in September that the government would raise the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour over five years, that sounded like a clear commitment. It was in the manifesto (pdf) too as a promise about what would happen under a Conservative government, not something that might happen. But now an element of doubt seems to be creeping in. As the government briefing document (pdf) on the Queen\u2019s speech reveals, the national living wage increase will only take place \u201cprovided economic conditions allow\u201d. This implies that, in the event of a recession, the rise won\u2019t go ahead. The document says: The chancellor has pledged that the national living wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around \u00a310.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow. I\u2019m grateful to SuffolkJason BTL for flagging this up. Here is my colleague Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, on the plans for a review of spying legislation. (See 12.08pm.) The Queen\u2019s speech says almost nothing new on social care, beyond restating the outline approach Boris Johnson sketched out during the general election campaign: an extra \u00a31bn a year for councils, seeking cross-party consensus on a way forward, and ensuring no one should have to sell their home to pay for care. But the government briefing paper (pdf) does say that the government may continue to allow councils to raise money for social care through a social care precept. This is something that has been happening since 2016; councils are allowed to raise council tax by an extra 2%, provided the revenue goes to social care. The government document says: The government is providing councils with an additional \u00a31bn for adults and children\u2019s social care in every year of this parliament. In addition, the government will consult on a 2% precept that will enable councils to access a further \u00a3500m for adult social care for 2020-21. The absence of a detailed plan for social care is an embarrassment because, in his first speech as PM in July, Johnson claimed that he had a \u201cclear plan\u201d to deal with the problem. He said: I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. Earlier this week, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, played down reports that the protection of workers\u2019 rights would not be included in the EU withdrawal agreement bill, saying there would be a separate bill on employment rights in the Queen\u2019s speech. There is an employment bill in the Queen\u2019s speech. According to the government\u2019s briefing document (pdf), it will make flexible working the default, give workers the right to request a more predictable contract and ensure workers get the tips in full left for them. The government says the bill will \u201cprotect and enhance workers\u2019 rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work\u201d. But the briefing does not say anything about how UK employment rights will or will not remain aligned with EU employment rights. Fresh from her Bute House media event (see 10.10am), calling for both section 30 order powers to hold a second Scottish independence referendum and the permanent devolution of those powers to Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon has faced sustained questioning on her domestic record at FMQs. The Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, raised a series of public service failures revealed over the past week, on ferries, railways and hospitals. Yesterday the Scottish government stripped Abellio, Scotland\u2019s main railway operator, of their franchise three years early after anger from commuters over cancellations and poor services. On the same day the finance secretary revealed that taxpayers were facing a \u00a3100m bill for two lifeline ferries after a catalogue of errors and mismanagement by contractors. Carlaw accused Sturgeon of \u201cshowboating in front of the cameras\u201d this morning, while ignoring the patients let down by poor hospital waiting times. He said every public service run by the SNP was ending the year in a worse place than when it began, while the Lib Dem leader, Willie Rennie, told Sturgeon that \u201cevery hour she takes off to hold another press conference at Bute House is another hour wasted trying to sort out [public services] that matter to the people of Scotland\u201d. Sturgeon accused Rennie of \u201cborrowing his question\u201d from Carlaw, and said childcare staffing was increasing, waiting times improving and the attainment gap closing, although citing the same Pisa education study that showed Scotland\u2019s performance in maths and science at a record low, and reading levels lower than they were at the start of the millennium. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, raised an interesting point about Scottish workers missing out on renewables jobs across the country, while those who are employed are stuck on short-term contracts. The union Unite has talked about a \u201crenewables scandal\u201d as jobs are placed increasingly with overseas firms. Here is some video of Jeremy Corbyn doing his best to avoid even looking at Boris Johnson, let alone talk to him, as they process from the Commons chamber to the Lords together to listen to the Queen\u2019s speech. Johnson does not seem too hurt by the snub. The October Queen\u2019s speech promised an environment bill, to improve air and water quality and to tackle plastic pollution, and the same bill is in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech. But now the government is saying explicitly the legislation will \u201cban the export of polluting plastic waste to non-OECD countries\u201d, with industry, NGOs and councils being consulted on when this could be achieved. This will be tough - Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea and India all take our plastic waste - and we have yet to build a domestic recycling industry which can keep this waste and use it here in a circular economy. We export two thirds of our plastic waste. The Department for Exiting the European Union will be wound up on 31 January, the government has announced. A government spokesman said the news was broken to DExEU staff today. It has been been reported that, after the UK leaves the EU at the end of January, Boris Johnson will conducted an extensive reshuffle involving changes to the way Whitehall is organised. One option is for DExEU\u2019s functions to be taken over by a beefed-up Department for International Trade, which would take the lead in negotiating post-Brexit trade deals. In his foreword to the government briefing notes (pdf) on the Queen\u2019s speech, Boris Johnson makes it clear he is planning a programme for the next 10 years. He says: This is a radical Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 it will take us out of the EU, overhaul our immigration system, and will enshrine in law record investment for the NHS. And it will take our country forward with an ambitious one nation programme to unite and spread opportunity to every corner of our United Kingdom. Just imagine where this country could be in 10 years\u2019 time. A country with 40 new state-of-the-art hospitals. More fantastic nurses and fantastic doctors. More police officers making our streets safer. Children given a chance to reach their full potential. Cleaner air. Biodiversity protected. Scientists making incredible breakthroughs in technology. Better transport. Better infrastructure bringing people together. Greater connectivity. Greater opportunity. A Britain where we are uniting and levelling up. That is the future we are going to deliver. That is the future I am going to be working round the clock to achieve. I am humbled by the trust millions of voters placed in this government last week. The work to repay that trust starts here. Unless the repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act is going to go a lot further than any of us were expecting (the Act is the law saying a general election has to take place every five years, replacing the Septennial Act which used to be the legislation setting a time limit for the maximum length of a parliament), Johnson must be assuming that winning the next election won\u2019t be too much of a problem. Leo Varadkar reckons Boris Johnson is eccentric \u2013 but in a good way. The Irish taoiseach outed himself as something of a fan of the prime minister in an TV interview on Wednesday. \u201cHe is the guy that you see, he\u2019s bright, he\u2019s witty, very personable, but he is a bit eccentric as well. He\u2019s not the standard politician but that\u2019s probably a good thing on balance,\u201d he told Virgin Media One. Asked whether he considered Johnson to be really a Europhile and not a Eurosceptic he replied: The story goes anyway that it was a hard decision for him whether he was going to come out for or against Brexit. I definitely think he is internationally orientated though. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a little Englander. I do think he wants to see Britain as having a role to play in Europe and the world. Despite Johnson reportedly mocking Varadkar\u2019s surname \u2013 \u201cwhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like the rest of them?\u201d \u2013 the two men hit it off during a meeting in October that paved the Brexit deal. The prime minister\u2019s Love Actually spoof campaign video probably boosted his stock with the taoiseach. Varadkar is a fan of the film and cited it when visiting Theresa May at Downing Street in 2017. There was nothing in the Queen\u2019s speech two months ago about new spying legislation. But now the government is proposing legislation to give the security services \u201cthe tools they need to disrupt hostile state activity\u201d. The government notes (pdf) say this is something that has been planned since the Salisbury poisoning attack. The government says: The government is considering whether to follow allies in adopting a form of foreign agent registration, updating the Official Secrets Acts for the 21st century, as well as the case for updating treason laws. The Law Commission have been commissioned by the government to review the Official Secrets Acts. The Official Secrets Acts are the only pieces of UK legislation that currently exist to specifically address hostile state activity such as espionage, sabotage and subversion, other than the ports stop power we included in the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019. The government will reflect on their final recommendations when published. The government is also considering like-minded international partners\u2019 legislation, to see whether the UK would benefit from adopting something similar. This includes the US and Australia. Here is the text of the Queen\u2019s speech. And here is the 151-page government briefing document (pdf) giving details of the bills and other legislative proposals planned for this session of parliament. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn The Queen\u2019s speech always ends with two messages. Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public services will be laid before you. This is addressed to MPs only, because the House of Lords does not deal with the estimates, the government\u2019s department-by-department spending plans. The Queen goes on: My lords and members of the House of Commons, other measures will be laid before you. This means that, notwithstanding what is being announced today, the government reserves the right to introduce other bills. Governments often pass very significant bills at short notice that were never featured in the Queen\u2019s speech. The Queen ends: I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels. And that\u2019s it. The speech is over. The final passages are about defence and foreign policy. My ministers will continue to invest in our gallant armed forces. My government will honour the armed forces covenant, which will be further incorporated into law, and the Nato commitment to spend at least 2% of national income on defence. It will bring forward proposals to tackle vexatious claims that undermine our armed forces and will continue to seek better ways of dealing with legacy issues that provide better outcomes for victims and survivors. My government will work to promote and expand the United Kingdom\u2019s influence in the world. An integrated security, defence and foreign policy review will be undertaken to reassess the nation\u2019s place in the world, covering all aspects of international policy from defence to diplomacy and development. My ministers will promote the United Kingdom\u2019s interests, including freedom of speech, human rights and the rule of law. My government will work closely with international partners to help solve the most complex international security issues and promote peace and security globally. It will stand firm against those who threaten the values of the United Kingdom, including by developing a sanctions regime to directly address human rights abuse, and working to ensure that all girls have access to 12 years of quality education. To protect members of the armed forces from \u201cvexatious claims\u201d, the government is proposing an armed forces (legal protections) bill. More on Johnson and Corbyn, from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From ITV\u2019s Joe Pike The Queen turns to the constitution. A constitution, democracy and rights commission will be established. Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Sometimes the Queen\u2019s speech is significant for what it does not say. This tells us very little about what the government is planning, but there was a passage in the Conservative manifesto that triggered suspicions that Boris Johnson has grand ambitions in this area. It said: After Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people ... In our first year we will set up a constitution, democracy and rights commission that will examine these issues in depth, and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. Ministers have said very little about what this means in practice. The next section of the speech covers the economy and climate change. My ministers will bring forward measures to ensure that every part of the United Kingdom can prosper. My government will invest in the country\u2019s public services and infrastructure whilst keeping borrowing and debt under control, maintaining the sustainability of the public finances through a responsible fiscal strategy. My government will prioritise investment in infrastructure and world-leading science research and skills, in order to unleash productivity and improve daily life for communities across the country. It will give communities more control over how investment is spent so that they can decide what is best for them. To support business, my government will increase tax credits for research and development, establish a national skills fund, and bring forward changes to business rates. New laws will accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband. To ensure people can depend on the transport network, measures will be developed to provide for minimum levels of service during transport strikes. My government will continue to take steps to meet the world-leading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It will continue to lead the way in tackling global climate change, hosting the COP26 summit in 2020. To protect and improve the environment for future generations, a bill will enshrine in law environmental principles and legally binding targets, including for air quality. It will also ban the export of polluting plastic waste to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and establish a new, world-leading independent regulator in statute. There will be two bills covering broadband, a telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill and a telecommunications (connectivity) bill. There will also be an environment bill. From Labour\u2019s Anneliese Dodds Now the Queen is talking about law and order. My government is committed to a fair justice system that keeps people safe. My ministers will establish a royal commission to review and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process. New sentencing laws will ensure the most serious violent offenders, including terrorists, serve longer in custody. New laws will require schools, police, councils and health authorities to work together to prevent serious crime. My government will ensure those charged with knife possession face swift justice and that the courts work better for all those who engage with them, including victims of domestic abuse. Legislation will be brought forward to support victims of crime and their families. Measures will be developed to tackle hostile activity conducted by foreign states. There are five bills being proposed relating to criminal justice: a counter-terrorism (sentencing and release) bill, a sentencing bill, a serious violence bill, a domestic abuse bill, and a prisoners (disclosure of information about victims) bill \u2013 as well as divorce legislation, the divorce, dissolution and separation bill. The next bit of the speech covers immigration and what might broadly be seen as cost of living measures. The Queen says: A modern, fair, points-based immigration system will welcome skilled workers from across the world to contribute to the United Kingdom\u2019s economy, communities and public services. My government will bring forward measures to support working families, raising the national insurance threshold and increasing the national living wage. To ensure every child has access to a high-quality education my ministers will increase levels of funding per pupil in every school. Measures will be brought forward to encourage flexible working, to introduce the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers and to help people save for later life. New measures will be brought forward to protect tenants and to improve building safety. My government will take steps to support home ownership, including by making homes available at a discount for local first-time buyers. My ministers will develop legislation to improve internet safety for all. On immigration, there will be an immigration and social security coordination (EU withdrawal) bill. The other bills referred to here are an employment bill, a pension schemes bill, a renters\u2019 reform bill, a fire safety bill, a building safety bill and an online harms bill. More on Johnson and Corbyn. The Queen turns to the NHS. The integrity and prosperity of the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance to my government. My ministers will work urgently to facilitate talks to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland. My government will embark on an ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people\u2019s priorities. For the first time, the National Health Service\u2019s multi-year funding settlement, agreed earlier this year, will be enshrined in law. Steps will be taken to grow and support the National Health Service\u2019s workforce and a new visa will ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom. Hospital car parking charges will be removed for those in greatest need. My ministers will seek cross-party consensus on proposals for long-term reform of social care. They will ensure that the social care system provides everyone with the dignity and security they deserve and that no one who needs care has to sell their home to pay for it. My ministers will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. The government is proposing two NHS bills: an NHS funding bill, and an NHS long-term plan bill. The Queen is speaking now. My lords and members of the House of Commons. My government\u2019s priority is to deliver the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 January. My ministers will bring forward legislation to ensure the United Kingdom\u2019s exit on that date and to make the most of the opportunities that this brings for all the people of the United Kingdom. Thereafter, my ministers will seek a future relationship with the European Union based on a free trade agreement that benefits the whole of the United Kingdom. They will also begin trade negotiations with other leading global economies. The Queen is referring to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, that will get its second reading tomorrow, and to five related Brexit bills: the agriculture bill, the fisheries bill, the trade bill, the financial services bill and the private international law (implementation of agreements) bill. The Queen is about to start. Boris Johnson is still grinning intensely. MPs are now processing from the Commons to the Lords, having been summoned by Black Rod. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are walking side by side, although they don\u2019t seem to be talking. Johnson is smiling; Corbyn isn\u2019t. The Queen is now on the throne in the House of Lords. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, is now processing into the chamber of the Commons. The royal standard is flying above the Houses of Parliament now that the Queen has arrived. This is the Queen\u2019s 66th Queen\u2019s speech, according to the BBC. The Queen is leaving Buckingham Palace on her way to Westminster. Here are some more lines from Emily Thornberry\u2019s interview with the Today programme this morning. Thornberry said that one of her strengths was that she could offer \u201cclear strategic thinking\u201d. Referring to how she argued against Labour agreeing to an early election, she said: It\u2019s important that people understand about the fact that I can make political decisions and that I am strategic, and in the end that\u2019s going to be a very important part of the leadership ... We need to be able to work out what we\u2019re doing, and where we\u2019re going, and rather than just be reactive all the time. I think that it\u2019s very important, particularly now that we\u2019re going to be in opposition, that we have an idea as to how we will take Boris Johnson on, how we will hold him to account, and not, as I say, just allow ourselves to be kind of knocked around like a ball in a pinball machine. She cited the response to the Salisbury poisoning attack as an example of when Jeremy Corbyn was led down by his advisers. She said: Obviously within my own brief there was the issue of the Salisbury poisonings, where Jeremy seemed to have said one thing in parliament and then a different spin was put on it when briefed afterwards. That undermined him. Those sorts of things need to be called out, and I call it out. She dismissed suggestions that her background might be a handicap in the the leadership contest. She said: I am southern, I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m not. But the point is you\u2019ve got to come from somewhere ... What you need to do is to be able to be empathetic and listen to the public throughout the country, and, as for this kind of class issue, people who know me know that I come from a council estate. People who know me know that I was brought up by a single parent on benefits. The fact of the matter is what makes me a good politician is that I have had a very mixed life, I have had a large amount of life experience, and I can empathise because I have been there. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has insisted \u201cdemocracy must and will prevail\u201d as she confirmed she has now written to Boris Johnson formally requesting the power for Holyrood to hold a second independence referendum, the Press Association reports. She said that following last week\u2019s election victory in which her party took 47 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, the case for another referendum was \u201cunarguable\u201d. In a statement delivered at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said: The alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us. Scotland made it very clear last week it does not want a Tory government led by Boris Johnson taking us out of the European Union. That is the future we face if we do not have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence. Sturgeon has also published a 38-page report (pdf) setting out arguments for why Scotland should have the power to decide for itself to hold a legally valid independence referendum, instead of having to get approval from London under the Scotland Act, as is the case now. The UK government has said it will not give the Scottish parliament the power to hold a second independence referendum, arguing that the matter was settled by the referendum in 2014. But Sturgeon said: The question is often posed to me: what will you do if the prime minister says no? But the document we are publishing today turns the question on its head. It is for the prime minister to defend why he believes the UK is not a voluntary union of equal nations. It is for him to set out why he does not believe people in Scotland have the right to self-determination. And it is for the prime minister to explain why he believes it is acceptable to ignore election after election in Scotland and to override a democratic mandate stronger than the one he claims for his Brexit deal. We live in a democracy, and ultimately democracy must and will prevail. UPDATE: Here is some video from the press conference. Good morning. It\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech day, again, with the Queen heading for parliament only two months after her last visit to read out the government\u2019s legislative programme. Only this time it\u2019s for real, because Boris Johnson now has a majority to pass the bills he is announcing. We are expecting the speech to be a beefed-up version of what we heard in October, with some of the measures in the phantom Queen\u2019s speech being regurgitated, but some extra legislation added too. Here is my colleague Matthew Weaver\u2019s preview story. In the meantime electioneering in the Labour leadership contest continues. Having declared her candidature with an article in the Guardian yesterday, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has been giving interviews this morning. In her article she criticised Jeremy Corbyn for ignoring her warning that backing an early election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. Today, though, Thornberry has shifted her focus somewhat, laying the blame for Labour\u2019s failings not so much with Corbyn himself, but with his advisers. This is what she told Sky News when asked if she was willing to blame Corbyn for the election defeat. I\u2019m prepared to tell the truth, which is that in 2017 Jeremy was authentic, he spoke clearly, he spoke truthfully, people liked it. And what was the difference between 2017 and 2019? I think it was that we had been triangulating on the issue of Brexit, so people weren\u2019t quite sure where we were. I think we had other issues like antisemitism, like our response to Salisbury, where I think that Jeremy was just very badly advised. And in the end advisers should be there to give advice and politicians should be there to make the decisions. And too often we saw a situation where advisers felt that they were more important and should have more of a steer, in terms of where the Labour party was going, than the elected politicians. And that\u2019s not right. Thornberry did not name the advisers she was referring to. But people in the Labour party will have understood that she was referring to Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of communications and strategy, and Karie Murphy, who was Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff before being moved to Labour HQ to run the general election, reportedly in response to complaints about how she was running his office. When it was put to Thornberry that she was talking about these two, she did not demur. She also suggested Milne and Murphy should be dismissed. Referring to the fact that staff working in Labour\u2019s HQ, in Corbyn\u2019s office and for the shadow cabinet are facing the sack, but not Milne and Murphy, she said that was wrong. She said: Those redundancies don\u2019t seem to include the most senior people in the Labour party who made the decisions during the election. And that\u2019s not fair. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, holds a press conference to mark the publication of a paper making the case for Scotland being given the power to hold a second independence referendum. 11.25am: The state opening of parliament commences, with MPs and peers gathering in the Lords to hear the Queen\u2019s speech. 2.30pm: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn speak in the Queen\u2019s speech debate. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on the Queen\u2019s speech and the subsequent debate. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two other new bills include one that insists on a minimum level of service for the railways, which would prevent strikes bringing trains to a halt, and another on renting that would abolish no-fault evictions and introduce lifetime deposits.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has set out his vision for the Tories to govern for the next decade as he published a Queen\u2019s speech that points the way towards a harder Brexit and sweeping constitutional reforms. The prime minister claimed that he wanted his programme for government to last for more than one parliament, describing it as a \u201cblueprint for the future of Britain\u201d. More than 30 new laws were set out during the Queen\u2019s speech, including the EU withdrawal agreement bill, tougher laws on sentencing, new espionage offences and a commitment to constitutional reform. The Brexit bill in particular was met with dismay by Labour and other opposition parties, as its text has been been significantly altered since Johnson last week won an 80-seat majority. The new legislation has stripped out protections for workers\u2019 rights, watered down a commitment to take unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, and removed parliament\u2019s say on the future relationship. It also inserted a ban on the government extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. The move destroys any illusions that the prime minister might have been planning to face down his hardline Eurosceptics and pivot towards a softer Brexit, despite his claims in the Commons to be leading a \u201cone nation\u201d government. The government insisted that workers\u2019 rights protection would be enshrined in another bill, but Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, warned that the legislation \u201cpaves the way towards a hard and extreme Brexit\u201d. \u201cThe Tories have torn up the protections for workers\u2019 rights and child refugees \u2013 and watered down parliament\u2019s role in the next phase of Brexit negotiations,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cIt was a bad bill before the election and it is even worse now.\u201d He confirmed that Labour would not be supporting the legislation, but earlier there was a split in shadow cabinet, with some members representing pro-leave seats suggesting that the party should not vote against the bill at second reading at least. Johnson is planning to hold the second reading on Friday at 3pm and the legislation is certain to pass, given the prime minister\u2019s new majority of 80 MPs. Following the Queen\u2019s speech, the prime minister talked of \u201cinvincible confidence\u201d for the future after his general election victory, with his comments suggesting he believes he can win again in 2024. \u201cThis is not a programme for one year, or one parliament \u2013 it is a blueprint for the future of Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cJust imagine where this country could be in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d Brexit barely featured in his speech to MPs, except to repeat his election phrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d just once. The government will shut down the Department for Exiting the European Union in January and is expected to drop the word Brexit altogether from official documents soon. However, he later said: \u201cToday we will deliver on the promise we made to the people and get the Brexit vote wrapped up for Christmas. \u201cNow MPs will start the process of passing the bill. Then, at the beginning of the new decade, at the beginning of a new dawn for our country, our parliamentarians will return to Westminster to immediately finish the job, take us out of the EU on 31 January and move this country forward.\u201d A senior source said: \u201cOn 31 January we will have got Brexit done, and then the focus will be on the future relationship with the European Union.\u201d Johnson\u2019s primary focus for his speech was his \u201cradical\u201d domestic agenda, which, he insists, will change Britain. This will include a new Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission, which will examine \u201chow our democracy operates\u201d in a move that has caused concern among opposition parties that he will try to change the UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements in the Tories\u2019 favour. There has been speculation that he could give politicians the power to appoint judges, as in the US, following Johnson\u2019s loss in the supreme court this autumn, but a No 10 source insisted that would not be one of the changes being examined. The Queen\u2019s speech did, however, announce plans to ditch the Fixed-term Parliaments Act early next year, which gives the government licence to call an election at a time of its choosing, possibly as late as December 2024. The ceremony, which officially marks the beginning of a new session of parliament, was the second Queen\u2019s speech in two months. There were similarities to his first, but also several additions following the election and the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto. The main new piece of legislation is an NHS bill that would enshrine in law a \u00a333.9bn cash increase in funding by 2023-4, in what appears to be a largely symbolic move. A new counter-terrorism bill has also been added after the London Bridge terrorist attack. It would legislate for tougher sentences for serious terrorist offenders and a 14-year minimum term for the worst. It would also remove the option of early release for terrorists who receive an extended determinate sentence and move the earliest point for discretionary release from halfway to two-thirds of the way through sentence for terrorists who are deemed less dangerous. A third new element was the promise of \u201cespionage legislation\u201d, which would include introducing a new Official Secrets Act. The current legislation is more than a century old and needs updating to deal with \u201chostile states\u201d, according to the government. They could also look at introducing a register of foreign agents operating in the UK and updating the treason laws. Human rights groups expressed reservations about plans to review the possibility of reviving the offence of treason, which dates back to 1351 and was last used to prosecute the Nazi propagandist William Joyce, or Lord Haw-Haw, after the second world war. Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cCreating new criminal offences is rarely justified and existing laws already define hostile state activity extremely broadly.\u201d Britain\u2019s spy agencies have been pressing for the government to reform espionage legislation, last tackled two decades ago in the Official Secrets Act 1989, before the emergence of the world wide web. Existing secrecy laws are full of archaic terms such as \u201ccode words\u201d, although Collier warned that reform could easily result in \u201ca further attempt to increase state power while reducing accountability\u201d unless safeguards were introduced. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cSome of our allies have particular systems in place and we will be looking at systems such as the US has and if that practice could work in the UK.\u201d Two other new bills include one that insists on a minimum level of service for the railways, which would prevent strikes bringing trains to a halt, and another on renting that would abolish no-fault evictions and introduce lifetime deposits. Another bill would make it illegal for public institutions to take part in \u201cboycott, divestment or sanctions campaigns against foreign countries and those who trade with them\u201d \u2013 a move aimed at universities introducing such policies against Israel. Other key elements of a speech widely trailed in advance include further plans for tougher jail sentences and controversial proposals to oblige people to show photographic ID before they are allowed to vote. A new immigration bill would make EU citizens \u201csubject to the same UK immigration controls as non-EU citizens\u201d, thus ending free movement, and introduce an Australian-style points-based entry system, while another bill would update or replace EU regulations on financial markets. Eight bills outlined were devoted to law and order, reflecting the Tories\u2019 election focus on crime and punishment \u2013 a direction that has prompted alarm from prison reform charities. Under one measure, violent and sexual offenders would serve a minimum of two-thirds of their sentence before becoming eligible to be released on licence, compared with half under current guidelines. Another would significantly increase the six-month maximum jail term for foreign offenders who returned to the UK in breach of deportation orders.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s security agencies are investigating whether hackers from a hostile state successfully targeted a personal Gmail account to access an explosive cache of correspondence that was seized on by Labour during the election campaign. The leak inquiry into how the 451-page dossier got into the public domain is focused on the Department for International Trade. Jeremy Corbyn said during the campaign that the documents proved the NHS was \u201con the table\u201d in future US trade talks. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, warned ministerial special advisers at a meeting on Tuesday not to use personal Gmail accounts because \u201cforeign powers\u201d were targeting them. Special advisers are not supposed to use personal accounts for government business but, in practice, some communications are conducted via private accounts, where security may be weaker because they are outside official networks. It is not clear which country \u2013 if any \u2013 is behind the alleged hack, but independent analysts have already suggested that the cache was originally disseminated online by a Russian operation known as Secondary Infektion. One source said the investigation was focused on events that may have taken place a few months ago. An official spokesperson said the government was looking into the matter and added that the investigation involved the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a division of GCHQ, saying: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d Downing Street blocked an analysis of the threat posed by Russia to the British democratic system written by MPs from the all-party intelligence and security committee from being published during the election campaign. Immediately after the Conservatives were returned to power with an overall majority, No 10 said that the document had been approved for release, but claimed that publication had to wait for the committee to be formally reconstituted. Existing guidance from the NCSC aimed at individuals involved in politics tells them to use a \u201cstrong and separate\u201d password for their email accounts, and to use additional means of authentication, such as via a mobile phone, because of the risk that they will be targeted by hackers. During the election campaign, Graphika, a social media research firm, examined the history of the cache of emails before they were picked up by the Labour leader in a dramatic press conference at the end of November. Graphika said the full cache of emails was posted on Reddit by an anonymous Twitter user called Gregoriator, who in their initial writing made grammatical errors that matched those made by the Russian Secondary Infektion operation. A Twitter user with the same name then tried unsuccessfully to disseminate it by tweeting it to various public figures including Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians and even to celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Bette Midler in October. Graphika said the approach used matched amplification techniques deployed by Secondary Infektion, the name given to a Russian information operation exposed by Facebook earlier this year, operating across six languages and dozens of platforms. Labour has not said how the full documents ended up in the hands of Corbyn, but a pressure group Global Justice Now has said it was alerted to their existence online after the party leader obtained a heavily redacted version of them. The opposition party has also pointed out that their authenticity was never denied.",

The two NSW Rural Fire Service volunteers were killed when a truck believed to have been travelling in convoy near the town of Buxton late on Thursday hit a tree and rolled off the road. The driver and front passenger died at the scene, police said, while three other firefighters were injured. The fatal accident occurred at the end of an exhausting day for firefighters in which it\u2019s feared some 40 homes could have been lost in Buxton, Balmoral, Bargo and surrounds, as the Green Wattle Creek blaze tore through the Wollondilly Shire on Thursday. The NSW RFS officially says 20 homes may have been lost but there are reports 40 buildings were destroyed. \u201cThe Service\u2019s thoughts are with all the firefighters\u2019 family, friends and fellow brigade members,\u201d the RFS said in a statement early on Friday. \u201cThis is an absolutely devastating event in what has already been an incredibly difficult day and fire season.\u201d The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Twitter the news was \u201cdevastating\u201d, and NSW had \u201ctragically lost two heroes\u201d. Earlier on Thursday, three firefighters were treated for burns after their truck was enveloped by the bushfire. Two members of the crew, a 36-year-old man and a 56-year-old man, needed to be intubated to protect their breathing as they were airlifted from the scene with serious facial and airway burns. Fitzsimmons said the two men also suffered burns to their arms, elbow, upper chest and leg. A 28-year-old woman was also treated for smoke inhalation and superficial burns and was taken to hospital by road ambulance. Record temperatures and gusty, damaging winds combined with the prolonged drought crippling this part of the world to create what the commissioner of the Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons, described as \u201cvolatile and erratic\u201d conditions as more than 100 fires continued to burn across New South Wales. A day that began with Berejiklian declaring a second week-long state of emergency in a little over a month ended with Fitzsimmons telling media that three firefighters had been hospitalised after a crew of volunteers was \u201coverrun\u201d and \u201cenveloped\u201d by fire while trying to protect homes. Fitzsimmons, whose press conferences have become an increasingly common sight, appeared shaken as he described how the five-person crew had been overwhelmed as a fire burning to Sydney\u2019s south-west changed from metre-high flames to a towering inferno in a matter of minutes. \u201cI have had field reports from out there that very quickly they saw lots of fire activity, from metre-high flame heights to flames burning through the tops of trees [and] crowning fires, under very strong winds,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cIt was very volatile, very dynamic and, unfortunately, emblematic of much of the fire behaviour we\u2019ve seen, under the hot, dry, windy conditions.\u201d It came amid a backdrop of growing anger at prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the bushfire emergency. Morrison has been criticised for his initial reluctance to link the worsening bushfire conditions with climate change, and more recently for his decision to take an overseas holiday in the midst of the crisis. In the tiny village of Itchenstoke in the state\u2019s Blue Mountains the defence force was mobilised to rescue residents who became isolated when fire cut off the only road in and out of the town. Aerial footage from Bargo to the south-west of Sydney, where the three firefighters were overwhelmed, showed dozens of burning buildings and Fitzsimmons told reporters he feared dozens of properties had been lost to a separate fire burning to Sydney\u2019s south-west. \u201cWe\u2019ve got indications of quite a considerable amount of property being impacted,\u201d he said. Fitzsimmons said he believed some of the homes lost belonged to firefighting volunteers. \u201cThey\u2019re devastated by loss no matter what, but it just goes that little further when it\u2019s your own home, or the colleague you\u2019ve got sitting on the fire truck next to you, having lost their home, while they\u2019re out saving others,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a tough afternoon. It will be another very emotional, very draining day for our firefighters.\u201d As Sydney again woke to a now-familiar blanket of thick smoke on Thursday, hundreds of protesters gathered at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, Kirribilli House, angry at his perceived lack of leadership. A NSW Greens MP, David Shoebridge, was arrested at the protest for refusing to obey a move on direction by police. But speaking after the protest the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, dismissed their concerns, telling protesters they were \u201cwasting your time\u201d and that the prime minister was \u201centitled to a holiday\u201d. \u201cGo and do something productive,\u201d McCormack said to protesters. \u201cThose people who are shouting and screaming \u2026 go and help someone out in need. Do a good turn rather than shouting and screaming and holding up placards that not always the words are spelt correctly on.\u201d Before Thursday both Berejiklian and Fitzsimmons had warned that fire crews across the scorched state would again face an \u201cenormous challenge\u201d in the coming days during a fire season in which six people have already died and more than 750 properties have been destroyed. Australia\u2019s all-time record average temperature has been broken twice already this week, with the more than 50 fires continuing to burn out of control across the state quickly fanned by temperatures exceeding 40C coupled with strong, gusting winds. Throughout Thursday four major fires stretching from the state\u2019s south coast to the south-west of Sydney and the central coast reached \u201cemergency\u201d levels. One of those blazes, at Gospers Mountain on the state\u2019s central coast, north of Sydney, has burned through more than 400,000 hectares already. And after a brief reprieve on Friday, conditions are expected to deteriorate further on Saturday. \u201cThe temperatures will be higher, and the wind turbulence more severe,\u201d Berejiklian said. Fitzsimmons echoed that concern, saying strong winds from the west were expected for \u201c10 to 15 hours\u201d. \u201cSaturday will be a very, very difficult day,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s financial watchdog has launched an investigation into a security breach at the Bank of England that allowed hedge funds early access to an audio feed of Mark Carney\u2019s market-moving press conferences. In a breach casting a shadow over the governor\u2019s final weeks at the Bank before he stands down at the end of next month, Threadneedle Street confirmed that its back-up audio feed for press conferences had been misused by a third party supplier. Following a rapid internal investigation at the Bank after the breach was first uncovered by the Times, the central bank said it had referred the matter to the Financial Conduct Authority, which is now investigating the incident. Raising questions over whether hedge funds managed to profit from accessing the market-sensitive press conference seconds ahead of others, the breach comes after years of efforts to prevent misconduct in financial markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Threadneedle Street said that the misuse of the back-up audio feed \u2013 which is up to eight seconds faster than its main video feed \u2013 was \u201cwholly unacceptable\u201d and had been done without the Bank\u2019s knowledge or consent. The video feed is the main vehicle for broadcasting the press conference, and is handled by the financial news and data company Bloomberg. The third-party supplier was reportedly connected to a market news service that charged clients between \u00a32,500 and \u00a35,000, according to the Times. The Bank did not identify the third-party provider. However, Statisma News, a little known Essex-based company that sells live streams of central bank press conferences, posted a statement on its website in response to questions from the Financial Times. The company\u2019s directors are listed as Philip Wand and Tom Sillence, both of whom are also directors of Encoded Media, a video services provider to businesses based at the same address, which lists government departments, the NHS and the Royal Navy among its customers. The Guardian has attempted to contact Wand and Sillence for comment. The statement said: \u201cStatisma is a technology company specialising in the delivery of publicly available audio content. We do not carry embargoed information and we do not release information without it first being made available to the public. It is impossible to \u2018hack\u2019 or \u2018eavesdrop\u2019 any live public event or press conference. Any such suggestion is dismissed out of hand.\u201d Statisma tweeted in April that it could provide customers with feeds \u201cup to 10 seconds faster than watching them on live TV\u201d, including for press conferences held by the Bank, the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. The ECB said on Thursday that since September this year it had offered a low latency \u2013 or minimal time delay \u2013 audio feed to \u201caddress exactly the issues that were in the news today\u201d.

The Bank published the latest MPC decision on Thursday but no press conference was scheduled to take place. It said that the misuse of its audio feed had taken place since earlier this year, raising the prospect that hedge fund customers had obtained advantageous access to key press events. In 2017, the Office for National Statistics stopped giving out figures early after research showed it was highly likely they were being leaked. The breach will be of particular embarrassment to the Bank, given its recent focus on the security policies of the companies it regulates. Researchers found there was a \u201ccredible case to link cyber-risk to systemic risk in the financial sector\u201d in a December 2018 paper. The FCA is likely to focus on whether the information accessed early constituted inside information and then whether the managers of the investment firms involved had acted with propriety, a senior regulatory lawyer said. The investment managers involved could potentially face personal regulatory action, the lawyer said. Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, said that Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief operating officer should resign immediately in the wake of the breach. Joanna Place, who reports directly to Carney, has had responsibility for the Bank\u2019s information security since her appointment in July 2017. \u201cCarney should be absolutely furious,\u201d Blanchflower said. \u201cThe person in charge of the Bank\u2019s security should be quitting within the next hour. \u201cDid they know this was being done?

      "bodyText": "The battle for control of Just Eat has intensified after fresh rival bids for the UK food delivery business. Takeaway.com of the Netherlands upped its all-share merger offer to a deal worth 916p a share. The offer, which would create one of the biggest food delivery groups in the world, values Just Eat at nearly \u00a36.3bn, up from a previous bid in the summer that valued the company\u2019s shares at 731p each. Prosus, the Amsterdam-listed offshoot of the South African technology group Naspers, had earlier raised its all-cash bid by \u00a3400m to \u00a35.5bn, or 800p a share. The company previously made 740p- and 710p-per-share bids. Takeaway.com\u2019s offer would hand Just Eat shareholders a 58% stake in the merged company, up from 52% as previously offered. It is also offering to sell Just Eat\u2019s stake in the Brazilian delivery company iFood, which Just Eat owns in partnership with Prosus, and return half of the proceeds to shareholders. The company said shareholders representing 13.5% of Just Eat\u2019s stock had accepted its offer by 18 December.

Fiona Wright, Maria Tumarkin, Meera Atkinson and Michelle de Kretser have all knocked my socks off. Most recently I spent some time with Julienne van Loon\u2019s The Thinking Woman. A delicate and fascinating mix of memoir and philosophy, Van Loon shares her conversations with some international thinkers of repute including Rosi Braidotti, Marina Warner, Siri Hustvedt, Nancy Holmstrom and Laura Kipnis.</p> <p>The Thinking Woman is applied philosophy in the manner of Alain de Botton, but frankly, much better. Van Loon isn\u2019t repackaging the philosophy canon for the masses. Her thinkers are all contemporary and active in their fields.</p> <p>Great essays have texture and this book demonstrates that in spades. Delicately threaded through the ideas and interviews is Van Loon\u2019s own story written with a vivid, compelling simplicity.</p> <p>The book can be dipped into \u2013 it is essentially a series of essays on love, play, work, fear, wonder and friendship. Van Loon\u2019s description of playing ball with her young son in Western Australia is both tender and thoughtful. That playing with a ball could be a kind of physics experiment, that mother and son are both researchers in the world and in relation to each other, was exhilarating to read.</p> <p>I love books that lead to other books. The Thinking Woman is just that kind of book. I\u2019m now reading Rosi Braidotti. How wonderful to have found her.</p> <p><em><strong>Carrie Tiffany is the author of Exploded View. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/13/i-needed-to-deal-with-my-destructive-demons-before-i-could-write-about-my-past\">Read about it here.</a></strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Tara June Winch<br><em><strong>Welcome to Country: A Travel Guide to Indigenous Australia by Marcia Langton is a perfect companion</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Hardie Grant</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c597e4996b3fc50146a1b1559d5b1cfacc3278a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c597e4996b3fc50146a1b1559d5b1cfacc3278a8/0_0_535_650/412.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Country by Marcia Langton\" width=\"412\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s something memorable when you feel a hardcover book under that sheet of wrapping paper, there\u2019s no disguising what lies beneath.

Part two is the guide, state by state, and has all the necessary information including tips on everything from drinking water and fire permits to crocodiles.</p> <p>There\u2019s a beautiful foreword by Stan Grant and colour photographs throughout.

Although it is set in the Surry Hills of the 1940s, the Darcy family of Plymouth Street, Surry Hills, could just as easily have been the Darcy family of mid-century Fitzroy or Collingwood. In these neighbourhoods now strewn with espresso-scented restaurants and renovated terrace houses, schmick designer dogs and well-fed affluent owners, I sometimes imagine myself into the impossibly grim past of Park\u2019s novel. I see the flash of a thin child\u2019s vanishing figure down a slum laneway, or a weary aproned housewife leaning on a fence outside a mean dwelling, or men in hats on street corners, idle and flicking cigarette ash.</p> <p>Such is the brilliance of the novel: its mighty evocation of place and time. The other is its colossal humanity. These rich characters, the Irish-Catholic Darcys, have a decency and an emotional intelligence that lift them above their world of gut-wrenching poorness, of \u201cfetid lavatories\u201d and \u201crotting garbage\u201d and bedrooms dank and bed-bug-ridden.</p> <p>But there is more to The Harp in the South than poverty-porn nostalgia; <em>plus \u00e7a change</em>, it has something important to say still. Says Roie to Grandma: \u201cYou just ought to make your pension go further.\u201d And the old woman\u2019s reply: \u201cWhat am I, a magic-an?\u201d And Roie\u2019s reflection on \u201cthe cheap and dirty portion of the city\u201d: \u201cShe remembered the countless dirty old lonely men around the city, living in some cheap and squalid room\u201d.</p> <p>I cry through the novel\u2019s finale, Roie\u2019s great love affair with Charlie, but the tears might just as well fall for those not so unlike them who even today tread their own difficult paths through our ever unfriendlier inner cities.</p> <p><em><strong>Stephanie Wood is the author of Fake. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/18/after-being-catfished-i-lost-trust-in-the-world-but-i-am-anything-but-a-damaged-soul\">Read about it here.</a></strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Charlotte Wood<br></strong><em><strong>Night Fishing by Vicki Hastrich is a stunning memoir</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Allen &amp; Unwin</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4b891328b38c97f56efa92924354713883bee65c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b891328b38c97f56efa92924354713883bee65c/0_0_1807_2457/735.jpg\" alt=\"Night Fishing by Vicki Hastrich\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Night Fishing, like any truly great book, resists summary. How to describe Vicki Hastrich\u2019s stunning memoir, this \u201cnatural history\u201d of the author herself?</p> <p>Hastrich\u2019s books have received little media attention, perhaps because they\u2019re too complex for bite-sized packaging. But her reputation flourishes in the deep and personal exchanges between real readers, her passionate fans. Night Fishing is a case in point: everyone I know who\u2019s read it has expressed a kind of shocked rapture at its beauty and depth, its intellectual audacity and originality \u2013 and then vowed to share it with every other reader in their lives.</p> <p>Attempting the impossible, I\u2019ll summarise Night Fishing as a collection of taut, lyrical essays about water, art, language, family, the natural world and ways of seeing. It\u2019s a love song to the particular waterscape of Hastrich\u2019s childhood and a joyful inquiry into what it means to really <em>look</em> at the world around us. Its breathtaking ambition lies in linking things as seemingly disparate as Goya and sea turtles; Rome\u2019s Pantheon and Taronga Zoo; Galileo and a deadly numbfish. Hastrich\u2019s prose makes such seemingly outlandish connections effortlessly natural, each one revealing profound truths.</p> <p>I\u2019ve perhaps made it sound a high-flown book, but much of its power lies in its tender attention to the ordinary, to the smallest human moment. In a world overwhelmed with crassness and cruelty, this book is a sanctuary. It will bring you truth, and beauty \u2013 and peace.</p> <p><em><strong>Charlotte Wood is the author of The Weekend. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/14/the-weekend-by-charlotte-wood-friendships-fracture-in-moving-feminist-fairytale\">Read about it here.</a></strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Vicki Laveau-Harvie<br></strong><em><strong>Kristina Olsson\u2019s Shell is an exceptional novel</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Scribner</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c74819bba533d916db4aae1c3517f6985092ec44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c74819bba533d916db4aae1c3517f6985092ec44/0_0_1399_2152/650.jpg\" alt=\"Kristina Olsson\u2019s novel Shell, out in October 2018 through Scribner Australia\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This Christmas, I recommend giving the pleasure of a big, generous novel: Shell by Kristina Olsson. In luminous prose that shimmers across every page, the author shows us Sydney in the mid-sixties: a storied place seeking a way into its future. The Opera House surges into the city\u2019s consciousness, its \u201csails arcing out of chaos\u201d; a lottery decides which of the country\u2019s young men will be sent to Vietnam.</p> <p>A journalist exiled to the women\u2019s pages as punishment for her political activism, and a young Swedish glass sculptor brought to Sydney by Utzon to create something of beauty for future visitors to his visionary building, share a fleeting connection. The juxtaposition of their worlds shows us the forces defining the identity of this raw new place: engagement and neutrality; hardship and the richness of art and ideas. In one corner, philistinism and \u201ca shuffle toward sameness\u201d; in the other, freedom for the creative process, the furthering of the \u2018vaulting potential\u2019 of a nation.</p> <p>These struggles remain with us. We must still reconcile the imperatives of the ordinary and the longing for something higher to define us. It is the stuff of our conversations and our public debate. This novel helps us, as exceptional novels do, to reflect upon our dilemma. It makes us think; it makes us choose. It fires us up to defend the place of freedom and creativity in our world, to recognise the necessity of beauty.</p> <p>Shell is a gift.</p> <p><em><strong>Vicki Laveau-Harvie is the author of The Erratics. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/13/the-unmissables-the-erratics-by-vicki-laveau-harvie-a-memoir-of-entirely-its-own-genre\">Read about it here</a>.</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Christos Tsiolkas<br></strong><em><strong>Patrick White\u2019s The Tree of Man is a tale of great moral power</strong></em><strong><br><sub><sup>Vintage Australia</sup></sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"af95f4dde9cc8a48734ad856199d81c40bed0fa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af95f4dde9cc8a48734ad856199d81c40bed0fa8/0_0_1086_1673/649.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for The Tree of Man by Patrick White\" width=\"649\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If I could only recommend one book to buy for Christmas then it would be the same one that I would take to me to that mythical desert island at the end of the world: Patrick White\u2019s The Tree of Man.

      "bodyText": "Carrie Tiffany Julienne van Loon\u2019s The Thinking Woman is a fascinating mix of essays NewSouth, 2019 I\u2019ve read some fine essays this year. Fiona Wright, Maria Tumarkin, Meera Atkinson and Michelle de Kretser have all knocked my socks off. Most recently I spent some time with Julienne van Loon\u2019s The Thinking Woman. A delicate and fascinating mix of memoir and philosophy, Van Loon shares her conversations with some international thinkers of repute including Rosi Braidotti, Marina Warner, Siri Hustvedt, Nancy Holmstrom and Laura Kipnis. The Thinking Woman is applied philosophy in the manner of Alain de Botton, but frankly, much better. Van Loon isn\u2019t repackaging the philosophy canon for the masses. Her thinkers are all contemporary and active in their fields. Great essays have texture and this book demonstrates that in spades. Delicately threaded through the ideas and interviews is Van Loon\u2019s own story written with a vivid, compelling simplicity. The book can be dipped into \u2013 it is essentially a series of essays on love, play, work, fear, wonder and friendship. Van Loon\u2019s description of playing ball with her young son in Western Australia is both tender and thoughtful. That playing with a ball could be a kind of physics experiment, that mother and son are both researchers in the world and in relation to each other, was exhilarating to read. I love books that lead to other books. The Thinking Woman is just that kind of book. I\u2019m now reading Rosi Braidotti. How wonderful to have found her. Carrie Tiffany is the author of Exploded View. Read about it here. Tara June Winch Welcome to Country: A Travel Guide to Indigenous Australia by Marcia Langton is a perfect companion Hardie Grant There\u2019s something memorable when you feel a hardcover book under that sheet of wrapping paper, there\u2019s no disguising what lies beneath. One is so careful about taking the paper off of a hardback \u2013 it\u2019s akin to cracking caramelised sugar on a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e \u2013 there\u2019s a delicacy and joy involved at once! This book has a beautiful cover, entirely wrapped in the artwork Kura Ala by the Spinifex Women\u2019s Collaborative, the artwork and the title are embossed, alluding to the deeper experience of what is contained within the pages. Inside the premise is simple enough, but it\u2019s never been done \u2013 a travel guide, to the whole country, that leads the voyager to Aboriginal owned-and-run experiences, from national park guided walks to cooking classes. The guidebook is broken into two parts; the first introduces the reader to Indigenous cultures of Australia; with chapters on history, kinship, art, performance and, importantly, a chapter on cultural awareness for visitors. Part two is the guide, state by state, and has all the necessary information including tips on everything from drinking water and fire permits to crocodiles. There\u2019s a beautiful foreword by Stan Grant and colour photographs throughout. During a recent two-month trip around the country I used my copy and can attest to it being a perfect companion, to read by the fire in the morning, and wrapped in a towel, makes a decent pillow for one. Tara June Winch is the author of The Yield. Read about it here. Stephanie Wood Ruth Park\u2019s The Harp in the South is a mighty evocation of place and time Penguin There is, for me, forever a part of inner Sydney and Melbourne that is The Harp in the South. Although it is set in the Surry Hills of the 1940s, the Darcy family of Plymouth Street, Surry Hills, could just as easily have been the Darcy family of mid-century Fitzroy or Collingwood. In these neighbourhoods now strewn with espresso-scented restaurants and renovated terrace houses, schmick designer dogs and well-fed affluent owners, I sometimes imagine myself into the impossibly grim past of Park\u2019s novel. I see the flash of a thin child\u2019s vanishing figure down a slum laneway, or a weary aproned housewife leaning on a fence outside a mean dwelling, or men in hats on street corners, idle and flicking cigarette ash. Such is the brilliance of the novel: its mighty evocation of place and time. The other is its colossal humanity. These rich characters, the Irish-Catholic Darcys, have a decency and an emotional intelligence that lift them above their world of gut-wrenching poorness, of \u201cfetid lavatories\u201d and \u201crotting garbage\u201d and bedrooms dank and bed-bug-ridden. But there is more to The Harp in the South than poverty-porn nostalgia; plus \u00e7a change, it has something important to say still. Says Roie to Grandma: \u201cYou just ought to make your pension go further.\u201d And the old woman\u2019s reply: \u201cWhat am I, a magic-an?\u201d And Roie\u2019s reflection on \u201cthe cheap and dirty portion of the city\u201d: \u201cShe remembered the countless dirty old lonely men around the city, living in some cheap and squalid room\u201d. I cry through the novel\u2019s finale, Roie\u2019s great love affair with Charlie, but the tears might just as well fall for those not so unlike them who even today tread their own difficult paths through our ever unfriendlier inner cities. Stephanie Wood is the author of Fake. Read about it here. Charlotte Wood Night Fishing by Vicki Hastrich is a stunning memoir Allen &amp; Unwin Night Fishing, like any truly great book, resists summary. How to describe Vicki Hastrich\u2019s stunning memoir, this \u201cnatural history\u201d of the author herself? Hastrich\u2019s books have received little media attention, perhaps because they\u2019re too complex for bite-sized packaging. But her reputation flourishes in the deep and personal exchanges between real readers, her passionate fans. Night Fishing is a case in point: everyone I know who\u2019s read it has expressed a kind of shocked rapture at its beauty and depth, its intellectual audacity and originality \u2013 and then vowed to share it with every other reader in their lives. Attempting the impossible, I\u2019ll summarise Night Fishing as a collection of taut, lyrical essays about water, art, language, family, the natural world and ways of seeing. It\u2019s a love song to the particular waterscape of Hastrich\u2019s childhood and a joyful inquiry into what it means to really look at the world around us. Its breathtaking ambition lies in linking things as seemingly disparate as Goya and sea turtles; Rome\u2019s Pantheon and Taronga Zoo; Galileo and a deadly numbfish. Hastrich\u2019s prose makes such seemingly outlandish connections effortlessly natural, each one revealing profound truths. I\u2019ve perhaps made it sound a high-flown book, but much of its power lies in its tender attention to the ordinary, to the smallest human moment. In a world overwhelmed with crassness and cruelty, this book is a sanctuary. It will bring you truth, and beauty \u2013 and peace. Charlotte Wood is the author of The Weekend. Read about it here. Vicki Laveau-Harvie Kristina Olsson\u2019s Shell is an exceptional novel Scribner This Christmas, I recommend giving the pleasure of a big, generous novel: Shell by Kristina Olsson. In luminous prose that shimmers across every page, the author shows us Sydney in the mid-sixties: a storied place seeking a way into its future. The Opera House surges into the city\u2019s consciousness, its \u201csails arcing out of chaos\u201d; a lottery decides which of the country\u2019s young men will be sent to Vietnam. A journalist exiled to the women\u2019s pages as punishment for her political activism, and a young Swedish glass sculptor brought to Sydney by Utzon to create something of beauty for future visitors to his visionary building, share a fleeting connection. The juxtaposition of their worlds shows us the forces defining the identity of this raw new place: engagement and neutrality; hardship and the richness of art and ideas. In one corner, philistinism and \u201ca shuffle toward sameness\u201d; in the other, freedom for the creative process, the furthering of the \u2018vaulting potential\u2019 of a nation. These struggles remain with us. We must still reconcile the imperatives of the ordinary and the longing for something higher to define us. It is the stuff of our conversations and our public debate. This novel helps us, as exceptional novels do, to reflect upon our dilemma. It makes us think; it makes us choose. It fires us up to defend the place of freedom and creativity in our world, to recognise the necessity of beauty. Shell is a gift. Vicki Laveau-Harvie is the author of The Erratics.

      "body": "<p>Everywhere you looked in the Lords there were vast expanses of empty seats. Two Queen\u2019s speeches in as many months is at least one too many. Especially when the first one was just a political stunt that was never intended to be implemented. This time the peers were voting with their feet. Just 10 Labour lords could be bothered to pull out the ermine and take up their places.</p> <p>There were rather more Tories, but still not enough to prevent the upper chamber from becoming an echo chamber. There\u2019s going to be plenty of room for Nicky Morgan when she gets over her surprise at being given the peerage she knew she was getting months ago. And also for Zac Goldsmith, once the minor inconvenience of his previous non-dom tax status had been ruled out. The rewards for failure have never been higher. We now have two unelected ministers in the People\u2019s Government. Lucky, lucky us.</p> <p>Even the Queen was staging her own dirty protest at having her time wasted. Hell, didn\u2019t the government know that the last Thursday before Christmas was the day she traditionally headed off for Sandringham? This time she had given most of her retainers the day off, had dispensed with the state coach in favour of the company Rolls and just pulled on the shabby green coat that had been hanging by the door. Her face never broke from a scowl throughout. She couldn\u2019t have made her feelings any more plain.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn was also wishing he was elsewhere. On the walk from the Commons to the Lords, Boris Johnson repeatedly tried to engage the Labour leader in small talk. Corbyn looked as if he was about to be physically sick, walking jerkily like a broken cyborg, his head fixed rigidly ahead as he steadfastly avoided any conversation. It was petty and peevish, but the best he could manage under the circumstances.</p> <p>Boris shrugged and smirked to himself. This was his day and nothing was going to spoil it. He was world king at last. Free to do whatever he wanted, safe in the knowledge that no one could stop him. If he wanted to decriminalise stealing a journalist\u2019s mobile phone or offer an amnesty to anyone who was late with their child support payments, then he was free to do so. Right now, he was the supreme leader. It would take time for the people to find out that all the People\u2019s Government could be relied on for was to let them down. And by the time they did, it would be far too late.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, the Commons had reconvened for the opening of the debate on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/queens-speech-nhs-to-be-at-heart-of-legislative-programme-minister\">Queen\u2019s speech</a>. Tory Tracey Crouch kicked things off with a few good-natured panto jokes. The MPs who get asked to propose the humble address are usually those whose careers are considered to be behind them, she said. Pause. \u201cI\u2019d feel rather more reassured if the prime minister shouted back, \u2018Oh no it isn\u2019t!\u201d she continued. Boris merely ignored her. You win some, you lose some.</p> <p>Seconding the motion, Conservative MP Eddie Hughes, made his speech without notes. He started well enough but quickly lost his audience. He complained that the previous speaker had always restricted him to two-minute slots. After this, Lindsay Hoyle will probably reckon that John Bercow had been too indulgent. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d Hughes said with a flourish. We all did. Shut up and sit down.</p> <p>None of the main contenders for the Labour leadership were in the Commons for the occasion. Nor were most of the other backbench MPs; and those that were soon wished they weren\u2019t. It can only be Corbyn\u2019s minders that have prevented him from standing down for an interim replacement already. As each day passes, Corbyn looks increasingly miserable. His voice is listless, his existential futility almost tangible. With each sentence he utters, he further demotivates and depresses his party. Now, even the Tories consider him an irrelevance. Not even worth the effort of a heckle or an intervention. He sat down to near total silence.</p> <p>Then came Boris. The prime minister has been instructed to be on his best behaviour and not to gloat but he just can\u2019t do it. After a brief attempt at \u201cunite the nation\u201d rhetoric \u2013 the \u201ctrust me\u201d line has never gone down well in any of Boris\u2019s relationships \u2013 Johnson quickly lapsed into charmless insincerity. It was so charming the way Corbyn believed the silly things he did, he exclaimed. Pity can be crueller than mockery.</p> <p>Johnson then just went into full-on lying mode. Forty hospitals. Tick. Fifty-thousand nurses. Tick. Get Brexit Done. Tick. The bigger the lie, the more the Tories loved him. He wanted to restore public trust in politics. Said the man who has built his whole career and campaign style on destroying it. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust the Daily Telegraph, who can you trust?\u201d he asked. How about a paper the prime minister hasn\u2019t lied in.</p> <p>Eventually Boris got so carried away that he went for the biggest lie he could think of.

      "bodyText": "Everywhere you looked in the Lords there were vast expanses of empty seats. Two Queen\u2019s speeches in as many months is at least one too many. Especially when the first one was just a political stunt that was never intended to be implemented. This time the peers were voting with their feet. Just 10 Labour lords could be bothered to pull out the ermine and take up their places. There were rather more Tories, but still not enough to prevent the upper chamber from becoming an echo chamber. There\u2019s going to be plenty of room for Nicky Morgan when she gets over her surprise at being given the peerage she knew she was getting months ago. And also for Zac Goldsmith, once the minor inconvenience of his previous non-dom tax status had been ruled out. The rewards for failure have never been higher. We now have two unelected ministers in the People\u2019s Government. Lucky, lucky us. Even the Queen was staging her own dirty protest at having her time wasted. Hell, didn\u2019t the government know that the last Thursday before Christmas was the day she traditionally headed off for Sandringham? This time she had given most of her retainers the day off, had dispensed with the state coach in favour of the company Rolls and just pulled on the shabby green coat that had been hanging by the door. Her face never broke from a scowl throughout. She couldn\u2019t have made her feelings any more plain. Jeremy Corbyn was also wishing he was elsewhere. On the walk from the Commons to the Lords, Boris Johnson repeatedly tried to engage the Labour leader in small talk. Corbyn looked as if he was about to be physically sick, walking jerkily like a broken cyborg, his head fixed rigidly ahead as he steadfastly avoided any conversation. It was petty and peevish, but the best he could manage under the circumstances. Boris shrugged and smirked to himself. This was his day and nothing was going to spoil it. He was world king at last. Free to do whatever he wanted, safe in the knowledge that no one could stop him. If he wanted to decriminalise stealing a journalist\u2019s mobile phone or offer an amnesty to anyone who was late with their child support payments, then he was free to do so. Right now, he was the supreme leader. It would take time for the people to find out that all the People\u2019s Government could be relied on for was to let them down. And by the time they did, it would be far too late. A couple of hours later, the Commons had reconvened for the opening of the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. Tory Tracey Crouch kicked things off with a few good-natured panto jokes. The MPs who get asked to propose the humble address are usually those whose careers are considered to be behind them, she said. Pause. \u201cI\u2019d feel rather more reassured if the prime minister shouted back, \u2018Oh no it isn\u2019t!\u201d she continued. Boris merely ignored her. You win some, you lose some. Seconding the motion, Conservative MP Eddie Hughes, made his speech without notes. He started well enough but quickly lost his audience. He complained that the previous speaker had always restricted him to two-minute slots. After this, Lindsay Hoyle will probably reckon that John Bercow had been too indulgent. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d Hughes said with a flourish. We all did. Shut up and sit down. None of the main contenders for the Labour leadership were in the Commons for the occasion. Nor were most of the other backbench MPs; and those that were soon wished they weren\u2019t. It can only be Corbyn\u2019s minders that have prevented him from standing down for an interim replacement already. As each day passes, Corbyn looks increasingly miserable. His voice is listless, his existential futility almost tangible. With each sentence he utters, he further demotivates and depresses his party. Now, even the Tories consider him an irrelevance. Not even worth the effort of a heckle or an intervention. He sat down to near total silence. Then came Boris. The prime minister has been instructed to be on his best behaviour and not to gloat but he just can\u2019t do it. After a brief attempt at \u201cunite the nation\u201d rhetoric \u2013 the \u201ctrust me\u201d line has never gone down well in any of Boris\u2019s relationships \u2013 Johnson quickly lapsed into charmless insincerity. It was so charming the way Corbyn believed the silly things he did, he exclaimed. Pity can be crueller than mockery. Johnson then just went into full-on lying mode. Forty hospitals. Tick. Fifty-thousand nurses. Tick. Get Brexit Done. Tick. The bigger the lie, the more the Tories loved him. He wanted to restore public trust in politics. Said the man who has built his whole career and campaign style on destroying it. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust the Daily Telegraph, who can you trust?\u201d he asked. How about a paper the prime minister hasn\u2019t lied in. Eventually Boris got so carried away that he went for the biggest lie he could think of. He would build the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland that every civil engineer had said was technically impossible. The Tory benches went moist in a collective orgasm. This is the new present. It\u2019s also the future. Boris Uncontained. Until it all inevitably goes hideously wrong. And then he\u2019ll just walk away. Untouched. Untouchable. As the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford got up to reply, Boris merely pulled out his phone and started playing online CandyCrush with Classic Dom. This One Nation stuff was never meant to include the Scots.

The Wall Street bank is said to be formulating a deal under which its Asian subsidiary, rather than the parent company, would pay a multibillion-dollar fine and admit guilt for having allegedly turned a blind eye while $4.5bn was looted from its client, Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB. The deal would also involve oversight from an independent monitor that would help reform the bank\u2019s compliance rules, the Wall Street Journal reported. The settlement package would end the US justice department\u2019s investigation into Goldman Sachs\u2019 role as an underwriter and arranger of bond sales for the wealth fund, totalling $6.5bn. About $4.5bn was allegedly looted from 1MDB in a fraud said to have involved the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, the Malaysian financier Jho Low, and his associates. The funds were allegedly used to buy everything from yachts to artwork, and fund the production of Hollywood films including The Wolf of Wall Street. Razak is facing criminal charges in Malaysia but has pleaded not guilty. Low is facing charges in both Malaysia and the US, and has also denied wrongdoing. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, said it was lied to about how the proceeds of the three bond sales it conducted on the fund\u2019s behalf between 2012 and 2013 were used. In November, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, confirmed he had rejected a separate offer from Goldman Sachs worth less than $2bn. \u201cWe are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them \u2026 If they respond reasonably, we might not insist on getting that $7.5bn,\u201d he told the FT. Earlier this year, the Goldman Sachs chief executive, David Solomon, apologised to the people of Malaysia over the role of the bank\u2019s former employee Tim Leissner in the 1MDB scandal and the effect the fraud had on the country. Leissner, a former partner at Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty in the US in August 2018 to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7m.

Hedge funds paid $10.6m each to use the line, and profit from discrepancies between stock prices in New York and futures in Chicago. Those speculators used high-frequency trading strategies \u2013 placing large volumes of trades across different markets, often trying to profit from marginal movements in share or currency markets. Brexit uncertainty means any head start would be especially valuable. Some foreign exchange traders nicknamed the pound the \u201cGreat British peso\u201d when it became even more volatile than the Mexican currency. They also joke about \u201cplaying the forex\u201d, a reminder that gains can vanish in the blink of an eye. Eight seconds is ample time for a few blinks, or a rush of buy or sell orders. But there could be consequences for those who took advantage of the illicit audio feed. Tony Katz, the head of financial services and investigations at DLA Piper, said: \u201cThe FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will, in all likelihood, be investigating those who have sought to take advantage of potential inside information, and will take appropriate action should any evidence be found.\u201d",

The family\u2019s life was upended on Tim\u2019s 20th birthday in 2010, when the FBI raided the house outside Boston and arrested Foley and Heathfield as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/29/fbi-breaks-up-alleged-russian-spy-ring-deep-cover\">a swoop to detain 10 Russian spies</a>, whose cover had been blown by a defector.</p> <p>It transpired that Tim and Alex\u2019s parents were really Elena Vavilova and Andrei Bezrukov \u2013 career KGB agents who had gone through a multi-year training scheme for Russia\u2019s \u201cillegals\u201d programme, and were dispatched abroad under false identities. They kept their cover even as the Soviet Union collapsed and continued to serve the new Russia.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Elena <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/russian-spy-elena-vavilova-posed-as-a-canadian-estate-agent-for-over-20-years\">told the Guardian</a> in an interview in Moscow that she married Bezrukov in the Soviet Union before departing for the west, but the pair left separately, staged a meeting in Canada and then married for a second time using their new Canadian identities. They never spoke Russian together and raised their children speaking a mixture of English and French.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/discovered-our-parents-were-russian-spies-tim-alex-foley\">interview with the Guardian in 2016</a>, both brothers said they had no suspicions about their parents\u2019 real identities while growing up, and the raid and subsequent upheaval in their lives came as a shock.

Both brothers also faced trouble travelling and obtaining visas on their new Russian passports.</p> <p>Tim won his own case for citizenship last year, meaning both brothers now have their Canadian identities restored with no further right of appeal for the state and their lengthy legal battles are over.</p> <p>The court case hinged on a provision of Canadian citizenship law whereby anyone born in Canada is eligible for citizenship except employees of foreign governments. The Canadian government had argued that the secret work of Elena and Bezrukov should cancel their sons\u2019 right to citizenship, but the supreme court disagreed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been many difficult years, and I\u2019m sure I still have many challenges to face, but I can finally once again indisputably and confidently call myself a Canadian.

      "bodyText": "The son of two deep-cover Russian spies says he feels \u201can overwhelming sense of relief\u201d after winning his long-running battle to regain his Canadian citizenship. Alex Vavilov was stripped of his citizenship after the FBI arrested and deported his parents from the US in 2010, exposing their Canadian backstories as fake. \u201cThe judges said that Mr Vavilov was a Canadian citizen,\u201d Canada\u2019s supreme court ruled on Thursday, upholding an earlier federal court ruling that the decision to strip Vavilov of citizenship was unreasonable. The government had appealed the decision. \u201cAfter 10 long years of fighting for my most basic rights I can take a moment\u2019s rest. I feel vindicated that the courts ultimately supported my own beliefs regarding my citizenship,\u201d Alex told the Guardian by telephone. He plans to give a press conference in Toronto on Friday. Alex was born in Toronto in 1994 and grew up, along with his older brother, Tim, believing his parents were the Canadian citizens Tracy Foley and Donald Heathfield, who later became naturalised Americans. The family\u2019s life was upended on Tim\u2019s 20th birthday in 2010, when the FBI raided the house outside Boston and arrested Foley and Heathfield as part of a swoop to detain 10 Russian spies, whose cover had been blown by a defector. It transpired that Tim and Alex\u2019s parents were really Elena Vavilova and Andrei Bezrukov \u2013 career KGB agents who had gone through a multi-year training scheme for Russia\u2019s \u201cillegals\u201d programme, and were dispatched abroad under false identities. They kept their cover even as the Soviet Union collapsed and continued to serve the new Russia. Earlier this year, Elena told the Guardian in an interview in Moscow that she married Bezrukov in the Soviet Union before departing for the west, but the pair left separately, staged a meeting in Canada and then married for a second time using their new Canadian identities. They never spoke Russian together and raised their children speaking a mixture of English and French. In an interview with the Guardian in 2016, both brothers said they had no suspicions about their parents\u2019 real identities while growing up, and the raid and subsequent upheaval in their lives came as a shock. They said it was unfair that they were being punished for their parents\u2019 decisions. \u201cI feel like I have been stripped of my own identity for something I had nothing to do with,\u201d Alex said at the time. Both brothers also faced trouble travelling and obtaining visas on their new Russian passports. Tim won his own case for citizenship last year, meaning both brothers now have their Canadian identities restored with no further right of appeal for the state and their lengthy legal battles are over. The court case hinged on a provision of Canadian citizenship law whereby anyone born in Canada is eligible for citizenship except employees of foreign governments. The Canadian government had argued that the secret work of Elena and Bezrukov should cancel their sons\u2019 right to citizenship, but the supreme court disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s been many difficult years, and I\u2019m sure I still have many challenges to face, but I can finally once again indisputably and confidently call myself a Canadian. I hope this can be another step in my goal to regain a normal life, where I am no longer harassed in the name of political differences,\u201d said Alex.",

Back then, the Conservatives won a majority of 144, compared with 80 last week. In 1983 Labour got 27.6% of the vote \u2013 its worst share for 65 years. Last week it got 32.2% \u2013 mediocre, but more than at the 2010 general election, when Alan Johnson was home secretary, or in 2015 under Ed Miliband. This year Corbyn may well have been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win\" title=\"\">a disaster on the doorstep</a>\u201d, as Johnson put it; but such assessments conveniently omit to mention that New Labour, in its latter years, was an even harder sell.</p> \n<p>And unlike Foot, Corbyn won the support of a cohort of voters that will only become more important. According to the Conservative pollster Michael Ashcroft, last week Labour received almost three times as many votes from the under-35s as the Tories. In 1983, the Tories led Labour comfortably in this group. Then, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s party often seemed more modern than Labour, offering a vision of an individualistic, competitive country, which many young people liked. There was an intellectual ferment on the right, which for years had been producing fresh policy ideas.</p> \n<p>Few people would say these things about the Tories now. In 2019, their almost content-free manifesto, and massive reliance on older voters, were highly effective as election tactics. Yet, like the airy promises to increase state spending in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, they are also signs of a party with questionable long-term prospects. By contrast, Labour\u2019s youthful support, and policies addressing what are by common consent the biggest contemporary issues \u2013 the climate emergency, the inadequacies of the modern economy and Britain\u2019s proliferating social crises \u2013 suggest a party with the potential to do much better at future elections.</p> \n<p>And even some of the similarities between 1983 and 2019 are less terrifying for the left than many think. In both contests, Labour struggled against an unexpected surge of nationalism that swept up many of its traditional voters: the triumphalist aftermath of the 1982 Falklands war; and the 2016 vote for Brexit. Such episodes aren\u2019t that common, despite the best efforts of the tabloids, and their electoral effects don\u2019t usually last. In 1983 the Tories drew level with Labour among working-class voters, but by the next election Labour was well ahead once more. With Brexit likely to fade as an issue, and given the failures of past Tory governments to do much for the working class, it\u2019s not hard to see a similar process happening again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d0a1778-7575-4566-9313-4be4ccc9d51e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JikhuJjM1VM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a democracy as prone to changing its mind as Britain, political settlements and orthodoxies never last for ever.

Yet, given the way the Iraq war and financial crisis destroyed New Labour\u2019s credibility in government, perhaps his manifesto wasn\u2019t so naive after all.</p> \n<p>In the 80s, one of Labour\u2019s biggest electoral problems was that it often performed poorly in London. In 1983 it won only 26 London seats, less than half the Tories\u2019 total. Yet Corbyn\u2019s election to parliament that year as a scrawny young radical was an early sign that Labour would come to dominate the capital. Despite the fact that London has become ever more central to British life since, Labour\u2019s strength in the city \u2013 its total of 49 MPs there was unchanged by last week\u2019s election \u2013 is now presented by the party\u2019s critics as a weakness.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s regeneration after 1983 made little use of its London MPs, and instead revolved around clever young centrists with northern constituencies \u2013 such as Blair, who won Sedgefield for the first time in 1983.

New Labour\u2019s vote dropped successively in 2001, 2005 and 2010.

      "bodyText": "Turmoil has continued to escalate across India over a controversial citizenship law that is seen as discriminatory against Muslims, as tens of thousands defied bans on public assembly to take to the streets, the largest internet shutdown yet was imposed and three more people were killed. Attempts by the authorities to clamp down on the demonstrations by banning large gatherings in areas across the country proved futile, as protesters gathered in their thousands in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Bangalore and many other big cities. The largest protest yet in the capital Delhi took place on Thursday, despite the police denying permission for it, and about 1,200 people were detained. Roads were shut down throughout the capital, with barricades and thousands of riot police stationed along the roads to block a planned march from the city\u2019s historic Red Fort, but swathes gathered at the New Delhi landmark Jantar Mantar in mass civil disobedience. The closures of main roads and metro stations led to at least 19 flights being cancelled from Delhi airport, while schools were closed in the afternoon and warnings were issued on the radio for people in Delhi to stay in their homes. In response to the unrest, the government ordered mobile internet to be blocked in certain areas of the capital. In New Delhi, Vodafone and Airtel announced they had cut services on mobiles in some parts of the city on orders from the authorities. The mobile operator Jio is reported to have followed suit. The Congress party leader, Rahul Gandhi, described the internet shutdown as an \u201cinsult to India\u2019s soul\u201d. While the more turbulent regions of the country, such as Kashmir and the north-eastern states, have faced regular internet blackouts during unrest \u2013 in 2018, 67% of global internet shutdowns took place in India \u2013 this was the first time it had been imposed on the capital. Prashant Bhushan, a lawyer and civic rights activist, said the government was trying to stop people gathering by disrupting mobile services. \u201cShame that this government is scared of its own people,\u201d he said.

We can start to transform the party now. I don\u2019t want to beat the other candidates; I want to learn from them and with them. I want us to use this campaign to reach out to every other progressive force in the country \u2013 parties, campaigns and movements \u2013 for the biggest conversation possible about how, together, we can change our country for the better. Nothing else will do. Even at this dark hour, as Labour suffers its own Dunkirk, as retreat is forced on us, I\u2019m an optimist. And my hope is founded in the unshakable belief I have in all of us. People are amazing. Given the support, care and time we can do incredible things. Our job, in the words of Raymond Williams, is \u201cto make hope possible, not despair convincing\u201d. Labour can and must offer hope: not the falsehood that it will do everything, but the real promise that it can help us help each other. \u2022 Clive Lewis is Labour MP for Norwich South and shadow minister for sustainable economics",

      "bodyText": "Shelter\u2019s latest report paints a shocking picture of the homelessness crisis in England, but it is a sadly familiar one to councils on the frontline of this terrible situation (No home for 285,000 on Christmas Day in England, figures show, 17 December). Behind the frightening statistics are real personal tragedies. When I was out with Lambeth\u2019s rough sleeping team this week, I saw people sheltering in collapsing tents, shivering in the rain and in horrible personal distress. Almost everyone sleeping rough has been the victim of some form of physical, mental or sexual abuse. Councils like Lambeth do all we can to help those in need: this week we have launched a new homelessness and rough sleeping strategy that commits \u00a34m, despite government cuts to our budget, to rough sleeping services including 500 beds and rooms for rough sleepers. We help hundreds off the street each year, have built the first new council homes in a generation in the borough, and house thousands who need temporary accommodation. But every council in England is struggling to cope with rising numbers needing help. The government needs to make addressing this housing crisis, in partnership with local councils \u2013 whatever their political colour \u2013 a key priority in 2020. We need support from government to build more homes, a revolution in standards, rights and rent levels in the private rented sector, and substantial funding for homeless services. Without this 2020 will see even more forced into the nightmare of homelessness. Cllr Paul Gadsby Cabinet member for housing, London borough of Lambeth \u2022 Your G2 series The Empty Doorway, telling the stories of some of those who have died on Britain\u2019s streets, has been timely given the rise in the number of homeless people, and Sajid Javid\u2019s inaccurate claim in the election that homelessness was decreasing. I work in an area that became infamous when the former leader of the council suggested that homeless people should be removed prior to the royal wedding and that some people made a \u201cvoluntary choice\u201d to be homeless. The Empty Doorway articles have demonstrated that it is much more complex than that, and last week\u2019s (\u2018A stranger gave me a bed, a key and a job\u2019, G2, 17 December) provided a ray of optimism in its account of nine people finding their way off the streets. We have an inter-agency group now working in Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead to try to help the homeless by attempting to link work in our voluntary drop-ins and hostels with outreach services including housing, a GP, the council, drug and dependency services, and mental health provision. Far from being a \u201cvoluntary choice\u201d, we have found complex interrelated reasons for people becoming homeless, such as early neglect and abuse, unidentified autism, head injury, learning difficulties, mental health problems, and life events such as losing jobs or being thrown out by parents.

      "body": "<p>A radical ketamine-like drug has been licensed for use in the UK for severe depression, a decision that offers hope to the millions of patients for whom conventional treatments have failed.</p> <p>Esketamine, taken as a nasal spray, is one of the first rapid-acting drugs for depression and the first in decades that is thought to work in a fundamentally different way in the brain. However, psychiatrists are divided on the benefits, with some hailing esketamine as a game-changer and others raising fears about the potential for addiction and abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/18/depression-and-suicide-linked-to-air-pollution-in-new-global-study\">Depression and suicide linked to air pollution in new global study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Rupert McShane, a consultant psychiatrist and associate professor at Oxford University, said: \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly an advance and a well-worked-out drug. It\u2019s a drug, not a miracle. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but it provides an opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike conventional antidepressants, which take weeks or months to take effect, esketamine has been shown, in some patients, to have enduring effects within hours.</p> <p>The European commission announced its decision on Thursday to approve the drug, which Janssen sells in the US under the brand name Spravato.</p> <p>Before the drug can be marketed in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) must decide whether it will impose any additional safety requirements, such as patients being monitored for longer periods or the introduction of a registry.</p> <p>There is no scheduled date for a decision, although this typically happens within months.

      "bodyText": "A radical ketamine-like drug has been licensed for use in the UK for severe depression, a decision that offers hope to the millions of patients for whom conventional treatments have failed. Esketamine, taken as a nasal spray, is one of the first rapid-acting drugs for depression and the first in decades that is thought to work in a fundamentally different way in the brain. However, psychiatrists are divided on the benefits, with some hailing esketamine as a game-changer and others raising fears about the potential for addiction and abuse. Prof Rupert McShane, a consultant psychiatrist and associate professor at Oxford University, said: \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly an advance and a well-worked-out drug. It\u2019s a drug, not a miracle. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but it provides an opportunity.\u201d Unlike conventional antidepressants, which take weeks or months to take effect, esketamine has been shown, in some patients, to have enduring effects within hours. The European commission announced its decision on Thursday to approve the drug, which Janssen sells in the US under the brand name Spravato. Before the drug can be marketed in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) must decide whether it will impose any additional safety requirements, such as patients being monitored for longer periods or the introduction of a registry. There is no scheduled date for a decision, although this typically happens within months. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is also expected to rule in the first half of next year on whether esketamine will be available on the NHS. European approval was based on a series of trials, including a long-term study showing that patients who had previously not responded to conventional drugs and who were given esketamine had a 51% lower risk of relapse than a similar group given oral antidepressants and a placebo nasal spray. Prof Allan Young, the director of the Centre for Affective Disorders at King\u2019s College London, said having another option could make a substantial difference to some of the roughly 2.7 million people in the UK who have chronic depression and have not responded to conventional drugs. \u201cDoctors will have another treatment choice \u2026 For people who have got treatment-resistant depression there aren\u2019t that many choices, and many [choices] have significant problems,\u201d he said. The drug is thought to work on a different brain pathway from that used by the most commonly used antidepressant drugs, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These work by stopping the brain mopping up the chemical serotonin. Ketamine and esketamine appear to act on a different brain chemical called glutamate, and in animal studies has been shown to restore connections between brain cells that are thought to shrink back during prolonged periods of depression. Overall, the studies on esketamine have given mixed results, with two out of three short-term studies failing to find statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms, and some have raised the potential for side-effects as a concern. Risks listed on licensing documents include the potential for drug abuse, transient perception disorders, disturbances in consciousness, cystitis and increases in blood pressure. The licence states that the drug must be given under the supervision of a medical professional. In October, a group of 12 psychiatrists wrote to the MHRA opposing the impending licensing decision, saying: \u201cShort-term apparent benefits of using esketamine are unsurprising, given its similarities to drugs of abuse, and no basis for approving a drug. \u201cOne could achieve similar results, short-term euphoria or dissociation, with various other street drugs. Indeed, we are as shocked by this recent development as we would have been had es-cocaine been submitted for approval.\u201d John Read, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of East London, who was among the critics, said: \u201cThe fear is that in a few years we will be having a Public Health England review into people who can\u2019t get off esketamine.

It\u2019s a very different scenario from the abuse scenario where people take massive doses. At the moment, safety looks good.\u201d McShane said he was disappointed that the European licence had not imposed a requirement for patients taking esketamine to be entered into a central registry that would enable the long-term outcomes to be tracked. According to Young, esketamine is the first of a wave of new drugs in the pipeline for depression, including the psycho-active drug psylocibin, found in magic mushrooms, which is currently the subject of trials. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing lots of work with new chemical entities that are very different from old SSRIs,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this will be the harbinger of a new era for treatments.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Zac Goldsmith, who lost his seat in the general election, has been given a life peerage so that he can keep his role as environment minister. The former MP for Richmond Park in Greater London was beaten by the Liberal Democrats by nearly 8,000 votes last week in one of the few high-profile Conservative losses of the election. The government confirmed on Thursday that Goldsmith would be reappointed to his old post as a minister in the department for the environment, food and rural affairs and the department for international development. \u201cThe Queen has been pleased to signify her intention of conferring a peerage of the United Kingdom for life on Zac Goldsmith,\u201d said the announcement. A government spokesperson confirmed Goldsmith would continue to attend cabinet meetings. The confirmation follows widespread suggestions that the move was planned. Goldsmith, the son of the billionaire businessman James Goldsmith, is a long-time ally of Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds. His London mayoral campaign was accused of being racist and Islamophobic for trying to suggest that Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan had links with terrorists and extremists. The shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett, said: \u201cIt says everything you need to know about Boris Johnson\u2019s respect for democracy that he has ignored the voters of Richmond Park and appointed Goldsmith to government.\u201d \u201cThe public deserve better than a government appointed by \u2018jobs for mates\u2019. At a time when the Conservatives are investigating racism in their party, they\u2019ve appointed the person who ran an overtly racist campaign against Sadiq Khan. Zac Goldsmith is not fit to hold any government position.\u201d It is the second time in a week that Johnson has chosen to make a colleague a life peer in order to keep them in his cabinet. Nicky Morgan, who stood down as an MP ahead of the election, was appointed to the House of Lords so that she could stay on as culture secretary. Responding to earlier reports that Goldsmith was in line for a peerage, Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: \u201cThe bloated House of Lords is already packed full of defeated and former MPs \u2013 over 200 of them. Politicians shouldn\u2019t be rewarded with votes on our laws for life after losing their seat. \u201cThis issue we\u2019ve seen across parties for years and makes an absolute joke of democratic accountability. Our second chamber should not be some absurd insurance policy for trounced MPs.\u201d Goldsmith has been an outspoken advocate for voters having the right to recall MPs outside a general election. Putting a proposal before parliament in 2014, he said: \u201cWhat is at stake now is a matter of principle. Do we trust our voters to hold us to account or not?\u201d",

Four hundred jobs were at risk, just before Christmas. And there was going to be a lot of collateral damage \u2013 including Galley Beggar Press. The Book People owed us \u00a340,800, and the administrators had frozen all payments to suppliers. There was a small chance that a buyer would be found and we might be able to file a claim and \u2013 eventually \u2013 get some of the money back. But money that we might claw back in the future was no good to us when we had bills to pay now.</p> <p>We began to panic.</p> <p>Our small press has had a very lucky and successful year, which has seen one of our novels, Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport, shortlisted for the Booker prize. When that happens, publishers always supply hardback copies of their shortlisted books for The Book People to sell. We weren\u2019t technically required to do so \u2013 but it\u2019s an important promotion that\u2019s been running since 2002, so it would have looked very bad if we had been the only publisher who hadn\u2019t complied. It was a deal with very tight margins, but it was also one that (we thought) guaranteed us a lump sum at the end of the year. Which was good, because alongside the cost of printing 8,000 hardbacks, we had more books to supply and were racking up plenty of other debts and bills. We used my personal savings and took out loans. While it was hard not to be anxious, we knew the money was on the way \u2013 until it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>The Book People went into administration just two weeks before the payment was due. We had a sleepless night wondering about what we could cut, who might be OK about being paid late. There were many questions and few solutions. Then, as a last desperate throw of the dice, Elly suggested crowdfunding. We didn\u2019t like imposing on people\u2019s goodwill \u2013 especially so near to Christmas \u2013 but we liked the thought of announcing our closure in spring even less. So when morning came, we quickly wrote a Gofundme appeal. I can\u2019t bear to look at it now, as it feels like it came out in a mad fever \u2026 But that was nothing compared to what happened next.</p> <p>Or almost next. Here\u2019s an insight into the glamour of publishing. As soon as we\u2019d fired off the appeal I had to go and put some boxes of books in a friend\u2019s shed. I hadn\u2019t realised what was happening until a journalist from the Bookseller phoned up. She told me that in less than an hour we\u2019d raised over \u00a36,000. It was at this point that I started crying. I am still teary, thinking of that extraordinary generosity and goodwill. We couldn\u2019t keep up. The tweets. The emails. The man who knocked on our door and handed us a cheque for \u00a3250, telling us: \u201cYou have to keep at it.\u201d Within 24 hours of thinking it might be curtains, people had given us the full \u00a340,000. It\u2019s a wonderful life.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to end there. But there is one more thing to say. I now feel much more hopeful for our future, but I also worry that we won\u2019t be the only company to encounter this kind of trauma in the coming months and years. I worry that The Book People was affected by political and economic uncertainty around Brexit. Our national nightmare is going to take down more of us. Publishers aren\u2019t supposed to be charities. I feel honoured and privileged that people have rallied around our flame this time. It\u2019s just one of many that must be kept alive; I hope we can all support each other in the future, too.</p>",

We weren\u2019t technically required to do so \u2013 but it\u2019s an important promotion that\u2019s been running since 2002, so it would have looked very bad if we had been the only publisher who hadn\u2019t complied. It was a deal with very tight margins, but it was also one that (we thought) guaranteed us a lump sum at the end of the year. Which was good, because alongside the cost of printing 8,000 hardbacks, we had more books to supply and were racking up plenty of other debts and bills. We used my personal savings and took out loans. While it was hard not to be anxious, we knew the money was on the way \u2013 until it wasn\u2019t. The Book People went into administration just two weeks before the payment was due. We had a sleepless night wondering about what we could cut, who might be OK about being paid late. There were many questions and few solutions. Then, as a last desperate throw of the dice, Elly suggested crowdfunding. We didn\u2019t like imposing on people\u2019s goodwill \u2013 especially so near to Christmas \u2013 but we liked the thought of announcing our closure in spring even less. So when morning came, we quickly wrote a Gofundme appeal. I can\u2019t bear to look at it now, as it feels like it came out in a mad fever \u2026 But that was nothing compared to what happened next. Or almost next. Here\u2019s an insight into the glamour of publishing. As soon as we\u2019d fired off the appeal I had to go and put some boxes of books in a friend\u2019s shed. I hadn\u2019t realised what was happening until a journalist from the Bookseller phoned up. She told me that in less than an hour we\u2019d raised over \u00a36,000. It was at this point that I started crying. I am still teary, thinking of that extraordinary generosity and goodwill. We couldn\u2019t keep up. The tweets. The emails. The man who knocked on our door and handed us a cheque for \u00a3250, telling us: \u201cYou have to keep at it.\u201d Within 24 hours of thinking it might be curtains, people had given us the full \u00a340,000. It\u2019s a wonderful life. I\u2019d like to end there. But there is one more thing to say. I now feel much more hopeful for our future, but I also worry that we won\u2019t be the only company to encounter this kind of trauma in the coming months and years. I worry that The Book People was affected by political and economic uncertainty around Brexit. Our national nightmare is going to take down more of us. Publishers aren\u2019t supposed to be charities. I feel honoured and privileged that people have rallied around our flame this time. It\u2019s just one of many that must be kept alive; I hope we can all support each other in the future, too.",

Indeed, since 2009 (when the interest rate went down to 0.5%) the Bank has cut the interest rate only once to 0.25% (following the Brexit vote in August 2016) and then hiked to 0.5% (in November 2017) and then again to 0.75% in (August 2018). Notice that these three interest rate actions occurred at the same time while new Inflation Reports were released by the Bank.</p> <p>It is not a secret that the Bank has the \u201chabit\u201d of changing interest rates and explaining their impact on the economy through the accompanying Inflation Reports. In fact, this is part of the Bank\u2019s (successful) communication strategy. Therefore, interest rate decisions, since 2009, have by no means surprised anybody which arguably puts to bed any suggestion that traders benefited as far as interest rate decisions are concerned.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfb951b8f08c3972263d643\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T15:29:46.120Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Any City traders who took advantage of the hacked Bank of England\u2019s audio feed might expect a call from the UK\u2019s financial regulator.</strong></p> <p><strong>Tony Katz</strong>, head of Financial Services and Investigations at <strong>DPA Piper</strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England will need to consider whether its information controls were adequate and whether they met the standards they expect of those they regulate.</p> <p>The FCA will, in all likelihood, be investigating those who have sought to take advantage of potential inside information and will take appropriate action should any evidence be found.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T15:39:37.120Z\">at 3.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfb89248f085eda5c10aa8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T14:51:58.187Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Pressure is mounting on the Bank of England\u2019s chief operating officer to resign immediately.</strong></p> <p>Joanna Place is facing scrutiny over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/dec/19/bank-of-england-hedge-fund-hack-interest-rates-sterling-ftse-business-live?page=with:block-5dfb225d8f087e8308e60d80#block-5dfb225d8f087e8308e60d80\">the security breach</a> that gave paying hedge funds early access to Mark Carney\u2019s market-moving press conferences.</p> <p>My colleague Jasper Jolly reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Joanna Place reports directly to Carney, the governor, and has had responsibility for the Bank\u2019s information security since July 2017. </p> <p>Danny Blanchflower, who served on the MPC until 2009, said Place\u2019s position was untenable after the Bank admitted the breach, first reported by the Times, late on Wednesday night.<br></p> <p>\u201cCarney should be absolutely furious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person in charge of the Bank\u2019s security should be quitting within the next hour.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/19/hedge-funds-hacked-into-bank-of-england-briefings\">Bank of England executive urged to quit over security breach</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfb81108f087e8308e610f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T13:56:04.666Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Economist Shaun Richards has given the Bank of England quite a blast for allowing its audio feed to be hacked, giving some hedge funds an advantage</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/dec/19/bank-of-england-hedge-fund-hack-interest-rates-sterling-ftse-business-live?page=with:block-5dfb225d8f087e8308e60d80#block-5dfb225d8f087e8308e60d80\">He writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is disgraceful on two counts.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 has ended the day 33 points higher at 7573, up almost 0.4%. Multinational companies were lifted by the weaker pound, which has lost half a cent to $1.3030 tonight. Mining giant Glencore (+2.3%), pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca (+2%) and medical equipment maker Smith &amp; Nephew were among the risers. Good night! On a positive note, at least the problems with the Bank of England\u2019s audio feed didn\u2019t lead to any interest rate moves being leaked. Not that there have been many to leak, as Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University writes: The hack of the Bank of England\u2019s press conference audio feed is very serious and the Bank needs to tighten its IT-related security. Nevertheless, it is arguably a huge exaggeration to believe that (some) traders might have exploited early information with reference to interest rate moves in particular. Indeed, since 2009 (when the interest rate went down to 0.5%) the Bank has cut the interest rate only once to 0.25% (following the Brexit vote in August 2016) and then hiked to 0.5% (in November 2017) and then again to 0.75% in (August 2018). Notice that these three interest rate actions occurred at the same time while new Inflation Reports were released by the Bank. It is not a secret that the Bank has the \u201chabit\u201d of changing interest rates and explaining their impact on the economy through the accompanying Inflation Reports. In fact, this is part of the Bank\u2019s (successful) communication strategy. Therefore, interest rate decisions, since 2009, have by no means surprised anybody which arguably puts to bed any suggestion that traders benefited as far as interest rate decisions are concerned. Any City traders who took advantage of the hacked Bank of England\u2019s audio feed might expect a call from the UK\u2019s financial regulator. Tony Katz, head of Financial Services and Investigations at DPA Piper, explains: The Bank of England will need to consider whether its information controls were adequate and whether they met the standards they expect of those they regulate. The FCA will, in all likelihood, be investigating those who have sought to take advantage of potential inside information and will take appropriate action should any evidence be found.\u201d Pressure is mounting on the Bank of England\u2019s chief operating officer to resign immediately. Joanna Place is facing scrutiny over the security breach that gave paying hedge funds early access to Mark Carney\u2019s market-moving press conferences. My colleague Jasper Jolly reports: Joanna Place reports directly to Carney, the governor, and has had responsibility for the Bank\u2019s information security since July 2017. Danny Blanchflower, who served on the MPC until 2009, said Place\u2019s position was untenable after the Bank admitted the breach, first reported by the Times, late on Wednesday night. \u201cCarney should be absolutely furious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person in charge of the Bank\u2019s security should be quitting within the next hour. More here: Economist Shaun Richards has given the Bank of England quite a blast for allowing its audio feed to be hacked, giving some hedge funds an advantage. He writes: This is disgraceful on two counts. Firstly in an era of computer driven algorithm driven trading an edge like this is quite something for them as we mull exactly who was more equal than others? To coin a phrase. Next is the fact that this happened at the ECB several years ago and after such a warning someone should have been dispatched to make sure that it could not happen at the Old Lady. So we can add laziness to the incompetence. Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, says the BoE is in \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 mode, after leaving interest rate on hold. This familiar holding pattern is likely to continue for some time as we await detail on what the future relationship with the European Union looks like. However, it is clear from the Bank that it is not just Brexit, or the hedge funds, that Mark Carney and co seem to be concerned about. They have specifically referenced the need to act on interest rates should global growth fail to stabilise and ease to help boost UK GDP and inflation. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR, says Carney\u2019s replacement will have a lot on their plate: \u201cWhile today\u2019s interest rate decision was widely anticipated, a myriad of factors will be crucial in determining the future path of UK monetary policy. When the new BoE governor takes over in January 2020, he or she will need to consider the risk of falling demand from the UK\u2019s most significant trading partners, the impact of the US-China trade war on the wider global economy and, barring any surprises, the outcome of the long-drawn Brexit process.\u201d \u2013 Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts rates will be cut next year: \u201cAfter last week\u2019s election result, the short-term clarity we have on Brexit could give a lift to economic sentiment, especially for businesses. A modest fiscal easing in the forthcoming budget could also push things along a little. \u201cOverall, though, as attention turns to the December 2020 end of transition deadline, the mood will likely remain subdued and growth weak. We expect that the committee will move further towards a rate cut in 2020 and a quarter point easing in May.\u201d The Bank minutes show that Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders believe the UK economy needed an interest rate cut now, to protect it from problems at home and abroad. The pair, both external members of the committee, argued: The economy had been a little softer than expected, and there was a modest but rising amount of spare capacity. Core inflation was subdued. Employment growth was slowing and seemed likely to weaken further given trends in vacancies and firms\u2019 hiring intentions. Downside risks remained to the MPC\u2019s projections from a weaker world outlook and Brexit uncertainties. With relatively limited space to cut Bank Rate, risk management considerations favoured a prompt response to downside risks at present in order to ensure a sustained return of inflation to the target. Most members of the Monetary Policy committee remain hopeful that the UK economy will strengthen in 2020. They anticipate lower uncertainty, easier fiscal policy and somewhat stronger global growth. Boris Johnson\u2019s victory, and the trade truce between the US and China, could help. But it\u2019s still early days, the BoE points out: The biggest news since November had been on global trade and domestic policy developments, but it was too early to judge how material that would prove to be for the economic outlook. There\u2019s little chance of significant economic growth this quarter, the BoE fears: UK GDP increased by 0.3% in 2019 Q3 and is expected to rise only marginally in Q4. Household consumption has continued to grow steadily, but business investment and export orders have remained weak. Financial markets have remained sensitive to domestic policy developments. But it also points out that the pound, and the stock market, have both rallied in the month: Since the November Report, the sterling exchange rate has appreciated by 2% and UK-focused equities have outperformed their international counterparts. There is no evidence yet about the extent to which policy uncertainties among companies and households have declined. The Bank reckons the global economic outlook appears slightly rosier than a month ago. It says: Global growth has shown tentative signs of stabilising and global financial conditions remain supportive. The partial de-escalation of the US-China trade war provides some additional support to the outlook relative to the November Report, although trade tensions remain elevated. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee also voted unanimously to maintain its asset purchase scheme (which currently holds \u00a3435bn of government debt and \u00a310bn of corporate bonds) Newsflash: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold, at 0.75%. But two policymakers, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, pushed for rates to be cut to 0.5%, echoing last month\u2019s vote. The Bank of England\u2019s early-access breach has broader implications for the new governor\u2019s role, according to former rate-setter Andrew Sentance. Successive governors have taken on greater and greater responsibilities. These range from dealing with intense scrutiny over every word in market-sensitive interest rate announcements to running a large organisation with significant security duties. Sentance told us that Mark Carney\u2019s replacement, due to be announced soon, should change tack: \u201cOne of the weaknesses of the Bank\u2019s organisation is too much power is concentrated in the governor. \u201cIf I was making a recommendation it would be to act more as a chairman and less as a chief executive.\u201d The Bank only appointed its first chief operating officer in 2012 to look after the day-to-day running of the Threadneedle Street headquarters and its various regional outposts, but the governor still has overarching responsibility. Economic responsibilities were formerly more spread between the nine members of the monetary policy committee. When he was chief economist Mervyn King answered most of the monetary policy questions, but he did not then relinquish that responsibility, setting a precedent for the governor to be the public figurehead. The number of deputy governors has increased to four, but the governor has nevertheless ended up with more work, Sentance added. \u201cThe productivity of deputy governors has not been a good lead to the economy.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s retail sales shocker: The Wall Street Journal has a good take on Sweden\u2019s interest rate hike. Here\u2019s a flavour: Sweden\u2019s central bank, one of the pioneers in wielding negative interest rates, became the first to end that policy Thursday, a move closely watched by other institutions that have resorted to what was supposed to be a radical and short-lived measure. In 2009, the Riksbank, the world\u2019s oldest central bank, became the first to charge commercial banks to hold deposits rather than pay them interest. In 2015, it lowered its key policy rate below zero, following a similar move by the European Central Bank the year before. On Thursday, the Riksbank raised the key rate to zero from minus 0.25%. The bank moved because a majority of its policy makers expect inflation to be close to its 2% target over the coming years. But it signaled caution, indicating it has no plans to raise its key rate further in the coming year. The WSJ also points out that two Riksbank policymakers, Anna Breman and Per Jansson \u2014opposed the move. They wanted to wait for more proof that inflation was on target. Just in: UK retail spending has slowed sharply, suggesting that nervous consumers cut back ahead of the general election. Retail sales fell by 0.6% month-on-month in November, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s much worse than expected. This dragged annual retail sales growth down to just 1% last month, from 3.1% in October. That\u2019s the weakest since April 2018. Looking at the last quarter, sales are down 0.4% - again, the worst reading in 19 months. However..... the ONS\u2019s reporting period doesn\u2019t actually cover Black Friday (which fell on 29th November), so it has adjusted the data to address that. Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, says the hack of its press conference audio feed is \u201cunprecedented\u201d for a central bank. Sentance, who is now senior adviser to Cambridge Econometrics, told us the Bank faces a lot of serious questions: \u201cCentral banks pride themselves on confidentiality and making sure communication is well managed. There has been an abuse of information here. The question in your mind will be, if this happened what else has happened? Are the Bank\u2019s communications secure?\u201d Sweden\u2019s interest rate rise is a small but significant milestone as central bankers try to extricate themselves from a decade of loose monetary policy. Significantly, the Riksbank is ending negative interest rates while still continuing its asset-purchase programme (buying bonds with new money to stimulate growth). Other banks have suggested that they\u2019d work the other way -- ending QE before risking higher borrowing costs. Clearly the Riksbank felt negative interest rates were too painful to persist with. Simon Harvey of Monex Europe has tweeted about this: Newsflash: Sweden\u2019s central bank has raised interest rates, to the heady heights of ZERO! The Riksbank has just ended its policy of negative interest rates, by lifting them from -0.25% to 0%. That will please savers and Swedish banks, as negative rates eroded their profitability. But... the Riksbank also warns that it could cut interest rates back below zero, if the economy performs weaker than expected. You don\u2019t need to hack the Bank of England to know that financial markets are winding down for Christmas. The main European indices are inching higher in quiet trading. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.1%, and the French CAC is 0.2% higher. The UK FTSE is flat, though, with a strengthening pound weighing on some stocks. Sterling is up almost half a cent at $1.3115, following two days of heavy losses that wiped out the \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019. Stephen Innes of AxiTrader says: The \u201c Tory Glory \u201c election relief rally has given way to the uncertainty of the next stages of the Brexit process. UK-EU trade negotiations, and the tight proposed deadline at the end of the transition period. Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank of England\u2019s eavesdropping woes: The Times also reports that these hedge fund clients were paying between \u00a32,500 and \u00a35,000 per press conference for access to the BoE\u2019s audio feed. You don\u2019t pay that sort of money unless you\u2019re expecting a trading advantage in return. The BoE insists that none of its decisions have been leaked early -- just the audio feed of its press conferences (which is bad enough!). It says: The Bank operates the highest standards of information security around the release of the market sensitive decisions of its policy committees. The issue identified related only to the broadcast of press conferences that follow such statements.\u201d The Bank of England has now referred the misuse of its press conference audio feed to the Financial Conduct Authority, Reuters reports. The FCA is responsible for regulating the City, so will have to decide whether this is a breach of its regulations..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is at the heart of a \u2018hedge fund hack\u2019 controversy this morning as it prepares to set interest rates for the final time in 2019. The UK central bank has admitted that some high speed traders have been able to listen in to market-sensitive press conferences before they were officially broadcast. Astonishingly, one of the BoE\u2019s own suppliers hacked into its systems, allowing it to send an audio feed of, say, governor Mark Carney\u2019s words of wisdom. This gave certain traders a potentially massive advantage to react to market-moving events before the rest of the City. It\u2019s a serious blunder - exposed by our friends at The Times. The Bank itself is clearly fuming, saying: This wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed was without the bank\u2019s knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further.\u201d The audio feed was apparently supposed to be a \u201cfallback option\u201d in case the usual video feed (streamed online) went down. Instead, it was pumped out to certain \u2018external clients\u2019 -- high-speed trading companies, through a market news service connected to this rogue supplier. Those clients could potentially have made serious profits, by using high-frequency trading strategies to buy and sell sterling and UK government debt before the rest of the market caught up. The story comes as the BoE prepares to set UK interest rates for the final time this year. We\u2019re not expecting any changes. However, two policymakers did push for a rate cut at the previous meeting, so it could be another split vote.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement bill has been published, with protections on workers\u2019 rights, unaccompanied refugee children and parliament\u2019s say over the future relationship stripped out. MPs are expecting to vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill for the first time in this parliament on Friday, as Johnson aims to rush it through its first stage before Christmas. The new bill scraps or waters down a number of key protections that were in the last one published in October, when Johnson was trying to get the support of some backbench Labour MPs to get it through parliament. It removes an entire schedule that promised to protect workers\u2019 rights, with the government suggesting this will now be dealt with in separate legislation. Ministers will no longer be bound by the legislation to provide updates on the future trading relationship or to make sure parliament approves the government\u2019s negotiating objectives. In a third change, a commitment to take unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, known as the Dubs amendment, is watered down. The legislation acknowledges this is still an aim but does not make a legal promise to take them. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that children who are claiming asylum or international protection will be reunited with specified family members in the EU and vice versa. \u201cThe government\u2019s policy on child refugees has not changed and we will continue to do all we can to enable children to claim asylum and be reunited with their families, which the legislation published today reaffirms.\u201d Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the changes showed the Tories now want to \u201ctear up those protections\u201d for refugee children. In terms of additions, the bill introduces a clause to rule out an extension to the transitional period, and powers to let lower courts overrule judgments from the European court of justice. The bill overall hands much greater power to Johnson\u2019s government to shape a harder Brexit without the checks and balances of parliament. Backbench Labour MPs and some soft Brexit Tories had fought to get concessions into the previous versions of the bill, but Johnson no longer has any need for their votes as he has a majority of 80.

      "bodyText": "Insurer TAL has agreed to repay a $68,150 Centrelink debt generated after it deducted the full rate of the disability support pension from a disabled man\u2019s income protection payments. TAL has defended the \u201ccommon industry practice\u201d of deducting Centrelink benefits from its income protection payments to insurance claimants, which was \u201cclearly stated\u201d in its terms. But the man\u2019s case, championed by his carer Diana Marr, has prompted Greens senator Rachel Siewert to write to the social services minister questioning whether the practice amounts to the government subsidising insurance companies by allowing welfare payments to be deducted from payouts. The man in Marr\u2019s care, Matt (not his real name) worked for 40 years in mining and transport before end-stage liver disease forced him out of the workforce in mid-2016. Through his IOOF superannuation fund, Matt had paid for income protection insurance with TAL entitling him to $3,894 a month less \u201cCentrelink offsets\u201d for welfare \u201cpaid or payable\u201d after he applied for the disability support pension. TAL deducted amounts ranging from $1,726 to $1,905 every month on the assumption that Matt was entitled to the full rate of the DSP, despite Marr warning as early as 2017 that the welfare payment was means-tested and would be reduced to reflect he had other income. In total, TAL deducted a total of $64,868 between 2016 and 2019, as Marr struggled to get Centrelink to correctly record Matt\u2019s income and TAL to acknowledge the offsets would be means-tested. On 9 October, Centrelink calculated that based on annual income of $47,377 Matt was only entitled to $26.30 in DSP a fortnight, plus other supplements. On 29 October, Centrelink sent Matt a debt notice for $68,152 for the period June 2016 to September 2019. After repeated complaints from Marr and an approach from Guardian Australia for comment, TAL wrote to Marr stating that although it is \u201centitled to offset Centrelink benefits under the IOOF policy terms\u201d it is prepared to pay the full debt, including $64,868 for the offsets and an ex gratia payment of $3,284 for the discrepancy.

      "bodyText": "Josh Frydenberg was \u201ckeen to see [if] he can accommodate Angus Taylor\u2019s requests\u201d when he was environment minister and asked his department for \u201ca how to\u201d guide on changing the laws designed to protect critically endangered native grasslands from clearing, new documents suggest. The documents do not make clear what Taylor\u2019s requests were. At the time the minister was making the requests, his department was conducting an investigation into alleged illegal clearing on a property the current minister for energy and emissions reduction, Taylor, co-owns. Illegal land clearing of federally protected ecological communities carries civil and criminal penalties of up to $1.05m for individuals and $10.5m for corporations. Jam Land \u2013 a company part-owned by Taylor and his family, and of which his brother Richard Taylor is a director \u2013 was under investigation for the alleged illegal poisoning of about 30 hectares of the same grasslands on a property near Delegate in the New South Wales Monaro region. More than two years later, the department says the investigation is \u201congoing\u201d. The new documents, obtained under freedom of information, include a handwritten note by a senior bureaucrat recording a conversation with a staffer in the minister\u2019s office. In it the bureaucrat records his understanding of what he was being asked to do. \u201cHeads up re grasslands. Minister keen to see [if] he can accommodate Angus Taylor\u2019s requests,\u201d the note says. \u201cWant a how to for Minister in event he wished to amend or delete thresholds.\u201d The \u201cthresholds\u201d he refers to are definitions of how much native grass has to be present for it to be protected under federal law. A spokesman for Taylor said he \u201chas never asked Mr Frydenberg to change laws governing the clearing of native grasslands\u201d. Ministerial standards state ministers must not \u201cuse public office for private purposes\u201d. Taylor told parliament in July: \u201cI have had no association with the events leading to the compliance action that has been the subject of these allegations, and I have never made a representation in relation to it. I never would. All available information supports my repeated statements that the compliance action was never raised. My focus was advocating for the interests of the farmers in my electorate and across the region. \u201cDocuments released under the FOI Act confirm the minister\u2019s statements and any imputation to the contrary is rejected.\u201d Guardian Australia revealed in June that Taylor sought and received a briefing with Frydenberg\u2019s office and senior department officials on 20 March 2017 about the critically endangered listing of the grasslands. The department has said it did not take notes, as is the usual practice. In April 2017, Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice from the environment department on whether the listing could be watered down, and whether such a change would have to be made public. Frydenberg has insisted there was nothing untoward about this and that the listing was never changed. But the new documents show he went on to ask the department how he could go about changing definitions of native grasslands, known as condition thresholds, that define whether grasslands are sufficiently intact to warrant protection from clearing. One reason the grasslands are so endangered is widespread clearing for activities including agriculture and urban development. The handwritten notes taken by Stephen Oxley, a senior bureaucrat, show the department was having regular conversations with Frydenberg\u2019s office about the matter in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, under the heading \u201cMonaro Grasslands\u201d, Oxley wrote the notes which included the line: \u201cHeads up re grasslands. Minister keen to see [if] he can accommodate Angus Taylor\u2019s requests.\u201d It continues: \u201cWant a how to for Minister in event he wished to amend or delete thresholds.\u201d A series of dot points then states that the minister\u2019s office said there had been reports of landowners having difficulties administering the rules and asks for the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of making changes to be included in the \u201chow to\u201d guide. The only active investigation for breaches of these rules at the time was the investigation into Jam Land. The note then says the minister would \u201cneed to know in advance if going to get a brief which does not support [changes]\u201d. It is unclear whether any such \u201chow to\u201d guide was ever drafted. In its freedom of information request, Guardian Australia sought access to any proposal or brief, including drafts, that proposed changes to these rules. An April 2017 document, referred to as a \u201cpreliminary analysis of options\u201d, containing \u201canalysis and options for policy improvements\u201d related to the grasslands, was withheld. In refusing access, the department said that \u201cif it were considered that the document would be released under the FOI Act, there is a significant risk that the document would have been drafted in a different manner, or indeed would not have been created\u201d. Other new emails show officials were also being asked if there were avenues to change the critically endangered status of the grasslands as early as March 2017. An email from Monica Collins, the head of the department\u2019s compliance division, on 6 March 2017, shows her asking bureaucrats for a response for the minister\u2019s office to the question: \u201cWhat are the available avenues/process to review a listing decision?\u201d The following day, a bureaucrat replies that this can be done only if the environment minister is satisfied a critically endangered community no longer meets the criteria for listing. The same day, 7 March, officials from the department were meeting representatives for Jam Land at the site of the clearing. In response to a series of questions to Frydenberg on Wednesday, his office directed Guardian Australia to his September interview with the ABC. That interview does not explain why he sought a guide on how to change rules governing clearing of the grasslands. In September, Frydenberg told the ABC the meeting between his office, Taylor and senior department officials on 20 March 2017 was \u201conly about the technical aspects of the listing\u201d. \u201c[Taylor] has constituents and indeed farmers right across that region who have been concerned about the listing of those grasslands as critically endangered. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been confusion around the compliance with that law. So it is only relevant and only appropriate that in relation to the technical aspects of that listing, which the officials made very clear, that this was about, that he had that briefing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scientists fear climate change will drive a surge in the number of supersized and dangerous bushfires that become coupled with the atmosphere and create their own violent thunderstorms. Guardian Australia can reveal 2019 is likely to be a \u201cstandout year\u201d for the number of bushfires that generate giant thunderstorm clouds known as pyrocumulonimbus, or pyroCBs. PyroCB storms are feared by firefighters for the violent and unpredictable conditions they create on the ground. PyroCBs are able to generate their own lightning strikes, mass downdrafts of air, gusty winds and even hail blackened with soot. The plumes generated from pyroCBs can influence the atmosphere at heights of up to 15km. Embers still hot enough to start new fires can be shot out of a pyroCB at distances of 30km from the main fire. The 411,000 hectare Gospers Mountain fire in the Blue Mountains, still burning out of control on Thursday, is likely the latest bushfire to have generated a pyroCB storm on 22 November. Nicholas McCarthy, who has just completed a Phd at the University of Queensland on why bushfire thunderstorms form, said watching one develop was a \u201cgrounding experience\u201d. \u201cOnce you hear that first clap of thunder, you know there\u2019s not a lot you can do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be anyone on the ground at that point. All of a sudden [the fire] loses a whole level of predictability.\u201d PyroCB fires can have devastating and dramatic consequences. Victoria\u2019s deadly Black Saturday conflagration in February 2009 created its own lightning that caused fires 100km ahead of the main fire front. Research scientist Rick McRae, who is the custodian of a register of Australian pyroCB events, said 2019 was a \u201cstandout year\u201d. In March, there were 15 pyroCBs detected in the Victorian high country, including a cluster of 12 in just four days \u2013 an unprecedented grouping on McRae\u2019s register. \u201cThis is the standout year but we are still analysing them,\u201d he said. Dr Andrew Dowdy, a meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, has published several studies on pyroCB fires and their underlying conditions. Research led by Dowdy and published in the journal Scientific Reports has found that adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere will make more dangerous conditions favourable to pyroCB events in the future, particularly for the southern parts of Australia. Dowdy said an examination of conditions in the atmosphere and on the ground between 1979 and 2016 that are conducive to pyroCBs had already found a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d trend in southern Australia. He said: \u201cWe found that in summer in southern Australia and spring time, there have been large changes towards more dangerous conditions.\u201d Dr Simon Heemstra, manager of planning and predictive services at the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that we are noticing an increase in incidence of these sorts of events. With a changing and heating climate, you are going to expect these effects.\u201d He said pyroCB fires were characterised by violent \u201cmass flaming\u201d that \u201cputs lives at risk, whether those are firefighters or the community in the path of these events\u201d. The advice given to firefighters in NSW before and during a pyroCB event is to \u201cmake sure they have a safe refuge\u201d. He said: \u201cIt instills fear \u2013 the thought of a fire creating a thunderstorm that\u2019s throwing embers and lightening in front of it. It creates a dangerous situation and we take them very seriously.\u201d In response to a rising number of pyroCBs, he said the NSW Rural Fire Service was using weather balloons to take atmospheric measurements during times it is feared that pyroCBs could form. New communications material for firefighters has also been produced. Heemstra said one warning sign was a smoke column that rises to about 5km and forms a white top as moisture turns to ice. If the column continues to rise, a warning is sent to firefighters and communities on the ground. As well as creating dangerous weather conditions, Heemstra said pyroCBs prevent the fire service from using aircraft either to take measurements, or to drop water or fire retardant. Associate professor Jason Sharples, of the University of New South Wales, said pyroCBs needed two basic elements to form \u2013 an intense and expansive fire and an unstable atmosphere above it. He said: \u201cThink of it like a really bad thunderstorm with all the winds and the rain but then take out the rain, and put in embers.\u201d Dr Mike Fromm, of the US Naval Research Laboratory at the Department of Defence, told Guardian Australia that to identify pyroCB events scientists used satellites to examine images and also detect aerosol particles. \u201cThey generally will punch a hole through the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey create a huge blanket of cloud that turns day into night.\u201d He said globally there was no evidence of a trend towards more pyroCBs but he also said the record was relatively short. PyroCB storms typically lasted between one and eight hours, Fromm said. There was evidence of embers being shot out from the fire at distances of up to 30km. \u201cWhat we know about pyroCB conditions is summarised as \u2018hot, dry, windy\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these factors intensify with climate change, it is reasonable to anticipate additional risk of such firestorms. \u201cThe pyroCB is the most dramatic manifestation of fire weather and behaviour from the standpoint of the views from space.\u201d He said observations from the deadly Black Saturday fires of February 2009, where 173 people died, illustrated the dangers posed by pyroCBs. \u201cBlack Saturday\u2019s Kilmore East fire didn\u2019t even exist until late morning of that fateful day; by mid-afternoon it generated a full-fledged, devastating pyroCB.\u201d",

In response to questioning from Labor\u2019s Murray Watt during the last Senate estimates hearings, the department reported that number has now jumped to 18,914.

      "body": "<p>When I think about 2019, there is one scene that springs to mind, something that sums up the milieu so perfectly that it almost seems art-directed.</p> <p>There we were two weeks ago at Rose Bay on the water\u2019s edge, waiting for a private boat to take us to a harbourside mansion for a wine tasting. It was one of those days when Sydney\u2019s air quality was among the worst in the world. The boat emerged from the pea soup gloom with the words \u201cVIP\u201d on the side.</p> <p>We were all in our party dresses and chunky trainers, phones fully charged to maximise the Instagrammable location, only coughing a little bit although peoples\u2019 eyes were red and I noticed some fellow guests pulling on Ventolin inhalers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Influencers posed by the swimming pool, seeing but refusing to see \u2013 this red-raw sun, that dirty brown sky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the mansion there was a DJ, sommeliers and a chef, who explained in great detail the origin of the scallops on the canapes and a recent, inspirational trip to Oaxaca. Later there was a wine tasting where we gathered around to swirl and spit. Every varietal had notes of bushfire.</p> <p>Various people wandered up to us and said \u201cgreat day for it!\u201d and \u201cbeautiful weather\u201d without irony.</p> <p><em>How could they say that?</em> The sun was (there was only one word for it) demonic, a burning red eye in a thick smoky sky. The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House were out there \u2026 somewhere, obscured in a brown haze.</p> <p>We stood near the pool, eating tiny food, drinking wine from large balloon glasses while ash flew from the sky, some of it landing in my drink.</p> <p>The DJ played on but the tunes \u2013 Tones and I, Mark Ronson \u2013 were nervy, jangly and strangely discordant. The smell of the smoke had an almost chemical taint, and in between trying the pinot and moving on to the tempranillo, I wondered about the alchemy at work in this commingling of the elements: the ancient forests and its animals turned to columns of ash, collapsed and drifting through the air, settling on the water and soil; and later in and on my body after swimming in the dirty sea that morning and now swallowing particles of ash floating in my wine at the party on the harbour\u2019s edge. (\u201cAt the end of the world,\u201d my friend and I nervously joked.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/the-hell-of-individuation-and-how-dancing-could-be-the-cure\">The hell of individuation and how dancing could be the cure | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More wine was poured and more people commented on the great weather (except for a sommelier who confessed sotto voce that he felt afraid), and influencers posed in the gloom on the jetty and by the swimming pool, seeing but refusing to see what was all around them: this red-raw sun, that dirty brown sky.</p> <p>The cognitive dissonance would have been funny had I not been so scared. It brought to mind F Scott Fitzgerald, a writer who understood more than most that decadent parties prefigure societal collapse. Had his novel The Great Gatsby been written now, the scene that day in Point Piper would not be out of place.</p> <p>Returning to shore in the haze, we could have been excused for thinking we were crossing the Styx \u2013 the mystical Greek crossing into the Underworld \u2013 and in this heightened state the day seemed more than the sum of its parts.

      "bodyText": "When I think about 2019, there is one scene that springs to mind, something that sums up the milieu so perfectly that it almost seems art-directed. There we were two weeks ago at Rose Bay on the water\u2019s edge, waiting for a private boat to take us to a harbourside mansion for a wine tasting. It was one of those days when Sydney\u2019s air quality was among the worst in the world. The boat emerged from the pea soup gloom with the words \u201cVIP\u201d on the side. We were all in our party dresses and chunky trainers, phones fully charged to maximise the Instagrammable location, only coughing a little bit although peoples\u2019 eyes were red and I noticed some fellow guests pulling on Ventolin inhalers. At the mansion there was a DJ, sommeliers and a chef, who explained in great detail the origin of the scallops on the canapes and a recent, inspirational trip to Oaxaca. Later there was a wine tasting where we gathered around to swirl and spit. Every varietal had notes of bushfire. Various people wandered up to us and said \u201cgreat day for it!\u201d and \u201cbeautiful weather\u201d without irony. How could they say that? The sun was (there was only one word for it) demonic, a burning red eye in a thick smoky sky. The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House were out there \u2026 somewhere, obscured in a brown haze. We stood near the pool, eating tiny food, drinking wine from large balloon glasses while ash flew from the sky, some of it landing in my drink. The DJ played on but the tunes \u2013 Tones and I, Mark Ronson \u2013 were nervy, jangly and strangely discordant. The smell of the smoke had an almost chemical taint, and in between trying the pinot and moving on to the tempranillo, I wondered about the alchemy at work in this commingling of the elements: the ancient forests and its animals turned to columns of ash, collapsed and drifting through the air, settling on the water and soil; and later in and on my body after swimming in the dirty sea that morning and now swallowing particles of ash floating in my wine at the party on the harbour\u2019s edge. (\u201cAt the end of the world,\u201d my friend and I nervously joked.) More wine was poured and more people commented on the great weather (except for a sommelier who confessed sotto voce that he felt afraid), and influencers posed in the gloom on the jetty and by the swimming pool, seeing but refusing to see what was all around them: this red-raw sun, that dirty brown sky. The cognitive dissonance would have been funny had I not been so scared. It brought to mind F Scott Fitzgerald, a writer who understood more than most that decadent parties prefigure societal collapse. Had his novel The Great Gatsby been written now, the scene that day in Point Piper would not be out of place. Returning to shore in the haze, we could have been excused for thinking we were crossing the Styx \u2013 the mystical Greek crossing into the Underworld \u2013 and in this heightened state the day seemed more than the sum of its parts. Instead it served as both an elegy for the lost world that had disappeared beyond the haze and a portent of the world to come. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That is what 2019 has come to mean to me: not the landslide elections and the global protests and Fleabag season 2. But the year some undeniable bomb dropped and dispersed its truth all around us in the form of dark particles in the air that didn\u2019t just sit around us \u2013 but entered our bodies in unholy communion, its fine matter an anti-sustenance that made us sick and afraid. The truth bomb came in various forms: in the form of a girl (Greta Thunberg) whose eloquent rage finally caught the world\u2019s attention and inspired millions around the globe to strike for climate action. The truth also came in the form of heat, smoke and fire. Even then, some people tried to ignore it. Ernest Hemingway had this famous line from his 1929 book The Sun Also Rises, which speaks to me of where things washed up in 2019: \u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\u201d Bill asked. \u201cTwo ways,\u201d Mike said. \u201cGradually, then suddenly.\u201d 2019 is the year of suddenly. Many of us were shaken awake from our cognitive dissonance this year as our weather patterns and climate conditions become ever more extreme. When wine turns to ash in your mouth, you can\u2019t deny the new reality anymore. Yet some still live in a land of cognitive dissonance: the lump of coal brought to parliament; the haze over the city obscuring the flashing Christmas lights; dead bats falling from the sky because their sophisticated and highly evolved sonar systems are overheating and confused; beekeepers being traumatised and needing counselling after hearing the sounds of animals screaming as they burn to death; new types of megafires devouring entire ecosystems; the NSW premier opening a new zoo during these megafires with a commitment to \u201cprotecting wildlife\u201d; and the prime minister disappearing without a word about the climate catastrophe \u2013 last seen boarding a business-class Jetstar flight bound for Hawaii; the Instagrammers posing on the jetty under the eye of Sauron, hoping that with the right filters, we can pretend the sky is blue. Cognitive dissonance is natural \u2013 it can make you feel safer, like the world is a more orderly, stable place than the reality, which is chaos. The end of this year makes me wonder how much during the years prior we have been engaged in unintentional acts of disassociation and dissonance. Maybe we had to, to survive the barrage of nonstop news \u2013 the dozen major scandals that emerge each week from Trump\u2019s White House, the way that Brexit is important, boring and confusing all at once. It\u2019s all too much so we just disassociate. It\u2019s no wonder the hot illegal drug of 2019 \u2013 ketamine \u2013 is an anaesthetic, numbing your body and making you feel separate from your environment. People disappear, aptly, into the k-hole, the chemical equivalent of our political situation. \u201cLike you\u2019re watching your own life happen instead of living it,\u201d said New York magazine, calling it \u201cthe party drug for the end of the world\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Summer is about situational drinking: cans of cider in the park, chilled light reds at your mate\u2019s backyard barbecue or a cheeky fros\u00e9 at a beachside bar. It\u2019s why every bartender on a rooftop bar has RSI from making upwards of a hundred Aperol spritzes on a scorching day in December.</p> <p>No matter the location, summertime drinks have one thing in common: a refreshing quality. We\u2019re talking drinks that have bright acid, clean flavours, something fresh and light (whether that be in taste or beverages with low to no alcohol).</p> <p>This year\u2019s crop of summer drinks are minimising sugar for something a little more sophisticated: savoury flavours. Whether it\u2019s a non-alcoholic salted raspberry tisane (an infusion of dried fruits or herbs) or an unfiltered ferment that actually tastes fermented, it\u2019s a way of bringing balance back into the drink \u2013 an equal harmony of savoury and sweet, like dark chocolate with a pinch of salt. The guide below comes from a quest to find the perfect summer thirst-quenchers, no matter the occasion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/16/sheeps-whey-and-wakame-tasmanias-off-beat-gin-boom\">Sheep's whey and wakame: Tasmania's off-beat gin boom</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Wine</h2> <p>Choosing wines for the summer months has always revolved around aromatic whites and lighter-style reds (and of course, ros\u00e9). With temperatures soaring around the country, the last thing anyone feels like drinking are heavily oaked, dense or high-alcohol styles of white and red. Focus on refreshing white wines such as riesling (<a href=\"https://macforbes.com/product/2019-spring-riesling/\">2019 Mac Forbes Spring riesling, Strathbogie Ranges Victoria</a>, <em>$30</em>). Or grab a red to be dunked in an ice bucket, like pinot noir or gamay (<a href=\"https://www.differentdrop.com/collections/wines/products/2019-meadowbank-gamay?variant=17123516645419\">2019 Meadowbank gamay, Derwent Valley Tasmania</a>, <em>$45</em>)<em> </em>for a refreshing change to your next barbecue.</p> <p>We asked Bryce Faiella (sommelier at Sydney\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/17/diy-fine-dining-a-three-course-make-at-home-meal-from-20-years-of-aria\">Aria restaurant</a>) for what he looks for during summer for his wine list.<em> </em>\u201cTypically I\u2019ll be looking to lighten the weight of the wines in the list and look for fresh, elegant options to pour by the glass. Fresh and exciting wines like <a href=\"https://www.lieuditwinery.com/shop/melon-de-bourgogne\">Lieu Dit\u2019s Melon De Bourgogne </a>[$24] that hails from the dense marine soils of Santa Barbara county in the US of A.\u201d</p> <h2>Sparkling</h2> <p>Sparkling wine and summertime: it works so well together it even rhymes. But what to pick when there\u2019s a gamut of vinous flavours, styles and production methods on the market? The newest kid on the block (that\u2019s actually been around for quite some time) are p\u00e9tillant-natural sparklings (colloquially shortened to \u201cp\u00e9t nat\u201d). These use an ancient method of production to create a more straightforward, rustic (and often more affordable) style of sparkling wine. Excellent for any summertime occasion you throw at it from picnics to pool parties, barbecues and beach adventures.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.drnks.com/products/2019-anim-field-fizz\">2019 Anim Field Fizz </a></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.drnks.com/products/2019-anim-field-fizz\">($33) </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.drnks.com/products/2019-anim-field-fizz\"><br></a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be9de3e4a178beb1c34c3d00822baf5fb4df4566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be9de3e4a178beb1c34c3d00822baf5fb4df4566/0_70_1420_1091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anim Field Fizz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anim Field Fizz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drnks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This field blend (meaning all the grapes are grown, picked and fermented together) is a combo of eight different red and white varieties.

A slightly savoury, almost saline character runs through the wine (like when you stand by the ocean and breathe in the sea salt spray coming off the waves) along with bright citrus notes of grapefruit peel and lemon verbena.

The sweetest accompaniment to brunch: put the porchetta in the oven and pop a bottle open as it cooks.</p> <h2>Non-alcoholic</h2> <p>There has never been a more exciting time to explore sans-alcohol beverages.

According to the brewers, the fruit is rich in folate, potassium and vitamins C and E.</p> <p>The resulting beer is chemical-free, preservative-free and without additional processes to remove alcohol.

Lightly carbonated (similar to that of a spritz or a p\u00e9t nat), it is bursting with raspberry flavours, enhanced by the almost floral earthiness of the chamomile. The blend is vegan-friendly and made with raspberries, fresh chamomile flowers, Murray River salt, organic cane sugar, verjus and filtered water.

      "bodyText": "Summer is about situational drinking: cans of cider in the park, chilled light reds at your mate\u2019s backyard barbecue or a cheeky fros\u00e9 at a beachside bar. It\u2019s why every bartender on a rooftop bar has RSI from making upwards of a hundred Aperol spritzes on a scorching day in December. No matter the location, summertime drinks have one thing in common: a refreshing quality. We\u2019re talking drinks that have bright acid, clean flavours, something fresh and light (whether that be in taste or beverages with low to no alcohol). This year\u2019s crop of summer drinks are minimising sugar for something a little more sophisticated: savoury flavours. Whether it\u2019s a non-alcoholic salted raspberry tisane (an infusion of dried fruits or herbs) or an unfiltered ferment that actually tastes fermented, it\u2019s a way of bringing balance back into the drink \u2013 an equal harmony of savoury and sweet, like dark chocolate with a pinch of salt. The guide below comes from a quest to find the perfect summer thirst-quenchers, no matter the occasion. Wine Choosing wines for the summer months has always revolved around aromatic whites and lighter-style reds (and of course, ros\u00e9). With temperatures soaring around the country, the last thing anyone feels like drinking are heavily oaked, dense or high-alcohol styles of white and red. Focus on refreshing white wines such as riesling (2019 Mac Forbes Spring riesling, Strathbogie Ranges Victoria, $30). Or grab a red to be dunked in an ice bucket, like pinot noir or gamay (2019 Meadowbank gamay, Derwent Valley Tasmania, $45) for a refreshing change to your next barbecue. We asked Bryce Faiella (sommelier at Sydney\u2019s Aria restaurant) for what he looks for during summer for his wine list. \u201cTypically I\u2019ll be looking to lighten the weight of the wines in the list and look for fresh, elegant options to pour by the glass. Fresh and exciting wines like Lieu Dit\u2019s Melon De Bourgogne [$24] that hails from the dense marine soils of Santa Barbara county in the US of A.\u201d Sparkling Sparkling wine and summertime: it works so well together it even rhymes. But what to pick when there\u2019s a gamut of vinous flavours, styles and production methods on the market? The newest kid on the block (that\u2019s actually been around for quite some time) are p\u00e9tillant-natural sparklings (colloquially shortened to \u201cp\u00e9t nat\u201d). These use an ancient method of production to create a more straightforward, rustic (and often more affordable) style of sparkling wine. Excellent for any summertime occasion you throw at it from picnics to pool parties, barbecues and beach adventures. 2019 Anim Field Fizz ($33) This field blend (meaning all the grapes are grown, picked and fermented together) is a combo of eight different red and white varieties. In typical p\u00e9t nat style, there\u2019s no fining, no filtration, no disgorging, no sulphur but all the deliciousness. It\u2019s a perfect pairing for a pizza and date night. 2017 Le Domaine d\u2019Henri Method Ancestrale \u201cChablis\u201d Brut Nature by Margaux Laroche ($55) This is the first ancestral-style p\u00e9t nat to be made in Chablis and worlds away stylistically from mass-produced champagne. A slightly savoury, almost saline character runs through the wine (like when you stand by the ocean and breathe in the sea salt spray coming off the waves) along with bright citrus notes of grapefruit peel and lemon verbena. This is a wine that will enhance any long lunch \u2013 grazing on antipasto, cheese and whatever you\u2019re still snacking on after the sun goes down. For lovers of tradition, we haven\u2019t forgotten you, but there\u2019s a twist! Fermented like a champagne, the St Ronan\u2019s Methode Traditionelle Pear Cider ($25) is going to be the MVP over the next few months. Its delicate bubbles complement the subtle jasmine notes, and the juicy pear flavours complement the cider\u2019s dry finish. The sweetest accompaniment to brunch: put the porchetta in the oven and pop a bottle open as it cooks. Non-alcoholic There has never been a more exciting time to explore sans-alcohol beverages. Whether you\u2019re trying to pace yourself during the festive season or you\u2019re a lifetime teetotal, don\u2019t reach for a mass-produced soft drink laden with sugar and artificial flavours. Try one of these drops that are made with the same love and care as your favourite wine, beer or craft spirit. With the demand for products without alcohol increasing, sommeliers such as Mem Hemmings (Three Blue Ducks group) are looking for beverages created with the same intention and care as wines. \u201cSobah is a unique Aboriginal-owned and led company delivering extremely high-quality non-alcoholic craft beer. Two incredibly important touchstones for me: sobriety and acknowledgement and support of the traditional custodians of the lands on which I work and live. Such a premium product that was made with intention \u2013 it\u2019s the magic behind this product.\u201d Sobah Finger Lime Cerveza ($18 /four-pack) This brew is light and zesty, and tastes like a beer should. The finger lime, AKA gulalung, is an Australian native citrus fruit grown in areas around northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland (throughout Bundjalung nation lands). According to the brewers, the fruit is rich in folate, potassium and vitamins C and E. The resulting beer is chemical-free, preservative-free and without additional processes to remove alcohol. It\u2019s also vegan-friendly and uses minimal intervention practices throughout the brewing process. Non Salted Raspberry and Chamomile ($30, 750ml) You\u2019ve likely seen William Wade and Aaron Trotman\u2019s Non label popping up on retail shelves, bars and wine lists all over the country. Considered the gold standard of non-alcoholic drinks, they have developed a range of unusual flavour combinations \u2013 the ideal addition to those lazy summer Sunday sessions. The Non Salted Raspberry and Chamomile is a reinvention of a tisane. Lightly carbonated (similar to that of a spritz or a p\u00e9t nat), it is bursting with raspberry flavours, enhanced by the almost floral earthiness of the chamomile. The blend is vegan-friendly and made with raspberries, fresh chamomile flowers, Murray River salt, organic cane sugar, verjus and filtered water. As a bonus, there\u2019s less than 2.5g of sugar per glass. Nice Pickles Good Time Brine ($20, 1L) Made by the team at Nice Pickles (home of cult ferment Jerk Beans), Good Time Brine is the ultimate hangover cure or non-coffee pick-me-up. Made with a combination of spices, cucumber, garlic, chilli and turmeric, they leave the drink to infuse with apple and white vinegar for 12 weeks until all that\u2019s left is a refreshing, tangy brine that will energise your insides. It\u2019s great in a breakfast Virgin Mary or in this recipe straight from the Nice Pickles kitchen: Spicy ginger michelada 30ml Good Time Brine 30ml fresh lime juice 355ml ginger beer A good splash of your favourite hot sauce Nice Pickles Jerk Beans, for garnish Rim a glass with coarse salt or Taj\u00edn. Mix the Good Time Brine, lime juice and hot sauce at the bottom of your glass. Fill the glass with ice, and then pour in the ginger beer. Mix thoroughly and garnish with Nice Pickles Jerk Beans. Cocktails Summer cocktail drinking is all about extending your fun longevity. This, of course, means quaffing lighter-style cocktails (such as spritzes or anything with citrus) or mixing your favourite spirits with lashings of soda or mineral water. Jason Crawley, owner of Fortunate Son in Sydney, agrees: \u201cAt our bar we serve a \u2018gin and min\u2019, which is a twist on a gin and mineral water. We\u2019ve seen this trend take western Europe by storm this summer just passed. It\u2019s easy to make at home and moves away from the soda element, many of which are full of salt \u2013 which is not so good!\u201d So grab your favourite gin and put an at-home carbonator to good use. You can experiment with different garnishes and flavours such as pink peppercorns and rosemary or native finger lime for an Australian twist. Tired of Instagrammable cocktails with foams and outrageous garnishes? Welcome the classic Tommy\u2019s margarita back into your life \u2013 a simple combination of tequila, salt, lime juice and agave nectar. Keep the triple sec far away (or in the bin, where it belongs). Experiment using other fresh citrus juices: try pink grapefruit or blood orange, a mixture of lemon and lime juices or add a slice of chilli for a kick. It pairs well with sunsets on the balcony and a killer Spotify playlist. Tommy\u2019s margarita 60ml of good-quality blanco (white) tequila 30ml fresh lime juice 15ml agave nectar A pinch of salt Salt the rim of a rocks glass and set aside. Add all the above ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake. Strain into a prepared rocks glass filled with fresh ice. Garnish with a lime wedge. Canned Initially seen as a gimmicky novelty, premium wineries and skilled winemakers are trying their hand at making high-quality wines in accessible packaging, like cans. They are a responsible way to drink in outdoor locations, where glass might not be permitted. Packaging quality wines in vessels like casks and cans help protect the liquids from outside influences for longer, which guarantees a consistently fresh glass of wine. No summer drinks list is complete without including a ros\u00e9, as Bryce Faiella notes. \u201cWe\u2019re now taking ros\u00e9 more seriously in Australia, it fits so perfectly with not only our balmy summer climate but also our light, Mediterranean-inspired cuisine,\u201d he says. 2019 Site Wine ros\u00e9 ($13, 375ml can) Site Wine have made a Victorian malbec, handpicked and naturally fermented to create a dry and vibrant wine with hints of bursting red fruits. Like all wines in a can, this has a subtle spritz, but that dissipates after a few sips. With 3.8 standard drinks per can, this little delicate pink number is packed full of ros\u00e9 goodness, so drink it slowly. Canned packaging has a secondary benefit, too: portion control and transport. There\u2019s no need to bring all your cocktail supplies to the picnic or lug multiple bottles of spirits to the beach \u2013 leave all the hard work to the professional distillers who are now releasing incredible premixed cocktails in cans (no shakers necessary).

But when I think about the results of this year and I compare them with where we were in Rio at the same point \u2026 and when I put it all together with the quality of the very clever people we have and our track record, I\u2019m quietly confident.</p> <p>\u201c If you polled the sports out there, they\u2019d say the same thing. But there\u2019s no complacency. That\u2019s the enemy of excellence.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 Britain became the first nation to surpass its medal total at the Olympics immediately following one that it hosted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full\" title=\"\">winning 67 medals in Rio</a> compared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/interactive/2012/aug/07/olympics-2012-alternative-medal-table-visualised\" title=\"\">65 at London 2012</a>.

I really believe our system is a great British success story. The public really care about it. And with that comes being open to scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>Munday, who was previously a highly regarded chief executive of GB hockey, also stressed she wanted UK Sport to be even better in the future. \u201cIt would be very easy, given the success there\u2019s been, for there to be complacency,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everywhere I look there\u2019s a real drive to want to get better and to give the athletes the very best chance of getting medals around their necks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very aware there are questions around things that have happened recently in the high-performance system.

      "bodyText": "UK Sport is \u201cquietly confident\u201d that the Tokyo Olympics will be the best ever for British athletes, surpassing the record-breaking medal haul of 2016. Three years ago in Rio Team GB finished a stunning second overall in the table with 67 medals, behind only the United States, and most experts expect that to dip in 2020. However, Chelsea Warr, UK Sport\u2019s performance director, says data from the organisation\u2019s Sports Intelligence team shows \u201cbases are loaded\u201d when it comes to British medal potential \u2013 with more sports and athletes making podiums at world championships compared with four years ago. \u201cWhat is pleasing is that ahead of Rio we had 15 sports getting medals at world championships, now we\u2019ve 22,\u201d said Warr, who also pointed out that 123 British athletes have won world championship medals over the Tokyo Olympic cycle compared with 115 before Rio. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had more fourth-to-eighth places this year,\u201d she added. \u201cIn 2015 we had 188 leading into Rio and we have 218 leading into Tokyo. So the bases are loaded. The medal potential is there. One of the things we need to work on is to optimise that group to move into the medal zone. It\u2019s looking good. We\u2019re quietly confident.\u201d Warr said she expected the \u201cexperienced sports\u201d of cycling, rowing and sailing to lead the way again but predicted that new events, such as freestyle BMX, could also spring a few welcome surprises. Among the names Warr flagged up was Charlotte Worthington, a chef before taking up freestyle BMX full-time two years ago, who has improved so rapidly she won a world bronze medal last month. However, Warr admitted she expected a stronger challenge from China, Japan and Australia this time, along with Russia if it successfully appeals against its ban imposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. \u201cThe international context has changed, no doubt,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are new sports in the programme. \u201cIt\u2019s tougher. We\u2019ve had to be more agile. But when I think about the results of this year and I compare them with where we were in Rio at the same point \u2026 and when I put it all together with the quality of the very clever people we have and our track record, I\u2019m quietly confident. \u201c If you polled the sports out there, they\u2019d say the same thing. But there\u2019s no complacency. That\u2019s the enemy of excellence.\u201d In 2016 Britain became the first nation to surpass its medal total at the Olympics immediately following one that it hosted, winning 67 medals in Rio compared with 65 at London 2012. However, the data company Gracenote has forecast Britain may win only 42 medals in Tokyo, dropping it to fourth or fifth in the medal table depending on whether Russia is competing. However, Warr said she expected British athletes to kick on again after a \u201cfantastic\u201d 2019. \u201cEvery sport has a Tokyo-ready plan,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of them have been stress-tested over the last few months.\u201d Meanwhile the new chief executive of UK Sport, Sally Munday, has praised journalists for unearthing the athlete welfare crisis in British Olympic sport during the past few years. Jess Varnish set the ball rolling by revealing before the 2016 Olympics there was a \u201cculture of fear\u201d inside the velodrome, with the track cyclist also alleging the former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton had told her she should \u201cget on with having a baby\u201d. The Guardian subsequently revealed a host of issues in other sports, including allegations of racism in British Bobsleigh and investigations into possible abuse in British Gymnastics and British Canoeing. However, Munday insisted UK Sport had listened and responded to some of the problems in the system. \u201cWe should welcome scrutiny,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we have a good system we shouldn\u2019t have anything to hide. I really believe our system is a great British success story. The public really care about it. And with that comes being open to scrutiny.\u201d Munday, who was previously a highly regarded chief executive of GB hockey, also stressed she wanted UK Sport to be even better in the future. \u201cIt would be very easy, given the success there\u2019s been, for there to be complacency,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everywhere I look there\u2019s a real drive to want to get better and to give the athletes the very best chance of getting medals around their necks. \u201cI\u2019m very aware there are questions around things that have happened recently in the high-performance system. But over the last few years UK Sport has put a lot of things in place to ensure some of the failings in the past aren\u2019t able to happen in the future.\u201d",

Outlines of a baby in a manger, angels with haloes, and what appears to be one of the wise men in a stable, were uncovered behind a 400-year-old depiction of the beheading of Saint John the Baptist at The Bowes Museum in County Durham. Art conservators from Northumbria University had originally conducted an x-ray analysis on the painting to find out what was causing damage to the wooden panel the canvas is stretched over. Nicky Grimaldi, a senior lecturer in conservation of fine art at the university, said such a discovery was unusual. \u201cIncredibly we can see lines over the x-ray image which we believe to be preparatory drawings, showing where the painting was probably copied from an original drawing [cartoon],\u201d she added. \u201cThose lines were subsequently filled with another paint layer such as lead white, which allows them to be visible on the x-ray.\u201d The painting in its present form was acquired by the museum\u2019s founders, John and Jos\u00e9phine Bowes, in the 19th century and is thought to have formed part of a larger altar piece. The wooden panel will need careful restoration and a forensic scientist will examine it further in order to determine its age, background and history. Dr Jane Whittaker, the museum\u2019s head of collections, said: \u201cWe\u2019re simply delighted and astounded to discover that this 16th-century work was hiding such a wonderful secret and to find out at this time of year is really quite fortuitous.\u201d Jon Old, a painting conservator who cleaned the picture two years ago, said he saw obvious markings when he removed varnish from the canvas. \u201cI thought it would be a fun thing for the students to look into so we donated it to the university,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a rare find. I only found out a month ago about the nativity scene, but it\u2019s really quite fascinating.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the university has hit the headlines after an interesting art discovery. In 2011, Grimaldi discovered that a portrait of Susanna Trevelyan by Thomas Gainsborough, which had hung in a Northumberland country house since 1761, could have been reworked by a rival.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has been impeached. For the sake of American democracy and national security, the Senate must convict and remove him from office. The articles of impeachment make a powerful and clear case: The president abused his power, extorting Ukraine to help Trump\u2019s campaign by fabricating smears about his potential political opponent and withholding US assistance from Ukraine until the campaign help was received. Then, when the House of Representatives began investigating the president\u2019s actions, the president engaged in obstruction of Congress by ordering the executive branch not to comply with congressional subpoenas. The facts \u2013 as made clear by the record of the call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, witness testimony, and the evidence compiled by the House intelligence and judiciary committees \u2013 indisputably back up the accusations made in the articles. And while the impeachment is focused on Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine, the reasons why he must be convicted and removed from office go far beyond this incident.

The only thing remotely promising in this photograph is the green velvet suit worn by Dehenna Davison, the new MP for Bishop Auckland, who informed me via Twitter that it is from Dorothy Perkins. And that, my friends, is almost certainly the single thing I will get out of this Tory government. Merry Christmas everyone!",

Did Arsenal do enough to persuade him?</p> <p>When Ars\u00e8ne Wenger left Arsenal at the end of the 2017-18 season, Arteta was prominent on the shortlist to take over as the manager. Towards the end of the process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/mikel-arteta-favourite-to-become-arsenal-manager-replace-wenger\" title=\"\">it appeared the job was his</a>. Yet the three-man selection panel of Ivan Gazidis, Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/22/arsenal-ivan-gazidis-unai-emery-mikel-arteta-new-manager-wenger\" title=\"\">would prefer Unai Emery</a>, who felt like a safer pair of hands.</p> <p>Did somebody get cold feet and, if so, who? Gazidis would insist he and his two colleagues had each placed Emery at the top of their lists, although he had to say that, really. A little while later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/sep/19/ivan-gazidis-leaving-arsenal-milan-biggest-challenge\" title=\"\">Gazidis had departed for Milan</a>. The Wenger Succession was sorted. His work was done. Mislintat would also leave \u2013 in February of this year.</p> <p>Whatever the ins and outs, Arsenal had passed over Arteta.</p> <p>Now they are primed to get him. The man whom they did not fight hard enough to recruit as a coach and did not want badly enough a little over 18 months ago as the manager is set to be confirmed as the permanent successor to Emery. What has changed? Because one thing is plain: Arteta has still done nothing as a manager, even if he has had another season and a half to work under and learn from Pep Guardiola at City.</p> <p>Perhaps the post-Wenger recruitment process was so awesome that Sanllehi, the remaining link to it, did not feel they had to deviate too far from it this time. Just bump up the next guy. Gazidis had made it clear the process had been exhaustive. Maybe other candidates \u2013 and Arsenal have explored several \u2013 were unavailable in mid-season.</p> <p>Arsenal are no strangers to decisions that do not bear scrutiny. After sacking Emery, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/unai-emery-arsenal-sack-freddie-ljungberg\" title=\"\">asked Freddie Ljungberg to step in</a> as caretaker, working alongside Per Mertesacker, who is the academy manager, and a skeleton staff. Ljungberg, who had never previously managed, pointedly said Arsenal needed \u201cto have the same resources as other clubs\u201d. The impression was they were happy to busk it with Ljungberg only for results to remain poor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6aaef5b27eb76127642b01ba3b994c7453c8c241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aaef5b27eb76127642b01ba3b994c7453c8c241/0_105_2770_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikel Arteta and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikel Arteta, left, challenges Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, then of Borussia Dortmund and now Arsenal\u2019s captain, in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Simoes/Borussia Dortmund/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arsenal\u2019s route to Arteta has been circuitous, a little unwieldy, and it is hard to see his appointment as anything other than a gamble \u2013 given he has never been a manager before. There is a big difference between being an assistant coach and the main man. Now, for example, he will have to deal directly with the repercussions of not selecting a player while troublesome matters such as contractual stand-offs \u2013 an Arsenal speciality \u2013 will enter his sphere. He will have to man-manage Mesut \u00d6zil.</p> <p>Look at where Arsenal are \u2013 not only in terms of Premier League position and European status but their identity as a team. That identity is jumbled, to say the least.

      "bodyText": "When Mikel Arteta announced his retirement as a player at Arsenal in May 2016, he had the offer of a coaching role at three Premier League clubs. One was Arsenal; the others were Manchester City and Tottenham. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say clubs but I have three very different options and I am very proud, because it is not common,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI have been left the door very open [at Arsenal] and I may have to make a decision.\u201d Arteta chose City. Did Arsenal do enough to persuade him? When Ars\u00e8ne Wenger left Arsenal at the end of the 2017-18 season, Arteta was prominent on the shortlist to take over as the manager. Towards the end of the process it appeared the job was his. Yet the three-man selection panel of Ivan Gazidis, Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi would prefer Unai Emery, who felt like a safer pair of hands. Did somebody get cold feet and, if so, who? Gazidis would insist he and his two colleagues had each placed Emery at the top of their lists, although he had to say that, really. A little while later Gazidis had departed for Milan. The Wenger Succession was sorted. His work was done. Mislintat would also leave \u2013 in February of this year. Whatever the ins and outs, Arsenal had passed over Arteta. Now they are primed to get him. The man whom they did not fight hard enough to recruit as a coach and did not want badly enough a little over 18 months ago as the manager is set to be confirmed as the permanent successor to Emery. What has changed? Because one thing is plain: Arteta has still done nothing as a manager, even if he has had another season and a half to work under and learn from Pep Guardiola at City. Perhaps the post-Wenger recruitment process was so awesome that Sanllehi, the remaining link to it, did not feel they had to deviate too far from it this time. Just bump up the next guy. Gazidis had made it clear the process had been exhaustive. Maybe other candidates \u2013 and Arsenal have explored several \u2013 were unavailable in mid-season. Arsenal are no strangers to decisions that do not bear scrutiny. After sacking Emery, they asked Freddie Ljungberg to step in as caretaker, working alongside Per Mertesacker, who is the academy manager, and a skeleton staff. Ljungberg, who had never previously managed, pointedly said Arsenal needed \u201cto have the same resources as other clubs\u201d. The impression was they were happy to busk it with Ljungberg only for results to remain poor. Arsenal\u2019s route to Arteta has been circuitous, a little unwieldy, and it is hard to see his appointment as anything other than a gamble \u2013 given he has never been a manager before. There is a big difference between being an assistant coach and the main man. Now, for example, he will have to deal directly with the repercussions of not selecting a player while troublesome matters such as contractual stand-offs \u2013 an Arsenal speciality \u2013 will enter his sphere. He will have to man-manage Mesut \u00d6zil. Look at where Arsenal are \u2013 not only in terms of Premier League position and European status but their identity as a team. That identity is jumbled, to say the least. Arteta\u2019s challenge is to reboot one of England\u2019s leading clubs, to fix a number of ills and to stay on the right side of the demanding Emirates Stadium support. Just to repeat: he has never been a manager before. And yet Arteta\u2019s return has fired the imagination, bringing that most precious of commodities \u2013 hope. For many years, Arsenal\u2019s biggest problem has been the collective mentality; the sense they are simply not tough enough to recapture past glories. Arteta is Mr Mentality. An incredible professional during his playing days, who squeezed every last drop from his talent, he has taken his confident and clear-eyed approach into coaching. Towards the end of his career as a midfielder, as the injuries bit, he started to think more as a coach. He knew where he was going; what he wanted.

      "bodyText": "A mother and daughter from Northern Ireland who were forced to travel to England for an abortion are to be compensated by the government over their costs. The European court of human rights has instructed the government to reimburse the women for the cost of travel and the termination at a private English clinic seven years ago. Known only as A and B, the pair began legal proceedings after they were forced to raise \u00a3900 to make the trip for A to have the termination. Northern Ireland was up until recently the only part of the UK where abortion was illegal except in extreme circumstances, such as a direct threat to a mother\u2019s life. In July the Labour MP Stella Creasy introduced legislation through the House of Commons that will ensure regulations for free, legal and local abortion services in Northern Ireland by 31 March 2020. In their battle for compensation A and B pursued an application to the European court of human rights, claiming that forcing them to pay for a termination in England breached their rights to a private life under article 8 of the Human Rights Act and article 14 in terms of discrimination. As a result of a written decision by the ECHR published on Thursday the pair will not only receive the full costs of the treatment and travel but also their legal costs in the case. Angela Jackman, a partner at A and B\u2019s lawyers, Simpson Millar, said: \u201cA and B\u2019s application to the European court has finally resolved through a friendly settlement between the parties. Terms include payment of compensation by the UK government to A and B, and a contribution towards their legal costs. \u201cThis is a very important case, which proved instrumental in raising widespread awareness of the discrepancy in access to NHS-funded abortion services for women in Northern Ireland.\u201d Jackman, who is also senior law lecturer at the City Law School, added: \u201cA and B\u2019s tenacity in pursuing litigation for over six years is deeply commendable and they have appreciated the consistent support they received throughout. \u201cOf course, they are relieved that after almost seven years they are finally able to have closure on these difficult issues. \u201c Emma Campbell, the co-convenor of the Northern Ireland-based Alliance For Choice campaign group welcomed the decision to compensate the two women. She said compensation should be followed by a \u201cgeneral state apology\u201d to the thousands of women in the same predicament as A and B over decades in Northern Ireland. On whether more Northern Irish women might now come forward seeking compensation as well for being forced to travel to England for private non-NHS terminations, Campbell said: \u201cA and B went through a long hard battle in the courts but if other women did come forward looking for compensation then we would put them in direct contact with the proper legal representation.\u201d A and B were only able to afford the treatment and travel costs due to the extra financial support of the charity Abortion Support Network.",

An expert report for the Scottish government has recommended ministers introduce mandatory licensing of grouse moors within five years because of their associations with the systematic persecution of eagles and other protected birds. The panel chaired by Prof Alan Werritty, a geographer, was set up by ministers after an expert report directly linked driven grouse moors to the disappearance of 30% of all golden eagles in parts of the Highlands. Grouse moors managers are blamed by conservationists for the illegal killing and disappearance of thousands of birds of prey to protect grouse stocks. Gamekeepers have been prosecuted for using poisoned baits, traps, shooting and nest disturbance, while several estates have been banned from controlling birds because of suspected links to persecution. The Werritty report said licensing would allow Scottish Natural Heritage, a government agency, to control the unnecessary culling of mountain hares, the over-zealous burning of heather causing environmental damage and the overuse of medicated grit, used to control infections in grouse stocks. It is understood Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, wants to introduce licensing much sooner than 2024, despite opposition from land owners and shooting estate managers, as do Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, and Mike Russell, the Brexit secretary who pushed through tougher regulation of wildlife crime as environment minister.

While much of the growth in debt levels was driven by China, the Washington-based development agency said most of the 100 countries covered by its analysis were affected, following an increased dependency on borrowing by both private and public sector organisations. The analysis in Global Waves of Debt, a study of the four significant episodes of debt accumulation since 1970, found the debt-to-GDP ratio of developing countries had climbed 54 percentage points to 168% since the debt buildup began in 2010. The total includes all forms of debt \u2013 consumer, business and government \u2013 and illustrates the pressure on all parts of the economy to honour debt payments, mostly to banks and international investment funds. On average, the debt-to-GDP ratio of the 100 countries affected increased by seven percentage points each year \u2013 nearly three times as fast as it did during the Latin America debt crisis of the 1980s. Ceyla Pazarba\u015fio\u011flu, the World Bank\u2019s vice-president for equitable growth, finance and institutions, said: \u201cHistory shows that large debt surges often coincide with financial crises in developing countries, at great cost to the population. \u201cPolicymakers should act promptly to enhance debt sustainability and reduce exposure to economic shocks.\u201d According to the report, the widespread adoption of historically low interest rates since 2008 by central banks to tackle low inflation has mitigated the risk of a crisis \u201cfor now\u201d. But the report argued the record of the past 50 years highlighted the dangers of presuming interest rates and inflation would remain low. \u201cSince 1970, about half of the 521 national episodes of rapid debt growth in developing countries have been accompanied by financial crises that significantly weakened per-capita income and investment,\u201d it said. World Bank executives have previously argued that low-income countries should borrow on international money markets to fund investment and infrastructure spending. But since a fall in commodity prices in 2015, many countries have used borrowing to fund welfare payments, education, health costs and disaster relief. The World Bank Group\u2019s president, David Malpass, said: \u201cThe size, speed and breadth of the latest debt wave should concern us all. \u201cIt underscores why debt management and transparency need to be top priorities for policymakers, so they can increase growth and investment and ensure that the debt they take on contributes to better development outcomes for the people.\u201d He said policymakers in poorer and developing world countries should act promptly to strengthen their economic policies and make them less vulnerable to financial shocks. The analysis found the latest wave differed from the previous three because it involved a simultaneous buildup in both public and private debt. Debtor nations have also preferred to borrow from China, which imposes non-disclosure clauses and collateral requirements that obscure the scale and nature of debt loads. \u201cThere are concerns that governments are not as effective as they need to be in investing the loans in physical and human capital. In fact, in many developing countries, public investment has been falling even as debt burdens rise,\u201d the report said. In previous debt waves, the crises emerged from one or two regions.

In remarks reminiscent of Trump himself, Putin said during an annual press conference that US Democrats were seeking to make up for their loss in the 2016 presidential elections \u201cby other means\u201d, ascribing the impeachment proceedings to political infighting. \u201cThe Democratic party, which lost the elections, is achieving results through other means, by accusing Trump at first of conspiracy with Russia, then it turns out, there was no conspiracy at all,\u201d Putin said during the marathon Q&amp;A session in Moscow. \u201cIt then turned out that there was no collusion and it could not form the basis for an impeachment, and now there is this made-up pressure on Ukraine.\u201d On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed two articles of impeachment against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from Trump\u2019s use of pressure against Ukraine to carry out an investigation into the family of his political rival Joe Biden. Trump is the third president in US history to be charged with high crimes and misdemeanours and face removal from office by the US Senate. Trump is not expected to be removed from office, however, due to the Republicans\u2019 senate majority. \u201cI doubt they will want to remove their own party\u2019s representative from power based on what I think are absolutely made-up reasons,\u201d Putin said in response to a question about the impeachment vote. Opponents of Trump have criticised the US president for seeking a closer relationship with Moscow despite evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The Russian president also made news on Thursday when he said he would consider amending the Russian constitution to limit a president to serving two terms total, preventing any potential successor from occupying power for the same period as he has done. Putin is currently serving his fourth presidential term, after which he will be constitutionally barred from standing in the 2024 presidential elections. One of the biggest political questions in Russia remains whether Putin, 67, will seek to remain in power after 2024 by amending the constitution or attempt to pass power on to a successor. Putin said that constitution term limits for the president could be altered by removing the word \u201cconsecutive\u201d, giving one person a two-term limit for life. In televised remarks he also said he was following proposals to increase parliamentary powers, driving speculation that he could assume the role of prime minister after exiting the presidency, in what would be an echo of the 2008 election in which he traded places with then-premier, Dmitry Medvedev, after serving two terms as president. The press conference, held with much fanfare each December, gives Putin a chance to sound off on a range of topics without giving journalists much of a chance for follow-up questions. Over more than four hours on stage, Putin said that Russia had been unfairly \u201cpunished twice\u201d for its doping scandal, skirted past questions about domestic violence and his family\u2019s business activities, and congratulated Boris Johnson on the Tories\u2019 victory in parliamentary elections, saying Johnson \u201csensed the mood of British society better than his opponent\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>So the ninth and last (we think) movie in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars\">Star Wars</a> saga arrives, and there\u2019s only one thing on our minds. When will Darth Vader\u2019s disturbing grandson, Kylo Ren (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/adam-driver\">Adam Driver</a>), and Rey (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/daisy-ridley\">Daisy Ridley</a>) do something about their outrageously obvious telepathic sexual tension and just get a room already? When will they do something about the symbolism of these lightsaber duels of theirs, secure a furtive daytime booking at some intergalactic Premier Inn and give us the most rock\u2019n\u2019roll sex scene \u2013 come to think of it, the only sex scene \u2013 in Star Wars history? Surely the suits at Disney would be OK with it? Well, oddly, the symbolism of Romeo and Juliet (as well as Dunkirk) might just occur to you in the course of this crazily but very entertainingly grandiloquent adventure.</p> <p>Now, The Rise of Skywalker has been rather coolly received in some quarters, and I certainly think it isn\u2019t quite as strong as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi-review-episode-viii-rian-johnson\">The Last Jedi</a>, around which critical consensus has gathered. (In this trilogy of trilogies, incidentally, it is the second film in each trio \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones and The Last Jedi \u2013 that has been the strongest episode, though Clones did not have much competition.) There is, I admit, some excessive MacGuffinism (the use of arbitrary objects to drive the story), especially when everyone conceives a great desire to get hold of a supernaturally potent glass tetrahedron, which is then smashed before someone miraculously comes across another mystically significant glass tetrahedron, murmuring: \u201cOh, there <em>were </em>two!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"860b66ca7180d815cc40139c49af44c7d647877c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/860b66ca7180d815cc40139c49af44c7d647877c/0_90_3504_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gang\u2019s all here \u2026 Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gang\u2019s all here \u2026 Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lucasfilm/Walt Disney Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us to the second flaw in episode nine: a habit of nullifying jeopardy by perpetually bringing dead people or things back to life. People are forever dying and then returning to the screen, either as poignant memories, or quasi-ghosts, or horribly unnatural resurrections. Partly, I think this is an over-writing flaw, with director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jjabrams\">JJ Abrams</a> (having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/11/star-wars-lose-directors-trevorrow-lucasfilm\">taken over from Colin Trevorrow</a> over \u201ccreative differences\u201d) working with co-writer Chris Terrio and perhaps over-zealously trying to correct what fans saw as the fault with The Last Jedi and to cover as much ground and as many alternative realities as possible, in the service of a resounding finality.

      "bodyText": "The mobile phones of at least two dozen Pakistani government officials were allegedly targeted earlier this year with technology owned by the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, the Guardian has learned. Scores of Pakistani senior defence and intelligence officials were among those who could have been compromised, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The alleged targeting was discovered during an analysis of 1,400 people whose phones were the focus of hacking attempts in a two-week period earlier this year, according to the sources. All the suspected intrusions exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp software that potentially allowed the users of the malware to access messages and data on the targets\u2019 phones. The discovery of the breach in May prompted WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, to file a lawsuit against NSO in October in which it accused the company of \u201cunauthorised access and abuse\u201d of its services. The lawsuit claimed intended targets included \u201cattorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and other senior foreign government officials\u201d. NSO has said it will vigorously contest the claim and has insisted that its technology is only used by law enforcement agencies around the world to snare criminals, terrorists and paedophiles. The alleged targeting of Pakistani officials gives a first insight into how NSO\u2019s signature \u201cPegasus\u201d spyware could have been used for \u201cstate-on-state\u201d espionage. The details also raise fresh questions about how NSO\u2019s clients use its spyware. \u201cThis kind of spyware is marketed as designed for criminal investigations. But the open secret is that it also winds up being used for political surveillance and government-on-government spying,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, an academic research group located at the University of Toronto that has worked with WhatsApp to help identify victims of the alleged hacks. \u201cSpyware companies are clearly contributing to the proliferation of state-on-state technological espionage. No government seems particularly immune. This is probably further stretching the patience of governments around the world with this industry,\u201d he added. The Pakistani embassies in London and Washington declined multiple requests for comment. WhatsApp declined to comment. Representatives for NSO declined to comment on questions about whether the company\u2019s software had been used for government espionage. The company has previously said it considered it a \u201cmisuse\u201d of its product if the software was used for anything other than the prevention of \u201cserious crime and terrorism\u201d. While it is not clear who wanted to target Pakistani government officials, the details are likely to fuel speculation that India could have been using NSO technology for domestic and international surveillance. The government of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, is facing questions from human rights activists about whether it has bought NSO technology after it emerged that 121 WhatsApp users in India were allegedly targeted earlier this year. The figure included about two dozen alleged victims who are journalists, activists and human rights lawyers, a fact that prompted Modi opponents in the Indian National Congress to seek a supreme court inquiry into the matter. Pakistan has not publicised the alleged hack, but there are signs the government, led by the prime minister, Imran Khan, is taking steps to address the matter. Dr Arslan Khalid, who serves as Khan\u2019s top adviser on digital issues, has said in local press reports that the government is working on developing an alternative to WhatsApp to be used for sensitive government data and other classified information. Government officials in Pakistan\u2019s ministry of information technology have also reportedly advised officials to stop sharing classified information over WhatsApp and replace smartphones that were purchased before May 2019, according to local press reports. NSO has repeatedly said that its spyware is only meant to be used to combat terrorism and other crimes, such as child abduction and sex crimes. The company has claimed that the use of its spyware by governments has saved \u201cthousands of lives\u201d. NSO has also put a new human rights policy in place that is meant to \u201cprevent and mitigate\u201d abuse of its spyware.

NSO has not commented on whether it has pursued any internal investigations into the alleged WhatsApp hack. India was first linked to NSO in 2018, when a report by the Citizen Lab identified 36 Pegasus \u201coperators\u201d who were found to be using the malware in 45 countries. One operator, which the Citizen Lab identified and codenamed \u201cGanges\u201d, was found to have been active since 2017 and had infected mobile phones in five locations: India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Hong Kong and Pakistan.

But the fun can sometimes leave bosses with more than just a headache the following day, when the behaviour of their employees lands them in court. Shelbourne v Cancer Research UK 2019 arose from an incident at the charity\u2019s Christmas party. The event \u2013 which consisted of a buffet, some \u201coversized\u201d games, a ceilidh and a disco \u2013 was open to staff and guests who had bought a ticket to attend. Robert Bielik, a visiting scientist who was not employed by the charity but attended the party and had been drinking, attempted to lift one of Cancer Research\u2019s animal technicians, Sandra Shelbourne, on the dancefloor. He lost his balance and dropped her, resulting in her sustaining a serious back injury. The party had been organised by a team of volunteers who had risk-assessed the event, noting the risk of partygoers returning to labs after the consumption of alcohol. As a result, guests were required to sign a disclaimer confirming that they would not attempt to work in the labs after drinking and security guards were present to stop anyone doing so.

Vicarious liability, White explains, has had a lot of attention in recent years. The Supreme Court\u2019s current approach is to consider two factors: whether the relationship between wrongdoer and defendant is such that the defendant can be made vicariously liable, and whether or not the conduct of the wrongdoer relates to the relationship sufficiently that vicarious liability is imposed.

Government figures showed the UK relied on renewables, such as wind and solar, for 38.9% of its electricity in the third quarter of this year, up from one-third in the same period in 2018. Renewable energy moved narrowly ahead of gas-fired power, which made up 38.8% of the electricity mix, to emerge as the UK\u2019s biggest source of power. The rise of renewables combined with output from nuclear power plants pushed fossil fuels to their lowest share of the UK\u2019s energy mix on record, according to the official data. The dwindling number of coal-fired power stations contributed 1% of the UK\u2019s electricity in the third quarter, down from 2.5% in the same period in 2018. This was in part due to the earlier-than-expected end of generation at Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire, which burned through its remaining coal stocks before the official 30 September finish date. Another two coal plants, Aberthaw B and Fiddler\u2019s Ferry, are due to close in March, leaving four coal-fired power stations in the UK. The report also said the UK\u2019s growing fleet of offshore wind projects generated more electricity than onshore windfarms for the first time. The giant turbines off the coast generated 9.8% of the UK\u2019s electricity, up from 6.7% in 2018. Onshore windfarms lagged slightly behind, generating 9.2% of the UK\u2019s electricity in the third quarter, up from 7.3% in the same period last year. Since the record-breaking quarter, wind power reached fresh highs earlier this month to generate almost 45% of the UK\u2019s electricity on one day, and an all-time high of 16GW overnight. The wind power highs meant thousands of homes were paid to plug in their electric vehicles overnight and set their dishwashers on timers for the early hours of the morning to make use of the extra energy.",

A founding principle of the NHS when it was set up in 1948 was that pay rates for staff should be the same throughout the UK, so that wealthy areas such as London couldn\u2019t offer extra money to poach more staff. Yet salaries of nurses in Northern Ireland have been allowed to fall far behind those of colleagues in the rest of the UK. A newly qualified band 5 staff nurse there, for example, is now <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/northernireland/get-involved/northern-ireland-safe-and-effective-care-campaign/northern-ireland-safe-and-effective-care-campaign-background\" title=\"\">paid \u00a31,419 less</a> than their counterpart in England and Wales, and \u00a31,875 less than in Scotland, each year. An experienced specialist nurse earns \u00a31,156 less than one in England and Wales, and \u00a32,097 less than in Scotland, each year. This disparity cannot be allowed to continue if Northern Ireland is to try and close the gap on the number of nursing vacancies.</p> <p>None of this is happening in a vacuum. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-stormont-crisis-timeline\" title=\"\">collapse of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-stormont-crisis-timeline\" title=\"\">Stormont</a> in January 2017 has meant that Northern Ireland hasn\u2019t had a functioning government for almost three years. Instead, the Department of Health is being run by civil servants. Patients and nurses need power-sharing to be restored urgently, and for health ministers to be appointed again to take charge of this crisis.</p> <p>I witnessed huge support for nurses from the public. They know staff wouldn\u2019t be taking this action unless they\u2019d been pushed to the limit. Yes, some patients will have had appointments cancelled because of the strike \u2013 but nurses working in safety-critical services such as chemotherapy and intensive care did continue to provide cover yesterday. Patients and the RCN are grateful to them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a truism to say that a strike is only ever a last resort. None of our members voted for it lightly. But I hope this first ever industrial action by RCN nurses will provide the shock politicians and health and social care management need to take action.</p> <p>\u2022 Donna Kinnair is chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing</p>",

Readers in the rest of the UK may be asking what on earth has driven nursing staff in Northern Ireland to take this unprecedented step. Patients and the public in Northern Ireland sadly know only too well. There simply aren\u2019t enough nurses to provide safe patient care \u2013 almost 3,000 nursing posts, around 13% of the total, are vacant. This compares to 11% in England. I met a cancer nurse called Edel yesterday who told me she was shocked by the unsafe staffing levels in oncology and fearful for her patients. Add in the fact that one in five people in Northern Ireland is on a waiting list, with more than 120,000 waiting over a year for treatment, and you can see why an independent health thinktank recently posed the question in a report about health services in Northern Ireland, \u201cHow bad does it have to get before urgent action is taken?\u201d Our strike is also over pay. A founding principle of the NHS when it was set up in 1948 was that pay rates for staff should be the same throughout the UK, so that wealthy areas such as London couldn\u2019t offer extra money to poach more staff. Yet salaries of nurses in Northern Ireland have been allowed to fall far behind those of colleagues in the rest of the UK. A newly qualified band 5 staff nurse there, for example, is now paid \u00a31,419 less than their counterpart in England and Wales, and \u00a31,875 less than in Scotland, each year. An experienced specialist nurse earns \u00a31,156 less than one in England and Wales, and \u00a32,097 less than in Scotland, each year. This disparity cannot be allowed to continue if Northern Ireland is to try and close the gap on the number of nursing vacancies. None of this is happening in a vacuum. The collapse of Stormont in January 2017 has meant that Northern Ireland hasn\u2019t had a functioning government for almost three years. Instead, the Department of Health is being run by civil servants. Patients and nurses need power-sharing to be restored urgently, and for health ministers to be appointed again to take charge of this crisis. I witnessed huge support for nurses from the public. They know staff wouldn\u2019t be taking this action unless they\u2019d been pushed to the limit. Yes, some patients will have had appointments cancelled because of the strike \u2013 but nurses working in safety-critical services such as chemotherapy and intensive care did continue to provide cover yesterday. Patients and the RCN are grateful to them. It\u2019s a truism to say that a strike is only ever a last resort. None of our members voted for it lightly. But I hope this first ever industrial action by RCN nurses will provide the shock politicians and health and social care management need to take action. \u2022 Donna Kinnair is chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing",

Because of what Brexit meant to them, voters were far less willing to compromise. When Theresa May first brought her withdrawal agreement to the House of Commons, the near-unanimous response by the British left was to reject her deal. Labour\u2019s fate would have been very different had the policy instead been to accept the result of the 2016 vote, support her deal and then push for a post-Brexit election. British politics post-Brexit will not be any kinder to Labour. With the social structures of Labourism in the north of England and in Scotland now in terminal decline, there is every possibility that the Tories will hold on to the new seats they won last week. As an indication of what may lie ahead for Labour, it is worth looking across the Channel. On the Rue Solf\u00e9rino, a stone\u2019s throw from the River Seine, stands the historic headquarters of the French Socialist party. It was recently sold off and converted into luxury flats. \u2022 Chris Bickerton teaches politics at Cambridge University and is a founding member of The Full Brexit",

      "bodyText": "The NHS was a dominant theme in the 2019 general election campaign, from harrowing pictures of a child being treated on an A&amp;E floor to fears over the impact of a trade deal with the United States. Performance statistics released during the campaign showed the number of people waiting too long in A&amp;E departments was at its highest level on record \u2013 in October, far from the depths of winter. Reflecting this and the poor state of staffing and buildings, public concern about the service rivals even Brexit. While their campaign focus was Brexit, the Conservatives also pledged more money and more staff for the NHS as a response to these issues. But with major problems facing the service, they will now need to go beyond these promises if they are to turn the situation around before they face voters again. Today we are expecting an NHS bill in the Queen\u2019s speech, which will pledge to increase the annual day-to-day health service budget by \u00a334bn by 2023-24. This is largely the same as the figure of \u00a320.5bn pledged by Theresa May in 2018, without adjusting for inflation. But either way, it represents a sharp break from the years of austerity, bringing spending back to what has been the historic norm, and giving the service room to breathe again. So far, we have seen no concrete plans beyond next year for the so-called \u201ccapital\u201d budget, which the NHS needs to invest in buildings and equipment. The Conservatives have pledged 40 new hospitals alongside 20 upgrades in the coming years. This will require substantial investment over and above current levels of capital spending. The cost for the backlog of repairs alone has now reached more than \u00a36bn, resulting in dilapidated wards and broken infrastructure. In addition, the UK has the lowest level of CT and MRI scanners of any comparable country. We should look for at least a five-year plan for this capital investment \u2013 and if the new government wants to rule for the long term, it could consider giving even more stability by planning a full decade in advance for both day-to-day running costs and capital investment. The NHS also faces a dire staffing crisis, with a nursing shortage of 40,000 in England and a decline in the number of GPs per person for the first time in 50 years. The government\u2019s promises of 50,000 extra nurses, 6,000 extra GPs and other staff will be difficult to deliver. We have argued that the NHS needs those extra 50,000 nurses in the coming five years.

That kind of increase would require immigration, on a larger scale than the Conservative figures assume. In social care, again, migration will be an indispensable support to a system that already has massive staffing shortages and yet is likely to need even more. Earlier migration crackdowns on people from outside the EU caused a sharp slowdown in the number of staff from overseas, and there is a real risk that any post-Brexit crackdown will have a similar effect. The Conservatives have promised to soften the impact with \u201cNHS visas\u201d for doctors and nurses. But they should rethink any policy that results in a drop in staff migration.

The internet-freedom group Access Now recorded 75 internet outages around the world in 2016; the figure more than doubled to 196 last year.</p> <p>With protest movements convulsing dozens of countries this year, the figure is likely to be \u201cmuch, much higher\u201d, said Berhan Taye, a senior policy analyst at Access Now.</p> <p>Iraq has periodically curbed the internet as violent protests have spread throughout the country. In Ethiopia, enforced outages have become so frequent that they are damaging the economy, costing an estimated US$4.5m a day, according to figures from a digital rights group. Reports of outages from Venezuela are so frequent that they can barely be counted, Taye said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a child is at the switch, turning it on and off whenever they fear something is happening,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Since India\u2019s first recorded use of the tactic, six times in 2012, it has become the world\u2019s undisputed leader, accounting for 134 internet shutdowns last year, around 68% of the global total. This week, it broke the record for the longest continuous outage for any democracy: 137 days and counting in the restive region of Kashmir.</p> <p>The blackout there has wreaked havoc on businesses, medical services and education. In its early days, reporters were forced to fly to Delhi to deliver their material or hang around the airport in the capital, Srinagar, and persuade the passengers flying out to carry memory cards containing the videos, pictures and stories of those left behind.</p> <p>Governments justify the curb on the freedom to communicate by citing public order. And it is clear that the hyper-speed with which information \u2013 true or otherwise \u2013 travels online is creating problems. In 2018, India <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/whatsapp-deleting-two-million-accounts-per-month-to-stop-fake-news\">struggled to contain</a> rumours of child kidnappers on the loose that travelled faster and more widely than authorities could track, whipping up mobs who lynched at least 30 people across the country.</p> <p>A few months before, Sri Lanka\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/facebook-accused-by-sri-lanka-of-failing-to-control-hate-speech\">blocked social media</a> to curb the spread of hateful posts that were helping to spark deadly anti-Muslim riots. \u201cThe whole country could have been burning in hours,\u201d the country\u2019s information minister at the time said.</p> <p>But measures first implemented in the crucible of crises are quickly spilling over into regular use. A tactic whose use (and misuse) most Indians accepted in border states such as Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Assam is now being used to quell largely peaceful protests in Delhi and Bengaluru.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/28/russia-great-firewall-sovereign-internet-bill-keeping-information-in-or-out\">Russia\u2019s great firewall: is it meant to keep information in \u2013 or out?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Autocratic states such as Russia and Iran are mapping out the next step: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/28/russia-great-firewall-sovereign-internet-bill-keeping-information-in-or-out\">\u201csovereign\u201d internets</a> that can be cut off from the outside world whenever a ruler chooses or walled off altogether, as in the case of China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d.</p> <p>November\u2019s massive protests in Iran were an opportunity for the country\u2019s rulers to try out what is sometimes called the \u201chalal net\u201d: a project to create an Iranian intranet that can continue functioning even as citizens are cut off from the global internet.</p> <p>It was far from perfect: many cash machines failed and some hospital communication networks went down, Iranians reported. But many were still being able to hail a car using the local ride-sharing service Snapp. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said this month the service <a href=\"https://en.radiofarda.com/a/30314456.html\">would be developed</a> until \u201cpeople will not need foreign [networks] to meet their needs\u201d.</p> <p>Governments elsewhere are paying attention. \u201cCountries are learning from each other, how these shutdowns work and how they can be implemented,\u201d Taye said.</p> <p>The increasing use of shutdowns is concerning everywhere, but matters most in India. As a country that touts itself as a future democratic superpower, how India treats the internet will serve as an example to countries less committed to civil liberties.</p> <p>An editorial this week in the Chinese state media outlet, People\u2019s Daily Online, did not miss the opportunity to highlight the message India\u2019s leaders are sending. \u201cIt means that shutting down the internet in a state of emergency should be standard practice for sovereign countries,\u201d it said.</p>",

With protest movements convulsing dozens of countries this year, the figure is likely to be \u201cmuch, much higher\u201d, said Berhan Taye, a senior policy analyst at Access Now. Iraq has periodically curbed the internet as violent protests have spread throughout the country. In Ethiopia, enforced outages have become so frequent that they are damaging the economy, costing an estimated US$4.5m a day, according to figures from a digital rights group. Reports of outages from Venezuela are so frequent that they can barely be counted, Taye said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a child is at the switch, turning it on and off whenever they fear something is happening,\u201d she said. Since India\u2019s first recorded use of the tactic, six times in 2012, it has become the world\u2019s undisputed leader, accounting for 134 internet shutdowns last year, around 68% of the global total. This week, it broke the record for the longest continuous outage for any democracy: 137 days and counting in the restive region of Kashmir. The blackout there has wreaked havoc on businesses, medical services and education. In its early days, reporters were forced to fly to Delhi to deliver their material or hang around the airport in the capital, Srinagar, and persuade the passengers flying out to carry memory cards containing the videos, pictures and stories of those left behind. Governments justify the curb on the freedom to communicate by citing public order. And it is clear that the hyper-speed with which information \u2013 true or otherwise \u2013 travels online is creating problems. In 2018, India struggled to contain rumours of child kidnappers on the loose that travelled faster and more widely than authorities could track, whipping up mobs who lynched at least 30 people across the country. A few months before, Sri Lanka\u2019s government blocked social media to curb the spread of hateful posts that were helping to spark deadly anti-Muslim riots. \u201cThe whole country could have been burning in hours,\u201d the country\u2019s information minister at the time said. But measures first implemented in the crucible of crises are quickly spilling over into regular use. A tactic whose use (and misuse) most Indians accepted in border states such as Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Assam is now being used to quell largely peaceful protests in Delhi and Bengaluru. Autocratic states such as Russia and Iran are mapping out the next step: \u201csovereign\u201d internets that can be cut off from the outside world whenever a ruler chooses or walled off altogether, as in the case of China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d. November\u2019s massive protests in Iran were an opportunity for the country\u2019s rulers to try out what is sometimes called the \u201chalal net\u201d: a project to create an Iranian intranet that can continue functioning even as citizens are cut off from the global internet. It was far from perfect: many cash machines failed and some hospital communication networks went down, Iranians reported. But many were still being able to hail a car using the local ride-sharing service Snapp. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said this month the service would be developed until \u201cpeople will not need foreign [networks] to meet their needs\u201d. Governments elsewhere are paying attention. \u201cCountries are learning from each other, how these shutdowns work and how they can be implemented,\u201d Taye said. The increasing use of shutdowns is concerning everywhere, but matters most in India. As a country that touts itself as a future democratic superpower, how India treats the internet will serve as an example to countries less committed to civil liberties. An editorial this week in the Chinese state media outlet, People\u2019s Daily Online, did not miss the opportunity to highlight the message India\u2019s leaders are sending. \u201cIt means that shutting down the internet in a state of emergency should be standard practice for sovereign countries,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Civilians in opposition-held Syria face a cold, hungry start to the winter with an intensified bombing campaign forcing thousands to flee their homes while fuel shortages threaten medical care and push up prices of food and transport. At least 90 people have been killed and 12,000 have fled the town of Maaret al-Numan in southern Idlib province after heavy bombing over the last week, local activists said. They fear the bombing campaign, which has included air strikes, barrel bombs and shelling, could be preparations for a ground offensive. Charities and hospitals are struggling to respond to the crisis because of soaring fuel prices, which have more than doubled in the area since early October. One hospital director said he had turned off heaters on his wards despite plunging winter temperatures to save fuel for ambulances and generators that power vital medical devices. Aid workers say they have had to cut back support for some of the internally displaced people in the region. \u201cWe have faced many barriers to our work over the last three years,\u201d said Haytham Abu Husam, who lives in southern Idlib and works for a Syrian-run aid group there. \u201cBut none are on the scale of the current crisis. \u201cWe have continued despite countless risks, including targeting of humanitarian workers in Idlib, where many have been kidnapped and two killed in the last few months. Warplanes and helicopters haven\u2019t left the skies. We didn\u2019t stop our work despite all that, but if the fuel crisis continues, we would have to stop.\u201d More than 3 million people are estimated to be living in Idlib, many of them refugees displaced from other parts of the country, as President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies reclaimed areas that had been under rebel rule and opposition supporters fled. The long offensive has been marked by a willingness to violate international law by targeting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, before the intensive bombing of the last week that hit busy markets and an olive oil processing plant, making it harder for families to buy food. Ali Saraqbi was in his family\u2019s fruit and vegetable store in Maaret al-Numan, which is a hub for the area, when a bomb hit during mid-morning trading on 2 December. It killed nine and injured 12, activists said. \u201cI became deaf for some minutes and then I started hearing the screaming, groaning, yelling and the ambulance sirens,\u201d Saraqbi said. \u201cThen I went outside my store and saw some bodies, including owners of three neighbouring shops and two porters.\u201d It was the fifth time the town\u2019s market has been hit. Saraqbi said he would not even attempt to reopen his family\u2019s fruit and vegetable store. He was already heavily in debt and shoppers were staying away. Instead he might buy a push cart to sell vegetables in the street. People were already cutting back on food because of soaring prices. Fuel shortages made transportation costlier, so staples like tomatoes, cucumber and aubergine were at least three times more expensive than a month earlier. These bombing attacks make fuel for ambulances vital. \u201cWe move around a lot to reach urgent cases especially in the current aerial campaign against civilians in Idlib,\u201d said Abu Husam, the aid worker. Budgets for this period had already been allocated, so when fuel costs went up, cuts had to be made. \u201cWe made it a priority to secure fuel for the bakeries, to make bread for the people who are still in the south of Idlib and neighbouring villages and towns,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are having difficulties reaching more distant areas, so our activities have been limited.\u201d For years, much of the fuel in Idlib had come from oil fields in north-eastern Syria, near Hassakah. Crude oil was trucked west along roads held by Kurdish and rebel forces to be turned into gasoline, diesel and fuel oil in makeshift refineries. But after the US president, Donald Trump, decided to abruptly abandon the US\u2019s Syrian Kurdish allies, leaving Turkish forces to sweep into some areas they held, fighting closed the main trucking route. The situation has calmed again, but the crossing remains closed, said one trader who operates several 125-barrel tanker trucks but has not been able to make any runs since mid-October. \u201cThe clashes have eased and the situation is stable on both sides near Manbij now, so I don\u2019t understand why the border is still closed,\u201d he said. Complicating the situation, in late November activists said strikes by unidentified planes hit several of the refineries around north and north-east Aleppo, hampering any attempt to processcrude oil should it start to arrive again.

Sounding the alarm that economic growth would come close to flatlining in the final three months of the year, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep the official interest rate on hold at 0.75%. Two of the outside experts on the nine-member panel, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, said the weakness of the economy warranted an immediate reduction to 0.5%, while seven others, including the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, voted to leave borrowing costs unchanged at among the lowest levels on record. Haskel and Saunders had voted for a rate cut at the last MPC meeting in November. Threadneedle Street said it expected gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by only 0.1% in the fourth quarter, slightly weaker than it had previously anticipated, as household spending stalled and business investment was kept on hold in the run-up to the election and amid a lack of clarity over Brexit. It said some company spending plans put on hold since the EU referendum could be reinstated by the end of next year but warned that heightened uncertainty over the future trade deal with the EU could continue to weigh on the economy. In a signal that the impact of Brexit uncertainty is unlikely to diminish, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s key election message that getting Brexit done would unleash a wave of investment, the Bank said the response of companies and households to leaving the EU would depend on developments in the year ahead as ministers seek to strike a trade deal with Brussels. Announcing the interest rate decision, the MPC warned there was \u201cno evidence yet about the extent to which policy uncertainties among companies and households have declined\u201d. According to the Bank\u2019s network of agents across the country, company investment intentions remained depressed by slower global growth and political uncertainty. Firms in the manufacturing and construction sectors told the Bank\u2019s agents they thought they would benefit from an increase in investment when uncertainty started to lift. However, the agents said: \u201cThere were risks around how soon that would materialise.\u201d The MPC said it expected inflation to remain below its 2% target next year. However, over the longer term it still anticipated that interest rates would need to rise at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. However, it warned there could be risks to the downside for the economy. In a heavy hint that it would be prepared to cut interest rates, the MPC said: \u201cMonetary policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation.\u201d",

The EU court said the company did not require an estate agent\u2019s licence to operate in France as it was mainly providing a tool for presenting and finding accommodation for rent rather than acting as a broker. The ruling is a boost for the company ahead of of its stock market listing next year. Airbnb is fighting claims from city authorities around the world, including Paris, Amsterdam and Barcelona, that its services are changing the face of neighbourhoods and that it should come under heavier regulation. Airbnb, which is registered in Ireland, said the court decision would allow it to \u201cmove forward and continue working with cities on clear rules\u201d. \u201cWe want to be good partners to everyone and already we have worked with more than 500 governments to help hosts share their homes, follow the rules and pay tax,\u201d the company said in a statement. The Luxembourg court rejected the claims of the Association for Professional Tourism and Accommodation (AHTOP) that Airbnb should face the same accounting, insurance and financial obligations as traditional providers of real estate. The association had sought to have the company regulated under the French Hoguet law, which covers the real estate profession and can lead to criminal sanctions for violations. But the court said the essential feature of Airbnb was its structured lists that enabled hosts to connect with people seeking accommodation along with \u201ca tool to facilitate the conclusion of contracts\u201d. The court said such an \u201cintermediation service\u201d that puts potential guests in contact with professional or non-professional hosts offering short-term accommodation services must be classified as an \u201cinformation society service\u201d under directive 2000/31. The ruling made mention of a recent case in which Uber was found to be acting as a transport company rather than a information society service leading to tighter regulatory oversight. But the court said that in the case of Uber, the company had a decisive influence over the conditions under which its drivers operated. In the case of Airbnb, the court ruled that it did not decide the rental price charged nor select the hosts or the accommodation put up for rent on its platform.

      "body": "<p>Felice Picano set out to write The Lure, his seminal gay thriller, after reading about a series of killings in Greenwich Village in the 1970s. The murders, which were mainly of gay male entrepreneurs, and the police\u2019s failure to find the culprit, were being covered by the Village Voice newspaper. But then the news stories suddenly stopped. When Picano met the reporter, he said he had been receiving death threats.</p> <p>\u201cSo I thought I should follow it up \u2013 it was my neighbourhood,\u201d says the author now, 40 years on. As he writes in a new introduction to the 1979 thriller, <a href=\"https://www.muswell-press.co.uk/book/the-lure\">which is being brought back into print in the UK by Muswell Press</a>, he had wanted to \u201cdetail a section of the gay community as I knew it; sort of the way Balzac detailed, piece by piece, much of early 19th-century French society.\u201d</p> <p>So he \u201cwent underground and did it myself\u201d, he says. \u201cI worked in bars and clubs, lived their lives, so I could get all the information I needed to make it realistic. And I had a good time. I got a boyfriend out of it.\u201d</p> <p>What he came up with was a layered and lurid thriller about an elusive serial killer stalking Manhattan\u2019s gay scene. After he witnesses a murder, academic Noel Cummings is recruited by police to act as a lure for the killer. Cummings, a widower, identifies as straight but is increasingly drawn to the lifestyle he is assuming. As <a href=\"https://www.out.com/art-books/2018/7/31/luring-them-remembering-queer-novel-broke-barriers\">Out magazine put it</a>: \u201cFor heterosexual readers for whom a flagrantly gay novel would, even in the late 70s, have been too much of a provocation, the title character Noel Cummings was a great distancing device that slowly reeled them in to New York\u2019s gay underbelly \u2026 Only mid-novel, once Cummings is engaging in drug-infused gay orgies, does one appreciate the skill with which Picano has seduced straight readers.</p> <p>\u201cFor many years before, men older than me had had to hide their lives, lead two lives, and I wanted to show people what it\u2019d be like to do that. In this case he was hiding his straight life. I wanted to do a neat reversal of what it is like to hide part of your life,\u201d says Picano. \u201cNoel goes into that world and suddenly he\u2019s awake all night and asleep all day. Everything starts changing for him as a result of that.\u201d</p> <p>When it was published in 1979, The Lure became the first gay-themed book to be picked up by the Book of the Month club in the US, it was an instant hit. (\u201cThey did me a wonderful favour, writing \u2018Warning: sex and violence\u2019 on the cover,\u201d says Picano.)</p> <p>Stephen King called Picano \u201cone hell of a writer\u201d, but not everyone approved. The Lure was hugely controversial with conservative readers and some gay readers because Picano, in his words, had \u201cexposed what I called the dirty laundry of gay life, the whole night-time scene. In order to get mainstream acceptance, a lot of organisations said we should never show that side. My feeling was, I\u2019m a modern author, I need to show what life is like, the good side and the shady side. I absolutely stand by that.\u201d</p> <p>He was even shot at in his apartment while he was working, by an unknown assailant: \u201cMy windows were open to the street. I heard the bullets and dropped down from my desk. We found the marks on the wall.\u201d</p> <p>For publisher Matt Bates, who is heading up the new queer writing list at Muswell, The Lure works on several levels. \u201cIt still has core resonance today because it functions, first and foremost, as a gripping, edge-of-your-seat psychological thriller. Any reader who enjoys a Michael Connolly, Linwood Barclay or Harlan Coben is going to experience deep satisfaction from this twisty read,\u201d says Bates. </p> <p>It is wonderful, he says, to be introducing The Lure to readers in the UK, where it has only had limited exposure. \u201cIt is important that we remember and champion queer past literature \u2013 firstly, because by reading it we can connect (possibly even feel) the experience of past queer lives and, secondly, we can also use that reading experience to measure change within the queer community both socially and psychologically,\u201d says Bates. \u201cFelice\u2019s novel is a great example of that, and one that delivers on a queer level as well as being a rollercoaster ride of a thriller.\u201d</p> <p>The Lure has never been out of print in the US. It has been studied on university courses, and Picano is now considered one of the founders of modern US gay literature. The novel has, as he writes in his new introduction, succeeded \u201cin bringing gay literature a renown \u2013 and income \u2013 that eventually helped solidify queer books as a solid \u2018niche\u2019 in publishing, and helping open the doors for thousands of volumes that followed.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years, hundreds of people have come to me and said it changed their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really surprised me!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.muswell-press.co.uk/book/the-lure\">\u2022 The Lure is published by Muswell Press.</a></p>",

When Picano met the reporter, he said he had been receiving death threats. \u201cSo I thought I should follow it up \u2013 it was my neighbourhood,\u201d says the author now, 40 years on. As he writes in a new introduction to the 1979 thriller, which is being brought back into print in the UK by Muswell Press, he had wanted to \u201cdetail a section of the gay community as I knew it; sort of the way Balzac detailed, piece by piece, much of early 19th-century French society.\u201d So he \u201cwent underground and did it myself\u201d, he says. \u201cI worked in bars and clubs, lived their lives, so I could get all the information I needed to make it realistic. And I had a good time. I got a boyfriend out of it.\u201d What he came up with was a layered and lurid thriller about an elusive serial killer stalking Manhattan\u2019s gay scene. After he witnesses a murder, academic Noel Cummings is recruited by police to act as a lure for the killer. Cummings, a widower, identifies as straight but is increasingly drawn to the lifestyle he is assuming. As Out magazine put it: \u201cFor heterosexual readers for whom a flagrantly gay novel would, even in the late 70s, have been too much of a provocation, the title character Noel Cummings was a great distancing device that slowly reeled them in to New York\u2019s gay underbelly \u2026 Only mid-novel, once Cummings is engaging in drug-infused gay orgies, does one appreciate the skill with which Picano has seduced straight readers. \u201cFor many years before, men older than me had had to hide their lives, lead two lives, and I wanted to show people what it\u2019d be like to do that. In this case he was hiding his straight life. I wanted to do a neat reversal of what it is like to hide part of your life,\u201d says Picano. \u201cNoel goes into that world and suddenly he\u2019s awake all night and asleep all day. Everything starts changing for him as a result of that.\u201d When it was published in 1979, The Lure became the first gay-themed book to be picked up by the Book of the Month club in the US, it was an instant hit. (\u201cThey did me a wonderful favour, writing \u2018Warning: sex and violence\u2019 on the cover,\u201d says Picano.) Stephen King called Picano \u201cone hell of a writer\u201d, but not everyone approved. The Lure was hugely controversial with conservative readers and some gay readers because Picano, in his words, had \u201cexposed what I called the dirty laundry of gay life, the whole night-time scene. In order to get mainstream acceptance, a lot of organisations said we should never show that side. My feeling was, I\u2019m a modern author, I need to show what life is like, the good side and the shady side. I absolutely stand by that.\u201d He was even shot at in his apartment while he was working, by an unknown assailant: \u201cMy windows were open to the street. I heard the bullets and dropped down from my desk. We found the marks on the wall.\u201d For publisher Matt Bates, who is heading up the new queer writing list at Muswell, The Lure works on several levels. \u201cIt still has core resonance today because it functions, first and foremost, as a gripping, edge-of-your-seat psychological thriller. Any reader who enjoys a Michael Connolly, Linwood Barclay or Harlan Coben is going to experience deep satisfaction from this twisty read,\u201d says Bates. It is wonderful, he says, to be introducing The Lure to readers in the UK, where it has only had limited exposure. \u201cIt is important that we remember and champion queer past literature \u2013 firstly, because by reading it we can connect (possibly even feel) the experience of past queer lives and, secondly, we can also use that reading experience to measure change within the queer community both socially and psychologically,\u201d says Bates. \u201cFelice\u2019s novel is a great example of that, and one that delivers on a queer level as well as being a rollercoaster ride of a thriller.\u201d The Lure has never been out of print in the US. It has been studied on university courses, and Picano is now considered one of the founders of modern US gay literature. The novel has, as he writes in his new introduction, succeeded \u201cin bringing gay literature a renown \u2013 and income \u2013 that eventually helped solidify queer books as a solid \u2018niche\u2019 in publishing, and helping open the doors for thousands of volumes that followed. \u201cOver the years, hundreds of people have come to me and said it changed their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really surprised me!\u201d \u2022 The Lure is published by Muswell Press.",

They are mixed up with organised crime, deeply influenced by the protective codes and practices of the family, the church and respectable commerce, but their conformity exists alongside a half-acknowledged life of sin and crime. The family man cheats on his wife, the churchgoer murders and robs, the hardworking small businessman evades tax, uses his business as a laundering front for the wiseguys and pays (or demands) protection \u2013 and the loyal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/22/mafia-godfathers-sicily-palermo-italy\">Cosa </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/22/mafia-godfathers-sicily-palermo-italy\">Nostra</a> soldier secretly wears a wire preparing to turn state\u2019s evidence.</p> <p>The Irishman is based on the true-crime bestseller I Heard You Paint Houses about Philadelphia mob enforcer Frank Sheeran \u00ad\u2013 whose nickname \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was an important way of announcing his semi-detachment from the Italian gangsters \u2013 and Sheeran\u2019s claim to have been the man who murdered Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa at the behest of mafiosi nervous about what Hoffa might reveal about his mob links. Scorsese assembles a superstar repertory of players: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/01/robert-de-niro-and-al-pacino-were-not-doing-this-ever-again\">Robert De Niro is the stolid, discreet Sheeran</a>, Joe Pesci displays his charismatic menace in the role of soft-spoken mafia boss Russell Bufalino and Al Pacino brings his A-game to the part of Hoffa.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS5JKhhvDv8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kS5JKhhvDv8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>These are all actors in their 70s, and though the digital de-ageing techniques used to represent them in middle age are remarkably successful, they have the bodies of old men and move like old men. Or is it that the top players in those days did indeed have a natural predator\u2019s discreet, unhurried stealth and stillness? Either way, there is a wintry poignancy to their performances and to the movie, which has led to a critical consensus that this is late Scorsese and that he is saying farewell to the mob genre.</p> <p>Maybe. What strikes me now about this story is not that it is sadly closing the book, but actually opening the book \u2013 and a lot of wounds \u2013 about crime and its connections with corrupt politics. The film makes clear the connection between the Cuban revolution, the collapse of the mob\u2019s casino business there and the subsequent creation of Las Vegas as the new gambling playground, built with money illegally loaned by Jimmy Hoffa out of the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund in return for a taste of the interest repayment and the use of mob \u201cmuscle\u201d \u2013 like Sheeran. It also touches on the mob\u2019s complex rage at John F Kennedy for failing to show gratitude for their alleged help in getting him elected and Hoffa\u2019s anger at attorney general Robert Kennedy for his anti-corruption crackdown. Not since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/jfk-oliver-stone-john-f-kennedy\">Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK </a>has a movie returned to the conspiracist issue of political assassination.

He talks of Bufalino\u2019s\u2019s wife, Carrie (played by Kathrine Narducci, who was Charmaine on The Sopranos) as a member of the blue-blooded Sciandra family from Sicily: \u201cThey came over on the Italian Mayflower!\u201d</p> <p>It is a very male film, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/07/why-dont-women-speak-in-the-irishman-martin-scorsese-anna-paquin-hollywood\">the absence of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/07/why-dont-women-speak-in-the-irishman-martin-scorsese-anna-paquin-hollywood\">powerful women figures has been noted</a>. I can only say that, yes, there is not much for Anna Paquin to do as Frank\u2019s adult daughter, but the maleness and male toxicity is part of the point.</p> <p>The geriatric melancholy of The Irishman is shown in the scenes in an old people\u2019s home and in those prison facilities adapted for use by the very old (another point in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/david-chase-the-sopranos-best-tv-21st-century\">David Chase\u2019s The Sopranos</a>).

      "bodyText": "The richness, artistry and grandeur of Martin Scorsese\u2019s film-making was revealed again in his epic mob corruption tale The Irishman, which returns him spectacularly to the wellspring of his greatest inspiration: the lives of working-class Italian Americans, and those from other US immigrant communities in the 20th century. They are mixed up with organised crime, deeply influenced by the protective codes and practices of the family, the church and respectable commerce, but their conformity exists alongside a half-acknowledged life of sin and crime. The family man cheats on his wife, the churchgoer murders and robs, the hardworking small businessman evades tax, uses his business as a laundering front for the wiseguys and pays (or demands) protection \u2013 and the loyal Cosa Nostra soldier secretly wears a wire preparing to turn state\u2019s evidence. The Irishman is based on the true-crime bestseller I Heard You Paint Houses about Philadelphia mob enforcer Frank Sheeran \u2013 whose nickname \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was an important way of announcing his semi-detachment from the Italian gangsters \u2013 and Sheeran\u2019s claim to have been the man who murdered Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa at the behest of mafiosi nervous about what Hoffa might reveal about his mob links. Scorsese assembles a superstar repertory of players: Robert De Niro is the stolid, discreet Sheeran, Joe Pesci displays his charismatic menace in the role of soft-spoken mafia boss Russell Bufalino and Al Pacino brings his A-game to the part of Hoffa. These are all actors in their 70s, and though the digital de-ageing techniques used to represent them in middle age are remarkably successful, they have the bodies of old men and move like old men. Or is it that the top players in those days did indeed have a natural predator\u2019s discreet, unhurried stealth and stillness? Either way, there is a wintry poignancy to their performances and to the movie, which has led to a critical consensus that this is late Scorsese and that he is saying farewell to the mob genre. Maybe. What strikes me now about this story is not that it is sadly closing the book, but actually opening the book \u2013 and a lot of wounds \u2013 about crime and its connections with corrupt politics. The film makes clear the connection between the Cuban revolution, the collapse of the mob\u2019s casino business there and the subsequent creation of Las Vegas as the new gambling playground, built with money illegally loaned by Jimmy Hoffa out of the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund in return for a taste of the interest repayment and the use of mob \u201cmuscle\u201d \u2013 like Sheeran. It also touches on the mob\u2019s complex rage at John F Kennedy for failing to show gratitude for their alleged help in getting him elected and Hoffa\u2019s anger at attorney general Robert Kennedy for his anti-corruption crackdown. Not since Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK has a movie returned to the conspiracist issue of political assassination. With calm, non-cranky deliberation, The Irishman proposes Hoffa\u2019s death as a quasi-Kennedy murder, but with no grassy knoll, no book depository, no Zapruder footage. There is such intense fascination in Scorsese\u2019s mastery of the big picture, the tiny detail, the flair and showmanship in the popular music on the soundtrack, and the unmistakable use of narrative voiceover, which gives his picture the intimacy of an anecdote and potency of myth. He talks of Bufalino\u2019s\u2019s wife, Carrie (played by Kathrine Narducci, who was Charmaine on The Sopranos) as a member of the blue-blooded Sciandra family from Sicily: \u201cThey came over on the Italian Mayflower!\u201d It is a very male film, and the absence of powerful women figures has been noted. I can only say that, yes, there is not much for Anna Paquin to do as Frank\u2019s adult daughter, but the maleness and male toxicity is part of the point. The geriatric melancholy of The Irishman is shown in the scenes in an old people\u2019s home and in those prison facilities adapted for use by the very old (another point in common with David Chase\u2019s The Sopranos). When the ageing Bufalino tells Sheeran he is going to mass in the prison chapel, he warns him not to laugh \u2013 and you don\u2019t laugh, not even ironically at Bufalino\u2019s expense. Then there is Sheeran himself, having run out of things to say at the last, and pitifully afraid of being left alone by us, the audience, and having the door shut in his own little room in the care home. The Irishman is the work by a master of cinema.",

      "body": "<p>When I was a child, we always spent Christmas at my uncle\u2019s. \u201cOgre\u201d is a strong word, but everyone was scared of him. He had an insane number of rules. He would come to fetch us in his car \u2013 then insist we leave the dog behind in case he scratched the upholstery. It was never obvious when children were meant to speak and when they weren\u2019t. If you chose the wrong time to go to the loo, you would get a 20-minute peroration on every 18th century print lining the stairs. I cannot tell you how uninterested I was in the window tax, which was another of his favourite subjects.</p> <p>There were tons of unspoken rules about nice stuff, such as where you could put a chair leg so it didn\u2019t leave a dent in the rug, where you could put a drink down and which was the right cloth to clean the table with (it transpired, over a period of some years, that there was no right cloth; there was a tiny battery-powered vacuum cleaner for detritus, and a chamois for high shine). There was an electric carving knife that made everyone tense. There are just so many things that can go wrong between an unevenly shaped carcass and a vibrating serrated blade.</p> <p>He was my mother\u2019s brother \u2013 my parents were separated \u2013 and disapproved very strongly of my father, which was fair, I guess, except that it meant we all had to pretend he had never existed, and definitely didn\u2019t exist now. I never got the hang of that until I was an adult \u2013 constantly tripping myself up in the middle of a sentence. \u201cI went to the cartoon cinema with my da \u2026 some man. Wait, not a man: a woman. Some strange woman took me to the cartoon cinema. Yes, it was great, we saw Bugs Bunny, thanks for asking.\u201d Protocol was a big thing, but it was unguessable. Things you would think were posh \u2013 the Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 were not posh, and my aunt had to sneak off and watch it on her own. Things you would think were not posh \u2013 putting on your cracker party hat and not taking it off, not ever, not until you got home \u2013 were mandatory. Once, he asked me if I wanted lemonade and I said: \u201cNo, thank you \u2013 it might make me fart,\u201d and I thought this was the most courteous and intelligent answer ever, since a classy person would definitely think ahead, but then I saw my mother\u2019s face, and it turned out that is not what a classy person would have done.</p> <p>Anyway, at some point in the late 80s, the tables were turned and everyone was coming to us. My sister and I were in our teens. We were maybe 10% more competent than your average teenage cook, but it would be a stretch to think we could manage the turkey, and I can\u2019t remember whose idea that was. Probably mine. (I think my uncle came to our childhood home to eat 10 times in my whole life \u2013 and once to my first flat, when I made potted ham, and it was unbelievably disgusting, claggy and mealy, as if it had been chewed and then refrigerated. I offered him some bread, and he said: \u201cYes, that might help,\u201d which was, again, fair.)</p> <p>Having guests always seemed to involve eating in a room we didn\u2019t normally eat in, so we would spend the day moving a bed out of it, and a lifetime\u2019s stash of the stuff that collects behind stuff. Then we would move a table in and cover it with a sheet because we weren\u2019t oversupplied with tablecloths. And then we\u2019d stand back and stare at it for hours: does that look like a dining table? Or a really uncomfortable bed? Is any of this in any way posh?</p> <p>So that was the drill this Christmas, and all this time the turkey was in the oven, sort of cooking. It definitely didn\u2019t go in early enough, but the main problem was that the door wouldn\u2019t close. For some reason, I thought this would be fine. That\u2019s the most common argument I have now with my kids; me going: \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d and them going: \u201cNO, IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE FINE.\u201d</p> <p>The atmosphere was like a montage scene of the Tudor servants of a remote lord getting ready for the king to arrive, except those people would have known what they were doing with suet, and we were just acting nervous and a bit hysterical. And it was all absolutely fine. We had enough chairs, we had enough drinks. We\u2019d got all the right stuff \u2013 we had smoked salmon, a stilton in a truckle, and nobody had gone off-piste and innovated. It was a bit stiff, but it was nothing like as boring as it normally was. There really wasn\u2019t a hitch, except when we got the turkey out, and it wasn\u2019t cooked at all.</p> <p>You have to understand how incredibly regimented Christmas Day was: the salmon was always at the same time, there was always a walk afterwards, the lunch was always after the walk, the presents were always after that. Any spontaneous change to the order of events would have been more than an act of aggression; it just wouldn\u2019t have computed. It couldn\u2019t have happened because it had never happened. There was no way the turkey could have just spent longer in the oven, never mind the three more hours it needed in a much bigger oven.</p> <p>It was like an anxiety dream where you have murdered someone, but forgotten to bury them: I was trying to carve it at the table, without anybody noticing the blood. I went round the bird\u2019s extremities, finding modest portions of the least dangerous meat, and distributed them in order of my favourites, although also on a family-hold-back principle, so I think my cousin\u2019s wife did OK and my sister got potato. The stuffing I took out and fried, while pretending to make gravy that I think my mother had already made. Luckily, the dining room was nowhere near the kitchen because it was actually a bedroom.</p> <p>My uncle was absolutely fine. It\u2019s possible his eyesight wasn\u2019t great. He was much more benign off his own turf, and did a lot of nodding and smiling. Who knows, he might have had a thing or two to say when he got home. Plainly, nobody died, otherwise I would have adopted a different tone to describe all this.</p> <p>Formality has so much power: the most formal person sets the rules and everyone tries like crazy to meet and anticipate them, like sheep trying to avoid a fence that isn\u2019t really electrified. A lot of its heft is in the things it leaves unsaid, which become immune to verbal challenge. Then you get the point where the potential downside is that you kill someone you are related to, and you sail straight past that point, to maintain the fiction that you can do formal as well as the next man. Reflecting on the event afterwards, I thought: in future, I\u2019m not going to do those kind of manners any more. I\u2019m going to do a rigorous separation between the stuff that hurts people\u2019s feelings, and the stuff that dresses up as courtesy but is actually a set of class-based mechanisms of domination and control. I also learned that it\u2019s harder to give people salmonella than you may think.</p>",

But it is much more than even this broad summary suggests: it is also a history of a place, or a series of places, a history of a house, a history of a period, and indeed of a way of thinking.

      "bodyText": "As Labour reflects on its dismal election defeat and gears up for another leadership contest, one thing is abundantly clear: it needs a woman as leader. Labour needs a woman for a variety of reasons, but most importantly because it has never, with the exception of a brief interim period, had one. The party is soon to be 120 years old. It\u2019s mortifying that, while the Tories have had not one, but two female prime ministers, the Labour movement, which claims to seek to liberate society\u2019s most downtrodden and vulnerable, is yet to have a woman lead it. What\u2019s that about? The answer is endemic gender bias. Labour\u2019s links to the trade union movement, historically not without its machismo or its sexist dinosaurs, have played a significant role. The left of the party\u2019s traditional emphasis on class liberation, while sidelining women\u2019s liberation, is another. That\u2019s not to say that there haven\u2019t been some good, feminist, Labour men, or that manifestos over the years have not included some solid feminist policies \u2013 we have Labour to thank for the Equal Pay Act and the Equality Act, and Sure Start centres. Jess Phillips has spoken powerfully about the difference these centres have made to her life. In power, Labour strengthened domestic violence legislation, increased support for carers, doubled maternity pay and helped low-income families through tax credits. Changes to the shortlists system saw 101 female Labour MPs elected to parliament in 1997. Yet when it comes to the upper echelons of the party, progress has been slow and clunking, and the party dawdles behind many of its global counterparts. Meanwhile in Finland, Sanna Marin has just become prime minister at the age of 34. When you say that the next leader of the Labour party should be a woman \u2013 as I have on a regular basis for years \u2013 the response I usually get is that whoever is chosen should simply be the best person for the job, regardless of gender (a set of principles Labour has apparently stuck to historically).

Round off the latest trilogy in the long-running space saga with a satisfying final instalment: check. Reintroduce one of the original trilogy\u2019s most liked faces in Billy Dee Williams\u2019 Lando Calrissian: check. Establish a credible character arc for the new movies\u2019 key antagonists: Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey and Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren/Ben Solo: check (just about).</p> <p>Director JJ Abrams must be given credit for pulling off such a storytelling endeavour, even if the result feels clunky and a little lifeless at times. But the film-maker\u2019s toughest task \u2013 and the one that may ultimately have damaged The Rise of Skywalker\u2019s chances of standing with the saga\u2019s greatest instalments \u2013 was to ensure that Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia retained her position at the heart of the movie, despite the actor having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-obituary-star-wars-actor-writer\">died in 201</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-obituary-star-wars-actor-writer\">6</a> before filming began.</p> <p>His task was made even more difficult when Disney bosses briefed journalists in the wake of Fisher\u2019s death to the effect that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/13/carrie-fisher-disney-negotiating-for-digital-rights-star-wars\">the studio would not be using the mo-cap \u201cghosting\u201d tech</a> that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/16/rogue-one-vfx-jon-knoll-peter-cushing-ethics-of-digital-resurrections\">successfully but controversially</a> used to revive Peter Cushing\u2019s Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One. Instead, Leia was restored to life with the use of previously shot footage from Abrams\u2019 The Force Awakens. </p> <p>She is at the peak of her Jedi powers in The Rise of Skywalker, a side of her we have only glimpsed in previous episodes. We see a flashback to her training \u2013 the only instance in which CGI is used to show us a younger version of the character. And back in the main timeline, Leia\u2019s scenes are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the story.

      "bodyText": "If Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is to be remembered for anything other than its mediocre reviews (the poorest for a live-action Star Wars film since the abominable Phantom Menace), it will probably be as an exercise in corporate box-ticking and fan service. Round off the latest trilogy in the long-running space saga with a satisfying final instalment: check. Reintroduce one of the original trilogy\u2019s most liked faces in Billy Dee Williams\u2019 Lando Calrissian: check. Establish a credible character arc for the new movies\u2019 key antagonists: Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey and Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren/Ben Solo: check (just about). Director JJ Abrams must be given credit for pulling off such a storytelling endeavour, even if the result feels clunky and a little lifeless at times. But the film-maker\u2019s toughest task \u2013 and the one that may ultimately have damaged The Rise of Skywalker\u2019s chances of standing with the saga\u2019s greatest instalments \u2013 was to ensure that Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia retained her position at the heart of the movie, despite the actor having died in 2016 before filming began. His task was made even more difficult when Disney bosses briefed journalists in the wake of Fisher\u2019s death to the effect that the studio would not be using the mo-cap \u201cghosting\u201d tech that was successfully but controversially used to revive Peter Cushing\u2019s Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One. Instead, Leia was restored to life with the use of previously shot footage from Abrams\u2019 The Force Awakens. She is at the peak of her Jedi powers in The Rise of Skywalker, a side of her we have only glimpsed in previous episodes. We see a flashback to her training \u2013 the only instance in which CGI is used to show us a younger version of the character. And back in the main timeline, Leia\u2019s scenes are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the story. She embraces Rey, talks to a multitude of other characters, and seems to be positioned right at the beating heart of the tale. She even makes a major intervention in the climactic battle between Rey and Ren, distracting her son from across the vast swathes of space with the use of Jedi powers, in order to allow the grand-daughter of Palpatine to achieve victory and begin turning Ren to the light. This is a fitting last hurrah for one of Star Wars\u2019 most emblematic figures: a final sacrifice, that sees her written out of the saga in hugely satisfying fashion. The problem is that we know, deep down \u2013 and can tell when watching \u2013 that Fisher\u2019s appearance is not really a tangible performance at all, but rather a spectacularly well crafted assembly of out-takes that has had a story built around it for convenience\u2019s sake \u2013 like a \u201cnew single\u201d from a long lost pop star, which everyone knows was previously unreleased because it didn\u2019t quite cut the mustard at the time of recording. The result is just about acceptable, but we cannot know how The Rise of Skywalker would have turned out had Fisher been alive to shoot new scenes for it. The idea is that Leia is completing Rey\u2019s training in the Jedi arts, yet Fisher\u2019s turn here seems woolly in the extreme, next to Mark Hamill\u2019s blistering return as Luke in The Last Jedi, or Frank Oz\u2019s magnificent debut as Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back \u2013 the two previous instances in Star Wars in which we have seen an elder master teach a young apprentice. There is no blame to be apportioned here, merely a comment on the available facts.

Trump holds defiant rally during impeachment vote It was a moment long anticipated by Donald Trump\u2019s critics, but the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, quickly silenced the celebrations in Congress after the House voted \u2013 mostly along party lines \u2013 to impeach the president on Wednesday. Trump is the third US president to face such a censure, on what Pelosi described as \u201c a sad day\u201d. But for all its supposed significance, the vote may come to be seen as simply another battle in the US\u2019s cold civil war. Tom McCarthy explains what is likely to happen next. As the House voted in Washington, Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Michigan where he told supporters \u201cthe country is doing better than ever before,\u201d and that he \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d. And, as Tom Perkins reports from Battle Creek, those supporters appeared to agree with him. Fox News. Trump\u2019s favourite news channel covered his impeachment in typical style, with its more serious anchors offering measured commentary on the debate in Congress \u2013 until the talkshows dived straight into rightwing conspiracy theories. Court strikes down Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate A federal appeals court in New Orleans has ruled that the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as Obamacare \u2013 is invalid. The ruling on Wednesday by the fifth US circuit court of appeals concurs with the 2018 decision of a US district judge in Texas, who found the mandate had been rendered unconstitutional by Congress, when lawmakers reduced the tax on people without insurance to zero in 2017. Pre-existing conditions. The new ruling stopped short of striking down more popular features of Obamacare, such as protections for those with pre-existing conditions and allowing people under 26 to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance. Australia heat records fall again as fires rage on Three firefighters were admitted to hospital with severe burns while tackling a blaze that destroyed about 20 properties near Sydney on Thursday, as eastern Australia continues to reckon with bushfires of unprecedented scale.

      "body": "<p>First released in 1982 \u2013 hot on the heels of its rival, Sinclair\u2019s ZX Spectrum \u2013 the Commodore 64 became one of the most popular home computers of the 1980s. It was far from user-friendly by today\u2019s standards \u2013 even demanding some code be entered just to load games \u2013 but it inspired a generation of future programmers and designers, many of whom went on to be influential game makers. At the peak of its popularity, factories were building 400,000 units a month to meet demand.</p> <p>In 2018, it made a comeback, reborn as a \u201cmicroconsole\u201d preloaded with games. A charming, half-scale replica, the C64 Mini could be plugged into a modern TV, providing access to 64 games. Unfortunately, it lacked two things so important to the Commodore 64 experience: a working keyboard and a decent joystick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"becbb5fc74cc696eebe29ae1f4f99ca83c935772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/becbb5fc74cc696eebe29ae1f4f99ca83c935772/0_56_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"THEC64 joystick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Click here \u2026 the C64 joystick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Retro Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now the the C64 Mini has returned, inflated to a full-size facsimile of the Commodore 64 and rebranded as the C64. This time, it features a functional keyboard and upgraded stick.</p> <p>As a replica, it is captivatingly precise. Placed alongside an original unit, only the logo and USB ports tell you that this isn\u2019t a carefully preserved 1980s model. The new mechanical keyboard is a little softer to use than the original, but it\u2019s an impressive reproduction nonetheless. Even before it is powered up, the C64 is capable of delivering a powerful hit of nostalgia.

      "bodyText": "First released in 1982 \u2013 hot on the heels of its rival, Sinclair\u2019s ZX Spectrum \u2013 the Commodore 64 became one of the most popular home computers of the 1980s. It was far from user-friendly by today\u2019s standards \u2013 even demanding some code be entered just to load games \u2013 but it inspired a generation of future programmers and designers, many of whom went on to be influential game makers. At the peak of its popularity, factories were building 400,000 units a month to meet demand. In 2018, it made a comeback, reborn as a \u201cmicroconsole\u201d preloaded with games. A charming, half-scale replica, the C64 Mini could be plugged into a modern TV, providing access to 64 games. Unfortunately, it lacked two things so important to the Commodore 64 experience: a working keyboard and a decent joystick. Now the the C64 Mini has returned, inflated to a full-size facsimile of the Commodore 64 and rebranded as the C64. This time, it features a functional keyboard and upgraded stick. As a replica, it is captivatingly precise. Placed alongside an original unit, only the logo and USB ports tell you that this isn\u2019t a carefully preserved 1980s model. The new mechanical keyboard is a little softer to use than the original, but it\u2019s an impressive reproduction nonetheless. Even before it is powered up, the C64 is capable of delivering a powerful hit of nostalgia. The Mini was delightfully tiny, but there is something much more evocative about holding a 1:1 scale remake. Once again, a generous 64 games are included, though the list of titles has been revised since the Mini.

The Buttigieg camp countered that they too had raised a lot of money from small donors paying as little as $25 to attend events like the Sacramento dinner. Sanders, in turn, has been accused of spreading himself wide but thinly in California. Critics say the noise generated by his appearances is not always matched by staff efforts to form relationships with new groups of voters and work to turn them out on election day. Spokesperson Bahr swiftly dismissed this. \u201cYou can\u2019t accuse of us of being shallow when we\u2019ve invested more than anyone else in this state,\u201d she said. This article was amended on 19 December 2019 to reflect that Cecilia Cabello is not the only native Californian state director in the race.",

      "body": "<p>It never rains but it pours for Lucien Favre this season. Having spent most of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/17/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-rb-leipzig-bundesliga-roundup\">Tuesday\u2019s second half</a> wired on the Westfalen touchline, hood pulled up and over against an actual and metaphorical deluge, he was now inside and dry, but the clouds hadn\u2019t cleared. Frequently the wearer of a pained expression, Favre looked even more glum than usual in his post-match press conference, in stark contrast to the sizzling spectacle that had prefaced his words.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe draw is very difficult to accept,\u201d sighed the Borussia Dortmund coach. How often does a team hold the league leaders to a draw and make those leaders grateful for a point? It had been a haphazard, difficult-to-explain evening. \u201cIt\u2019s a lucky point for us,\u201d confessed RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann. \u201cIt felt like a win tonight.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2019/dec/17/the-100-best-male-footballers-in-the-world-2019\">The 100 best male footballers in the world 2019: 100-11</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He had every right to feel like that, as his opposite number had to feel the way he did. Nagelsmann\u2019s side arrived for the most top of Top-Spiels in great nick, in first place and riding a run of six successive Bundesliga wins in which they scored an average of more than four per game. It was some sight, then, see the first half unfold. Dortmund, after being hemmed in by their opponents\u2019 press for the opening 10 minutes, proceeded to unload one of their best performances of the Favre era on their visitors, who initially had no answer.</p> \n<p>Julian Weigl\u2019s opener was a touch fortunate, with Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi diving around his shot from outside the box, but it had been coming and the tide was strong. When Jadon Sancho set up Julian Brandt for an exquisite pirouette around Dayot Upamecano and a rifled finish into the far corner, Dortmund were fully ablaze and Leipzig were hopelessly fumbling in the dark for a fire blanket.</p> \n<p>The Jekyll and Hyde nature of Dortmund\u2019s display was, however, personified by Roman B\u00fcrki. Gulacsi\u2019s opposite number made two saves of great quality in quick succession at the end of the first half, from Yussuf Poulsen and Timo Werner, having been rendered a virtual spectator for most of it as his side dominated. Then, just 72 seconds after the interval, B\u00fcrki came out to head a long ball away but nodded it straight to Werner, who gratefully rolled it into the net. Brandt, having provided the high point of the match, then touched a nadir by gifting Werner a leveller with a blind backpass.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56cf2dec214b8bb122d95ac16e596df31d31936c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56cf2dec214b8bb122d95ac16e596df31d31936c/0_204_4734_2841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucien Favre saw his Borussia Dortmund side play out an erratic and potentially costly 3-3 draw at home to league leaders RB Leipzig on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucien Favre saw his Borussia Dortmund side play out an erratic and potentially costly 3-3 draw at home to league leaders RB Leipzig on Tuesday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Beating Leipzig once is hard enough at the moment. Dortmund set themselves the task of doing it three times, giving away another equaliser, expertly snaffled by substitute Patrick Schick, after Sancho had given Dortmund the lead back in scoring for a seventh straight game. Favre\u2019s team play some incredible football. They also play some incredibly careless football. Even outside the goals they conceded in that frenetic second half, they looked vulnerable every time they lost possession, defending too high up the pitch and prone to Leipzig\u2019s lightning counters, with the pace of Werner and his potential to outpace Mats Hummels in particular preying on Schwarzgelben minds.</p> \n<p>The turnaround hurt. Not just because of how much Dortmund had put in for relatively meagre reward, but because of who it was against. In Leipzig\u2019s fourth season of top-flight football, there continues to be a crackle to this fixture. In February 2017, when they first visited Westfalen after promotion, the Gelbe Wand met them with a sea of banners panning their model, their morals and Red Bull\u2019s entry into the German game, the tip of an inhospitable iceberg that later saw Dortmund fined \u20ac100,000 and their S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne closed for a home game. A few banners remained on Tuesday night: \u201cNull toleranz gegen\u00fcber RB Leipzig\u201d, \u201cRB verpiss dich\u201d - and their players were met with a barrage of whistles when they entered the pitch, but the hatred has been dialled down a notch. It\u2019s more through necessity that any change in sentiment, with the reality being that Leipzig are here to stay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1306f84e8672d665ea3d137c5d489ee7896c9516\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1306f84e8672d665ea3d137c5d489ee7896c9516/0_24_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Brandt\u2019s strike was the pick of the goals in a pulsating 3-3 draw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Brandt\u2019s strike was the pick of the goals in a pulsating 3-3 draw.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Kuegeler/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That is more evident than ever this season, with Nagelsmann having taken them up a level already. The coach has better players at his disposal than he did at Hoffenheim, as a bench that had the likes of Schick and Christopher Nkunku on it on Tuesday night attested to. There is no doubt that he is drawing more from them than even Ralf Rangnick did, however, and his team have been not far off untouchable in the last two months, since blowing their cobwebs from their hitherto tentative home form. On the road, there\u2019s never been a doubt about them, which made the first half here all the more stunning.</p> \n<p>Yet they found a way, even if some will say that way was largely being available to accept early Christmas gifts. Taking a point from such an unpromising situation was proof of their mettle, though the ambitious Nagelsmann was brutally realistic. \u201cOur first-half performance was poor,\u201d he chided. \u201cIn future, we need to make sure that we play with more conviction when faced with an important match such as tonight\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "It never rains but it pours for Lucien Favre this season. Having spent most of Tuesday\u2019s second half wired on the Westfalen touchline, hood pulled up and over against an actual and metaphorical deluge, he was now inside and dry, but the clouds hadn\u2019t cleared. Frequently the wearer of a pained expression, Favre looked even more glum than usual in his post-match press conference, in stark contrast to the sizzling spectacle that had prefaced his words. \u201cThe draw is very difficult to accept,\u201d sighed the Borussia Dortmund coach. How often does a team hold the league leaders to a draw and make those leaders grateful for a point? It had been a haphazard, difficult-to-explain evening. \u201cIt\u2019s a lucky point for us,\u201d confessed RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann. \u201cIt felt like a win tonight.\u201d He had every right to feel like that, as his opposite number had to feel the way he did. Nagelsmann\u2019s side arrived for the most top of Top-Spiels in great nick, in first place and riding a run of six successive Bundesliga wins in which they scored an average of more than four per game. It was some sight, then, see the first half unfold. Dortmund, after being hemmed in by their opponents\u2019 press for the opening 10 minutes, proceeded to unload one of their best performances of the Favre era on their visitors, who initially had no answer. Julian Weigl\u2019s opener was a touch fortunate, with Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi diving around his shot from outside the box, but it had been coming and the tide was strong. When Jadon Sancho set up Julian Brandt for an exquisite pirouette around Dayot Upamecano and a rifled finish into the far corner, Dortmund were fully ablaze and Leipzig were hopelessly fumbling in the dark for a fire blanket. The Jekyll and Hyde nature of Dortmund\u2019s display was, however, personified by Roman B\u00fcrki. Gulacsi\u2019s opposite number made two saves of great quality in quick succession at the end of the first half, from Yussuf Poulsen and Timo Werner, having been rendered a virtual spectator for most of it as his side dominated. Then, just 72 seconds after the interval, B\u00fcrki came out to head a long ball away but nodded it straight to Werner, who gratefully rolled it into the net. Brandt, having provided the high point of the match, then touched a nadir by gifting Werner a leveller with a blind backpass. Beating Leipzig once is hard enough at the moment. Dortmund set themselves the task of doing it three times, giving away another equaliser, expertly snaffled by substitute Patrick Schick, after Sancho had given Dortmund the lead back in scoring for a seventh straight game. Favre\u2019s team play some incredible football. They also play some incredibly careless football. Even outside the goals they conceded in that frenetic second half, they looked vulnerable every time they lost possession, defending too high up the pitch and prone to Leipzig\u2019s lightning counters, with the pace of Werner and his potential to outpace Mats Hummels in particular preying on Schwarzgelben minds. The turnaround hurt. Not just because of how much Dortmund had put in for relatively meagre reward, but because of who it was against. In Leipzig\u2019s fourth season of top-flight football, there continues to be a crackle to this fixture. In February 2017, when they first visited Westfalen after promotion, the Gelbe Wand met them with a sea of banners panning their model, their morals and Red Bull\u2019s entry into the German game, the tip of an inhospitable iceberg that later saw Dortmund fined \u20ac100,000 and their S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne closed for a home game. A few banners remained on Tuesday night: \u201cNull toleranz gegen\u00fcber RB Leipzig\u201d, \u201cRB verpiss dich\u201d - and their players were met with a barrage of whistles when they entered the pitch, but the hatred has been dialled down a notch. It\u2019s more through necessity that any change in sentiment, with the reality being that Leipzig are here to stay. That is more evident than ever this season, with Nagelsmann having taken them up a level already. The coach has better players at his disposal than he did at Hoffenheim, as a bench that had the likes of Schick and Christopher Nkunku on it on Tuesday night attested to. There is no doubt that he is drawing more from them than even Ralf Rangnick did, however, and his team have been not far off untouchable in the last two months, since blowing their cobwebs from their hitherto tentative home form. On the road, there\u2019s never been a doubt about them, which made the first half here all the more stunning. Yet they found a way, even if some will say that way was largely being available to accept early Christmas gifts. Taking a point from such an unpromising situation was proof of their mettle, though the ambitious Nagelsmann was brutally realistic. \u201cOur first-half performance was poor,\u201d he chided. \u201cIn future, we need to make sure that we play with more conviction when faced with an important match such as tonight\u2019s. We can\u2019t afford to hide. We weren\u2019t able to keep up during the first half.\u201d That first half is what Dortmund must cling to as they seek to continue their recent improvement, and to convince the world that they can contend for a title again. When the dust settled on this extraordinary spectacle one did wonder if, coupled with Leipzig freezing in the first half, all that we could really be convinced of is that Bayern\u2019s pretenders will somehow find a way to hand them back their title. Talking points \u2022 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach took advantage of Tuesday\u2019s draw in Dortmund to go level on points at the top with an unspectacular 2-0 win over Paderborn. It was a vital win too, coming after straight defeats, and Marco Rose\u2019s men just about avoided being stung by the bottom team\u2019s increasingly eye-catching counterattacks. \u2022 Bayern Munich set their supporters\u2019 hearts more aflutter in Freiburg, during a game in which they looked like winning at a canter after Robert Lewandowski\u2019s opener, and could well have lost after Vincenzo Grifo\u2019s second-half equaliser. Bravo then to Hansi Flick, who replaced Philippe Coutinho with Joshua Zirkzee and then watched the 18-year-old put Bayern in front in stoppage time with a smart finish. Serge Gnabry added a third with the last kick of the game but it was all about Zirkzee, now the youngest-ever Dutchman to score in the Bundesliga. \u2022 Werder Bremen continued their rough week with a humiliating 5-0 thrashing at home to Mainz. \u201cThere are no explanations for such a very bad game,\u201d said coach Florian Kohfeldt. \u201cIt was disastrous.\u201d They now have a huge game on Saturday away at K\u00f6ln, who leapfrogged them out of the bottom three with a thrilling 4-2 win at Eintracht Frankfurt, coming back from two down.",

Recognising the difficulties on the high street, the government said it was committed to a \u201cfundamental review\u201d of business rates and announced new measures to help independent retailers in the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. The measures include a 50% discount on business rates for small to medium-sized high street properties including shops, pubs and restaurants with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000, up from a 33% discount at present. The discount is also being extended to cinemas and music venues. The plans are unlikely to do much to help troubled major retailers such as House of Fraser or Debenhams as retail chains are not eligible for the discount and neither are large department stores. November was the fourth month in a row without growth in retail spending \u2013 the longest stretch since the mid-90s. The ONS said Black Friday was not included in the figures, as the US-inspired day of shopping discounts fell late in the month, on 29 November. It said its seasonally adjusted estimates accounted for this shift in timing. However, analysts said the timing of Black Friday could have had an impact and probably distorted November\u2019s spending figures. The ONS said Black Friday spending patterns would probably influence its December release, with only early promotions captured in the November estimates. Duncan Brewer, a retail partner at the consultancy Oliver Wyman, said political uncertainty had lifted since the election and unemployment remained low, in a positive signal for consumer spending. However, he warned that at least two high street shopping chains were likely to go bust next year and about 100,000 jobs were likely to be cut across the sector. He said: \u201cThe slump in retail sales over November goes to show that despite the momentous shopping holiday of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, discounting periods are not an effective way of getting people into the shops.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s much more impeachment news on Thursday\u2019s live blog. Follow it here: Today, Donald Trump became the third president in US history to be impeached. Here\u2019s a recap: After a full day of debate, the House approved two articles of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Congress voted 230-197 to approve the first article and 229-198 for the second. Members voted overwhelmingly along party lines, with three Democrats opposing one or both articles, and one, 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard, voting \u201cpresent\u201d. While announcing the result, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has cast the impeachment as a sad, solemn occasion, shut down applause from Democrats. Afterward, Pelosi evaded questions about when she will hand the articles of impeachment over to the Senate, indicating that wants to first make sure that the Senate will hold a \u201cfair\u201d trial. Leader Mitch McConnell said he will address the impeachment on the Senate floor tomorrow. As members of the House voted to impeach him, Donald Trump carried on speaking at a campaign rally in Michigan. The moment offered a surreal split screen. As impeachment was being debated, an appeals court delivered a long-awaited ruling on the Affordable Care Act. The court said that the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d provision of Obamacare was unconstitutional while punting a broader decision on whether the entire law was valid. And finally (just for fun): the USDA removed references to Wakanda, the fictional home of Marvel superhero Black Panther, from a list of trading partners. A few more impeachment reactions from 2020 Dems... Joe Biden, the only 2020 candidate name-checked in the articles of impeachment, echoed other Dremocrats and cast today as \u201ca solemn moment for our country\u201d Cory Booker, who along with his 2020 competitors Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, will be participating in the Senate trial on whether to convict Trump, similarly said: \u201cToday is a sad moment for our country.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, yet another Senator in the 2020 race said \u201cthe House is fulfilling their constitutional obligation\u201d. Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard, the only House member to vote \u201cpresent\u201d said she was \u201cstanding in the center\u201d. \u201cAfter doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report, I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,\u201d she said. The Hawaii representative and 2020 candidate instead introduced a resolution to censure Trump for abusing \u201c the powers of the Presidency for his own personal political gain\u201d . Analysis: Impeachment is \u2018one more battle in America\u2019s cold civil war\u2019 Read The Guardian\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s historic impeachment vote, courtesy of David Smith: While no crystal ball can truly foresee whether impeachment will help or hurt Trump in the 2020 presidential election, the House\u2019s ultimate sanction may come to be seen simply as one more battle in America\u2019s cold civil war. That would make it one of the most important yet least consequential votes in congressional history. RNC and DNC issue contrasting statements on impeachment Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel said \u201cNancy Pelosi and her fellow impeachment crusaders have ensured the reelection of President Trump\u201d by voting to impeach him. At the same time, the Democratic National Committee chair lauded those who voted for impeachment. \u201cThose who voted for impeachment will be remembered for their courage and commitment to protecting our democracy,\u201d said DNC chair Tom Perez. Republicans and Democrats have stuck with tried and tested talking points, with the former continuing to cast the process as a \u201csham\u201d and the latter repeating that House Dems had a constitutional responsibility to see the impeachment through. Donald Trump is the third US president to be impeached. The moment offered a surreal split screen \u2014 as the president railed against Democrats at a rally, they cast their votes against him. Here\u2019s a recap of the day, in pictures: Representative Debbie Dingell responded to Trump\u2019s attacks against her and her late husband, writing that his \u201churtful words just made my healing much harder\u201d. Dingell is a Democrat from Michigan, where Trump is holding a campaign rally tonight. Now that Donald Trump has been impeached, it\u2019s up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi what happens next. Responding to questions from reporters, Pelosi wouldn\u2019t say when she plans on sending the impeachment articles to the Senate, which is required to hold a trial to decide whether to remove the president from office. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens over there,\u201d Pelosi said at her news conference, referring to the Senate. She said House Democrats would decide as \u201ca group\u201d when to send the articles over and name impeachment managers \u2014 House members who will make their case in the Senate trial. Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, said he will address the impeachment at 9:30 AM EST tomorrow morning. Speaking at his campaign rally, Donald Trump said he regretted that Debbie Dingell, a Democratic representative from Michigan, voted to impeach him even though he allowed a state funeral to proceed for her late husband and have him \u201cthe A+ treatment\u201d. Trump also suggested John Dingell may be \u201clooking up\u201d from hell. 2020 Democratic candidates laud impeachment Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren indicated they were ready to take up the torch in the senate. Michael Bloomberg said the House \u201cdid its duty under the Constitution,\u201d but added that \u201cunfortunately, it increasingly appears that Senate Republicans will not. The issue won\u2019t be settled until November, by the American people.\u201d Julian Castro suggested that Mitch McConnell should recuse himself from the Senate trial. \u201cThe Senate should do its constitutional duty. Remove Donald Trump from office,\u201d he said. Pete Buttigieg expressed similar sentiments. \u201cOur lawmakers take an oath not to party but to country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat oath is all the more important in the most difficult of times. Nancy Pelosi would not definitively commit to sending over the articles of impeachment or naming impeachment managers. \u201cWe cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen anything that looks fair to us.\u201d Senate leader Mitch McConnell is \u201cin cahoots with the lawyers of the accused,\u201d Pelosi said, but she did not say how exactly a fair Senate trial would look . Withholding the articles could give Pelosi some leverage over the trial as she pushes McConnell to call more witnesses. Adam Schiff: \u2018Will the Senate uphold its duty?\u2019 \u201cThe question is whether the majority leader will allow a fair trial,\u201d Shiff said, having seen the impeachment inquiry he led come to a close. \u201cWe have done our duty in the House, we have upheld the constitution. The question now is will the senate uphold its duty?\u201d He urged senators to call more witnesses and demand to see documents that the president has withheld. \u201cThe president not only abused his office but threatens to abuse it again,\u201d Schiff said. Nancy Pelosi said today is a \u201csad day\u201d for the country. \u201cThe president\u2019s reckless activities necessitated us having to introduce articles of impeachment,\u201d she said, before thanking the various House committee leaders who spearheaded the impeachment inquiry. House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler added that the \u201cno one, not even the president is above the law\u201d. Donald Trump continued to speak at a campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan as a majority of the House voted to pass both articles of impeachment. \u201cThe do-nothing Democrats are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThis lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat party.\u201d In a statement, Trump\u2019s press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president is \u201cconfident the Senate will restore regular order, fairness, and due process, all of which were ignored in the House proceedings\u201d. \u201cHe is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated,\u201d she said. The House has now passed the second article of impeachment, which is obstruction of Congress. The final vote was 229-198, with only Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard voting \u201cpresent.\u201d Trump has been impeached on both abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and the two articles will now taken up by the Senate in a trial to determine whether he should be removed from office. It is widely expected the president will be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, but the importance of this moment cannot be understated. A majority of the House of representatives has declared that Trump has abused his power and obstructed Congress, and he will go down in history as only the third US president to ever be impeached. Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who voted \u201cpresent\u201d on both articles of impeachment, has issued a statement explaining her stance, which will certainly prove controversial with the rest of her caucus. \u201cAfter doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report, I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,\u201d Gabbard said in the statement. This moment is quickly going viral. After the first article of impeachment officially passed, speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to shush the House Democrats who started to applaud. Pelosi has emphasized throughout the day that this is a \u201csad\u201d occasion, and the speaker reportedly instructed her caucus not to appear celebratory of the inevitable result. A majority of the House of representatives has now voted in favor of the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, after passing the first article, abuse of power. The vote is not final until speaker Nancy Pelosi gavels it in, but the tally is currently 221-165, with only Tulsi Gabbard voting present. Three House Democrats -- Jeff Van Drew, Collin Peterson and Jared Golden -- have voted \u201cno\u201d on the second article of impeachment, which is obstruction of Congress. Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard voted \u201cpresent,\u201d as she did on the first article of impeachment. With Nancy Pelosi presiding over the House, the speaker called for a vote on the second article of impeachment, which is obstruction of Congress. This vote will go much the same as the first, with one notable exception: Democratic congressman Jared Golden has said he will vote \u201cno\u201d on this article, despite supporting the first article. Members have five minutes to cast their ballots. The House has passed the first article of impeachment against Trump, abuse of power, by a vote of 230-197. Donald Trump is officially the third president in US history to be impeached by the House. The members will now move on to the second article of impeachment, which is obstruction of Congress. Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned in a green \u201cyes\u201d card moments ago, casting her ballot in favor of the first article of impeachment. After much speculation as to whether she was even going to participate in the vote, congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the first article of impeachment. A majority of House members have now voted \u201cyes\u201d on the first article of impeachment, but it is not official until the end of the vote is called. The vote is currently 219-164. Congressman Collin Peterson has now voted \u201cno\u201d on the first article of impeachment, becoming only the second (and likely last) House Democrat to oppose the article. Congressman Ron Kind, who avoided stating publicly whether he would support impeachment, has voted \u201cyes,\u201d as has congressman Jared Golden. Golden, a Democrat from Maine, announced yesterday that he would support the first article of impeachment, but not the second, so his vote will switch to a \u201cno\u201d when that article is taken up. As expected, congressman Jeff Van Drew, the Democrat who is expected to switch parties after the impeachment vote and has spent the day on the Republican side of the aisle, has voted \u201cno\u201d on the first article of impeachment. Democratic congressman Collin Peterson is also likely to vote \u201cno,\u201d but every other House Democrat is expected to support the first article, which is abuse of power. More than 11 hours after the start of today\u2019s impeachment hearings, the vote is now underway on the first article of impeachment against Trump, which is abuse of power. House members will have 15 minutes to cast their votes, and many are choosing to do it by hand rather than electronically. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, speaking at his campaign rally in Michigan said, \u201cBy the way, it doesn\u2019t really feel like we\u2019re being impeached.\u201d \u201cWe did nothing wrong and we have tremendous support in the Republican party like we\u2019ve never had before,\u201d he said. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has concluded his remarks, wrapping up the debate on the impeachment resolution. The chamber has now moved on to a vote on the two articles of impeachment. Minority leader Kevin McCarthy has concluded his floor speech, and intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff is now delivering the final remarks of the impeachment debate. Schiff accused his Republican colleagues of spending their debate time spewing a lot of \u201csound and fury signifying nothing.\u201d But the chairman said the Republican argument boiled down to this question: \u201cWhy should we care what the president did to Ukraine?\u201d Schiff went on to say America should care about the plight of its allies, particularly a struggling democracy like Ukraine. He also encouraged his Republican colleagues to consider the precedent it would set if the House did not impeach Trump, warning it could signal presidents can just ignore congressional oversight. Minority leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of acquiescing to their \u201cnew socialist base\u201d in pursuing the impeachment of Trump. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way. Is this why we came here to serve? To trample on due process rights? To issue more subpoenas than laws? To appease the new Democrat-socialist base?\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cFortunately, the people will have the opportunity to speak up and render their verdict in 11 short months,\u201d the California Republican continued. \u201cTo my fellow Americans -- If you approve of the way this House has conducted its business -- if you want to see your tax dollars go towards endless investigations -- support impeachment. \u201cBut if you want to restore a working Congress -- like the previous Congress that listened to you and worked to bring the best economy this country has ever seen and will once again work with the President to get things done for you and your family -- then join Republicans in rejecting this baseless impeachment. That\u2019s what\u2019s wonderful about this system of ours: we are a government of, by, and for the people.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy opened his floor speech by sharing a fact that Democrats will \u201chate to hear\u201d: \u201cDonald J. Trump is president of the United States,\u201d prompting cheers from his Republican caucus. \u201cHe is president today, he will be president tomorrow and he will be president when this impeachment is over,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHere is our choice tonight,\u201d McCarthy continued, \u201cWill we let impeachment become an exercise of raw political power, regardless if it damages our country? Or will we protect the proper grounds and process for impeachment now and in the future?\u201d Majority leader Steny Hoyer has concluded his floor speech, and congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, is now delivering some remarks. The final two speakers are expected to be minority leader Kevin McCarthy and intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff. In his floor speech, majority leader Steny Hoyer praised congressman Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party over his opposition to Trump. Amash spoke on the floor earlier today, encouraging his colleagues to vote in favor of impeachment for the sake of the country. \u201cWe need not ask who will be the first to show courage by standing up to President Trump,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cThe question we must now ask is who will be the last to find it.\u201d House Republicans have repeatedly jeered Steny Hoyer as the majority leader delivers his floor speech presenting Democrats\u2019 position on the impeachment resolution. Trump arrives in Michigan for a campaign rally As the impeachment debate rolls toward a final vote, Donald Trump has arrived in Michigan, where he is holding a campaign rally tonight. Upon deboarding his plane, the president did not speak to the press, signaling that he was doing \u201cgood,\u201d as he waved off questions. He did issue a statement on the Affordable Care Act ruling earlier today, reassuring that \u201cthis decision will not alter the current healthcare system.\u201d Besides posting an all-caps tweet decrying \u201catrocious lies by the radical left\u201d several hours ago, Trump has remained relatively quiet on impeachment today. Members of Congress may begin voting on articles of impeachment against Trump as he takes the rally podium. Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer acknowledged the 63 million people who voted for Trump in 2016 but quickly nodded to the 65 million who voted for Hillary Clinton, appearing to prompt some cheers from the Democratic side of the aisle. The Maryland Democrat also reminded his Republican colleagues that he and the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, resisted the idea of impeachment for months, until the whistleblower complaint on the Ukraine controversy emerged. The most senior Democrats and Republicans in the House are now delivering their floor speeches, indicating the debate on the impeachment resolution is winding down. House minority whip Steve Scalise has just finished speaking, and majority leader Steny Hoyer has now taken the mic. Minority leader Kevin McCarthy also tweeted he would soon speak on the floor. Congressman Steve Scalise, the House minority whip, has been granted five minutes to criticize the impeachment resolution as the floor debate begins to wind down. The Louisiana Republican accused Democrats of pursuing a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d against Trump with their impeachment inquiry, which he said only stemmed from their \u201cfear that he might win reelection.\u201d \u201cThey made up these terms to impeach a president because they couldn\u2019t find any crimes,\u201d Scalise said, claiming the Democrats \u201chated\u201d the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump. That last comment sparked boos from the Democratic side of the aisle and some cheers from Scalise\u2019s Republican colleagues. Doug Collins, the Republican congressman coordinating his caucus\u2019 floor speeches, asked Adam Schiff whether the Democrats had concluded their side of the debate, but the House intelligence committee chairman said they still had a few speakers remaining. The hearing has now been underway for 10 hours, and the vote on the articles of impeachment is expected in the next hour. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to take the stage at his campaign rally in Michigan at any moment. On a historic day for America \u2026 Soon, Donald Trump faces an impeachment vote in the House. This vote marks the latest twist in one of the most turbulent presidencies in US history. But the challenges to American democracy do not end today. Over the last three years, much of what we hold dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. 2020 promises to be an epic year \u2013 and could define the country for a generation. With your help we will continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight. We\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Congresswoman Liz Cheney, the chairwoman of the House Republican conference, was allowed four minutes to condemn the impeachment resolution, more time than almost any of her colleagues. The Wyoming Republican claimed Democrats had presented \u201cno direct evidence of any impeachable offense\u201d and warned Trump\u2019s impeachment could set a dangerous precedent. Cheney urged her colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote \u201cno\u201d on the articles of impeachment to honor the Constitution and their oath of office. Congressman Drew Ferguson, a Georgia Republican, condemned the impeachment resolution, calling it a \u201cgoat rodeo\u201d and a \u201csham.\u201d As the House debate continues on the impeachment resolution, another poll has been released showing the country is evenly divided on whether Trump should be removed from office. According to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 48% of Americans favor the president\u2019s impeachment and removal from office, while 48% oppose it. Trump and his allies have taken to claiming in recent days that support for impeachment is sharply declining. In reality, support for the president\u2019s impeachment has been virtually unmoved since the inquiry\u2019s public hearings started. Congressman Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, accused Democrats of cooking up baseless allegations against Trump to make up for their loss in the 2016 election. \u201cThe only thing that Donald Trump is guilty of is beating Hillary Clinton,\u201d the California Republican said. Nunes went on to slam his Democratic colleagues for \u201cripping the country apart ... in their lust for power.\u201d Echoing dozens of his colleagues, congressman Jim Jordan argued Democrats only pursued impeachment to punish Trump for his allaged success in office. \u201cWhen you drain the swamp, the swamp fights back,\u201d the president\u2019s House ally said. It also appears congressman Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, will get the chance to weigh in on the floor. After two more of Trump\u2019s House allies, Mark Meadows and John Ratcliffe, spoke in opposition to the impeachment resolution, Adam Schiff predicted history would remember his Republican colleagues poorly. \u201cI think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found that they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did,\u201d Schiff said. This condemnation was met by audible groans on the Republican side of the aisle. Congressman Lee Zeldin, a close House ally of Trump\u2019s, was given three minutes to criticize the impeachment resolution, a relatively lengthy window given most of his colleagues who have spoken in this hour of the debate were only allowed 30 seconds. Zeldin directed most of his ire at Adam Schiff, accusing the intelligence committee chairman of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d facts and \u201cmisleading\u201d the American public. He concluded by encouraging his colleagues to vote \u201cno\u201d on impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s a total Schiff show,\u201d Zeldin concluded, appearing to prompt a chuckle from the Democratic chairman. Adam Schiff interrupted the string of short floor speeches to argue his Republican colleagues are unable to address the accusations against Trump, claiming the president\u2019s allies are only able to come up with \u201cprocess\u201d complaints about the impeachment inquiry. Schiff\u2019s comments prompted grumbling on the Republican side of the aisle. \u201cApparently, Madame Speaker, I\u2019ve struck a nerve,\u201d Schiff said. He went on to say of Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to defend that conduct. ... What they can\u2019t say is that this president\u2019s conduct was ethical.\u201d \u201cAuntie Maxine\u201d is now trending on Twitter after congresswoman Maxine Waters delivered her floor speech in favor of the impeachment resolution. \u201cThis day was not inevitable, but it was predictable,\u201d Waters said, \u201cbecause this president has shown himself time and time again to believe that he is above the law and he has no respect for our Constitution or our democracy.\u201d Time check: there is a little over an hour remaining in the impeachment debate, but Republicans have about 43 minutes left compared to the Democrats\u2019 29 minutes. Meanwhile, even reporters from Hawaiian outlets have been unable to determine whether one of their representatives, Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, will participate in tonight\u2019s impeachment vote. Gabbard was not present for this morning\u2019s procedural votes, and the presidential candidate proposed yesterday that Democrats censure Trump rather than impeaching him. If Gabbard does appear, it\u2019s unclear how she will vote on the two articles of impeachment. One Republican cingressman suggested the House should consider the removal of Nancy Pelosi, prompting a laugh from the speaker. While lawmakers on Capitol Hill are preoccupied with impeachment, a federal judge dropped a long-awaited decision on healthcare, ruling that the Obamacare mandate requiring Americans to buy coverage is unconstitutional but declining to rule on whether the entire Affordable Care Act is valid. The decision doesn\u2019t have much immediate impact, because Congress already repealed the penalty for those who don\u2019t buy insurance. But the court delayed any decision on whether the entire ACA is unconstitutional because of the mandate, leaving it to a district court to \u201cprovide additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA as they currently exist.\u201d In 2018, a group of Republican-led states filed a lawsuit arguing that individual mandate repeal meant that the entire law should be town down. The Fifth Circut agreed, but the decision was appealed by Democratic state attorneys, including California. California\u2019s attorney general Xavier Becerra said he will challenge today\u2019s ruling as well. The ruling thrusts the debate of the Affordable Care Act, and its many provisions including protections for people with preexisting medical conditions, back into the national spotlight as the 2020 elections approach. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House financial service committee, argued the impeachment resolution would allow \u201cjustice\u201d to be served. Quoting Maya Angelou, Waters said of the president, \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, another Virginia Democrat whose district backed Trump in 2016, has also just taken the floor to explain her support for the impeachment resolution. Spanberger and Elaine Luria, who spoke shortly before her, are two of the vulnerable freshman Democrats who signed a Washington Post op-ed in September asserting Trump\u2019s alleged actions toward Ukraine constituted impeachable behavior. Congresswoman Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat whose district backed Trump by 3 points in 2016, has just finished delivering her floor speech explaining her support for impeachment. Luria said she spoke today \u201cin support of our Constitution\u201d and the oath she first took at 17, when she entered the naval academy. The congresswoman said she stood on the House floor with the \u201cresolve to do what is right and not what is politically expedient.\u201d Several House Republicans actually booed just now as Adam Schiff was challenging their defenses of the president, a first for this historic day in Congress. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced she and the committe chairs who led the impeachment inquiry would hold a press conference tonight, following the expected passage of the articles of impeachment. Before Trump departed the White House for his campaign rally in Michigan, some of his advisers -- including his daugher, Ivanka Trump -- were spotted in the Oval Office, sitting near a poster showing the 2016 election results by acreage. Earlier today, a judge dismissed Paul Manafort\u2019s state charges -- undermining New York prosecutors\u2019 attempts to ensure jail time for Trump\u2019s former campaign chair, despite a potential presidential pardon. Manafort is currently serving a 7.5 year prison sentence after being convicted in federal court on charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller III\u2019s Russia probe. The Manhattan district attorney additionally charged Manafort, 70, with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other state felonies. Manafort\u2019s lawyers argued that the state charges should be dismissed because they overlapped with his federal charges. A state judge in Manhattan agreed. \u201cBasically, the law of double jeopardy in New York State provides a very narrow window for prosecution,\u201d he said, before submitting his decision to dismiss the charges. Manafort, 70, did not appear in court. He was hospitalized last week after a cardiac health issue. Congressman Matt Gaetz, one of the president\u2019s closest House allies, has taken the floor, and he has come out swinging. \u201cThis is not about Ukraine; this is about power,\u201d the Florida Republican said. \u201cDonald Trump has it, and Democrats want it.\u201d Gaetz accused the Democrats of \u201cadhering to no sense of honor\u201d in their handling of the impeachment inquiry, claiming his colleagues on the left have \u201cplotted and planned\u201d Trump\u2019s removal since his inauguration. Gaetz called the impeachment resolution a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to the Americans who voted for Trump and argued Democrats were merely looking for an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d because they cannot defeat Trump. \u201cBut we have an insurance policy, too,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cIt\u2019s the next election, and we intend to win it.\u201d Time check: congresswoman Diana DeGette, who is presiding over the impeachment proceedings, said two hours remain in the impeachment debate. Democrats and Republicans each have another hour to make their cases, although the Republican caucus has about six minutes more in their remaining time than their Democratic counterparts. Trump is on his way to a campaign rally in Michigan, ignoring reporters\u2019 questions about today\u2019s impeachment proceedings as he left the White House. The rally is scheduled to begin at 7pm ET, which means Trump could be speaking to his supporters when he becomes the third president in US history to be impeached. Congressman Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party over his opposition to Trump, was given two minutes by the Democrats to make a floor speech in favor of impeachment. \u201cI come to this floor, not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, but as an American,\u201d Amash said. The Michigan lawmaker went on to argue House members have a duty to vote in favor of the impeachment resolution. \u201cImpeachment is about maintaining the integrity of the office of the presidency,\u201d Amash said. Adam Schiff mocked a talking point from his Republican colleagues, who have repeatedly slammed the \u201csecretive\u201d nature of the impeachment inquiry. Specifically, Republicans have complained about the House committees leading the inquiry holding meetings in a basement \u201cbunker,\u201d referring to the room in the Capitol where lawmakers receive classified information. \u201cThis is apparently what they call depositions,\u201d Schiff joked. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights icon who marched alongside Martin Luther King, called on his colleagues to support impeachment, arguing they have a \u201cmoral obligation to say something, to do something.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cOur nation is founded on the principle that we do not have kings, we have presidents, and the Constituion is our compass.\u201d Lewis asserted the House had \u201ca mission and a mandate to be on the right side of history.\u201d The Georgia Democrat predicted future generations would ask this question: \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Republican congressman Francis Rooney, who had said he was open to supporting impeachment, has officially announced he will vote \u201cno\u201d tonight, virtually ensuring every House Republican will oppose the resolution. \u201cBased on the limited evidence provided to the House of Representatives, the President\u2019s behavior, while inappropriate, was neither criminal, nor does it rise to the level of justifying impeachment,\u201d Rooney said in a statement explaining his decision. A Republican congressman, Bill Johnson, just used his floor speech to hold a moment of silence for the 63 million Americans who backed Trump in 2016, whose votes are supposedly being ignored in the impeachment inquiry. Of course, that 63 million figure is almost 3 million votes fewer than Hillary Clinton received in 2016. Congressman Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party over his opposition to Trump and has become a vocal supporter of impeachment, has asked Democrats for two minutes to deliver a floor speech. Adam Schiff used his floor speech to detail the allegations against Trump and warn that Congress would set a dangerous precedent if members did not vote to impeach him. \u201cIf the president\u2019s conduct isn\u2019t impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,\u201d Schiff said. The intelligence committee chairman also quoted Alexander Hamilton\u2019s warning of a leader who is \u201cunprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper,\u201d who would \u201cthrow things into confusion\u201d and \u201cmay ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has taken over from Jerry Nadler to oversee Democrats\u2019 floor speeches in the impeachment debate. \u201cI rise to support the impeachment of Donald J Trump,\u201d Schiff said upon taking the floor. The handoff from Nadler to Schiff indicates we are halfway through the floor debate, with three hours remaining. Congressman Louie Gohmert, a fervent defender of Trump\u2019s, used his floor speech to peddle baseless claims against Ukraine. When the floor was turned over to Jerry Nadler, the judiciary committee chairman said, \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned that any member of the House would spew Russian propaganda on the floor of the House.\u201d Gohmert could be heard shouting back at Nadler from the floor, but his objections were drowned out by congresswoman Diana DeGette, who is presiding over the debate, banging her gavel. Gohmert then walked over to Nadler and appeared to be angrily confronting him, although Nadler said few words in response. Congressman Will Hurd, a retiring Republican who was once viewed as a potential impeachment supporter by Democrats, used his floor speech to condemn the \u201crushed process\u201d of the inquiry, so his \u201cno\u201d vote is secured. It\u2019s still unclear how many votes will be needed to pass the articles of impeachment because the number depends on how many members participate in the vote, as a Fox News reporter noted. In a matter of hours, Donald Trump faces an impeachment vote in the House. This vote marks the latest twist in one of the most turbulent presidencies in US history. But the challenges to American democracy do not end today. Over the last three years, much of what we hold dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. 2020 promises to be an epic year \u2013 and could define the country for a generation.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has spent much of the afternoon sitting on the House floor, listening to members\u2019 speeches about the impeachment resolution. Juli\u00e1n Castro didn\u2019t qualify for the Democratic presidential debate in Los Angeles this week, but the former housing secretary is still making stops in LA. This morning, he took a tour of Skid Row with activists and talked with homeless people about the worsening crisis in California. His visit comes as Trump has repeatedly threatened to launch some kind of police crackdown on homeless people living on the streets of LA and San Francisco. \u201cThe administration has decided to take an approach of essentially criminalizing people who are homeless,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThis is the wrong thing to do ... The administration is going backwards.\u201d \u201cWe cannot accept criminalizing poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is morally wrong.\u201d Castro visited the Downtown Women\u2019s Center at Skid Row, which is the epicenter of the housing crisis in southern California. \u201cThe stereotype of homelessness is a single man, but we know that doesn\u2019t reflect the reality out there today. Unfortunately there are many women and children and families,\u201d Castro said. As he walked through tent encampments with a trail of reporters tagging along, some living on the street ran up to shake his hand and give hugs. \u201cYou need to get us housing, that\u2019s what y\u2019all need to do!\u201d one person shouted at Castro. \u201cStop filming and help us!\u201d said another. Castro and senator Cory Booker both failed to qualify for the final debate of the year, which will take place in LA on Thursday night. The White House appears to be delivering Trump\u2019s six-page letter to Nancy Pelosi to Senate offices, along with a pair of Christmas cards. Trump sent the furious letter to Pelosi yesterday, calling impeachment an \u201cunprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history.\u201d Democrats and Republicans each have about an hour and 45 minutes left in their debate time, meaning three and a half hours of debate remain before members will turn to a vote on the articles of impeachment. Some House Democrats are reportedly urging speaker Nancy Pelosi to withhold the articles of impeachment against Trump in the hope of gaining leverage in a Senate trial. The Washington Post reports: The notion of impeaching Trump but holding the articles in the House has gained traction among some of the political left as a way of potentially forcing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to conduct a trial on more favorable terms for Democrats. And if no agreement is reached, some have argued, the trial could be delayed indefinitely, denying Trump an expected acquittal. The gambit has gained some traction inside the left wing of the House Democratic Caucus this week. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of \u2018rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.\u2019 ... Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution. Giving an interview in the White House briefing room, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway accused Nancy Pelosi of making the impeachment inquiry \u201cpersonal,\u201d claiming the House speaker threw a \u201chissy fit\u201d when she met with the president in the cabinet room. Congressman Mike Kelly has just compared today\u2019s impeachment vote to Pearl Harbor, predicting Dec. 18 would be \u201canother date that will live in infamy,\u201d referring to FDR\u2019s famous quote about Dec. 7, 1941. Kelly\u2019s comparison adds to a growing list of inappropriate references Trump\u2019s Republican allies have made to lament the president\u2019s impeachment, including the crucifixion of Jesus and the Salem witch trials. At least two more House members, Democrat Jose Serrano and Republican John Shimkus, will not be present for today\u2019s impeachment vote, slightly lowering the threshold needed to approve the articles of impeachment. But it\u2019s still unclear whether Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who is running for president and missed this morning\u2019s procedural votes, will participate. Gabbard, who has been harshly critical of some of her presidential primary opponents, called for Trump\u2019s censure yesterday, and it\u2019s unclear how she will vote on the articles of impeachment if she appears on Capitol Hill. House members were just told a little more than four hours remain in the impeachment debate, so the chamber appears to be on schedule for a final vote between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. E.T. Republican congressman Barry Loudermilk just made a comparison between the Trump impeachment inquiry and the trial of Jesus in the Bible, shockingly arguing Pontius Pilate was more fair to Jesus than Democrats have been to the president. Congressman Steve Chabot, the Republican lawmaker who just warned Trump\u2019s impeachment would set a dangerously low standard going forward, was an impeachment manager during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Two other former Clinton impeachment managers, congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and senator Lindsey Graham, also still serve in Congress. Several thousand Trump supporters are standing in line, waiting to get in to the venue for his Michigan campaign rally tonight despite that it\u2019s -4 with the wind chill. Not surprisingly, the crowd\u2019s opinions on impeachment were firmly pro-Trump. \u201cIts a shitshow. Its been a waste of time from the start. The Democrats want to overturn the election and they can\u2019t, so they\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time,\u201d said Debra Schulz from Kalamazoo, who had a Trump-Pence flag draped around her shoulders. \u201cDid you watch the hearings? They didn\u2019t present any evidence. It was all speculation and hearsay. There\u2019s nothing there,\u201d said Mike Ostafin from Ceresco. Steve King, the Republican congressman who was stripped of his committee assignments over his comments about white nationalism, just delivered his floor speech criticizing the impeachment inquiry. The Iowa lawmaker made the dubious argument that Trump could not have abused his power by pushing for an investigation into Joe Biden because the former vice president is not actually his political rival. King argued Biden was competing against \u201c21\u201d other Democratic presidential candidates and \u201crunning third in the polls,\u201d so Trump\u2019s request for an investigation was therefore not inherently political. In a matter of hours, Donald Trump faces an impeachment vote in the House. This vote marks the latest twist in one of the most turbulent presidencies in US history. But the challenges to American democracy do not end today. Over the last three years, much of what we hold dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. 2020 promises to be an epic year \u2013 and could define the country for a generation.

Congressman Cedric Richmond tried to appeal to the reputations of his Republican colleagues in his floor speech, arguing Trump was not worthy of the loyalty his party is showing. The Louisiana Democrat warned the president would not stand by Republican lawmakers \u201cpast the next tweet or next week.\u201d Here is the full text of Clay Higgins\u2019 floor speech, in which the Republican congressman criticized the Democrats supporting impeachment by referring to them as \u201cthe same socialists who threaten unborn life in the womb.\u201d Meanwhile, over in the Senate, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway is attending the Republican caucus lunch and working hard to prevent defections in the likely event of an impeachment trial. There was just a bizarre moment on the House floor, as judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler reminded his Republican colleagues that Mike Pence would become president if Trump were impeached, not Hillary Clinton. This ackowledgement was met by laughs and cheers on the Republican side of the aisle. Congressman Chris Stewart, a Republican member of the House intelligence committee, warned Trump\u2019s impeachment would set a precedent for future presidents. \u201cThe next president, I promise you, is going to be impeached,\u201d Stewart said in his floor speech. \u201cIf you set this bar as being impeachable, every president in our future will be impeached.\u201d Congressman Clay Higgins attracted Republican applause and Democratic scorn for his floor speech, which was accompanied by a poster showing the results of the 2016 election by acreage. \u201cThey call us deplorables,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThey fear our faith, they fear our strength, they fear our unity, they fear our vote, and they fear our president.\u201d He added, \u201cOur republic shall survive this threat from within.\u201d But commentators pointed out Trump actually lost the popular vote in 2016, taking some of the air out of Higgins\u2019 argument. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, whose name has been floated as a possible impeachment manager, pledged that Democrats would impeach Trump to send a message about the Constitution. \u201cWe will impeach Donald John Trump,\u201d Jeffries said on the House floor. \u201cAnd we will clarify that, in America, no one is above the law.\u201d Jeffries\u2019 remarks were followed by those of Republican Tom McClintock, who referred to abuse of power (one of the articles of impeachment) as a \u201cmade-up crime.\u201d On a historic day for America \u2026 In a matter of hours, Donald Trump faces an impeachment vote in the House. This vote marks the latest twist in one of the most turbulent presidencies in US history. But the challenges to American democracy do not end today. Over the last three years, much of what we hold dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth.

Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, asked G.K. Butterfield, who is now presiding over the impeachment proceedings, how much time remains in the debate. Butterfield conferred with House officials and confirmed that more than five hours remain, so there will be a lot more debate to come. Here\u2019s where this historic day stands so far: The House is currently debating the articles of impeachment against Trump, with a final vote expected between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. E.T. tonight. House speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the six hours of debate by accusing Trump of violating the Constitution and urging members to honor their oath of office. Two House Democrats -- Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew, who has signaled he intends to switch parties -- joined Republicans in opposing procedural motions to advance the impeachment debate. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. A senior Trump campaign official said the president\u2019s team is \u201cvery excited\u201d that the impeachment vote may be finalized as Trump takes the stage tonight for his campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan. The impeachment vote will likely occur between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. E.T. tonight, and Trump is scheduled to start his rally at 7. House judiciary committee Jerry Nadler criticized his Republican colleagues\u2019 remarks on the floor, saying he has heard them say everything \u201cexcept a defense of President Trump\u2019s conduct, which is indefensible.\u201d Nadler then turned the floor over to congressman Ted Deutch of Florida. There is still more than five hours of debate left to go. Moments after the White House claimed Trump would be \u201cworking all day\u201d and would only catch \u201csome\u201d of the impeachment debate, the president again tweeted about the proceedings, accusing Democrats of executing an \u201cASSAULT ON AMERICA.\u201d Trump has a light public schedule today before leaving for his Michigan campaign rally, allowing the president to tweet more than 40 times by noon. Speaking at an event in Michigan before the president\u2019s campaign rally tonight, Mike Pence slammed the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and accused Democrats of trying to reverse the 2016 election. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Capitol Hill today is a disgrace,\u201d the vice president said, according to the pool report. \u201cThe truth is they are trying to impeach this president because they know they can\u2019t defeat this president. ... \u201cThey\u2019re pushing this partisan impeachment because they know they can\u2019t stop you from giving president Donald Trump four more years in the White House. ... Tonight after a sham investigation, do-nothing Democrats are going to vote on a partisan impeachment seeking to oveturn the willl of the American people.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s light schedule today before he leaves for his Michigan campaign rally, the White House said he would be \u201cworking all day\u201d and might watch \u201csome\u201d of the floor debate on the impeachment resolution. \u201cThe President will be working all day,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \u201cHe will be briefed by staff throughout that day, and could catch some of the proceedings between meetings.\u201d Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, one of only 14 Republicans who were in the House during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, just spoke on the floor to denounce the impeachment inquiry. Congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, is now speaking on the floor, slamming impeachment as a baseless, partisan stunt. \u201cThis is not a solemn occasion,\u201d Collins said, mocking the words of speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wanting to do this ever since the election.\u201d Collins repeated his words from yesterday\u2019s rules committee hearing, saying, \u201cThe clock and the calendar are terrible masters.\u201d The Georgia Republican argued his Democratic colleagues only cared about getting political revenge on Trump. \u201cThey do not care about facts,\u201d Collins said. As Nancy Pelosi concluded her remarks to kick off debate on the impeachment resolution, the House speaker was met with a standing ovation from the many Democratic members present for her speech. Speaking on the House floor, Nancy Pelosi reiterated the accusations against Trump and urged members to honor their oath of office in today\u2019s impeachment vote. The House speaker argued the president had \u201cviolated the Constitution\u201d and had left Democrats with \u201cno choice\u201d but to impeach. \u201cIf we do not act now, we are derelict in our duty,\u201d Pelosi told the chamber, where most of her Democratic caucus was present to hear her remarks. The debate on the articles of impeachment has officially begun, and House judiciary committee Jerry Nadler began by deferring to speaker Nancy Pelosi. The House speaker opened the debate by reciting the pledge of allegiance and emphasizing the oath members take. \u201cThe republic for which it stands is what we are here to talk about today,\u201d Pelosi said. She then repeated the Benjamin Franklin quote she has pointed to throughout the impeachment inquiry to justify the investigation: \u201cA republic if we can keep it.\u201d The House clerk, Joe Novotny, has just finished reading the articles of impeachment against Trump, and members will now have six hours to debate the resolution. The articles concluded \u201cWherefore, President Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\u201d The House clerk is now reading the articles of impeachment against Trump on the floor, after which House members will have six hours to debate the resolution before tonight\u2019s vote. If the debate goes according to schedule, which (again) is a big assumption, the vote should take place around 7:30 p.m. E.T. The House has adopted the \u201crule\u201d outlining the procedures for today\u2019s debate on the impeachment resolution, with all but two Democrats (Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew) backing the motion. Members will now have six hours to debate the impeachment resolution itself, split eqaully between the majority and the minority. House Democrats successfully approved a motion to end debate on the \u201crule\u201d outlining procedures for today\u2019s impeachment proceedings, clearing the way for a vote on the rule itself. Two House Democrats \u2013 Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has signaled he itnends to switch parties after the impeachment vote \u2013 joined Republicans in opposing a procedural motion to end debate on the \u201crule\u201d outlining procedures today. Van Drew dodged reporters\u2019 questions yesterday when asked about switching parties, but he is expected to cast his votes today as a Democrat, helping Republicans to claim bipartisan opposition to impeachment. But with the exceptions of Peterson and Van Drew, every House Democrat backed the procedural motion, proving how unified the caucus is on impeaching Trump. Congressman Jeff Van Drew, the Democratic lawmaker who has signaled he will switch his party affilation to Republican over his opposition to impeachment, has arrived on the House floor after missing this morning\u2019s procedural votes. As House members vote on the \u201crule\u201d outlining procedures for today\u2019s impeachment proceedings, some campaign-related news is also unfolding. Senator Susan Collins said in a letter to supporters this morning that she is running for reelection, confirming widespread expectations the Maine Republican would seek a fifth term. \u201cThe fundamental question I had to ask myself in making my decision was this: in today\u2019s polarized political environment, is there still a role for a centrist who believes in getting things done through compromise, collegiality, and bipartisanship?\u201d Collins said in the letter. \u201cI have concluded that the answer to this question is \u2018yes,\u2019 and I will, therefore, seek the honor of continuing to serve as Maine\u2019s United States Senator.\u201d But Democrats have argued Collins has lost her centrist reputation by siding with Trump on controversial issues, such as the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh. Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine house and the frontrunner in the Democratic primary to face off against Collins, said in a statement that the longtime senator is no longer the centrist lawmaker the state has repeatedly elected. \u201cWhen Sen. Collins took office 22 years ago, she might have been different from other people in Washington, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way anymore,\u201d Gideon said. \u201cThese days, Sen. Collins seems more focused on serving the special interests that fund her campaigns than the Mainers who elected her.\u201d Debate has now concluded on the \u201crule\u201d outlining procedures for today\u2019s impeachment proceedings, and House members have moved on to a vote series to adop the rule. Democratic congressman Joe Kennedy used his floor speech to explain to his children why he intended to vote in favor of impeaching the president. \u201cDear Ellie and James: This is a moment that you\u2019ll read about in your history books,\u201d the Massachusetts lawmaker said. As the president lashes out against Nancy Pelosi, some commentators have started recirculating this 2008 video, in which Trump commends Pelosi and suggests she should have tried to impeach George W. Bush. \u201cWhen [Pelosi] first got in and was named speaker, I met her,\u201d Trump told CNN host Wolf Blitzer at the time. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very impressed by her. I think she\u2019s a very impressive person, I like her a lot.\u201d Trump continued, \u201cBut I was surprised that she didn\u2019t do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush. It just seemed like she was really going to look to impeach Bush and get him out of office. Which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing.\u201d Trump argued Bush should have been impeached for the \u201clies\u201d he told before invading Iraq. Trump has already tweeted a few dozen times this morning to slam the impeachment inquiry and speaker Nancy Pelosi as debate continues on the House floor. The president has nothing on his public schedule this morning until he leaves for his Michigan campaign rally at 4:25 p.m. E.T., so more tweets will likely be forthcoming as the House takes up the articles of impeachment. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is sitting on the House floor as debate continues on the \u201crule\u201d outlining procedures for today\u2019s proceedings. The vote on the \u201crule\u201d should take place in about ten minutes. Once it is adopted, members will be given six hours to debate the impeachment resolution itself, split evenly between the majority and the minority. Congressman Jeff Van Drew, the Democrat who has signaled he will switch his party affiliation to Republican over his opposition to impeachment, did not vote in this morning\u2019s procedural motions. House Republicans are trying to introduce more procedural motions to delay the vote, suggesting that debate on the articles of impeachment should be six hours longer than scheduled and that memebers should be made to cast votes manually, but Democrats have rejected the proposals. Congressman Jim Clyburn, the House majority whip, delivered a floor speech outlining Democrats\u2019 argument for impeachment. \u201cToday we have a president who seems to believe he is a king or above the law,\u201d the longtime South Carolina lawmaker said. Just outside the US Capitol, pro-impeachment protesters have found some fun, holiday-themed ways of expressing their displeasure with the president. Walking to the House floor, Nancy Pelosi would only tell reporters she felt \u201csad\u201d about today\u2019s proceedings, echoing reports that the speaker has intstructed her Democratic caucus to treat today as a solemn occasion. The sadness of today\u2019s vote may be the only point of agreement between House Democrats and Republicans, as Tom Cole, the top Republican on the rules committee, made a similar comment on the floor. The Republican minority whip, Steve Scalise, tried to raise a point of order, but Diana DeGette, the Democratic congresswoman presiding over today\u2019s debate, ruled it to be out of order. Debate has now begun on the \u201crule\u201d establishing procedures for today\u2019s impeachment proceedings. Congressman Jim McGovern, the Democratic chairman of the House rules committee, has introduced the \u201crule\u201d that will establish parameters for debate on the impeachment resolution. House members will now have an hour to debate the rule before voting on the proposal, so it\u2019s looking like an 11 a.m. E.T. vote before discussion can turn to the impeachment resolution itself. The motion to table Kevin McCarthy\u2019s resolution condemning Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler has succeeded, hopefully clearing the way (finally) for an hour of debate on the procedures for today. True to form, the House of representatives is already behind schedule for today\u2019s impeachment proceedings. The optimistic estimate that the final vote on articles of impeachment would take place by 7:30 p.m. E.T. is feeling more unlikely by the minute. The Democratic majority leader, Steny Hoyer, has now introduced a motion to table Kevin McCarthy\u2019s resolution condemning Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler for their handling of the impeachment inquiry, triggering another 15-minute vote. It appears Republicans are trying to delay the inevitable for as long as possible in the hope of forcing Democrats to take some uncomfortable votes before the all-important vote on articles of impeachment later tonight. These procedural motions could disrupt the optimistic timeline of concluding today\u2019s proceedings by 7:30 p.m. E.T., but they will not affect the end result. The day will end in Trump\u2019s impeachment no matter how many technical maneuvers Republicans deploy. Kevin McCarthy is calling for a vote on a resolution condemning the Democratic chairmen of the intelligence and judiciary committees, Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler, for their handling of the impeachment inquiry. This will also be rejected by the Democratic majority. Well, not so fast. The Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, is now offering a parliamentary question before the House begins debating the rules for today\u2019s proceedings. The Republican motion to adjourn before taking up the articles of impeachment has been defeated, clearing the way for debate to begin on the procedures for today\u2019s historic proceedings. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler is on the floor today, having returned from a last-minute trip to New York yesterday to attend to a family medical emergency. Nadler\u2019s absence from Washington yesterday meant that congressman Jamie Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, presented the Democrats\u2019 argument for impeachment before the House rules committee. A House Democratic aide provided more context on why congresswoman Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat who has served since 1997, is presiding over today\u2019s debate. Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette is currently presiding over the House proceedings, but speaker Nancy Pelosi will take over when members vote on the articles of impeachment later tonight. Pelosi will also deliver a floor speech tonight, which is a rarity for House speakers. Once the motion to adjourn is defeated, House members will likely begin one hour of debate on the procedures adopted by the rules committee to set parameters for today\u2019s proceedings. As expected, House Republicans have put forth a motion to adjourn before considering the articles of impeachment, which will almost certainly be defeated. The House has now convened for today\u2019s proceedings, which will conclude with final votes on the two articles of impeachment against Trump. House Republicans are expected to introduce a number of procedural motions, which could delay the final vote, but Democrats will be able to defeat those proposals with their majority power. The House will convene in about 10 minutes to begin today\u2019s proceedings, which will include several hours of debate on the impeachment resolution, but protesters have already gathered on Capitol Hill. Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee who has been intensely criticized by Trump and his allies, encouraged his colleagues to \u201chonor their oath\u201d in today\u2019s impeachment vote. Nancy Pelosi has designated Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette to serve as speaker pro tempore and preside over the House debate on the impeachment resolution. DeGette, a Colorado lawmaker who has served in the House since 1997, said of the honor, \u201cThis is a sad and somber moment in our nation\u2019s history and the responsibility to preside over this important debate is something I will not take lightly.\u201d Following a marathon hearing yesterday, the House rules committee adopted debate procedures for today\u2019s impeachment vote, which will likely not be finalized until this evening. According to the rules passed by the committee, House members will have six hours to debate the impeachment resolution, split evenly between the majority and the minority. The House is set to start today\u2019s business at 9 a.m. E.T., but they have to take care of some housekeeping and formally adopt the rules before debating the actual impeachment resolution. Assuming everything runs on time, which is a hefty assumption where the House of representatives is concerned, the final vote could come sometime between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. E.T. Trump is scheduled to start his campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, at 7 p.m. E.T., which means he could be on stage when he becomes only the third president in US history to be impeached. Trump has nothing on his public schedule today until he leaves for a Michigan campaign rally at 4.25 pm ET., and the president is already lashing out against his critics over Twitter. Trump acknowledged the House would almost certainly impeach him, but he insisted he had done \u201cNOTHING WRONG\u201d and warned of the effect today\u2019s vote would have on future presidents. \u201cSay a PRAYER!\u201d Trump wrote. The request for his supporters to pray for the country is noteworthy, given that Trump sent a letter to Nancy Pelosi yesterday criticizing the House speaker for saying, \u201cI pray for the President all the time.\u201d \u201cEven worse than offending the Founding Fathers, you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying you pray for the President when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense,\u201d Trump wrote in his furious letter. Good morning, live blog readers! We have arrived. Today, the House of Representatives is expected to impeach Donald Trump, making him only the third president in US history to receive this ignoble honor. The outcome of today\u2019s House vote is all but certain, as a majority of members have said they intend to vote in favor of impeachment. However, once they do, the case will move on to the Republican-controlled Senate, where Trump has already been guaranteed a much more favorable audience. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday he would not be an \u201cimpartial juror\u201d in the trial to determine whether to remove Trump from office, calling impeachment a \u201cpolitical process.\u201d Even though the Senate trial will likely end in acquittal, nearly all the House Democrats from more conservative districts have said they plan to vote \u201cyes\u201d today, framing the issue as a matter of duty. Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, whose Michigan district backed Trump by 7 points in 2016, wrote in an op-ed earlier this week, \u201cOver the past few months, I\u2019ve been told more times that I can count that the vote I\u2019ll be casting this week will mark the end of my short political career. That may be. \u201dBut in the national security world that I come from, we are trained to make hard calls on things, even if they are unpopular, if we believe the security of the country is at stake. There are some decisions in life that have to be made based on what you know in your bones is right. And this is one of those times.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Why are Indians protesting?</strong></h2> <p>The government has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/india-to-bring-in-law-denying-citizenship-to-muslim-migrants\">passed a long-mooted law</a> to fast-track citizenship applications for refugees from surrounding countries who are Hindu, Christian, Parsi, Jain or Buddhist \u2013 but not Muslim.</p> <p>Critics argue the legislation is unconstitutional and undermines India\u2019s secular ethos. In contrast to neighbouring Pakistan, an Islamic republic, India\u2019s founding leaders were adamant that their country would not have an official religion. More than 80% of the country is Hindu, but India also has the third largest Muslim population in the world and one of the oldest Christian communities outside the Middle East.</p> <p>People in India\u2019s north-east, protective of their distinctive cultures and long suspicious that those cultures might be diluted by migrants, are also unhappy. They say they do not want refugees from neighbouring Bangladesh to become citizens of their states, whatever their religion. Some of the fiercest protests against this bill have been in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/12/they-will-lock-us-up-or-just-kill-us-muslims-fearful-in-west-bengal]\">north-eastern states</a> such as Assam.</p> <p>This week the demonstrations were fuelled by scenes of police beating protesters from a Muslim-majority university who were demonstrating against the law.

      "bodyText": "Why are Indians protesting? The government has just passed a long-mooted law to fast-track citizenship applications for refugees from surrounding countries who are Hindu, Christian, Parsi, Jain or Buddhist \u2013 but not Muslim. Critics argue the legislation is unconstitutional and undermines India\u2019s secular ethos. In contrast to neighbouring Pakistan, an Islamic republic, India\u2019s founding leaders were adamant that their country would not have an official religion. More than 80% of the country is Hindu, but India also has the third largest Muslim population in the world and one of the oldest Christian communities outside the Middle East. People in India\u2019s north-east, protective of their distinctive cultures and long suspicious that those cultures might be diluted by migrants, are also unhappy. They say they do not want refugees from neighbouring Bangladesh to become citizens of their states, whatever their religion. Some of the fiercest protests against this bill have been in north-eastern states such as Assam. This week the demonstrations were fuelled by scenes of police beating protesters from a Muslim-majority university who were demonstrating against the law. Footage of young people, including many women in religious garments, being attacked by officers or stuck in a library that was being teargassed have shocked Indians and crystallised the concerns of opponents of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, that this government is eroding civil liberties. Why did the Modi government pass this law? The government argues non-Muslim minorities often face persecution in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan. It says persecuted Muslims have many places in Asia to go, such as Malaysia or Indonesia. Hindus, on the other hand, have only India, and so they and other minorities should receive priority for citizenship. Modi\u2019s critics, on the other hand, believe the law is in line with the prime minister\u2019s vision of India as an inherently Hindu nation. The roots of this dispute go back to India\u2019s founding: the country\u2019s first leaders established it as a secular republic over the strident objections of Hindu nationalists. For more than 70 years the religious nationalists have fought to fix what they perceive to be these early errors. Since Modi\u2019s decisive re-election in May, several items on the Hindu nationalist wishlist have been rammed through, including in August the effective annexation of Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region that lobbied for decades for independence and fought an armed insurgency \u2013 fuelled by Pakistani guns, men and money \u2013 against Delhi\u2019s forces for more than 30 years. How significant are this week\u2019s protests? India is a diverse country and there have been regular protests against various Modi policies in the past six years. But these latest demonstrations are the largest of his tenure and represent a rare instance of anti-Modi forces putting their vast differences aside and rallying around a single cause: the exclusionary citizenship bill. Modi\u2019s government is clearly rattled: it has shut down internet access, including in the capital, Delhi, and passed orders to prohibit protests in many places, including the entire state of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 which has a population of more than 200 million. But the government\u2019s efforts to suppress dissent are so far having the opposite effect, adding to the claims of its opponents that Modi has no respect for civil liberties and is trying to fundamentally alter a country that prides itself on being a raucous, vibrant democracy.",

      "bodyText": "The slick marketing website for Reliance House boasts a timeless building near Liverpool\u2019s vibrant waterfront \u201creimagined for modern living\u201d. The swanky apartments are furnished with wooden floors and sleek built-in storage (a one-bedroom flat is on the market for \u00a3114,950). But the website does not mention that five of the flats in the basement have no windows, while two more only have high level windows at street level. The plans from the developer, Legacie Developments, however reveal that many of those living below ground in the \u00a324m project will have to survive with little or no natural light. Liverpool\u2019s planners were unable to consider the lack of natural light as the project did not go through the usual approval process for new dwellings in the north-west city. Instead it was fast-tracked under controversial reforms, which allow developers to use so-called \u201cpermitted development rights\u201d to convert offices to flats without full planning permission. These changes were brought in by ministers to boost housing numbers in 2013 but are now subject to a government review amid concerns they have led to a flurry of poor-quality office to residential conversions across the country. Julia Park, head of housing research at architects Levitt Bernstein, says developers are taking advantage of the lack of controls to build flats in basements for which they would not have received permission in the past. \u201cDaylight and space are the two most obvious victims of permitted development rights,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that any planning authority would allow either a conversion or a new home to go ahead without a window to each habitable room or at least a roof light.\u201d Lack of natural light can have serious implications for those living below ground. The government\u2019s housing health rating system, which determines the standards demanded by housing officers, warns inadequate natural light poses a threat to physical and mental health. Sunlight is also known to boost vitamin D, which helps prevent bone loss and reduces the likelihood of various diseases. \u201cI haven\u2019t met anyone who thinks that a home without daylight is acceptable \u2013 we all know that it\u2019s essential to our health and wellbeing,\u201d says Park. \u201cHaving a view out \u2013 a visual connection with the outside world \u2013 is also really important. However smart these flats are, they are likely to increase the risk of isolation and depression.\u201d For experienced planners, windowless flats are anathema. Hugh Ellis, head of policy at the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), says the window-free flats in Reliance House should never have been built: \u201cDwellings of any kind without natural light should not be allowed under any circumstances.\u201d Legacie Developments said it would not be commenting on the claims by the TCPA. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing to say. We can\u2019t comment on that,\u201d said a spokesperson for the company. These flats are just some of the estimated 65,000 new dwellings that have been created by turning offices into residential accommodation since 2013. A sample of more than 550 developments analysed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) last year found 70% did not meet space standards. Some of these are in basements, where natural light cannot penetrate and the outside world is rarely glimpsed. Ellis from the TCPA warns that we are currently building the slums of tomorrow. \u201cAll sorts of unsuitable buildings including basements are being converted into housing right now,\u201d he says. \u201cDevelopers are trying to cram people into small, dark places, which is symptomatic of a much wider failure to provide the kind of decent housing that we need.\u201d Two hundred fifty miles away in Croydon, Kaisha Hance glances up towards the blur of legs drifting past the grimy, barred window at the far end of the narrow basement room she shares with her two young sons in the centre of Croydon. \u201cIt feels almost like prison - it really does,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are bars on the window. The glass is frosted. It\u2019s dull in here all of the time.\u201d The 24-year-old and her two children, aged six and four, were placed in 3 Church Road \u2013 a former office block carved up into 32 tiny studio flats by developer Church Road Croydon Limited - by Croydon council in April.

      "bodyText": "A Canadian judge is set to determine the fate of Joshua Boyle, the former hostage who spent five years in Afghanistan with his family and stands accused of sexually assaulting his estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman. The Ontario superior court justice Peter Doody will rule on Thursday on the 19 charges against Boyle, including assault with a weapon and forcible confinement. In doing so, Doody will also weigh the credibility of competing testimony from Coleman and Boyle, who have provided starkly different accounts of their time in Ottawa, where the alleged crimes are said to have occurred. In 2012, then newlyweds Boyle and Coleman travelled to Afghanistan, where they were kidnapped by a Taliban-linked group shortly after arriving in the restive country. They spent five years in captivity, during which time Coleman gave birth to three children, and were eventually freed by Pakistani soldiers in 2017. Soon after, they returned to Canada, where crown prosecutors allege Boyle abused Coleman. \u201cMr Boyle manipulated [Coleman], exercised control over her, imposed his will on her and instilled fear in her,\u201d the prosecutor Jason Neubauer said during closing arguments in September. \u201cHe did this through emotional and physical abuse \u2013 demeaning her and striking her.\u201d Coleman traveled from her home in Pennsylvania to Ottawa for the judge-only trial. She testified from a separate room in the court to avoid sharing a room with her estranged husband. In addition to instances of sexual assault, Coleman described a list of demands created by Boyle, dictating her behaviour, diet, exercise and frequency of sex. She claims she was punished physically if she failed meet the expectations laid out in the list. \u201cIn the past, he made it clear he didn\u2019t feel any guilt hurting me,\u201d she told the court. Coleman also recounted a harrowing late-night escape, fearing for her life as she ran from the couple\u2019s apartment into a \u201cdangerously cold\u201d Ottawa winter, wearing only socks on her feet. \u201cIt took me a while to get up my courage to do it. But I did,\u201d she told the court. Coleman told the court how she took shelter at a nearby pizza shop, and phoned her mother, who was in town visiting, for help. Boyle was arrested later that night. Boyle\u2019s defence team pushed back at the crown\u2019s portrayal of their client. \u201cMr Boyle is not easy to like. He is not conventional \u2026 by society\u2019s so-called \u2018norms\u2019,\u201d said the defence lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon. \u201cBut he is a person who tells the truth, even if it\u2019s not to his own advantage.\u201d Boyle has admitted to criticizing his wife, fighting often and striking her once while the two were in captivity, but rejected accusations this behaviour carried over to their life in Ottawa. Boyle told the court that the couple had a turbulent relationship, that they participated in BDSM and that Coleman\u2019s \u201ctempestuous personality\u201d affected her ability to accurately recall events, with his legal team suggesting Coleman\u2019s testimony was \u201cneither credible nor reliable\u201d. He also claimed that he had only restrained Coleman was for her own safety, fearing she might be suicidal. \u201cThere is no eyewitness or physical evidence to corroborate any of the 19 charges [against Boyle],\u201d said Greenspon, suggesting Coleman had provided testimony that had only \u201cmild corroboration\u201d. The trial was initially expected to only last weeks, but was delayed by a handful of procedural questions \u2013 including debate over how much of Coleman\u2019s sexual history would be admissible as evidence.

She is still reeling from it all. \u201cI feel extremely grateful and proud and every adjective I can come up with to describe the way I feel about this year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Facing public pressure to rein in its pollution, a Japanese chemical manufacturer has instead launched an aggressive, years-long campaign to undermine the science showing that its compounds could cause cancer, according to newly released documents reviewed by the Guardian. Chloroprene, the primary constituent of the synthetic rubber neoprene, is the major air pollutant in the town of Reserve, Louisiana, an area which according to the Environment Protection Agency has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxins anywhere in the US. The town, and the chemicals plant operated by Denka Performance Elastomer, is the subject of a year-long Guardian reporting project, Cancer Town. Robert Taylor, director of the Concerned Citizens of St John \u2013 the community group leading the fight for clean air in the town \u2013 said a reversal of the EPA classification would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for his fellow residents. \u201cI think it\u2019s very audacious of them to challenge all of this work that the government has done. To me it\u2019s indicative of how callous these people are and how they really just don\u2019t care about the people here,\u201d Taylor, who has numerous relatives that have died of cancer he blames on the plant, said. \u201cIf they are successful it would leave us at the mercy of this plant.\u201d In 2010, the EPA concluded an extensive, independent, peer-reviewed assessment of chloroprene which found that the compound was \u201clikely to be carcinogenic to humans\u201d. The federal government has recommended a maximum level of chloroprene humans should inhale over a lifetime as 0.2 micrograms a cubic metre. The agency, however, doesn\u2019t enforce its guidelines. For years Denka has been quietly fighting to discount the underlying science that proves chloroprene is a dangerous carcinogen even in low amounts. Denka argues that lifetime chloroprene exposure levels could be 156 times higher than what the EPA has determined and that the chemical shouldn\u2019t be considered a likely carcinogen. A series of documents, shared with the Guardian and released to lawyers for Reserve residents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), shows the company and its contractors have pursued EPA scientists and pushed them to accept their own new modeling, which Denka has offered multiple new peer-reviewed studies to try to bolster. Emails show EPA officials resisting Denka\u2019s efforts. A spokesman for Denka said the company is \u201cdedicated to sound science\u201d and stated it has \u201cworked collaboratively with EPA to seek EPA\u2019s reconsideration of the faulty science\u201d underlying the 2010 classification. The plant, named the Pontchartrain Works facility, was built by the US chemicals giant DuPont in the mid-1960s, and began producing neoprene in 1968. DuPont sold the facility to Denka in 2015, shortly before the EPA found that a census tract next door to the plant had a cancer risk rate 5o times the national average. Denka\u2019s campaign began shortly after Donald Trump won election and just days before he took office, with an \u201curgent\u201d memo to the presidential transition team on 17 January 2017, accusing EPA of \u201cusing faulty and highly inflated risk data\u201d. The company said the EPA\u2019s findings about the dangers of chloroprene would hurt its bottom line, according to another set of public records obtained by the Sierra Club under the FOIA. \u201cThese studies will result in unwarranted compliance costs that pose a direct threat to [Denka\u2019s] ability to keep its facility open and to keep jobs in Louisiana,\u201d Denka said. A Denka spokesman pointed to the $35m spent by the company to install emissions controls in recent years. The company said these installations have reduced chloroprene emissions by 86%, but it has been challenged on this claim by the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ).

We know. It seems difficult to believe it has only been a few weeks since prime minister Boris Johnson prorogued parliament, then recalled parliament when that was found to be illegal, then prorogued it again so that he could have a Queen's speech announcing a slate of legislation, then called a general election and scrapped it all. , 2:D - We're not saying that the monarch is unamused about being dragged out to do this twice in the space of a few weeks, but according to the parliament.uk website all of these elements will be missing today because of the \"unique circumstances of the general election and the proximity to Christmas\", which sounds like a diplomatic way to say \"Don't take the piss. We are phoning this one in.\", 3:B - Yes, the Queen has her own personal entrance to the palace of Westminster. Handy that, eh?, 4:D - \"The government\" write the speech. It normally lists the bills they are planning to present during the parliamentary session, although there is nothing that obliges them to stick to the list. The Queen doesn't get a say in what she is going to read out, although she can pull a slightly frowny face if they are planning something she isn't keen on, 5:C - This is all supposed to symbolise that the Commons is independent from the monarch. And Dennis Skinner won't be making any quips in the chamber this year, he lost his seat in the election last week. Odds on that at least one wacky MP will shout something out in his place though, trying to be the new Skinner, and that this will become a tradition that is part of the British Constitution and by 2150 is called \"Quipping The Skinner\" or something equally ridiculous, 6:A - Sarah Clarke assumed the role in February 2018 and is the first woman to hold the office, which dates back to the 1360s, 7:A - In another symbolic representation that the commons is independent of the monarch, the first bill they present is traditionally The Outlawries Bill, which has not been included in the Queen's speech. The bill never progresses further than this reading. In the Lords they do a similar thing, but with the Select Vestries Bill, 8:B - Like a glorified best man's speech, the humble address appears to be absolutely hilarious to MPs in the chamber, but quite perplexing to anyone who hasn't been involved in any of the in-jokes going round the bars in the Commons for the previous five years, 9:C - The Queen did not attend in 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Edward. Instead the Speech was read by one of the Lords Commissioners, 10:D - The monarch's body guards do this. To be honest there's only been one instance of gunpowder being hidden under parliament in the last 414 years so it seems like overkill but then we guess you can't be too careful these days, 11:A - It's true. The ritual dates from the time of Charles I, who didn't exactly have a great time with his parliaments. Possibly this year they could kidnap someone like Philip Davies or John Redwood and keep them? Just a thought, 12:A - It was more of a comment than a question really</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"4\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Well done.

Many of us who loathe him would like nothing more than to see him removed from office. Yet as the Democrats move forward on charges of obstruction and abuse of power, it does not feel like the triumph of righteousness that it should.</p> <p>Perhaps this is in part because Trump is not being charged for his most serious actual crimes. Like Al Capone being brought down by tax evasion charges, Trump is facing impeachment for one of the least consequential bad acts of his career. The string of alleged sexual assaults?

These crimes will go uncharged and unpunished. Instead, Congress\u2019s focus is entirely on the question of whether Trump unethically pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hunter-biden-life-scandals-ukraine-involvement-with-trump-giuliani-2019-9\">ne\u2019er-do-well son</a>. It\u2019s an issue. But given the number of terrible things Trump has done, does it deserve this level of disproportionate focus?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/18/trump-impeachment-why-it-matters\">Impeachment won't force Trump out of office. But it matters for our republic | Andrew Gawthorpe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Democrats\u2019 outrage over the Ukraine scandal feels a little contrived. Would they have been calling so vehemently for impeachment if Barack Obama had pressured another country\u2019s government to investigate one of Trump\u2019s sons\u2019 shady dealings? Republicans are correct when they say that the impeachment is \u201cpolitically\u201d motivated and is about trying to remove a president from office who they never liked in the first place. It is, and it should be. Some \u201cpolitical\u201d acts are beyond the pale, and every procedural weapon should be utilized in trying to remove a president from office if they are using that office to despoil the earth and terrorize civilians at home and abroad.</p> <p>A satisfying set of impeachment articles, then, would list the various ways in which Trump has put the future of humanity at risk, and the urgent need to remove him in order to secure peace and a stable planet. But Democrats are not willing to be that confrontational and political (and of course, if they start calling drone strikes and deportation crimes, it will be easy to point out that they did it first). So Ukraine it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f42c40c1eaa4efcafe8623595f27e818f5a1372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f42c40c1eaa4efcafe8623595f27e818f5a1372/0_358_5523_3315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"congress\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The underlying issues do not affect the material wellbeing of working-class Americans in any noticeable way.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One also senses that this impeachment carnival may be exactly the sort of thing Trump wants. He knows that he\u2019s not actually going to be removed from office, thanks to the protection of Republicans in the Senate. Now he has the opportunity to portray himself as a persecuted victim, and to accuse the Democrats of being \u201csore losers\u201d who refuse to accept his legitimacy and are using underhanded means to try to remove him. He will use this impeachment to rally his supporters, telling them that Democrats do not respect the will of the people and want to undo it. (This is precisely what Boris Johnson told British voters about attempts to undo the Brexit referendum, and it proved very successful for him.)</p> <p>On the one hand, impeaching Donald Trump seems like a no-brainer: the man almost defines \u201cunfit for office\u201d and the list of possible \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is endless. On the other hand, impeaching Trump creates a spectacle that voters might not care too much about. The underlying issues do not affect the material wellbeing of working-class Americans in any noticeable way, and not many people are emotionally invested in protecting the reputations of Joe and Hunter Biden. Every moment spent discussing impeachment is a moment not spent discussing healthcare, educational inequity, the black-white wealth gap, the sprawling prison system, the surveillance state, the opioid epidemic, the hollowing out of industrial towns, and the country\u2019s appalling treatment of immigrants. The easy reply is that it\u2019s possible to \u201cdo both\u201d, but time and energy are zero-sum: you have to pick and choose what you focus on. Trump would probably love a 2020 election cycle dominated by the impeachment issue, because it relieves him from having to defend his appalling record.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One can see impeachment as a symptom of the continuing failure of the Democratic party to articulate a substantive agenda</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One can even see impeachment as a symptom of the continuing failure of the Democratic party to articulate a substantive agenda. Democrats in 2016 focused excessively on Trump\u2019s personal attributes rather than giving disaffected voters a real reason to go to the polls. Now, they\u2019re doing it again: instead of telling people what the Democratic party stands for and why it would be good for the country, they are obsessed with the figure of Donald Trump, and define themselves in opposition to him.

      "bodyText": "There is something unsatisfying about the impeachment of Donald Trump. Many of us who loathe him would like nothing more than to see him removed from office. Yet as the Democrats move forward on charges of obstruction and abuse of power, it does not feel like the triumph of righteousness that it should. Perhaps this is in part because Trump is not being charged for his most serious actual crimes. Like Al Capone being brought down by tax evasion charges, Trump is facing impeachment for one of the least consequential bad acts of his career. The string of alleged sexual assaults? Deporting desperate migrants to their deaths? Destroying the possibility of preventing catastrophic climate change? Causing thousands of deaths by rescinding environmental rules and then covering up the human toll? Escalating drone strikes and then hiding the civilian deaths? These crimes will go uncharged and unpunished. Instead, Congress\u2019s focus is entirely on the question of whether Trump unethically pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his ne\u2019er-do-well son. It\u2019s an issue. But given the number of terrible things Trump has done, does it deserve this level of disproportionate focus? The Democrats\u2019 outrage over the Ukraine scandal feels a little contrived. Would they have been calling so vehemently for impeachment if Barack Obama had pressured another country\u2019s government to investigate one of Trump\u2019s sons\u2019 shady dealings? Republicans are correct when they say that the impeachment is \u201cpolitically\u201d motivated and is about trying to remove a president from office who they never liked in the first place. It is, and it should be. Some \u201cpolitical\u201d acts are beyond the pale, and every procedural weapon should be utilized in trying to remove a president from office if they are using that office to despoil the earth and terrorize civilians at home and abroad. A satisfying set of impeachment articles, then, would list the various ways in which Trump has put the future of humanity at risk, and the urgent need to remove him in order to secure peace and a stable planet. But Democrats are not willing to be that confrontational and political (and of course, if they start calling drone strikes and deportation crimes, it will be easy to point out that they did it first). So Ukraine it is. One also senses that this impeachment carnival may be exactly the sort of thing Trump wants. He knows that he\u2019s not actually going to be removed from office, thanks to the protection of Republicans in the Senate. Now he has the opportunity to portray himself as a persecuted victim, and to accuse the Democrats of being \u201csore losers\u201d who refuse to accept his legitimacy and are using underhanded means to try to remove him. He will use this impeachment to rally his supporters, telling them that Democrats do not respect the will of the people and want to undo it. (This is precisely what Boris Johnson told British voters about attempts to undo the Brexit referendum, and it proved very successful for him.) On the one hand, impeaching Donald Trump seems like a no-brainer: the man almost defines \u201cunfit for office\u201d and the list of possible \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is endless. On the other hand, impeaching Trump creates a spectacle that voters might not care too much about. The underlying issues do not affect the material wellbeing of working-class Americans in any noticeable way, and not many people are emotionally invested in protecting the reputations of Joe and Hunter Biden. Every moment spent discussing impeachment is a moment not spent discussing healthcare, educational inequity, the black-white wealth gap, the sprawling prison system, the surveillance state, the opioid epidemic, the hollowing out of industrial towns, and the country\u2019s appalling treatment of immigrants. The easy reply is that it\u2019s possible to \u201cdo both\u201d, but time and energy are zero-sum: you have to pick and choose what you focus on. Trump would probably love a 2020 election cycle dominated by the impeachment issue, because it relieves him from having to defend his appalling record. One can even see impeachment as a symptom of the continuing failure of the Democratic party to articulate a substantive agenda. Democrats in 2016 focused excessively on Trump\u2019s personal attributes rather than giving disaffected voters a real reason to go to the polls. Now, they\u2019re doing it again: instead of telling people what the Democratic party stands for and why it would be good for the country, they are obsessed with the figure of Donald Trump, and define themselves in opposition to him. Joe Biden\u2019s entire campaign is centered around a promise to restore honor to the White House and purge it of the \u201cmalarkey\u201d. But when Trump dominates every discussion, we lose sight of the actual human stakes of politics. In Jacobin, Doug Henwood asks an important question: what is impeachment for?

      "bodyText": "We will leave our live coverage of the bushfire crisis here for tonight. This is what happened today: About 20 structures have been destroyed in the Balmoral and Bargo area, according to official \u2013 and conservative \u2013 RFS estimates. There are unconfirmed reports of a house being destroyed at Bilpin from the Gospers Mountain fire, and fears that the actual number of homes lost near Balmoral and Bargo will be much higher. Fires are currently threatening lives and homes in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. Emergency warnings remain in place for Gospers Mountain, around Bilpin, and Green Wattle Creek Fire, around Balmoral and Bargo. That Gospers Mountain fire has crossed Bells Line of Road again, circumventing a 7km containment line. The estimated area is 417,000ha. Three firefighters are recovering in hospital after being burned near Bargo. Australia broke its one-day-old record for its hottest ever day. The average maximum temperature on Wednesday was 41.9C \u2013 that\u2019s a full degree warmer than the previous record for Australia\u2019s warmest ever day, which was set on Tuesday. What we can expect for tomorrow. South Australia is at the greatest risk of horrific bushfires tomorrow. A fire danger rating of catastrophic has been issued for SIX of its 15 fire regions. Those regions are the Lower Eyre Peninsula, the Mid North, Mount Lofty Ranges, Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island and Lower South East. The Wimmera and South West regions of Victoria will have extreme fire conditions tomorrow. Melbourne is forecast to have its hottest ever December day, with a maximum of 44C. New South Wales will have a slight respite from the heat tomorrow, before very bad fire conditions on Saturday. Extreme fire conditions are forecast for the Greater Hunter, Greater Sydney Region, Southern Ranges, Central Ranges, and Illawarra/Shoalhaven. That\u2019s all the areas where fires are currently burning. Where to go for information in the mean time: If you\u2019re in NSW: www.rfs.nsw.gov.au If you\u2019re in SA: www.cfs.sa.gov.au If you\u2019re in Victoria: www.emergency.vic.gov.au If you\u2019re in Queensland: www.qfes.qld.gov.au Stay safe, and we will see you in the morning. What a difference a day makes. These photos are from Lithgow. Yesterday: Today: Updated emergency warning for the Gospers Mountain fire, which is now 417,000ha in size. Both the Springvale coalmine and the Mount Piper power station on the western edge of the Blue Mountains, under threat from the Gospers Mountain megafire, remain unburned. The ABC has reported that the Springvale mine was surrounded by fire last night but firefighters managed to hold back the flames. There was reportedly fire across the road from the Mount Piper power station today but again they didn\u2019t get close. The Channel Seven helicopter is flying over Buxton, hit by the Green Wattle Creek fire today. Tahmoor coalmine evacuated About 100 workers were evacuated from the Tahmoor coking mine, which is under threat from the Green Wattle Creek fire today. The call to evacuate the underground mine came at 1pm, a spokesman for the company said. They have not had any updates since. Mine management is working with the RFS on the protection of the site. In 2015, a bushfire spread into the Hazelwood coalmine in Victoria\u2019s Latrobe Valley. The coal burned for 45 days, and the operators of the Hazelwood power station were last month found guilty of 10 WorkSafe offences for failing to adequately prepare for the fire. But, Tahmoor operator SIMEC Mining was at pains to point out, Hazelwood is an open-cut coalmine while they are underground, so the risk profile is different. I just spoke to the RFS, who say that their current estimate for fires damaged in the Green Wattle Creek fire near Balmoral and Bargo today is \u201cup to 20 structures.\u201d Earlier, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said 20 properties were confirmed lost and another 20 were unconfirmed. There has been a bit of misinterpretation, says the RFS. They will not be able to do a proper damage assessment until the fire is no longer active in the area, which could be several days. That figure of 20 structures is conservative, but that\u2019s the official figure. Queensland Police have revoked the emergency declaration which was in place around the Gregory River fire, southeast of Bundaberg. It had been in place since Monday afternoon. So, that\u2019s one bit of good news. Angus Taylor will not discuss police investigation Angus Taylor told ABC24 it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d for him to comment on a police investigation into a doctored document used by his office to justify a political attack on the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore. Labor referred the matter to NSW police last month. Taylor: I really haven\u2019t got any further comment to make. I\u2019ve made a statement in the Parliament and that\u2019s - that\u2019s all I can do at this point. ABC presenter Karina Carvalho pointed out that, actually, Taylor can comment unless charges have been laid and it will be subject to a trial by jury. That\u2019s when the contempt period would begin. Taylor again: Well, as I say, as I say, there\u2019s ongoing inquiries here and I\u2019m not going to make any further comment. I\u2019ve made a very clear statement on this in the parliament, an unambiguous statement and I stand by that statement. I haven\u2019t really got anymore to add. You can ask the question lots of different ways \u2013 I\u2019ll give you the same answer. Taylor\u2019s statement in parliament left many questions unanswered, as Christopher Knaus explained here. PM is \u2018pretty well connected\u2019, says Angus Taylor Angus Taylor told ABC24 he had been in touch with prime minister Scott Morrison, who is on holidays, and he is \u201cpretty well connected about what\u2019s gone on.\u201d Taylor: I\u2019m not convinced he\u2019s having a very significant holiday right now. He\u2019s working very hard to make sure that communities are well supported. Should the PM come home? That\u2019s a question Morrison will answer, says Taylor. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s coming home ... He\u2019s coming home soon anyway. He\u2019s finishing up his holiday this week. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has just done an interview with ABC24 from the Picton Bowling Club, which is in his electorate and an evacuation point for the Green Wattle Creek fire. About 250 people are at the evacuation point, Taylor says. Emergency messages were sent out after the fire jumped containment lines. This is a community that went through dreadful bushfires back in 2013 and it really does band together ... They unite in these situations of adversity. We\u2019re still waiting to see what damage there has been and, in particular, how the fire is continuing the progress at the moment. Taylor said the RFS units in his electorate had been \u201chard at it for weeks\u201d. Asked if Australia was doing enough to combat climate change, given that Australia has just had its two hottest days ever and is currently on fire, Taylor said there have been fires since he was a kid. Taylor: When we have fires the great thing we\u2019ve done, since I was a kid, is we unite. It is very, very important that we unite behind communities like this one in Wollondilly. People want that support. They give each that support. That\u2019s the most important thing we can do at times like this. Yes, but what about the emissions? I\u2019m obviously extremely conscious of Australia doing its bit on emissions. I\u2019ve just been in Spain telling other delegates, telling other delegations about the work that Australia has done. We\u2019ve beaten our 2012 targets. We\u2019re well over expectation on our 2020 targets, almost a year\u2019s worth of emissions reductions and we\u2019ve laid out exactly how we\u2019ll achieve, meet and beat our 2030 targets. We\u2019ll keep striving to do that. That\u2019s our bit we\u2019ve got to do. Taylor\u2019s positive account of his contribution at COP25, and Australia\u2019s contribution to emissions reduction more generally, does not accord with that of the other attendees, who accused Australia of \u201ccheating\u201d. You can read environment editor Adam Morton\u2019s account of it here. Property loss revised down to 20 The ABC has just reported that the actual number of houses destroyed today is 20, not up to 40. Earlier, Gladys Berejiklian said that there were 20 homes confirmed destroyed and 20 unconfirmed, but it seems there was some misinterpretation there. We are seeking confirmation from the RFS. Updated emergency warning for Green Wattle Creek Fire activity is increasing on the eastern edge of the Bargo State Conservation Area, where up to 40 homes have already been destroyed today. Residents at Nattai, Pheasants Nest, Buxton, Couridjah, Thirlmere, Tahmoor, Bargo and Yanderra have been told to shelter from the fire because it is too late to leave. The RFS is reporting dangerous fire conditions across the fire ground with \u201ceratic fire behaviour\u201d. Properties are currently under threat. The loss of up to 40 properties today takes the total number of homes lost in NSW since the fire season began to 800. As of 5.30pm there are 106 fires burning in NSW, exactly half of which are not contained. Two \u2014 Gospers Mountain and Green Wattle Creek fires \u2014 are at emergency warning level. There are 2,500 firefighters in the field. Firefighters\u2019 homes are among those lost. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told the ABC that the properties lost were on the eastern edge of the Green Wattle Creek fire, mainly in the communities of Balmoral and Buxton. That has been one of the most active areas of bushfire today. The firefighters who are in hospital receiving treatments for burns this afternoon were fighting in that region, in Bargo. Berejiklian described the loss of homes as \u201ctragic\u201d. Reports are that some of those homes that have been lost are actually homes of firefighters \u2014 people who\u2019ve given up their own personal safety to go and support others in the community. Our heart goes out to those people who\u2019ve lost their homes but also, in particular, to the firefighters who\u2019ve been injured. Asked if she had requested any more resources or funding from the federal government to deal with the bushfire crisis, Berejiklian said: The New South Wales emergency personnel resources have everything they need to keep the community safe. But what concerns us today, and even worse on Saturday, is the unpredictable nature of the weather, the turbulent winds. Hotter, dryer temperatures have meant that the embers and the spot fires can actually travel for a long distances and cause very unpredictable fire fronts. Twenty homes have been confirmed destroyed in the Green Wattle Creek fire today and another 20 are unconfirmed, says NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. South Australia will be under a statewide total fire ban again tomorrow. Updated emergency warning: Bilpin under threat The RFS have issued an updated emergency warning for the Gospers Mountain fire. Fire activity has increased around Bilpin, Mt Wilson, Mt Irvine and Itchenstoke. It\u2019s too late to leave. I just spoke to Kazan Brown, who lives at Warragamba. It is one of the communities under threat from the Green Wattle Creek fire. There is ash falling in her backyard, says Brown, but it has been doing that since the fire first started three weeks ago. Brown and her family have lived at Warragamba forever, and have fronted a campaign against a proposal to raise the dam wall. They\u2019re Gundungurra, this is their country. And it\u2019s on fire. A lot of important sites where there is rock art \u2014 the fires just went through them.... There will be scar trees that won\u2019t survive. Thanks for your time today on the live blog. Calla Wahlquist will be taking over for now. I\u2019ll leave you with this photo from Thirlmere, showing the sights people are coming home to this evening. Shocking footage showing the devastation at Bargo, NSW. More footage has emerged from the climate protest outside Scott Morrison\u2019s Sydney prime ministerial residence, where NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge was arrested today. This young girl was also issued with a move-on order, according to Twitter user @RivOMac. The protestors had vowed to \u201ccamp-out\u201d at the residence until Morrison returns from leave on Monday. Two firefighters have received serious burns after their five-person crew was \u201cenveloped\u201d by a rapidly growing blaze near Bargo, NSW, today. The two men were intubated and airlifted to hospital, while another female firefighter was evacuated by road ambulance to be treated for burns and smoke inhalation. Two fires are still burning at \u201cemergency\u201d level, at Gospers Mountain and Green Wattle Creek. Three are at \u201cwatch and act\u201d and more than 60 fires are currently at advice level. Conditions are expected to improve tomorrow, but many areas are expected to remain at severe or very high fire danger. While a cool change is sweeping across the state, NSW remains drenched in ash, with the majority of monitoring stations reaching \u201chazardous\u201d air quality levels today. Australia has for two days running now beaten the record for \u201chottest day\u201d, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9C on Wednesday. Despite the fire danger easing off tomorrow, it is still listed as \u201csevere\u201d for the Central Ranges and \u201cvery high\u201d for the Southern Ranges, Northern Slopes and North Western and Southern Slopes. Australia\u2019s record for its hottest day has tumbled for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9C on Wednesday, the Bureau of Meteorology has just confirmed. The previous record of 40.9C was set just a day earlier, on Tuesday, beating the previous 40.3C mark set on 7 January 2013. The hottest individual December day at any location was also broken on Thursday, when Eucla, in south-east Western Australia hit 49.8C. The Nullarbor came in second place at 49.7C. Dr Karl Braganza, manager of climate monitoring at the bureau, told Guardian Australia: \u2018Clearly we have background warming that has impacted Australia. The frequency we are setting high temperature records greatly exceeds the setting of cold records. It is clear that climate change has contributed to setting records of this type. \u2018It is typical for records like these to fall in a bunch because of the way heatwaves progress along the continent. The heat builds over the central west.\u2019 To calculate the record, the bureau takes about 700 observations from weather stations across the continent and places them on a grid and then calculates the average. Those calculations are then cross-checked with a reference network of 100 stations, known as ACORN-SAT, and \u201cif they line up, that gives us confidence\u201d added Braganza. The previous December record for Australia was Birdsville, that reached 49.5C on 24 December 1972. People across NSW will be holding their breath as they leave the office this afternoon, with air quality around Sydney extremely poor. The most recent figures from Air Quality Index Data from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage shows all but three regions of NSW currently have reached poor or hazardous air quality. In Sydney alone, every monitoring station reached \u201chazardous\u201d levels just after lunch today. Fitzsimmons has also warned that Saturday could be worse. Today, he says, conditions have shaped up to be as bad as he feared. \u201cDown the south coast, we saw weather stations registering extreme fire danger ratings with a combination of high 30s, low 40 temperatures and strong westerlies. That was at 10am. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see that sort of environment unfolding Saturday when the temperatures and strong winds from the west will be dominant from 9am or 10am in the morning and this will sustained for 10-15 hours. Saturday will be a very, very difficult day.\u201d Replacement crews \u2013 from interstate but also from the US and Canada \u2013 are scheduled to arrive on the scene on Saturday, and help the RFS battle the blazes. The fires that \u201cenveloped\u201d a crew of five firefighters today switched from metre-high blazes to towering infernos too quickly to escape, according to RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. \u201cI have had field reports from out there that very quickly they saw lots of fire activity from metre-high flame heights, to flames burning through the tops of trees and canopy burning, crowning fires, under very strong winds,\u201d Fitzsimmons says. \u201cIt was very volatile, very dynamic and, unfortunately, emblematic of much of the fire behaviour we\u2019ve seen, under the hot, dry, windy conditions.\u201d The \u201cdozens\u201d of homes lost that comissioner Fitzsimmons referred to are mostly around Bargo in the Wollondilly shire. Of that, some are the homes of firefighters themselves, who were out today at other firegrounds. There is \u201cquite a considerable amount of property being impacted\u201d, Fitzsimmons told reporters. People\u2019s homes, businesses, and even poultry farming operations in the area could be affected, he says. He says the firefighters who lost their homes are \u201cabsolutely shattered\u201d . \u201cThey\u2019re devastated by loss no matter what, but it just goes that little further when it\u2019s your own home, or the colleague you\u2019ve got sitting on the fire truck next to you, having lost their home, while they\u2019re out saving others. \u201cSo it\u2019s a tough afternoon. It will be another very emotional, very draining day for our firefighters.\u201d The Rural Fire Service, the defence force and search-and-rescue teams have been mobilised to rescue people in the small NSW town of Itchenstoke, according to RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Itchenstoke, north of Bilpin, on the Bells Line of Road, became isolated today when fire cut off the only road in and out of the town. \u201cThe advice [to people in the town] was to shelter in place as the fire approaches,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cSome of our aircraft, particularly working with our defence force with the search and rescue teams ... were [then] touching down in that area and helping to extract a few people that wanted to be relocated out of that vicinity and that was safely done as I understand it.\u201d \u201cDozens\u201d of structures, including homes, have been lost in the fires today, according to RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. \u201cThere are lots of buildings including people\u2019s homes and livelihoods that are being impacted by this fire this afternoon,\u201d he has told a press briefing. The cool change bringing relief to many in NSW this afternoon is increasing the danger. \u201cYou get increased volatility, erratic fire behaviour and you get dramatic changes in fire intensity and fire spread. It\u2019s still a very difficult set of circumstances in around the fire ground both for firefighters, emergency services and also for the communities in and around that area being impacted,\u201d he said. It looks like we\u2019re getting a white Christmas, but not one we would ever have wished for. Three firefighters have been seriously injured in NSW today, with two airlifted for emergency treatment. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said a crew of five was overrun by fire near the Bargo area, with a number of crew members suffering serious burn injuries. \u201cMy advice is that the crews were operating and this particular crew, a crew of five, were overrun by fire. Enveloped by fire.\u201d \u201cThey were first treated by their Fire and Rescue counterparts who were close by with first aid before being transported to the local showground, where ambulance paramedics arrived on scene to triage and treat and assess the injuries,\u201d he said. Two members of the crew received airway burns and needed to be intubated to protect their breathing, he said. A 36-year-old and 56-year-old male were airlifted from the scene with serious facial and airway burns, and burns to other parts of their bodies including their arms, elbow, upper chest and a leg. A female was also treated for smoke inhalation and superficial burns and was taken to hospital by road ambulance. There are currently 50 fires uncontained in NSW, with a number at emergency level. NSW RFS are on patrol at the Hawkesbury River. The cool change has reached the Illawarra region, and there is not long to wait for relief from the heat for greater Sydney, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. The Hume Highway has now been closed between Campbelltown and Mittagong due to the Green Wattle Creek fire. Footage of the Gospers Mountain fire showing the scale of the fire front. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge has been arrested at the Sydney climate protest. Shoebridge told Guardian Australia that he was at the rally to show solidarity with the student protestors, but had been attempting to comply with a NSW police move-on order when \u201cthey cut me off, arrested me and put me in the back of a paddy wagon\u201d. \u201cIt was all very unnecessary and a complete waste of police and court time, and obviously we\u2019ll be defending it,\u201d he said. Shoebridge described a chaotic scene at the protest, as police attempted to issue mass move-on notices via loudhailer, but were shouted down by protestors. \u201cThen they [the riot squad] came in as a kind of phalanx and started singling out individuals and issuing them with single move-on directions,\u201d he said. Australia has reached \u201cDevil\u2019s armpit\u201d level on the heat map, according to cartoonist Glen Le Lievre. The RFS is emphasising the risk posed by a southerly wind change this afternoon, with Bargo likely to be quickly moved into the fire\u2019s path. Accused \u201craving inner-city lunatic\u201d (see below) and leader of the Australian Greens, Dr Richard Di Natale, has released a statement today calling for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to convene an emergency meeting to address the fires. His statement calls on the PM to do the following: Commit to convening an emergency summit with the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action to discuss improving how we prepare for and resource bushfire emergencies in a changed climate. Meet with the presidents of medical colleges who have called the current crisis a public health emergency. Convene an urgent cross-party forum with the leaders of the main political parties to find a way forward on climate policy, similar to that implemented by John Howard in response to the Port Arthur tragedy. An emergency warning has been released for Gospers Mountain. It is now too late to leave. Local incident commander for the Rural Fire Service David Stimpson has urged motorists to stay off the roads in the Green Wattle Fire zone. \u201cStay off. I don\u2019t think I can be any more stern than that. The situation is that some people may have to move, and I would say only move if it\u2019s absolutely necessary, otherwise stay where you are,\u201d he told the ABC. He was responding to reports from locals that roads were becoming heavily congested from Picton towards the Hume Highway. \u201c[Cars already on the roads should] move out of the area so you are not contributing to a buildup of traffic that may impact on the movement of our fire appliances,\u201d he said. Winds could shift the fire direction towards more heavily populated areas in Buxton and towards Tarmoor, and locals needed to prepare, he said. Alerts have previously been issued that it is too late to evacuate from these areas. ABC crews at Balmoral, near Picton in the NSW southern highlands, are reporting that they can see at least three homes on fire from their helicopter. Forget climate change \u2014 let\u2019s talk about exploding horse manure Yes. Michael McCormack, deputy prime minister of Australia, would like inner-city Greenies to know that while climate change may be a factor in the worsening bushfire risk, so too is exploding horse manure. This is not actually as ridiculous as it sounds. Spontaneous combustion of hay sheds on very hot days is not unheard of, and horse manure, when dried, is basically compacted, smelly hay. Spontaneously combusting manure piles is a recognised barn fire hazard, according to the three minutes of Googling I just did. Of course, in Australia, horse manure generally lies in the paddock and crumbles into dust pretty quickly. Anyway. This is what McCormack said, in full, via my colleague Naaman Zhou. Climate change of course is a factor. So are lightning strikes from dry thunderstorms. So are, in a case in South Australia, horse manure, self-combusting \u2013 and we have had, all too tragically, a number of arson attacks too Last month, McCormack said that blaming climate change on bushfires was \u201cinner-city Greenies ravings\u201d. He said today that those comments had been misreported, that he did not say the link between climate change and bushfires was \u201cinner-city ravings\u201d and that the ravings were actually comments stating that prime minister Scott Morrison was responsible for the fatal bushfires. McCormack: We had Adam Bandt and Richard Di Natale from the Greens accusing the prime minister of being somehow responsible for the deaths. I was accusing them of being raving inner-city lunatics. Glad that\u2019s cleared up. \u2018Adani is going ahead\u2019: McCormack Today is apparently a good day to talk about increasing Australia\u2019s coal exports. That will be one of Scott Morrison\u2019s aims when he visits India next month, acting PM Michael McCormack told reporters today, which could include talks to advance the Indian-owned Adani coalmine. McCormack: We will wait and see, but Adani has been ticked off by the Queensland government. So Adani is going ahead. The fact is, this is going to lead to more coal exports. We need more coal exports. The prime minister is going to have a number of talks with his Indian counterpart, Modi. Talks with business leaders of course. We need to continue and enhance our trade and negotiations with India. McCormack was then asked the obvious question: you\u2019re talking about coal exports while standing in the incident control centre for a statewide bushfire emergency. What about the link between climate change and bushfires? His answer is going to need another post. Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack, who is acting PM while Scott Morrison is overseas, has confirmed that Morrison will be back at work on Monday. As in, he is returning to work the day before Christmas eve. This morning, hundreds of protestors camped outside Kirribilli House, angry at Morrison\u2019s absence and lack of leadership during the bushfire crisis. Speaking to the protesters through reporters at the RFS state control centre, McCormack said: You are wasting your time. Go and do something productive. Go and donate your time to meals on wheels and something like that. The fact is, the PM is not there. He is having a well deserved holiday. Those people who are shouting and screaming \u2026 go and help someone out in need. Do a good turn rather than shouting and screaming and holding up placards that not always the words are spelt correctly on .... He\u2019s entitled to a holiday. The PM takes a week off, he is entitled to that. McCormack said there was no need for Morrison to return home early, despite NSW declaring a state of emergency and expecting some of its hottest days on record. The prime minister is very across this issue. He is getting daily briefings, if not hourly briefings, and he is very across it. We are in constant contact. I am the acting prime minister, I am here at the state control centre, I am here with RFS Commissioner Fitzsimmons. Does McCormack think Morrison has shown leadership on the fires? Yes I do. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all like examples. McCormack provides: He has been out with the fires, I have been with him in many electorates. Talking to the people on the ground, we have provided the assistance that has been asked by the state firefighting authorities. He has led from the front, as you expect a PM to do so, and he will continue to do so in the future. The southern highlands train line is not operating between Moss Vale and Campbelltown because of bushfire. The fire crossed the railway line near Balmoral. A replacement bus service is being organised but if you can put off or avoid travel, it\u2019s recommended you do so. The scariest bit is when it turns purple, and you realise they had to put a colour code hotter than fire-engine red ... NSW Health has provided this advice on how you can keep yourself safe in the heat. This just in from Mark Greenhill, the Blue Mountains mayor, who has written about his fury at watching the devastation unfolding around him: Yesterday in the northern part of the Blue Mountains, I walked through a scenery of devastation and loss. This community is bearing witness to the climate crisis, besieged by bushfire all around and struggling to cope with extreme air pollution. People are also asking me why our leaders at a state and federal level are in denial about what is happening here and in other parts of Australia that are on fire? There is incomprehension at the lack of leadership during this climate crisis. Governments need to be present and that means actually coming up with answers to legitimate questions about how they are going to ensure the safety of communities in the face of more intense and more frequent extreme weather events. As we face unprecedented temperatures, what plans do the federal and state governments have to counter climate change? What actions are they taking to support communities like mine and help us to get back to our normal lives? Because, in truth, we can\u2019t see any plans at all. Our patience is running out. We ask our leaders: do what you were elected to do, take control and show leadership. If not, get out of the way so other people can save our country. Visibility in NSW continues to worsen. Here is some satellite vision of the smoke on the east coast of NSW. More on the Green Wattle Creek fire: the Illawarra Mercury reports multiple houses alight. The Green Wattle Creek fire is worsening. It is now too late to leave in Buxton, Couridjah, Thirlmere and Tahmoor. The fire has crossed the railway line near Balmoral. A lot of sad and scary fire news around today, so please take a brief emotional break and enjoy this picture of a koala in a bucket. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has just gone on radio station 2GB to discuss her declaration that NSW is now in a state of emergency. She said that while today was extremely concerning, authorities were most worried about conditions on Saturday. \u201cThe temperatures will be higher, and the wind turbulence more severe,\u201d she said. After the recent public outcry about resourcing for fire services, Berejiklian stated that they were well equipped to manage the coming days. \u201cWe have everything we need, we have the resources on the ground, but what we don\u2019t have is a crystal ball in relation to these conditions,\u201d she said. But she asked that people heed health and safety warnings. The NSW government has responded to the fire emergency by announcing an increase in demerit points for drivers who throw lit cigarettes out vehicle windows. In a media release, the minister for police and emergency services, David Elliott, said if a driver commits the offence during a total fire ban the penalty will double to from five to 10 demerit points, and a fine of up to $11,000. The minister for transport and roads, Andrew Constance, said more than 200 people had been caught carelessly tossing a lit cigarette this year alone. The Green Wattle Creek fire is moving quickly towards the southern highlands village of Balmoral. The RFS advises it is now too late to leave Balmoral and people should seek shelter. Fires in the Shoalhaven LGA are getting worse. It is now too late to leave in Jerrawangola and Wandandian. Scroll down our coverage to see the view from Vincentia beach. The smoke is really starting to overtake Sydney. Here is a tweet from the Bureau of Meteorology only two hours ago showing the smoke on the radar, compared with the radar now: \u201cIn Sydney we\u2019ve just been watching the visibility deteriorate,\u201d says Gabrielle Woodhouse from the bureau. For many people from NSW and Australia, Jervis Bay and its surrounds are synonymous with Australian summer holidays. Today the view from the beach in Vincentia is terrifying. Hi, it\u2019s Amy Corderoy taking over from Michael McGowan ... NSW paramedics are bracing for more heat and fire-related emergencies, warning vulnerable people to be vigilant and protect themselves today. There has already been a 10% increase in calls for patients with respiratory conditions over the past week as bushfire smoke causes dangerous conditions, AAP reports. Young children and elderly people are also at risk. An additional 187 extra paramedics will be on duty to help tackle the \u201cquite remarkable conditions\u201d, says NSW Ambulance\u2019s chief executive, Dominic Morgan. He said anyone in a \u201cvulnerable group\u201d such as the elderly or very young needed a plan to cope with the heat and ensure they stayed well hydrated. \u201cJust this morning I became aware of a three-year-old who had such a severe asthma attack that they were unable to speak,\u201d Morgan told reporters in Sydney. Signs of heat exhaustion include dizziness and confusion, headaches, appetite loss, excessive sweating, leg, stomach and arm cramps and thirst. In a cafe in Penrith, ducking in for a coffee, is Steve, an RFS volunteer in bright yellow vest. Steve works in a nearby fire control centre. He says one of his jobs today is to keep all the firefighters safe from the heat. \u201cBaically the main thing is we ensure all volunteers stay hydrated,\u201d he says. \u201cWe tell them they need to drink at least one litre an hour. And regularly rotate crews through the different positions. We have someone doing the really hot stuff and others that aren\u2019t.\u201d I ask him if it\u2019ll be a busy day for him. \u201cOh yeah. We\u2019ve got extreme fire danger forecast, and numerous fires currently burning, with huge perimeters, so the chances that they become uncontrolled is pretty high.\u201d We have just updated our interactive map showing the size of the area burned in NSW and Queensland since the start of the fire season. The total area is now 3.1m hectares. If this was a country, it would be the 136th largest \u2013 larger than Belgium, and just smaller than Moldova. The view out in the Oaks near Campbelltown in south-west Sydney this morning. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has announced it is will push for an urgent upgrade of health workplace health safety conditions to address the risk of working in heat and smoke. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, and assistant secretary Liam O\u2019Brien are announcing the proposal today to regulate exposure to heat and smoke. The guidelines include advice on how to minimise exposure to heat and smoke pollution and how to recognise serious health risks. At a McDonald\u2019s off the Great Western Highway, Jake and Samson are taking a break. Luckily, they work indoors in Penrith, in a nearby warehouse. \u201cIf it gets too hot, it\u2019s normally bearable,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got fans, they give us cold packs and cold water. It\u2019s something we can deal with.\u201d They\u2019ve been at work today since 6am. But that means they clock off just as the heat will reach its 45C peak. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be going indoors for sure,\u201d Jake says. \u201cLots of water ... we both have air con.\u201d But Samson interjects. \u201cEven sometimes with air con on, it\u2019s fucking hot dude! Seriously, when the air con is on, and the outside is hot, it\u2019s hotter.\u201d \u201cMy aircon does the job,\u201d says Jake. A fire in the Shoalhaven area is now at watch and act. Crowds are growing at a protest outside the prime minister\u2019s residence, Kirribilli House. Australian Associated Press reports that riot squad officers are on the scene but there is no sense of the protest getting out of hand. A group of students representing the Schools Strike 4 Climate movement stood with other protesters, some of whom were wearing Hawaiian shirts, carrying placards declaring \u201cThe time to talk is now\u201d and \u201cC\u2019mon SloMo\u201d. From Australian Associated Press: They called on the federal government to take immediate action on climate change and urged no new coal and gas projects, a transition to 100% renewables and funding for affected fossil fuel workers. Dr Kim Loo said there was no framework currently in place to deal with the effects of climate change on health. \u201cIt is negligent not to do anything about mitigation or adaptation. It is criminal to continue mining, burning, exporting oil, coal and gas because it\u2019s fuelling the crisis,\u201d Loo told the crowd. \u201cAnd this is the greatest crisis to our health in the 21st century.\u201d Cheers erupted as Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said Morrison was missing at a time of crisis. \u201cEveryone is gathered here today to ask one question, \u2018Where the bloody hell is the prime minister?\u2019\u201d Faruqi said. Sydney student Ambrose Hayes said Morrison\u2019s holiday was badly timed. \u201cOur direct message to Scott Morrison is for him to come home ... even though he\u2019s entitled to a holiday, it shouldn\u2019t be at a time where Australia is in crisis,\u201d said the 14-year-old. Ambulance Victoria responded to eight reports of children locked in vehicles yesterday, including a preschool-aged girl who was left with a primary school-aged child in a hot car at Narre Warren South about 4.30pm. The girl wasn\u2019t taken to hospital. Please do not do this. It\u2019s 9.30am right now in Penrith, western Sydney, and thankfully, still cool. The suburb is forecast to hit 45C today and 46C on Saturday. It\u2019s the next two or three hours that will hurt, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Right now, it\u2019s a breezy 26.2C. By 11am that will rise to 39C. 13C over two hours. But the haze and bushfire smoke is already thick. Here we\u2019re only about 30km from the southernmost edge of the huge Gospers Mountain megafire, burning through the Blue Mountains. Smoke from the 400,000 hectare blaze is rolling down in waves. The NSW ambulance commissioner, Dominic Morgan, says paramedics have seen a 10% increase in call-outs for patients suffering respiratory ailments in the last week amid what he called \u201cremarkable\u201d conditions. He said people with respiratory conditions \u201cneed to be very vigilant\u201d. \u201cIt can be a life-threatening condition,\u201d he said. \u201cJust this morning, I became aware of a three-year-old who had such a severe asthma attack that they were unable to speak.\u201d Air quality in much of NSW is rated from poor to hazardous on Thursday. From a protest outside the prime minister\u2019s Sydney residence at Kirribilli this morning. They\u2019re unhappy at Scott Morrison\u2019s absence during bushfire crisis. What does a state of emergency actually mean? It allows powers to be transferred from the NSW government to the Rural Fire Service commissioner. Those powers include: The power to direct any NSW government agency to conduct or refrain from conducting its functions Control and coordinate the allocation of government resources Evacuate people from property within the declared area Close roads and thoroughfares to traffic Pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse Order the shutdown of essential utilities in the declared area, including electricity, gas, oil and water Enter or take possession of property in the course of the emergency response. That press conference with the the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, has now ended. Just to reiterate, the premier announced a state of emergency for NSW for the next seven days amid \u201cunpredictable\u201d weather conditions that are causing extreme fire danger across much of the state today and later in the week. Fitzsimmons said there were three major fires he was concerned about. All three are burning near residential populations, and he said there was a risk communities could be impacted today. They are the Currowan fire on the state\u2019s south coast near Batemans Bay and Ulladulla, the Gospers Mountain fire which stretches through the Central Coast to Lithgow, and the Ruined Castle fire which stretches from Picton in Sydney\u2019s south-west through the Blue Mountains and into the state\u2019s west. Both the Gospers Mountain and Green Wattle Creek fire are burning at \u201cwatch and act\u201d this morning. All other fires are at \u201cadvice\u201d. Shane Fitzsimmons continues, saying he\u2019s picking up a sense of \u201cdespair\u201d in firefighters. Look, I think the big thing that I\u2019m picking up from crews, year in, year out, is their sense of despair and challenge because you\u2019ve got such a dry landscape, the structure of the landscape is resulting in fires starting so easily and spreading so very quickly, and proving to be extremely difficult to suppress and contain. And we just cannot overstate the criticality of the drought and its effect on the vegetation and how volatile the fire behaviour becomes. And we\u2019re seeing fire behaviour much greater, with spotting activity and flame heights and that sort of thing, than would otherwise be the case for the sorts of conditions we\u2019re experiencing. He said the fires had a psychological impact on firefighters: They\u2019re invested in their local community. So when they see, when they see impact, when they see loss, when they see damage and destruction and devastation in their local community, it\u2019s not just a job, it\u2019s not just another day in firefighting. That\u2019s their neighbour. That\u2019s their town. That\u2019s their own home being impacted by the fires. They take it very personally and the amount of conversations I\u2019ve had with firefighters and incident controls and incident management teams that feel they\u2019ve failed because they\u2019ve lost a home or a property in their town. Shane Fitzsimmons has been asked whether he\u2019s confident that RFS volunteers are appropriately equipped and resourced. He says he\u2019s \u201cextremely confident\u201d: But the reality is we\u2019ve got a scale and a magnitude of fire operations unfolding this season and that has necessitated assistance and support well beyond just local capabilities. So, yes, I\u2019m absolutely confident, but the scale and the magnitude of this season, and the fire operations, is such that we\u2019ve had to bring in, necessarily, a whole heap of interstate and international assistance. There\u2019s a lot of very tired and fatigued people right across New South Wales, physically, emotionally, psychologically, that are truly invested in trying to save and protect their local community and communities across New South Wales. That question follows reports of firefighters crowdfunding for smoke masks. The RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said conditions would remain \u201cvery serious and dangerous\u201d over the coming days, and the forecast was that Saturday \u201cwill be even worse\u201d. \u201cWhile we still have fires burning effectively from the Queensland border right down to the south coast of New South Wales, the worst of the fire weather conditions, the extreme fire danger ratings we are expecting today, are centred around the greater Sydney, the Illawarra/Shoalhaven area under southern ranges,\u201d he said. Fitzsimmons said the fire burning between Batemans Bay and Ulladulla was \u201clikely to impact communities\u201d in those areas today. He said another fire burning to Sydney\u2019s south-west effectively spanned from Picton in south-west to the town of Oberon in the west. \u201cThat southern exposure is quite at risk for communities,\u201d he said. Gladys Berejiklian made the announcement at a press conference just a moment ago. She acknowledged it could mean problems for people travelling over the Christmas period. \u201cWe want everybody to be together with their families and enjoy the time and be safe, but please be aware that the state of emergency might mean extra diversions, extra road closures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might mean if you are using the roads that you are delayed, or in fact your plans have to change.\u201d She said the \u201cbiggest concern\u201d was the unpredictability of the weather patterns \u201cwith extreme wind conditions [and] extremely hot temperatures\u201d: We don\u2019t take these declarations lightly. We only take them when the conditions are so severe that we want everybody to be alert. We want to ensure Commissioner Fitzsimmons has all the authority legally and all the powers that he has to ensure that he can take any decision to protect life and property, and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding of their patience. I appreciate that for many families this could be a disruptive period, but we ask everybody to ... be sensible, to be cautious and also to expect, when they are on the roads, they should expect delays. They should expect perhaps to reach their destination later than expected, but also perhaps have to change their plans depending on what happens over the next few days. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has announced a state of emergency for the next seven days. She said she had made the decision after the advice from the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, and that she was concerned about the \u201cunpredictability\u201d of the weather. It is the second time in just over a month that NSW has been under a state of emergency due to the extreme weather. Smoke on the radars. High temperatures are forecast across most of the south-east of Australia today, including in Victoria and South Australia. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, told the ABC it was \u201ca tale of two states\u201d with mild weather to the south but extremely hot weather in the state\u2019s north around Swan Hill and Mildura. Crisp said there had been reports of poor air quality in the eastern half of the Victoria as a result of fires in Gippsland in the north-east and also from NSW. South Australia\u2019s emergency services minister, Corey Wingard, said there had been reports of temperatures of close to 50 degrees in the northern part of the state this week. \u201cIt is extreme, really hot, and that does focus people on making sure they are looking after each other and their neighbours, so across the state everyone is feeling it,\u201d Wingard said. While Tuesday was Australia\u2019s hottest day on record, with an average of 40.9C across the country, it\u2019s possible today could get even hotter. Temperatures in parts of NSW and the ACT are expected to exceed 40C through to Saturday, while in the western half of the state the mercury could top 45C. Sydney\u2019s CBD is expected to hit a top of 40C, while Penrith has the dubious honour of being the city\u2019s hottest location, with temperatures forecast to reach 45 degrees. Further north and west it\u2019s likely to be just as hot. Cessnock in the Hunter Valley is expected to reach 45C, as are many towns in the west that are dealing with water shortages. Sydney has again woken up to a thick blanket of smoke from bushfires burning to the west. It has become an increasingly common sight this summer. The Department of Planning and Environment has predicted \u201cpoor\u201d air quality for Thursday, which could worsen as the day progresses. The RFS has warned that three major fires pose the biggest risk on Thursday. They are: The Currowan fire burning near Batemans Bay and Ulladulla on the state\u2019s south coast The Green Wattle Creek fire burning near Picton and Ruined Castle fire near the Megalong Valley The Gospers Mountain fire burning near Kurrajong Heights, Bowen Mountain, communities on Bells Line of Road, Lithgow, and Cullen Bullen As of Thursday morning the Gospers Mountain fire, which has already burned through 411,900 hectares, is rated as watch and act while the other two are at the advice level. The RFS has warned those communities may come under threat on Thursday from embers or fire fronts. Conditions are then forecast to worsen again on Saturday. A state-wide total fire ban is in place in NSW. Good morning, The Rural Fire Service has issued \u201cextreme\u201d fire danger warnings for the Sydney, Illawarra/Shoalhaven and southern ranges regions on Thursday, with three \u201csignificant fires\u201d in those areas posing \u201cextreme to severe fire danger\u201d. The RFS has are also warned there remain \u201cbroad areas of severe and very high fire danger\u201d across northern, eastern and southern parts of the state. A statewide total fire ban is in place on Thursday as more than 100 fires continue to burn across NSW. The RFS said on Wednesday that conditions would be dangerous due to high temperatures, strong and gusty winds and low humidity. Temperatures in the state and the ACT are expected to exceed 40C through to Saturday, while in the western half of the state the mercury could top 45C. On Wednesday the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, warned firefighters would face an \u201cenormous challenge\u201d for the rest of the week, with the potential for \u201cexceedingly concerning\u201d winds to blow embers well ahead of fire fronts. \u201cNot only are we going to experience very high temperatures on Thursday and Saturday but there\u2019s the exceedingly concerning wind conditions,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a number of wind fronts escalating the fuel, the fires burning, and the potential to have spot fires and embers travelling very long distances.\u201d",

Black Georgians, he adds, have an unemployment rate in the state that could be triple that of white residents, often because of additional barriers they face, like where they live, access to transportation and the difficulty of finding a job in a mandated period of time. Waide echoes the sentiment. \u201cPoverty and hunger disproportionately affect people of color. These are going to be low-income folks in rural communities who are economically vulnerable by definition,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they can\u2019t eat, they can\u2019t get over other hurdles.\u201d Rural households experience more struggle with food security, according to the Food Research and Action Center, compared with households in metro areas. Food insecurity is also twice as high among African American households compared with white households, in rural communities or not. The average Georgian on Snap benefits remains approximately eight months before cycling out of the program as they get back to some sort of stability, Waide explains, just as the program intends. The myth of anyone perpetually staying on government benefits just is not true, he says. When the change to the work requirement takes place in April next year, Waide is confident the food bank will see a high demand to try to make up for the shortfall. Last year, he points out, his food bank stepped in when a government shutdown left thousands of federal workers in Atlanta without pay. \u201cWe mobilized our network and donors to distribute hundreds of thousands of meals. And we\u2019ll do the same here, this time,\u201d he said.",

In <em>The Tenth Muse</em>, the US novelist Catherine Chung favours a different version of the myth. In her telling, equal parts Brothers Grimm and feminist call to arms, there were not nine daughters born to Mnemosyne but 10. The first nine came of age and duly assumed their gifts but, when it was her turn, the youngest refused. \u201cShe did not wish to sing in the voices of men, telling only the stories they wished to tell.

That show was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession\">Succession</a>, Jesse Armstrong\u2019s dizzyingly seductive drama about a billionaire media family, which became a runaway hit with its second series. A veritable powerhouse, Succession contained all the things that had once drawn us to Westeros: power, wealth, loyalty and sheer nastiness.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>The writing is so creatively foul that it fills the gap left by its sibling in crudeness, Veep; half the fun is waiting to see what the interminably vile Roman will sneer about next. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/best-tv-shows-2019-no-1-succession\">Read more</a></p> <h2><strong>2</strong></h2> <h2>Fleabag</h2> <p>(BBC iPlayer) That the second series of Fleabag successfully and satisfyingly deepened, enriched and furthered the first, which had been designed and stood as a perfectly worked standalone series, is a near-divine miracle. But this was appropriate enough, given the figure who supplied most of the fuel for our second journey into Fleabag\u2019s world \u2013 Andrew Scott\u2019s Priest. Or to give him the title by which he instantly came to be known: Hot Priest.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>This series raised the bar so utterly that, at times, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s risks and progression were so impressive all one could do was shake one\u2019s head in appreciation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/18/best-tv-shows-2019-no-2-fleabag\">Read more</a></p> <h2><strong>3</strong></h2> <h2>Chernobyl</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e06f70f9dc1c414d5205a53032bf805d4aaa1ef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e06f70f9dc1c414d5205a53032bf805d4aaa1ef5/0_97_4240_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chernobyl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The best true-story miniseries ever made ... Chernobyl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Daniel/Sky UK Ltd/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>(HBO/Sky) On the most basic level, Chernobyl was one of the best true-story miniseries ever made, capitalising on the curious fact that most people know hardly anything about the meltdown of a nuclear reactor in Pripyat, Ukraine in April 1986, despite the incident\u2019s global infamy. But it also made universal observations, painfully resonant in the UK or US in 2019, about how institutions and hierarchies turn people into liars who, in extreme circumstances, lose their basic humanity.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>Director Johan Renck and screenwriter Craig Mazin will be remembered for crafting a remarkably cogent and multivalent drama, one aided by impeccable performances. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/17/best-tv-shows-2019-no-3-chernobyl\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>4</strong></h2> <h2>Years and Years</h2> <p>(BBC One) In the first episode of Years and Years, a family shindig was interrupted by the whine of air raid sirens and the news that Donald Trump had fired a nuclear missile at the Chinese \u2013 a moment of hysteria-inducing horror that doubled as the show\u2019s starter pistol. That\u2019s right: impending nuclear armageddon was merely an aperitif when it came to the terror and devastation the Lyons family were to face in Russell T Davies\u2019s breathtakingly ambitious six-part dystopian drama.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>For a series that compresses 15 years into six hours, it seems to pass in the blink of an eye thanks to Russell T Davies\u2019s trademark humour, compassion and the kinetic energy with which he infuses every project. We do not deserve Davies, but thank God he\u2019s here. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/16/best-tv-shows-2019-no-4-years-and-years\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>5</strong></h2> <h2>The Virtues</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91402ab003da5fea75ed4c2b6b0aec9e4813eacb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91402ab003da5fea75ed4c2b6b0aec9e4813eacb/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everyday heroism \u2026 Stephen Graham in The Virtues.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everyday heroism \u2026 Stephen Graham in The Virtues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Rogers/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>(Channel 4) It has been said that Stephen Graham is Shane Meadows\u2019 muse. Graham\u2019s qualities as an actor \u2013 unflinching emotional honesty, the ability to convey an infinity of turmoil in a single facial expression \u2013 coincide perfectly with Meadows\u2019 journeys into despair and redemption. The Virtues is a career peak for both. A drama that began as a desperate trawl through the anguish of Graham\u2019s Joseph \u2013 a lonely alcoholic, spun off the rails by the departure of his son to Australia \u2013 evolved into a moving depiction of everyday heroism.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>In its last throes, The Virtues distilled itself down to drama in one of its purest forms: whether humans have something deep within that will save them when they face the source of all their pain, with the lure of the self-destruct button stronger than ever. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/13/best-tv-shows-2019-no-5-the-virtues\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>6</strong></h2> <h2>Unbelievable</h2> <p>(Netflix) The trauma of sexual assault is often twofold. There\u2019s the assault itself and then the systematic way in which victims are dismissed and disbelieved by the criminal justice system. This autumn, over eight precisely constructed episodes, Unbelievable dramatised this process more powerfully than ever before. This was the buddy cop duo that the #MeToo generation deserved.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>Unbelievable isn\u2019t a programme about whether a vulnerable teen was telling the truth. It\u2019s about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/12/best-tv-shows-2019-no-6-unbelievable\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>7</strong></h2> <h2>Russian Doll</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20ca3c724a4888d61227ea1bd07c1259b73adc45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20ca3c724a4888d61227ea1bd07c1259b73adc45/900_76_2568_1541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trippy \u2026 Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trippy \u2026 Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>(Netflix) Wisecracking New Yorker Nadia Vulvokov (Natasha Lyonne) finds herself caught in a traumatic Groundhog Day-style loop in this eight-episode dramedy, which \u2013 despite landing out of nowhere back in February \u2013 proved to be one of the funniest, saddest and trippiest shows of the year.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>Russian Doll is an acquired taste. But do persist: there is such a fine, idiosyncratic, impressive show nested within. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/11/best-tv-shows-2019-no-7-russian-doll\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>8</strong></h2> <h2>This Time With Alan Partridge</h2> <p>(BBC One) When it was announced that Alan Partridge was to make his return to TV in early 2019 as co-host of a chat show, the big question was: would his incontinent crassness stand out in a media landscape that contained actual buffoons such as Piers Morgan? The answer was a resounding yes.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony and lie limp from laughter, hatred, panic, despair or in awe at the end of another half-hour in his appalling company, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/10/best-tv-shows-2019-no-8-this-time-with-alan-partridge\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>9</strong></h2> <h2>Catastrophe</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad1445d1f3a1f6d4f6d10eb951c586b111a6ce58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1445d1f3a1f6d4f6d10eb951c586b111a6ce58/0_160_2834_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Explosive \u2026 Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney oin Catastrophe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Explosive \u2026 Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney oin Catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Johnson/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>(Channel 4) What.

Catastrophe\u2019s climax was always going to come closer to explosive than orgasmic, but dear God it hurt like only 2019 could: deeply, because even after four seasons of watching Sharon and Rob love-hate each other till death did them part, we still cared; shockingly, because it turned out we weren\u2019t made entirely of Brexit-born cynicism and we still wanted them to make it.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>The great skill of Catastrophe has always been its unrivalled ability to show us brittle and spiky people, behaving mostly terribly, and then to make us feel deeply invested in their messy, fractured lives. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/09/best-tv-shows-2019-no-9-catastrophe\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>10</strong></h2> <h2>Euphoria</h2> <p>(HBO/Sky Atlantic) What made this hot teen drama such a blast of cool fresh air was not its shock tactics, or its NSFW content, but its massive heart.

By the end of its eight thrilling episodes, it\u2019s difficult not to care deeply about the plights of these young people.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>For all of its bleak vision, sympathy is not in short supply, and it is hard not to root for these kids to fight their way through to the other side. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/06/best-tv-shows-2019-no-10-euphoria\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>11</strong></h2> <h2>Leaving Neverland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a3dfce3a85396e6e7e4953990cd4899ccad810b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a3dfce3a85396e6e7e4953990cd4899ccad810b/0_314_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chilling \u2026 Michael Jackson with the young Wade Robson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Astonishing \u2026 Michael Jackson with the young Wade Robson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>(HBO/Channel 4) A harrowing four-hour expos\u00e9 of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson.

Relentlessly spare and unsensationalist, it manages better than any other in its genre not to let its attention wander from the survivors\u2019 testimony.

That show was Succession, Jesse Armstrong\u2019s dizzyingly seductive drama about a billionaire media family, which became a runaway hit with its second series. A veritable powerhouse, Succession contained all the things that had once drawn us to Westeros: power, wealth, loyalty and sheer nastiness. What we said: The writing is so creatively foul that it fills the gap left by its sibling in crudeness, Veep; half the fun is waiting to see what the interminably vile Roman will sneer about next. Read more 2 Fleabag (BBC iPlayer) That the second series of Fleabag successfully and satisfyingly deepened, enriched and furthered the first, which had been designed and stood as a perfectly worked standalone series, is a near-divine miracle. But this was appropriate enough, given the figure who supplied most of the fuel for our second journey into Fleabag\u2019s world \u2013 Andrew Scott\u2019s Priest. Or to give him the title by which he instantly came to be known: Hot Priest. What we said: This series raised the bar so utterly that, at times, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s risks and progression were so impressive all one could do was shake one\u2019s head in appreciation. Read more 3 Chernobyl (HBO/Sky) On the most basic level, Chernobyl was one of the best true-story miniseries ever made, capitalising on the curious fact that most people know hardly anything about the meltdown of a nuclear reactor in Pripyat, Ukraine in April 1986, despite the incident\u2019s global infamy. But it also made universal observations, painfully resonant in the UK or US in 2019, about how institutions and hierarchies turn people into liars who, in extreme circumstances, lose their basic humanity. What we said: Director Johan Renck and screenwriter Craig Mazin will be remembered for crafting a remarkably cogent and multivalent drama, one aided by impeccable performances. Read more. 4 Years and Years (BBC One) In the first episode of Years and Years, a family shindig was interrupted by the whine of air raid sirens and the news that Donald Trump had fired a nuclear missile at the Chinese \u2013 a moment of hysteria-inducing horror that doubled as the show\u2019s starter pistol. That\u2019s right: impending nuclear armageddon was merely an aperitif when it came to the terror and devastation the Lyons family were to face in Russell T Davies\u2019s breathtakingly ambitious six-part dystopian drama. What we said: For a series that compresses 15 years into six hours, it seems to pass in the blink of an eye thanks to Russell T Davies\u2019s trademark humour, compassion and the kinetic energy with which he infuses every project. We do not deserve Davies, but thank God he\u2019s here. Read more. 5 The Virtues (Channel 4) It has been said that Stephen Graham is Shane Meadows\u2019 muse. Graham\u2019s qualities as an actor \u2013 unflinching emotional honesty, the ability to convey an infinity of turmoil in a single facial expression \u2013 coincide perfectly with Meadows\u2019 journeys into despair and redemption. The Virtues is a career peak for both. A drama that began as a desperate trawl through the anguish of Graham\u2019s Joseph \u2013 a lonely alcoholic, spun off the rails by the departure of his son to Australia \u2013 evolved into a moving depiction of everyday heroism. What we said: In its last throes, The Virtues distilled itself down to drama in one of its purest forms: whether humans have something deep within that will save them when they face the source of all their pain, with the lure of the self-destruct button stronger than ever. Read more. 6 Unbelievable (Netflix) The trauma of sexual assault is often twofold. There\u2019s the assault itself and then the systematic way in which victims are dismissed and disbelieved by the criminal justice system. This autumn, over eight precisely constructed episodes, Unbelievable dramatised this process more powerfully than ever before. This was the buddy cop duo that the #MeToo generation deserved. What we said: Unbelievable isn\u2019t a programme about whether a vulnerable teen was telling the truth. It\u2019s about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed. Read more. 7 Russian Doll (Netflix) Wisecracking New Yorker Nadia Vulvokov (Natasha Lyonne) finds herself caught in a traumatic Groundhog Day-style loop in this eight-episode dramedy, which \u2013 despite landing out of nowhere back in February \u2013 proved to be one of the funniest, saddest and trippiest shows of the year. What we said: Russian Doll is an acquired taste. But do persist: there is such a fine, idiosyncratic, impressive show nested within. Read more. 8 This Time With Alan Partridge (BBC One) When it was announced that Alan Partridge was to make his return to TV in early 2019 as co-host of a chat show, the big question was: would his incontinent crassness stand out in a media landscape that contained actual buffoons such as Piers Morgan? The answer was a resounding yes. What we said: We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony and lie limp from laughter, hatred, panic, despair or in awe at the end of another half-hour in his appalling company, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. Read more. 9 Catastrophe (Channel 4) What. A. Finale. Catastrophe\u2019s climax was always going to come closer to explosive than orgasmic, but dear God it hurt like only 2019 could: deeply, because even after four seasons of watching Sharon and Rob love-hate each other till death did them part, we still cared; shockingly, because it turned out we weren\u2019t made entirely of Brexit-born cynicism and we still wanted them to make it. What we said: The great skill of Catastrophe has always been its unrivalled ability to show us brittle and spiky people, behaving mostly terribly, and then to make us feel deeply invested in their messy, fractured lives. Read more. 10 Euphoria (HBO/Sky Atlantic) What made this hot teen drama such a blast of cool fresh air was not its shock tactics, or its NSFW content, but its massive heart. The writer and director Sam Levinson has spoken about how much of Rue\u2019s story drew from his own experiences of anxiety and addiction, and you can feel the authenticity. By the end of its eight thrilling episodes, it\u2019s difficult not to care deeply about the plights of these young people. What we said: For all of its bleak vision, sympathy is not in short supply, and it is hard not to root for these kids to fight their way through to the other side. Read more. 11 Leaving Neverland (HBO/Channel 4) A harrowing four-hour expos\u00e9 of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson. Wade Robson and James Safechuck outlined their chilling accounts of childhood grooming by the man that they, and the whole world, worshipped. What we said: An astonishing piece of work. Relentlessly spare and unsensationalist, it manages better than any other in its genre not to let its attention wander from the survivors\u2019 testimony. Footage of Jackson is confined almost wholly to that of him with the boys themselves on stage, private calls between them and family snaps. He is never allowed to overwhelm the story. Read the full review. 12 Top Boy (Netflix) Resurrected thanks to Netflix\u2019s notoriously deep pockets, the gangster drama set on a fictional Hackney estate (previously seen on Channel 4) could have ended up a glossy shadow of its former self. Thankfully, its return was as bleak and brilliant as ever, with ripped-from-the-headlines nods to county lines drug dealing and the Windrush scandal. What we said: It is not a flattering portrait of our times, but as a TV drama, it is up there with the best \u2013 tense, gripping and relentless. Read the full review. 13 Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) \u201cIt\u2019s all bowls baby!\u201d The second series of Jamie Demetriou\u2019s surreal comedy set in a family lettings agency boasted even weirder dialogue than the first. As well as its often excruciating laughs, however, the show also became more tender, cementing Demetriou\u2019s titular character as a truly versatile comic creation. What we said: At a time when television is fixated on memoirish sadcoms about loss and betrayal, Stath harks back to the golden era of 90s surrealist comedies such as The Fast Show and I\u2019m Alan Partridge. Read more. 14 Sex Education (Netflix) Gillian Anderson starred as Jean, a sex therapist whose son Otis (Asa Butterfield) \u2013 though too anxious to masturbate himself \u2013 sets up a sex advice service at school. A punchy, horny and eye-wateringly funny comedy with much to add to the teen TV genre. What we said: Endlessly and seemingly effortlessly funny, in a naturalistic way that doesn\u2019t have you listening for the hooves of the next gag thundering down a well-worn track but, like Catastrophe, catches you almost unawares and makes you bark with laughter. Read the full review. 15 Derry Girls (Channel 4) One of last year\u2019s surprise hits, Lisa McGee\u2019s Northern Irish comedy didn\u2019t let things slip in its second season, with the gang still finding teenage kicks (this time courtesy of Take That and Bill Clinton) in the midst of the Troubles. The scene in which teens from both sides of the sectarian divide unleashed a barrage of stereotypes about each other (\u201cProtestants hate ABBA!\u201d) is among the year\u2019s funniest. What we said: Derry Girls\u2019 magic remains intact. The evocation of the 90s is as lightly done as ever (Elizabeth Hurley is fleetingly referenced \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s a total ride, but she paperclips her frocks together\u201d) and the Troubled setting never overwhelms but simply throws into relief the ordinariness of the girls\u2019 lives in the middle of extraordinary depths of conflict. Read the full review. 16 What We Do in the Shadows (FX/BBC Two) This weirdo vampire tale \u2013 based on Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement\u2019s 2014 film of the same name \u2013 was transposed from New Zealand to Staten Island, for brilliantly awkward, cross-cultural, cross-species laughs, with a cast helmed by Matt Berry, Kayvan Novak and Natasia Demetriou. Fangs a lot! What we said: What We Do in the Shadows is a deft and seductive comedy that has all the hallmarks of a series it will be easy to fall for completely. Read the full review. 17 Everybody in the Place: An Incomplete History of Britain (BBC Four) Eat, sleep, rave, repeat was the mindset for thousands of young Brits in the mid 80s and early 90s, as Turner prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller explores in this politically charged music documentary. As well as transporting former rave and acid house fans back to their younger years, it offered a group of young participants a window into a world of hedonism and irrevocable social change. What we said: Everybody in the Place has enveloped viewers in a loved-up embrace. Across social media, even hard bitten, seen-it-all old ravers have been celebrating the film. Read more. 18 Back to Life (BBC Three) Daisy Haggard\u2019s downbeat gem took on a tough topic \u2013 a woman\u2019s return to her home town after a stretch behind bars \u2013 and turned it into a meditation on grief, regret and the passage of time, though with enough gags to keep things zipping along. What we said: The beauty of the script and the performances \u2013 which build relationships so delicately and naturally, which modulate so deftly in and out of grief and laughter, and which turn ordinary moments into hilarity and heartbreak without you noticing how they got you there \u2013 will take your breath away. Read the full review. 19 Ghosts (BBC One) The Horrible Histories team offered up more thrillingly silly comedy with this spirited sitcom about a gang of ghouls going to war with the new owners of a crumbling mansion. What we said: In making us giggle at the supernatural, Ghosts is very British. But it is American in the sense of having a gag-to-airtime ratio much higher than British sitcoms normally manage these days. Read the full review. 20 Mum (BBC Two) Stefan Golaszewski\u2019s splendid sitcom ended on a heartwarming high. Over three lovely series, Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan as Cathy and Michael gave us the gift of a quietly epic romance that kept the tears in our eyes \u2013 and that will echo down the ages. What we said: Mum might have looked like it was just a sitcom, but it had something beautiful to say about love and loss. It\u2019s said it. Read the full review. 21 Prince Andrew and the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview (BBC Two) Not since the Princess Diana and Martin Bashir sit-down in 1995 has such an astonishing royal spectacle been shown on our screens. This was gobsmacking television from entitled first to \u201cunbecoming\u201d last, which the world swallowed with a side order of Pizza Express dough balls. What we said: An extended moment of clownish, life-changing stupidity wrapped around a kernel of true nastiness. Prince Andrew has been accused of doing genuinely awful things that reek of consequence-free privilege. The way in which he blithely slow-blinked his way into catastrophe during the interview seems to suggest that he still doesn\u2019t understand the scale of what has been levelled at him, and that is absolutely damning for his family.

What we said: I wolfed down the entire series in one sitting, genuinely incapacitated with laughter. And then I watched it all again. I\u2019ve watched I Think You Should Leave more times than I\u2019ve watched entire series of Monty Python, and it\u2019s only been available for two weeks. I\u2019m fully obsessed at this point. At its peak, I Think You Should Leave might be one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Read the full review. 23 When They See Us (Netflix) Ava DuVernay\u2019s staggering miniseries about the Central Park Five showed how a group of young men came to be falsely convicted for raping a young white woman in 1989. It is unbearably harrowing to watch the boys, as young as 14, get violently coerced by police into giving confessions. What we said: The performances are uniformly astonishing \u2013 especially from the central five, Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez and Jharrel Jerome, most of whom are just a few years older than the teens they are playing. They capture the innocence, in all senses, of children, and the permanence of its loss. It feels like a great privilege to see them. Read the full review. 24 His Dark Materials (BBC One) After a laughably lacklustre 2007 film version, Philip Pullman\u2019s much-loved fantasy trilogy finally got the adaptation it deserved in this gripping eight-parter. Dafne Keen shone as orphaned, daemon-tethered protagonist Lyra Belacqua, with James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson among its enviable cast. What we said: There is time and space to do the books justice and the first episode, in all its steampunkish glory, gave every sign that the potential is to be realised. Read the full review. 25 The Crown (Netflix) Although somewhat overshadowed by grim royal events in the present, Peter Morgan\u2019s lavish regal drama returned for its third outing, with Olivia Colman ascending to the throne and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret keeping her on her toes. Taking in the period from 1964 to 1976, from the Aberfan disaster to the moon landing and the meeting of Charles and Camilla, the royals were mired in crisis \u2013 making this series as dark and compelling as ever. What we said: It will leave you either longing for the monarchy to be decapitated for its endless, parasitical privilege (great scenes arise from Philip complaining about being asked to cut back on his yacht consumption, for example) or abolished for the Windsors\u2019 own good. Read the full review. 26 Barry (HBO/Sky Atlantic) The second season of this black comedy about a hitman who catches the acting bug took its story into darker territory, with Barry\u2019s attempts to extricate himself from his past life only dragging him further into oblivion. Things are not going to end well. What we said: Though it\u2019s a comedy rather than a thriller, Barry replicates much of what made Breaking Bad irresistible. Read more. 27 State of the Union (Sundance TV/BBC Two) Rosamund Pike and Chris O\u2019Dowd shone as estranged spouses Tom and Louise in Stephen Frears\u2019s bite-size tales of crisis, crosswords and couples therapy. While Louise tells her husband that \u201cdiscussing a malfunctioning marriage is depressing and time-consuming\u201d, watching it proved quite the opposite. What we said: As honest and multi-faceted an examination and appreciation of marriage as you could hope to find (as well as an astonishingly cliche-free one). Read the full review. 28 The End of the F***ing World (All 4/Netflix) Despite a tense cliffhanger of a series one ending, Jessica Barden and Alex Lawther returned as the millennial answer to Bonnie and Clyde in the second run of the pitch-black comedy that became an unexpected global hit. And with Naomi Ackie on board as a creepy hitchhiker with a mysterious connection to the pair, three was very much a crowd. What we said: These 20-minute instalments are hymns to brevity. It is gruesome and violent and scatalogical, but then it is funny and pointed and wry, and then it defers to a tender look, or an affectionate touch, and shows its heart. Read the full review. 29 The Other Two (Comedy Central/All 4) How would you react if you were a struggling actor who could barely get cast as Man Who Smells Fart in an advert \u2026 while your kid brother became a Bieber-esque teen heart-throb overnight? That\u2019s the premise of this brilliant satire, which follows Cary, Brooke and their famous sibling ChaseDreams, spectacularly skewering our pop-culture-obsessed society. What we said: It has heart, charm, steel, belly laughs and a gimlet eye. Get on it. Read the full review. 30 BoJack Horseman (Netflix) As it entered its final series, BoJack once again proved that adult animation could be just as hilarious and quietly devastating as any drama. While our titular horse is finally wrestling with his demons and looking for a way out of LA, there still seems to be a reckoning yet to come. What we said: BoJack Horseman has blossomed over the past five years from an unoriginal entertainment satire into something far richer and more profound. Read the full review. 31 Gentleman Jack (BBC One) Sally Wainwright travelled back in time for her latest piece of thrillingly human Yorkshire drama, the real life tale of Anne Lister. Suranne Jones has received rave reviews for her portrayal of the 19th-century industrialist and prolific diarist, who developed a code to hide her lesbianism. What we said: It\u2019s Regency Fleabag! Because the heroine occasionally breaks the fourth wall and exteriorises her inner monologue. But it\u2019s set in Halifax in 1832, so it could be Northern Jane Austen \u2026 You can afford to have a little fun with Gentleman Jack; Sally Wainwright clearly has. Read the full review. 32 This Way Up (Channel 4) A dark yet beautifully irreverent sadcom written by and starring comic Aisling Bea (with Sharon Horgan as her older sister), This Way Up breathed new life into the often staple themes of mental illness and difficult families with wicked wit and lashings of craic. What we said: The sisters\u2019 relationship is one of the show\u2019s most consistent joys, featuring conversations that switch between huge, bleak subjects and the mundane, before dissolving into considerations of dogs on the internet who look like Nicolas Cage. Read the full review. 33 Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History (BBC One) Darragh MacIntyre\u2019s staggering seven-part look at the historic unrest in Northern Ireland meticulously traced tensions from early discontent to horrendous, bloody conflict and on to the eventual peace process. 34 Broad City (Comedy Central) After five virtually flawless sitcom seasons, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson\u2019s millennial kweens went out the same way they came in: with gross-out gags, madcap surrealism and one of the greatest on-screen friendships in TV history. What we said: This season has given Abbi and Ilana the best possible send-off. It has been joyful, silly and wild, and while it feels like the perfect time to wrap up their adventures, it is poignant that they\u2019ve done so by reminding you just how good those can be. Read more. 35 Don\u2019t Forget the Driver (BBC Two) Pulling off a state-of-the-Brexit-nation series looked a tall order, but Toby Jones\u2019s comedy-drama was taller, finding humour and pathos in its tale of a coach driver who discovers a refugee hiding in the luggage compartment and a body washed up on the beach. What we said: If it is a comedy, it is one with the bleakest tragedy at its heart. But whatever label you put on it, it is a fine, fine piece of work. Read the full review. 36 Game of Thrones (HBO/Sky Atlantic) Whether you felt the final season of the Westerosi fantasy stuck the landing in a blaze of dragon fire or was one great coffee cup gaffe that should have been remade from the ground up, this was unquestionably the most talked about TV of the decade. What we said: The ending was true to the series\u2019 overall subject \u2013 war, and the pity of war \u2013 and, after doing a lot of wrong to several protagonists, it did right by those left standing. When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Overall, I think, it won. Read the full review. 37 The Capture (BBC One) With flashes of Jed Mercurio\u2019s Bodyguard, the BBC\u2019s deliciously paranoid primetime drama about a soldier accused of a horrendous crime and the authorities snooping on him proved that conspiracy theories sometimes do come true. What we said: Ben Chanan\u2019s surveillance thriller isn\u2019t just one of the most cleverly plotted dramas of recent years \u2013 it\u2019s also one of the most satisfying. Read the full review. 38 Surviving R Kelly (Lifetime/Crime+Investigation) A heartbreaking investigation into the decades of abuse by the R&amp;B star towards young and often vulnerable women, this six-part series was among the year\u2019s most hard-to-stomach but vital documentaries. What we said: All the young women who shared their stories with the world last week spoke of some of the most unimaginable harms a person could endure. Yet they still participated. Read more here. 39 Mindhunter (Netflix) David Fincher turned his talents to TV back in 2017 with this disquieting thriller set in the FBI\u2019s nascent Behavioural Science Unit, based on investigator Holden Ford\u2019s (Jonathan Groff) efforts to get into the heads of violent killers. Series two was equally gripping and even more disturbing, with a plot based around the real-life abductions of African American children in Atlanta. What we said: If you\u2019re going to indulge in a nasty crime drama, at least make it the classiest one on TV. Read the full review. 40 Watchmen (HBO/Sky Atlantic) A rare superhero tale infused with the tense racial politics of modern-day America, this HBO saga saw Regina King at her steely best as detective with a double life Angela Abar. Not your average comic book adaptation, and all the better for it. What we said: A bravura series that interrogates power, storytelling and the former embedded in the latter. Read the full review. 41 Line of Duty (BBC One) 2019 was the year that Jed Mercurio\u2019s cop corruption hit went fully mainstream, boosted by the huge success of his Whitehall thriller Bodyguard. While series five wasn\u2019t as light on its feet as previous runs, the nation was firmly gripped by Stephen Graham\u2019s star turn \u2013 and the possibility that H might have been right under our noses all along. What we said: As ever, nothing is wasted; not a scene, not a line, not a beat. For every morsel of information gathered by the team and by the viewer, another turn reveals 100 hidden possibilities. Read the full review. 42 Stranger Things (Netflix) Having thrilled viewers with its Spielbergian, Stephen King-flavoured brand of nostalgia, these days Netflix\u2019s shockfest isn\u2019t quite as novel as it once was. Even so, watching the gang grow into teenagers \u2013 and uncover a top-secret facility under the Hawkins shopping mall \u2013 added new intrigue to its third series. What we said: It\u2019s a slicker, pacier operation than the slightly sprawling previous season, and far more fun. Read the full review. 43 63 Up (ITV) The latest instalment in Michael Apted\u2019s groundbreaking series, which has followed a group of children from vastly different backgrounds throughout their lives since the age of seven. Now heading towards retirement age, the changes \u2013 from marriage breakups to reconciliations to the death of one of the cohort, Lynn \u2013 proved all the more poignant. What we said: Up makes other attempts to replicate the project \u2013 let alone the reality TV shows to which it is sometimes considered a precursor \u2013 seem trivial in comparison. Read the full review. 44 Seven Worlds, One Planet (BBC One) Another year, another epic Attenborough extravaganza. Seven Worlds upped the game once again, with its jaw-dropping cinematography and huge scale (41 countries featured, a crew of over 1,500 people) \u2013 plus an environmental message that was never far from the surface. What we said: As gorgeous, breathtaking, moving and harrowing as we have come to expect from this world-leading branch of the BBC. Read the full review. 45 Transparent: Musicale Finale (Amazon) They said it couldn\u2019t be done. After the show\u2019s lead, Jeffrey Tambor, was fired for accusations of sexual harassment on set, fans of Jill Soloway\u2019s bold exploration of sexuality, identity and Judaism in the Pfefferman family feared it would never return. But return it did, with a gobsmacking feature-length send-off including the most out-there closing number in musical history: Joyocaust (\u201cWe need a celebration of the soul / For this extermination Superbowl.\u201d) One thing\u2019s for sure: TV won\u2019t be this transgressive again any time soon. What we said: Some will feel it\u2019s too outrageously close to the bone, but this is what it means to take risks all the way to the final curtain. Read the full review. 46 Guilt (BBC Scotland) BBC Scotland\u2019s first original drama \u2013 a murder mystery kickstarted by a bungled hit-and-run \u2013 was an unexpected triumph of Hitchcockian twists, razor-sharp wit and the best sibling rivalry since Oasis. What we said: Writer Neil Forsyth has mapped out a tense noir story that spirals out in unexpected directions while reliably lacing the whole thing with withering one-liners. Read the full review. 47 The Curry House Kid (Channel 4) \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you run.\u201d So says feted dancer and choreographer Akram Khan at the start of this astounding one-off documentary, in which he confronts the racism he faced as the child of Bangladeshi restaurateurs, before creating a cathartic dance to honour his family\u2019s past. What we said: Threaded through this stirring narrative is the exquisite piece Khan creates in response, performed at the end in a disused Brick Lane warehouse. The choreography is extraordinary: expressive, dynamic and deeply moving. Read the full review. 48 The Last Survivors (BBC Two) Arthur Cary\u2019s thoughtful, wonderful and always dignified 90-minute documentary heard the stories of some of the last living people who survived concentration camps as children. Very important viewing indeed. What we said: For an hour and a half, I was crying, especially when Cary followed three generations of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz, knowing all the time that tears are not enough. Nor guilt. Read the full review. 49 World on Fire (BBC One) Peter Bowker\u2019s ambitious wartime drama, featuring both the burning home fires and the plight of families in Germany and Poland, was an emotional tour de force right to its flabbergastingly open ending. What we said: There is plenty of action, for those who want it, but this is far from the standard wartime miniseries. It is a beautifully turned ensemble piece, with everyone getting their time in the spotlight. Read the full review. 50 Killing Eve (BBC America/BBC iPlayer) Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s blackly comic assassin hit returned without the midas touch of its creator (who was busy working on the final series of Fleabag), but with more than enough wit and comic book-style action to keep fans satisfied. What we said: The core of its success \u2013 the relationship between Villanelle and Eve \u2013 remains intact and further torqued by events. It is still stylish, sexy and gorgeous.

      "bodyText": "Scott McIntyre, the former SBS sports reporter, will spend Christmas and new year in detention in Japan after he was arrested for illegal entry, reportedly during an attempt to track down his school-age children. McIntyre, an Australian freelance journalist based in Tokyo, was arrested on 28 November after allegedly gaining unauthorised access to the common area of the apartment building where his parents-in-law live. He had reportedly followed a resident into the building\u2019s main doors in an attempt to seek information from his in-laws on the whereabouts of his two children, whom he has not seen since May. McIntyre, who has been detained at a police station in western Tokyo since his arrest, was reportedly charged last week with illegal entry and now faces a further period in detention after his bail application was turned down this week, according to people familiar with his case. The 45-year-old is being held in a cell that is lit 24 hours a day. He is allowed to take a bath once every five days. \u201cHe is having trouble sleeping,\u201d Catherine Henderson, a friend in Tokyo who has visited McIntyre in detention three times, told the Guardian. \u201cHe knows how serious this is and he knows it\u2019s not good,\u201d she said, adding that the Australian government was aware of McIntyre\u2019s arrest. The power of Japanese prosecutors to detain suspects for up to 23 days for each potential charge and question them without their lawyers present attracted international criticism after the arrest in November last year of the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn. Ghosn, who is out on bail facing financial misconduct charges, was kept at Tokyo\u2019s main detention house for a total of 129 days before being released on bail for a second time in April. McIntyre made headlines in his native Australia in 2015 after he was sacked by SBS for posting controversial Anzac Daytweets critical of what he called the \u201ccultification [sic] of an imperialist invasion\u201d. \u201cRemembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these brave Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,\u201d he wrote in one tweet. \u201cWonder if the poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered,\u201d he said in another.

I\u2019m sometimes on the third page of results before I get to what I was really looking for. I\u2019m sure a few simple tips would find these results on page 1. All advice welcome. <strong>Michael</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Google achieved its amazing popularity by de-skilling search. Suddenly, people who were not very good at searching \u2013 which is almost everyone \u2013 could get good results without entering long, complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important, based on its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\">PageRank</a> algorithm, and it knew which pages were most effective, because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn\u2019t deliver what they wanted.</p> <p>Later, Google added personalisation based on factors such as your location, your previous searches, your visits to other websites, and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns, because your searches into physical and mental health issues, legal and social problems, relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else \u2013 or even a machine \u2013 to know.</p> <p>When talking about avoiding \u201c<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eric-schmidt-google-creepy_n_748915\">the creepy line</a>\u201d, former Google boss <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/10/googles-ceo-the-laws-are-written-by-lobbyists/63908/\">Eric Schmidt said</a>: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you\u2019ve been. We can more or less know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d</p> <p>Google hasn\u2019t got to that point, yet, but it does want to save you from typing. Today, Google does this through a combination of <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/how-google-autocomplete-works-search/\">auto-complete</a> search suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.seoclarity.net/google-answers-queries-15134/\">Answer Boxes</a>, and \u201c<a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/infinite-people-also-ask-boxes\">People also ask</a>\u201d boxes, which show related questions along with their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/what-are-featured-snippets/\">feature snippets</a>\u201d. As a result, Google is much less likely to achieve its stated aim of sending you to another website. According to Jumpshot research, about <a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/\">half of browser-based searches no longer result in a click</a>, and about 6% go to Google-owned properties such as YouTube and Maps.</p> <p>You could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic, but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers, not pages of links.</p> <p>So, I can give you some search tips, but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/jan/08/onlinesupplement\">January 2004</a> \u2013 or perhaps not for as long.</p> <h2><strong>Advanced Search for everyone</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179635d033f166034bbe0203e392608962ad77e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179635d033f166034bbe0203e392608962ad77e7/0_0_2997_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google\u2019s advanced search page is the tool to properly drill down into the results.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s advanced search page is the tool to properly drill down into the results.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/advanced_search\">Advanced Search page</a>, though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words, phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search, it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words).</p> <p>You can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language, region, website or domain, or to a type of file, how recently it was published and so on. Of course, nobody wants to fill in forms. However, using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below, and it\u2019s a fallback if you forget any.</p> <p>Happily, many commands work on other search engines too, so skills are transferable.</p> <h2><strong>Use quotation marks</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6733b3919712128aaa367d5bea998831280a2def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6733b3919712128aaa367d5bea998831280a2def/293_235_4759_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quotation marks can be a powerful tool to specify exact search terms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quotation marks can be a powerful tool to specify exact search terms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IKEA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you are looking for something specific, quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds, rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will, of course, ignore this, but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist, but you will get fewer or perhaps no results.</p> <p>Putting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect, and is useful for finding quotations, people\u2019s names, book and film titles, or particular phrases.</p> <p>You can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example, The Simpsons episode, Deep Space Homer, popularised the phrase: \u201cI for one welcome our new insect overlords\u201d. Searching for \u201cI for one welcome our new * overlords\u201d finds other overlords such as aliens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/17/evolution-octopus-fossils\">cephalopods</a>, computers, robots and squirrels.</p> <p>Nowadays, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-new-google-rankbrain-algorithm-234440\">RankBrain</a> is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks, even if they include \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words\">stop words</a>\u201d such as a, at, that, the and this. You don\u2019t need quotation marks to search for the Force, The Who or The Smiths.</p> <p>However, it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don\u2019t want than add terms that are already implied.

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s column mentioned search skills. I\u2019m sometimes on the third page of results before I get to what I was really looking for. I\u2019m sure a few simple tips would find these results on page 1. All advice welcome. Michael Google achieved its amazing popularity by de-skilling search. Suddenly, people who were not very good at searching \u2013 which is almost everyone \u2013 could get good results without entering long, complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important, based on its PageRank algorithm, and it knew which pages were most effective, because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn\u2019t deliver what they wanted. Later, Google added personalisation based on factors such as your location, your previous searches, your visits to other websites, and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns, because your searches into physical and mental health issues, legal and social problems, relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else \u2013 or even a machine \u2013 to know. When talking about avoiding \u201cthe creepy line\u201d, former Google boss Eric Schmidt said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you\u2019ve been. We can more or less know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d Google hasn\u2019t got to that point, yet, but it does want to save you from typing. Today, Google does this through a combination of auto-complete search suggestions, Answer Boxes, and \u201cPeople also ask\u201d boxes, which show related questions along with their \u201cfeature snippets\u201d. As a result, Google is much less likely to achieve its stated aim of sending you to another website. According to Jumpshot research, about half of browser-based searches no longer result in a click, and about 6% go to Google-owned properties such as YouTube and Maps. You could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic, but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers, not pages of links. So, I can give you some search tips, but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in January 2004 \u2013 or perhaps not for as long. Advanced Search for everyone The easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the Advanced Search page, though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words, phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search, it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words). You can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language, region, website or domain, or to a type of file, how recently it was published and so on. Of course, nobody wants to fill in forms. However, using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below, and it\u2019s a fallback if you forget any. Happily, many commands work on other search engines too, so skills are transferable. Use quotation marks If you are looking for something specific, quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds, rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will, of course, ignore this, but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist, but you will get fewer or perhaps no results. Putting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect, and is useful for finding quotations, people\u2019s names, book and film titles, or particular phrases. You can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example, The Simpsons episode, Deep Space Homer, popularised the phrase: \u201cI for one welcome our new insect overlords\u201d. Searching for \u201cI for one welcome our new * overlords\u201d finds other overlords such as aliens, cephalopods, computers, robots and squirrels. Nowadays, Google\u2019s RankBrain is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks, even if they include \u201cstop words\u201d such as a, at, that, the and this. You don\u2019t need quotation marks to search for the Force, The Who or The Smiths. However, it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don\u2019t want than add terms that are already implied. One example is jaguar -car. Use site commands Google also has a site: command that lets you limit your search to a particular website or, with a minus sign (-site:), exclude it. This command uses the site\u2019s uniform resource locator or URL. For example, if you wanted to find something on the Guardian\u2019s website, you would type site:theguardian.com (no space after the colon) alongside your search words. You may not need to search the whole site. For example, site:theguardian.com/technology/askjack will search the Ask Jack posts that are online, though it doesn\u2019t search all the ancient texts (continued on p94). There are several similar commands. For example, inurl: will search for or exclude words that appear in URLs. This is handy because many sites now pack their URLs with keywords as part of their SEO (search-engine optimisation). You can also search for intitle: to find words in titles. Web pages can include incidental references to all sorts of things, including plugs for unrelated stories. All of these will duly turn up in text searches. But if your search word is part of the URL or the title, it should be one of the page\u2019s main topics. You can also use site: and inurl: commands to limit searches to include, or exclude, whole groups of websites. For example, either site:co.uk or inurl:co.uk will search matching UK websites, though many UK sites now have .com addresses. Similarly, site:ac.uk and inurl:ac.uk will find pages from British educational institutions, while inurl:edu and site:edu will find American ones. Using inurl:ac.uk OR inurl:edu (the Boolean command must be in caps) will find pages from both. Using site:gov.uk will find British government websites, and inurl:https will search secure websites. There are lots of options for inventive searchers. Google Search can also find different types of file, using either filetype: or ext: (for file extension). These include office documents (docx, pptx, xlxs, rtf, odt, odp, odx etc) and pdf files. Results depend heavily on the topic. For example, a search for picasso filetype:pdf is more productive than one for stormzy.

      "body": "<p>Like many political neologisms, \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d became de rigueur so fast that it had multiple variations, passionate disciples, critics (some measured, others fierce) and endless namechecks before anyone had said definitively what it meant. The \u201cwhy\u201d was clear: after decades of the business-as-usual answer to the climate crisis, the environmental movement was more or less united in its conviction that more profound change was needed than awareness-raising and intergovernmental target setting. The precedent was Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/03/green-jobs\" title=\"\">New Deal of the 1930s</a>, with which he successfully combatted the Great Depression. But does this green version essentially correspond to the bid Jeremy Corbyn made for the Labour leadership in 2015: a national investment bank and 1m jobs in green energy, to simultaneously upskill the population and reach towards a zero-carbon economy? Or is it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/29/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-met-greta-thunberg-hope-contagious-climate\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>\u2019s vision of environmental justice wrapped into social justice, the private sector swept up in the enthusiasm of a radical state? Is it Keynesianism \u2013 except instead of digging the hole and filling it up, you put a tree in it? Or is it a plan so root-and-branch post-capitalist that none of the old words will do?</p> <p>These books by Ann Pettifor and Naomi Klein have similar titles and are similar, too, in respect of their urgency. Pettifor delivers a sober, technical but readable account of the framework, as she \u2013 among a handful of economists and/or environmentalists, including Richard Murphy (the main architect of Corbyn\u2019s 2015 programme), Larry Elliott (the Guardian\u2019s economics editor) and Jeremy Leggett (solar entrepreneur) laid it out more than a decade ago. It was devised in the wake of the global financial crash, which had two obvious effects: to give it an internationalist perspective, since never more than in 2008 were economists aware of the irrelevance of borders; and to put the focus squarely on systems, rather than individual actors.</p> <p>Pettifor\u2019s case is pretty straightforward: there is a climate crisis, and it may be too late to avert it, yet to surrender means nihilism. While she directs the occasional weary sideswipe at the climate-change denier, her true enemy is defeatism, and she is very convincing on this: whether or not the planet can be saved, there is no alternative but to try. In such a context money is no object, but it\u2019s not so much \u201cyou can\u2019t put a price on our habitat\u201d, rather it is the rallying cry of the heterodox economist, echoing Keynes, Roosevelt, through to US policy wonk Demond Drummer: \u201cwe can afford what we can do.\u201d Money is not a finite natural resource, handed us by the mountains or the seas: it is a social construct based on trust and cooperation, created through credit, which is itself backed by the toil of today\u2019s citizens, and the citizens of the future (an idea explored in her last, very readable book, <em>The Production of Money</em>) Deploying examples of the sheer limitlessness of money, when a government really puts its mind to it, Pettifor points to Roosevelt (a fascinating experiment in social ambition, with its own environmental element: over the nine years of the New Deal, 5% of the total male population was engaged in the Civilian Conservation Corps, planting among other things, 2bn trees). She also points to the Marshall plan, to the moon landings \u2013 all the classic examples of the hope genre, though given a different spin by climate catastrophe. If we can, as a species, muster all that effort, iconoclasm and single-mindedness just to get to the moon and have a poke about, imagine what we\u2019re capable of when our children\u2019s lives are at stake.</p> <p>Nothing will be realised, however, without systems change: the problem is not simply that \u201cprivate financial firms have for decades now displaced governments in the financing of \u2026 water, transport, education, housing, environmental services and health\u201d, leaving elected politicians without leverage or agency, and an electorate crying out for strength (hence the inexorable rise of the strongman). It is not just that governments are increasingly impotent in the face of \u201cdollarised financial capitalism shifted off-shore\u201d, powerless before speculative finance which demands high returns on low effort, and therefore is by definition extractive The block on progress is all those things, underpinned by something more fundamental: you cannot, as George Lakoff once spelt out, put profit in a cost benefit analysis against nature. Pettifor has a rare approach, both radical and intricate., and is never more enthusiastic than when she is spelling out the potentially transformative effects of a global transaction tax, or capital controls, or the management of interest rates by public authority, or an alternative to the dollar standard. She can persuade the reader to abandon growth as a goal in the blink of a page, and adopt instead the idea of an economic \u201cPlimsoll line\u201d (what\u2019s the most a vessel can carry before compromising its seaworthiness?). The book\u2019s purpose, though, is more than a manifesto for the climate, while stopping short of fully costed fixes it sets out to show which elements of the world as it is are incompatible with meaningful change, and how manageably (if not necessarily easily) they could be overturned. Quoting the American abolitionist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/22/narrative-life-frederick-douglass-american-slave-review\" title=\"\">Frederick Douglass</a>, Pettifor notes: \u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d220794280dfd6f7f66491a1df6c5f95fa392d15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d220794280dfd6f7f66491a1df6c5f95fa392d15/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooding in Lincolnshire, November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooding in Lincolnshire, November 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Robinson/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naomi Klein\u2019s <em>On Fire</em>, a collection of her environmental essays over the past decade, follows the same principles. There are differences in emphasis between the UK\u2019s Green New Deal and the US\u2019s \u2013 Britain\u2019s is oriented more internationally, the American version more focused on Roosevelt\u2019s template of transformation through social justice and democratic agency, which by definition is bordered. Fundamentally, though, their prescriptions are the same, and the depth and uniqueness of Klein\u2019s work is in the human beings she brings to the party. Philosophers, flood victims, students, conservationists \u2013 she has a reporting style that is rooted in her decades of activism; everybody\u2019s voice is given the same dignity, the same weight. This pluralism alone presents a vast horizon of possibility, a sense of limitless creative energy, all engaged on the same question. None of us is alone, and nor do we have to leave it all to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\"> Greta Thunberg</a>. This sweetens what is otherwise quite a bitter pill, a globe that knows its peril but can\u2019t respond. From the floods of Hebden Bridge to the fires of British Columbia, from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/19/children-as-young-as-seven-mining-cobalt-for-use-in-smartphones-says-amnesty\" title=\"\"> cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, the harder you look, the more cause there is to despair.</p> <p>Klein finds hope not in large motivational assertions, but in the detail: so she quotes the geophysicist Brad Werner, talking an audience through his computer modelled conclusion that \u201cglobal capitalism had made the depletion of resources so rapid, convenient and barrier-free that \u2018earth-human systems\u2019 were becoming dangerously unstable in response\u201d. When pressed by a journalist for a clear answer on the \u201care we fucked\u201d question, Werner set the jargon aside and replied: \u201cMore or less.\u201d Wait, though: there is one source of friction that could slow down and even derail the machine \u2013 mass resistance movements. Direct action by environmentalists, say; or hundreds of thousands of school children striking; resistance is not only germane to the dynamic, it is a powerful countervailing force. This isn\u2019t a book about heroes: Klein has an equally keen ear and roving eye for the deniers, the obstructionists, the defeatists, the status quo-ists. She creates vivid and terrifying portraits of the fossil fuel industry in full sail, of the Republican party completely subservient to it (this feels new and Trumpian, but isn\u2019t: Newt Gingrich unveiled the slogan \u201cDrill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less,\u201d in 2008), of the victims of corporate carelessness and catastrophic climate events. Klein can sink your spirits with an analogy: she draws a parallel between the extinction peril of \u201cmismatching\u201d\u2013 the process whereby \u201cwarming causes animals to fall out of step with a critical food source\u201d \u2013 and our own cultural mismatch, where the greatest collective action is required of us just as we are at our most socially atomised. Yet she can lift them again with a metaphor, a parable, the sight of a whale, the feeling of the wind.</p> <p>Pettifor works extremely hard to describe the mechanisms by which capitalism and corporatism created the climate crisis and, more recently, the degradation of democratic politics. Klein is bolder, tearing through these ideas \u2013 the connection between \u201cclimate crisis, wealth concentration and racialised violence\u201d, the \u201cviolence of othering in a warming world\u201d \u2013 on her way to somewhere both more urgent and more nourishing: the sites of resistance, and how each grain might turn into enough sand to stop the machine. These Green New Deals dovetail so well as companion works that they seem designed to be read together. Or is it simply that this is an idea whose time has come \u2013 not a moment too soon, and quite possibly too late?</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-case-for-the-green-new-deal-9781788738156.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Case for the Green New Deal</em></a><em> is published by Verso (RRP \u00a312.99);</em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/on-fire-9780241410721.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em> On Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal </em></a><em>is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Like many political neologisms, \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d became de rigueur so fast that it had multiple variations, passionate disciples, critics (some measured, others fierce) and endless namechecks before anyone had said definitively what it meant. The \u201cwhy\u201d was clear: after decades of the business-as-usual answer to the climate crisis, the environmental movement was more or less united in its conviction that more profound change was needed than awareness-raising and intergovernmental target setting. The precedent was Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal of the 1930s, with which he successfully combatted the Great Depression. But does this green version essentially correspond to the bid Jeremy Corbyn made for the Labour leadership in 2015: a national investment bank and 1m jobs in green energy, to simultaneously upskill the population and reach towards a zero-carbon economy? Or is it Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s vision of environmental justice wrapped into social justice, the private sector swept up in the enthusiasm of a radical state? Is it Keynesianism \u2013 except instead of digging the hole and filling it up, you put a tree in it? Or is it a plan so root-and-branch post-capitalist that none of the old words will do? These books by Ann Pettifor and Naomi Klein have similar titles and are similar, too, in respect of their urgency. Pettifor delivers a sober, technical but readable account of the framework, as she \u2013 among a handful of economists and/or environmentalists, including Richard Murphy (the main architect of Corbyn\u2019s 2015 programme), Larry Elliott (the Guardian\u2019s economics editor) and Jeremy Leggett (solar entrepreneur) laid it out more than a decade ago. It was devised in the wake of the global financial crash, which had two obvious effects: to give it an internationalist perspective, since never more than in 2008 were economists aware of the irrelevance of borders; and to put the focus squarely on systems, rather than individual actors. Pettifor\u2019s case is pretty straightforward: there is a climate crisis, and it may be too late to avert it, yet to surrender means nihilism. While she directs the occasional weary sideswipe at the climate-change denier, her true enemy is defeatism, and she is very convincing on this: whether or not the planet can be saved, there is no alternative but to try. In such a context money is no object, but it\u2019s not so much \u201cyou can\u2019t put a price on our habitat\u201d, rather it is the rallying cry of the heterodox economist, echoing Keynes, Roosevelt, through to US policy wonk Demond Drummer: \u201cwe can afford what we can do.\u201d Money is not a finite natural resource, handed us by the mountains or the seas: it is a social construct based on trust and cooperation, created through credit, which is itself backed by the toil of today\u2019s citizens, and the citizens of the future (an idea explored in her last, very readable book, The Production of Money) Deploying examples of the sheer limitlessness of money, when a government really puts its mind to it, Pettifor points to Roosevelt (a fascinating experiment in social ambition, with its own environmental element: over the nine years of the New Deal, 5% of the total male population was engaged in the Civilian Conservation Corps, planting among other things, 2bn trees). She also points to the Marshall plan, to the moon landings \u2013 all the classic examples of the hope genre, though given a different spin by climate catastrophe. If we can, as a species, muster all that effort, iconoclasm and single-mindedness just to get to the moon and have a poke about, imagine what we\u2019re capable of when our children\u2019s lives are at stake. Nothing will be realised, however, without systems change: the problem is not simply that \u201cprivate financial firms have for decades now displaced governments in the financing of \u2026 water, transport, education, housing, environmental services and health\u201d, leaving elected politicians without leverage or agency, and an electorate crying out for strength (hence the inexorable rise of the strongman). It is not just that governments are increasingly impotent in the face of \u201cdollarised financial capitalism shifted off-shore\u201d, powerless before speculative finance which demands high returns on low effort, and therefore is by definition extractive The block on progress is all those things, underpinned by something more fundamental: you cannot, as George Lakoff once spelt out, put profit in a cost benefit analysis against nature. Pettifor has a rare approach, both radical and intricate., and is never more enthusiastic than when she is spelling out the potentially transformative effects of a global transaction tax, or capital controls, or the management of interest rates by public authority, or an alternative to the dollar standard. She can persuade the reader to abandon growth as a goal in the blink of a page, and adopt instead the idea of an economic \u201cPlimsoll line\u201d (what\u2019s the most a vessel can carry before compromising its seaworthiness?). The book\u2019s purpose, though, is more than a manifesto for the climate, while stopping short of fully costed fixes it sets out to show which elements of the world as it is are incompatible with meaningful change, and how manageably (if not necessarily easily) they could be overturned. Quoting the American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Pettifor notes: \u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand.\u201d Naomi Klein\u2019s On Fire, a collection of her environmental essays over the past decade, follows the same principles. There are differences in emphasis between the UK\u2019s Green New Deal and the US\u2019s \u2013 Britain\u2019s is oriented more internationally, the American version more focused on Roosevelt\u2019s template of transformation through social justice and democratic agency, which by definition is bordered. Fundamentally, though, their prescriptions are the same, and the depth and uniqueness of Klein\u2019s work is in the human beings she brings to the party. Philosophers, flood victims, students, conservationists \u2013 she has a reporting style that is rooted in her decades of activism; everybody\u2019s voice is given the same dignity, the same weight. This pluralism alone presents a vast horizon of possibility, a sense of limitless creative energy, all engaged on the same question. None of us is alone, and nor do we have to leave it all to Greta Thunberg. This sweetens what is otherwise quite a bitter pill, a globe that knows its peril but can\u2019t respond. From the floods of Hebden Bridge to the fires of British Columbia, from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the harder you look, the more cause there is to despair. Klein finds hope not in large motivational assertions, but in the detail: so she quotes the geophysicist Brad Werner, talking an audience through his computer modelled conclusion that \u201cglobal capitalism had made the depletion of resources so rapid, convenient and barrier-free that \u2018earth-human systems\u2019 were becoming dangerously unstable in response\u201d. When pressed by a journalist for a clear answer on the \u201care we fucked\u201d question, Werner set the jargon aside and replied: \u201cMore or less.\u201d Wait, though: there is one source of friction that could slow down and even derail the machine \u2013 mass resistance movements. Direct action by environmentalists, say; or hundreds of thousands of school children striking; resistance is not only germane to the dynamic, it is a powerful countervailing force. This isn\u2019t a book about heroes: Klein has an equally keen ear and roving eye for the deniers, the obstructionists, the defeatists, the status quo-ists. She creates vivid and terrifying portraits of the fossil fuel industry in full sail, of the Republican party completely subservient to it (this feels new and Trumpian, but isn\u2019t: Newt Gingrich unveiled the slogan \u201cDrill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less,\u201d in 2008), of the victims of corporate carelessness and catastrophic climate events. Klein can sink your spirits with an analogy: she draws a parallel between the extinction peril of \u201cmismatching\u201d\u2013 the process whereby \u201cwarming causes animals to fall out of step with a critical food source\u201d \u2013 and our own cultural mismatch, where the greatest collective action is required of us just as we are at our most socially atomised. Yet she can lift them again with a metaphor, a parable, the sight of a whale, the feeling of the wind. Pettifor works extremely hard to describe the mechanisms by which capitalism and corporatism created the climate crisis and, more recently, the degradation of democratic politics. Klein is bolder, tearing through these ideas \u2013 the connection between \u201cclimate crisis, wealth concentration and racialised violence\u201d, the \u201cviolence of othering in a warming world\u201d \u2013 on her way to somewhere both more urgent and more nourishing: the sites of resistance, and how each grain might turn into enough sand to stop the machine. These Green New Deals dovetail so well as companion works that they seem designed to be read together. Or is it simply that this is an idea whose time has come \u2013 not a moment too soon, and quite possibly too late? \u2022 The Case for the Green New Deal is published by Verso (RRP \u00a312.99); On Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Australia recorded its hottest day on record on Wednesday, with an average maximum temperature of 41.9C (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set only 24 hours earlier. Tuesday 16 December recorded an average of 40.9C across the continent, beating the previous record of 40.3C set on 7 January 2013. But it held the record for just 24 hours. Wednesday was even hotter across the country, with the highest maximum temperature reached in Birdsville, Queensland, which hit 47.7C (117.8). On Wednesday the lowest maximum was 19C at Low Head, Tasmania. On Thursday, Nullarbor in South Australia set the record for the hottest December day on record, recording 49.9C (121.8). To calculate the average maximum, the Bureau of Meteorology takes the maximum temperatures recorded in about 700 locations, puts them into a grid, calculates an average, and then cross-checks this against its long-term quality controlled record, known as ACORN-SAT. So why is Australia so hot? Dr Karl Braganza, manager climate monitoring at the bureau, told Guardian Australia: \u201cNatural variability and global warming are pushing in the same direction. That\u2019s why we have broken records.\u201d It\u2019s not \u2018only natural\u2019 Dr Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, identified three key factors that have pushed temperatures to record levels \u2013 two of them natural, and one of them not. Australia is currently feeling the impacts of one of the strongest Indian Ocean Dipole events on record. When the IOD is positive, the waters off Australia\u2019s north-west are cooler, dragging moisture away from the continent and leaving very dry conditions. On the flipside, Watkins said parts of east Africa had seen devastating impacts from flooding rains, in particular in Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan. \u201cThat positive IOD has kept things very dry in winter and spring,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThat sets us up with an extremely dry environment. It has been the second driest year to date and the warmest year to date.\u201d A second natural driver, Watkins said, was a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode that was kicked off by warming of the atmosphere high above Antarctica. The SAM had helped drive the extreme heat in NSW and Queensland, Watkins said, adding to the extreme fire danger. This has also brought drier and warmer air across the continent on westerly winds. SAM events usually only last a few weeks, but Watkins said this event had been present since October. \u201cAll of this is leading to central Australia baking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there to evaporatively cool the air.\u201d He said an example of this heat was revealed in forecast temperatures in recent days of between 43C and 45C for Alice Springs. \u201cWhen I see those forecasts I say, \u2018wow.\u2019 Because Alice Springs is 550m above sea level. 45C half a kilometre up is pretty insane. \u201cMeteorologists will say that you get roughly 1C per 100m of elevation so we know that means the air at the surface would have been in the high 40s.\u201d Climate change pushing heat Underlying these two major drivers of the heat is climate change \u2013 the simple physics of loading the atmosphere with extra greenhouse gases, mainly by burning fossil fuels. Australia\u2019s latest State of the Climate report shows the country has warmed by just over 1C since 1910, leading to more extreme events. Watkins said: \u201cThat long-term warming sees the bar lifted up so that it\u2019s easier to get extreme conditions now than it was 50 or 100 years ago,\u201d \u201cOne part of me says that this is amazing but then another says that we have seen this in other parts of the world so we\u2019re not especially surprised.\u201d He pointed to France\u2019s heatwave of June 2019, when Montpellier hit 43.5C, breaking its previous all-time heat record set in August 2017 by a huge 5.8C. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we are shocked by much any more.\u201d Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales specialising in extreme events, said climate change had given the natural drivers of Australia\u2019s record -breaking heat \u201cextra sting.\u201d She said without the extra CO2 in the atmosphere \u201cit would still have been warm\u201d, but, she added: \u201cI doubt very much we would have seen a record on Tuesday and then another one on Wednesday.

In a moment that quickly went viral, the House speaker appeared to sternly silence House Democrats who began to applaud as she announced the final vote on the first of two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. Pelosi has emphasized throughout the day that Wednesday\u2019s vote was a \u201csad\u201d occasion, and had reportedly instructed her caucus not to appear celebratory of the inevitable result. Wearing a large pin of the ceremonial mace of the chamber as she spoke on the House floor on Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi said it was \u201ctragic\u201d that the president\u2019s reckless actions make impeachment necessary. \u201cHe gave us no choice,\u201d she said. The House voted 230-197 to approve a first article of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power, with one \u201cpresent\u201d vote. A second article charging Trump with obstruction of Congress was approved 229-198. The historic vote made Trump only the third president in US history to be impeached. The impeachment inquiry has been a legacy-defining moment of Pelosi\u2019s long career. For months she resisted calls for impeachment from her own party, before changing her position after a whistleblower complaint detailed Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president Joe Biden.

In the original short story, <em>Martin\u2019s Close</em>, James\u2019s narrator is puzzled by a piece of enclosed yet overgrown land in a West Country village. His research sends him back to a murder trial in the 17th century before the infamous hanging judge, Judge Jeffreys. George Martin is accused of killing a young woman who was obsessed with him, yet she has been seen after he is supposed to have killed her.

While featuring some settings that would tempt any TV producer \u2013 a spookily abandoned country house with its overgrown garden, an isolated French monastery \u2013 the text presents some challenges. It will be intriguing to see how the adapters translate the chilling subjectivity of this first-person narrative. The story is told by a book dealer called Adam Snow, played by Douglas Henshall, whose supernatural experiences are mostly feelings and impressions. One key moment occurs in the narrator\u2019s mind while he is sitting in a traffic jam.</p> <p>The ghost-free adaptations are mostly aimed at children. Worzel Gummidge, the animated scarecrow who first walked and talked in a series of novels by Barbara Euphan Todd, returns to our screens, perhaps stirring the memories of parents who watched the TV version starring Jon Pertwee that aired from 1979. This is clearly a labour of love by Mackenzie Crook, who has written and directed the two hour-long films, as well as taking the title role. The publicity tells us that it now has an \u201cenvironmental message\u201d, with which Todd, a lover of the English countryside, might well have been happy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3427c1c98cd2da6ac1659beacddafb4cd2a8387e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3427c1c98cd2da6ac1659beacddafb4cd2a8387e/0_30_1662_997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Snail and the Whale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off to save the day \u2026 <em>The Snail and the Whale.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magic Light/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Owen Sheers\u2019s TV adaptation of Michael Morpurgo\u2019s <em>Mimi and the Mountain Dragon</em> seems seasonally appropriate. It is based on the author\u2019s observation of a Swiss mountain tradition, where children parade in red hats to frighten off any wicked spirits. The BBC will show an animated version with a score by Rachel Portman performed by the BBC Philharmonic orchestra. After lunch on Christmas Day itself, conscientious or desperate parents will be able to settle down with smaller children to watch an adaptation of Julia Donaldson\u2019s narrative-in-rhyme <em>The Snail and the Whale</em>, illustrated by Axel Scheffler. The snail gets to see the world by hitching a ride with a friendly whale. The whale is huge and powerful, but the snail will save the day. It will be the latest in a sequence of adaptations of children\u2019s books by this pair, which began with <em>The Gruffalo</em>, first shown on Christmas Day 2009. And on Channel 4, <em>The Tiger Who Came to Tea</em>, the classic by Judith Kerr, who died this year, will air on Christmas Eve. David Walliams narrates, with Benedict Cumberbatch, Tamsin Greig and David Oyelowo providing voices, and songs performed by Robbie Williams.</p> <p>Absences are perhaps worth noting too. No Agatha Christie! A sequence of four inventive, no-expense-spared adaptations by Sarah Phelps began with <em>And Then There Were None</em>, broadcast in 2015. Phelps has been working on a two-part dramatisation of Christie\u2019s <em>The Pale Horse</em>, but sadly we will have to wait a little longer to watch Rufus Sewell playing amateur investigator Mark Easterbrook. In the meantime, there is always Cluedo.</p>",

The snail gets to see the world by hitching a ride with a friendly whale. The whale is huge and powerful, but the snail will save the day. It will be the latest in a sequence of adaptations of children\u2019s books by this pair, which began with The Gruffalo, first shown on Christmas Day 2009. And on Channel 4, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, the classic by Judith Kerr, who died this year, will air on Christmas Eve. David Walliams narrates, with Benedict Cumberbatch, Tamsin Greig and David Oyelowo providing voices, and songs performed by Robbie Williams. Absences are perhaps worth noting too. No Agatha Christie! A sequence of four inventive, no-expense-spared adaptations by Sarah Phelps began with And Then There Were None, broadcast in 2015. Phelps has been working on a two-part dramatisation of Christie\u2019s The Pale Horse, but sadly we will have to wait a little longer to watch Rufus Sewell playing amateur investigator Mark Easterbrook. In the meantime, there is always Cluedo.",

Peer-to-peer travel It\u2019s estimated that, on any given night, 2 million people are staying in an Airbnb rental.

In 2016, Airbnb further capitalised on this wish to go beyond the tourist traps by launching its own range of \u201cExperiences\u201d with local guides, offering everything from bar crawls in Barcelona to pasta-making lessons with Italian grandmas. The success of Airbnb has inspired dozens of imitators, with peer-to-peer equivalents for every travel need, whether it be camping (campspace.com), yacht sharing (borrowaboat.com) or currency exchange (weswap.com). Inevitably, with such rapid growth came some snags: stories of dodgy hosts, dodgy guests, inferior accommodation, last-minute cancellations and fake reviews. There has also been growing unease about the impact Airbnb has had on rents in cities such as Barcelona, with landlords able to make more money from short-term guests than long-term rentals. But despite critics\u2019 complaints that Airbnb is changing the nature of the very neighbourhoods it aims to celebrate, there are no signs that the bubble is about to burst.

Camping to glamping According to Google Trends, the word glamping first appeared as a search term in 2007, but the trend for posh camping really took off in the past decade. By 2016 it had earned an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. The first glampsites comprised a smattering of tipis or yurts in a field \u2013 essentially, camping holidays for people who didn\u2019t want to put up their own tents \u2013 but intensifying competition has upped the ante. In recent years anything from retired ambulances to old shipping containers have been pressed into service, and the quest for novelty reached new heights, literally, in 2017, when glamping specialist Canopy and Stars suspended a cabin from a cargo crane above Bristol harbour. The company, which launched in 2010 and now offers 700 places to stay, says it has seen a 30% increase in bookings for next year, with treehouses the most popular option. The trend is showing no signs of slowing down, as more of us look to switch off from digital devices and reconnect to nature, if only for a weekend. Research carried out by Pinterest on the most popular search terms this year showed that one of the biggest leaps was for \u201cbushcraft camping\u201d, which jumped by more than 1000% year on year. The wellness revolution Earlier this year, the legendary Ibiza party hotel Pikes \u2013 whose swimming pool was the backdrop for Wham\u2019s Club Tropicana video back in 1983 \u2013 announced that it would be running its first spring fitness retreat, the three-night Rockovery, in May. It was a seminal moment \u2013 proof that \u201cwellness\u201d had indeed become the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll. The island\u2019s decision to reinvent itself as a holistic holiday destination was a shrewd one. Wellness tourism is big business, and growing faster than any other sector of the travel industry. Once the preserve of dedicated health resorts and retreats, it has gone mainstream, from fitness bootcamps in the Algarve to mindful skiing in the Alps. Perhaps one of the biggest shifts has been \u201cwellness\u201d moving out of the hotel basement and into the great outdoors. Where once a spa break meant shuffling in white towelling slippers between hot tub, sauna and massage table, now it\u2019s all about reconnecting with nature and enjoying mindful exercise. Forest bathing, stargazing and wood-fired hot tubs are replacing gyms and infinity pools as selling points. The Finn Lough resort near Enniskillen in County Fermanagh is a good example of the new breed of low-key holistic retreats: here guests follow a trail through the grounds, stopping off at a lakeside hot tub, an aromatherapy sauna or a woodland shower. The desire to escape our sedentary, switched-on lives is also driving the growth of fitness and wellbeing festivals, such as the Big Retreat in Pembrokeshire, which, as well as yoga, Pilates and circuit training, offers cookery classes, tai chi and wild swimming. With Google Trends reporting that searches for \u201cwellness retreats\u201d have increased by 182%, this isn\u2019t a fad that\u2019s going away any time soon. Experiential holidays Experiences are the new luxury. Rather than splashing their cash on designer goods, people with disposable income are choosing to spend it on \u201ctransformational experiences\u201d. Whether it\u2019s learning to cook with immigrants from Asia, Europe and South America in their New York City homes or joining a reforestation programme in the Amazon, travellers are looking for more meaningful interactions with locals and for immersive experiences that go beyond ticking off the usual sightseeing spots. Tour operators are catching on to the trend. Scott Dunn recently launched its own \u201cexperiential\u201d portfolio, offering a range of personalised activities, from perfume-making workshops in Paris to taiko drumming lessons in Tokyo. Hoteliers are also starting to respond to these consumer shifts. It\u2019s no longer enough to offer a comfortable bed, a decent breakfast and an eye-catching design; the new breed of \u201clifestyle\u201d hotels are courting their guests with the promise of immersion into a neighbourhood, a chance to mingle with locals and a menu of enriching activities. The Whitworth Locke, which opened last year in a former cotton mill near Manchester\u2019s Canal Street, is a perfect example of this new hybrid of accommodation and culture hub. Before guests have even picked up their room key, they\u2019re plunged into a world of exciting possibilities. Free yoga class? Painting workshop? Browsing the homewares and houseplants for sale in the lobby? Dining on Mexican street food in the pop-up restaurant? With a new emphasis on informality and authenticity, it appears that traditional tourism providers, be they hotel chains or tour operators, are finally starting to learn from the successes of their peer-to-peer rivals and, in doing so, creating a new template for tourism. If they\u2019re going to survive the next decade, it\u2019s a lesson they\u2019ll need to score full marks in. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

My name is Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the Guardian\u2019s top stories this Thursday.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/trump-impeachment-house-vote-nancy-pelosi-latest\">only the third US president to be impeached</a> amid a highly charged partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill in Washington. After a full day of debate, the House of Representatives voted<strong> </strong>230-197 to approve a first article of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and 229-198 for a second article charging the president with obstruction of Congress. Trump will now go on trial in the Senate, probably starting in January, but he is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled upper house. Trump learned of the vote while addressing a rally in Michigan. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/trump-impeachment-supporters-michigan-rally\">Supporters said the charges were \u201cmade up\u201d</a> but the president told them he was sure that senators would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d.</p> \n<p>The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said the president had endangered the republic and its elections with his reckless behaviour and had \u201cgiven us no choice\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When the French entrepreneur Jacques Mouflier visited the remote Alpine village of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re in 1935, he saw the future before him. \u201cA miracle is going to happen,\u201d Mouflier told his young son, as he gestured towards the mountains encircling the village. \u201cSki champions from every country will come to compete where we\u2019re standing right now.\u201d</p> <p>He was right. In 1948 Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re produced France\u2019s first Olympic ski champion, and ever since, professional athletes have flocked to the village, which sits 1,850 metres above sea level, to train and compete. They are joined by tens of thousands of amateurs. Last year the resort sold 1.3m ski \u201cdays\u201d to tourists, and more Britons visit Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re each year than any other ski resort in the world.</p> <p>For a long time, the source of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re\u2019s enduring attraction \u2013 aside from its almost oppressively picturesque surroundings, five-star hotels and 300km of pistes, each one as groomed as a Surrey garden \u2013 has been that it is, in the parlance of the skiing industry, \u201csnow certain\u201d. Year in and year out, the arrival of the first snowfall, in mid-November, was as reliable as a Swiss watch. In 1955, when the resort began hosting an annual ski competition called the Crit\u00e9rium de la Premi\u00e8re Neige (\u201cthe competition of the first snow\u201d), its organisers boasted that Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re was the only French resort able to guarantee snow throughout December.</p> <p>Villagers claim to be able to predict the year\u2019s coming snowfall by the berries on the local<strong> </strong>rowan<strong> </strong>trees. Plump clumps in summer promise deep snow in winter. For decades, the branches drooped under the berries\u2019 weight. But in the mid-1980s, locals began to notice a change. The date of the first snowfall began to drift later. Patches of bare ground appeared on slopes that, in previous years, had been covered in an uninterrupted white drift. Some ski seasons would have an abundance of snow; others, a scarcity. More consistent was the retreat of the Pissaillas glacier, whose run-off water feeds the surrounding forests; each year it withdrew a little farther up the Pointe du Montet mountain, which dominates the jagged horizon. By 2014, snow was arriving so late to Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re that, for the first time in its history, the Crit\u00e9rium de la Premi\u00e8re Neige was relocated, to a more snow-reliable resort in Sweden.</p> <p>For reasons scientists don\u2019t fully understand, the Alps are warming faster than the global average. The 1.4C rise in the average global temperature since the end of the 19th century has translated into a 2C rise in the Alps. In the past hundred years, the number of hours that sunshine hits the mountains each year has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29245606\" title=\"\">increased by 20%</a>. The heat and light cause snow to melt, or not to fall at all. In 2017 the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research recorded that less snow fell in the Alps during the winter months than in any year since 1874. In April a report by the European Geosciences Union showed that 90% of glacier volume in the Alps \u2013 an essential source of drinking water, crop irrigation and ski runs \u2013 could be lost by the end of this century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/13/snow-machines-and-fleece-blankets-inside-the-ski-industrys-battle-with-climate-change\">Snow machines and fleece blankets: inside the ski industry\u2019s battle with climate change \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the Alpine ski industry, which hosts 35% of the world\u2019s ski resorts across eight countries, and serves an estimated 120 million tourists each year, this is potentially an extinction-level event. Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re is one of the mountain range\u2019s highest resorts, so it will be one of the last to feel the full effects of the climate catastrophe. But farther down the mountains, the disappearance of snow has already begun to devastate the ski industry, as well as the communities that rely on it.</p> <p>Since 1960, the average snow season has shortened by 38 days, while \u201cseasonal drift\u201d has pushed the coldest weather from December to the early months of the year, throwing the ski season out of sync with the lucrative Christmas holidays. In November 2017 the EU launched the Prosnow project, whereby scientists advise Alpine resorts on how to \u201cmaintain the same season duration with 30% less snow\u201d. Such efforts have not been entirely successful. According to some reports, as many as 200 ski resorts now stand abandoned across the Alps, where bankrupt hotels have been left unoccupied, and forsaken ski lifts dangle in the wind.</p> <p>The disaster encroaching on Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re has been obvious to Olivier Simonin, the director of tourism at the resort, since the infamous 2006-7 season, when a scarcity of snow caused a 7% decline in revenues across Alpine resorts. This September, for the first time, the French ski industry\u2019s main union, Domaines Skiables de France, held an emergency meeting of directors from France\u2019s most important resorts to discuss the existential challenges they face. Twenty-five directors attended the meeting, which was held in the valley of Chamb\u00e9ry. The mood, according to Simonin, was sombre. \u201cThis is now the main topic of conversation among us,\u201d said Simonin. \u201cNobody wants to die.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike the islanders of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/waiting-for-the-tide-to-turn-kiribatis-fight-for-survival\" title=\"\">Kiribati</a>, whose homes will be swallowed by the Pacific Ocean in the coming years, or the farmers of rural Bangladesh, whose crops fail whenever their fields are flooded by saltwater, the Alpine ski industry, which turns over billions of euros every year, is disproportionately well-equipped to fight for its survival. And resorts like Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re have invested tens of millions of euros in the most straightforward solution imaginable: when the snow stops falling, it\u2019s time to make your own.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u201cYou need four things to make snow,\u201d Pierre Mattis told me in September as we toured the control centre of the snow-making operation he runs in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cWater, air, cold and talent.\u201d One morning in 1995, Mattis, who was then a 28-year-old ski-lift engineer, was told he was being redeployed to look after the resort\u2019s handful of snow machines. Four years later, he began building his snow-making factory, or <em>atelier neige</em>, installing a 70km network of pipes beneath the mountain that now, after years of expansion and improvement, can cover 65 sq km of slopes in artificial snow at the touch of a button. It is one of the most sophisticated snow-making operations in the world.</p> <p>The first snow-making machines in Europe appeared in Italy in the early 1980s, just before the locals in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re began to notice the seasons shifting. (In 1963 snow-making equipment was installed at Mar Lodge in Scotland, but the project was abandoned after two seasons as the water kept freezing.) As winters with unreliable snow became more common in the Alps, so did the machines. Most were based on a design by a Pennsylvanian man named Herman K Dupr\u00e9, who in 1968 had fitted a water sprinkler to an air compressor system he bought at a scrapyard. Dupr\u00e9 pumped the air and water at high pressure through a lance-like nozzle to create a fine spray that, at sufficiently low temperatures, turned to snow before it hit the ground. The HKD snowmaking system, as Dupr\u00e9 named his invention, became the industry standard. The first one arrived in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re not long before the snow-scarce winter of 1986.</p> <p>Warm winters had occurred before the mid-1980s, Robert Steiger, an economist and tourism researcher at the University of Innsbruck, told me, \u201cbut at that time Alpine communities had not been so dependent on ski tourism.\u201d Today, 95% of Italian, 70% of Austrian, 65% of French and half of Swiss ski resorts are reliant on snow machines for their continued survival, according to estimates from Claus Dangel, CEO of B\u00e4chler, a snow-machine maker that supplies more than 200 resorts across the Alps.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of technology, water and energy to manufacture the amount of snow that might have naturally blanketed the Alps two or three generations ago. Mattis\u2019s control centre in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re is housed in a cavern chiselled into the mountainside, like the bunker of a Bond villain. It is large enough to house some 40 double-decker buses, and home to six 10ft tall pumps, water filters, and a phalanx of computer screens \u2013 all maintained by Mattis\u2019s 12-member \u201csnow team\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"470342f99722b411f18b97f39412dfbd5da03372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/470342f99722b411f18b97f39412dfbd5da03372/0_382_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snow cannon in the Swiss Alps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snow cannon in the Swiss Alps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Parkin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using software developed in-house, the team controls a vast network of snow machines via a bank of 10 computers. Like the timer on a boiler, the software allows the team to set \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d periods for the snow machines, ensuring a consistent covering of snow throughout the season. Forecasts fed into the bunker from weather stations on the mountains help the team to adjust their schedules. During the ski season, three people monitor the system throughout the night, like security guards watching over a bank vault. They check the correct positions of the cannons in relation to the prevailing wind, watch the quality of snow, and ensure that the pump rooms are working satisfactorily. If a patch of ground appears in the melting snow, they can cover it before sunrise.</p> <p>The snow is shot on to the mountains at a speed of 250km/h via 650 snow cannons. Ten years ago the cannons could be spaced 80 metres apart from one another and still create an unbroken blanket of snow, but climate change has since forced Mattis to cut that distance in half. The system has to be continually upgraded to keep pace with the effects of climate change. The current iteration was completed in 2014 at a cost of \u20ac2m, and can produce 8,000 cubic metres of snow per hour \u2013 eight times the capacity of five years ago. The plant is one of the largest in the Alps, and differs from most of its rivals in that all of the equipment (bar HKD\u2019s nozzles, which are imported from Quebec) was designed in-house. Mattis claims his system is unique as it allows the team to control the density of the snow on a sliding 10-point scale, enabling him to create a more compact, \u201cfaster\u201d snow, ideal for professional competitions.</p> <p>This technology comes at a major financial and ecological cost. Today, one in every 20 euros spent anywhere in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re goes into the snow factory, covering energy costs, staffing, maintenance and upgrades (a hidden \u201cartificial snow\u201d tax that is continually increasing). Although snow machines are becoming increasingly efficient, a typical snowmaker still uses about the same amount of energy as a boiler in a family home. When multiplied into the tens of thousands across the Alps, snowmakers become something of a self-defeating invention: they worsen and sustain the climate problems they\u2019re supposed to solve.</p> <p>And yet, for life in the Alps as we\u2019ve come to know it, they remain essential. Steiger\u2019s most recent simulations suggest that unless every ski resort in the Alps installs state-of-the-art snowmaking facilities like the ones Mattis operates at Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, by the 2050s up to half will no longer be able to sustain their businesses. Only the wealthiest resorts, like Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re \u2013 where chalets can sell for more than \u20ac23,000 per sq metre, five times the average cost of property in London\u2019s most expensive borough, Kensington and Chelsea \u2013 are able to make the necessary investments to continually update and retool their snow-making facilities.</p> <p>Less-moneyed resorts rely on a cheaper source \u2013 snow farming, whereby snow is gathered or made in January and February, when manufacturing snow costs less than in warmer months. The snow is then placed under a 40cm layer of wood chippings, which absorb and release moisture and keep the snow cool, compact and manageable during the summer months. The wood chippings are then removed at the end of October, allowing the snow to be deployed on the slopes in time for the skiing season.</p> <p>Artificial snow, be it farmed or sprayed, is not only the would-be saviour of the ski industry, however. This is a region where, as the International Commission for the Protection of the Alps, Cipra, puts it, \u201cthere is an urgent need for innovative ideas and solutions\u201d. One Dutch professor believes artificial snow may also hold the key to saving glaciers, in the Alps and beyond \u2013 along with the communities that rely on them for their food and water.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On the morning of 11 July 2000, after a night of unexpectedly heavy summer snow, Hans Oerlemans went to check his weather station on the Morteratsch glacier, near the village of Pontresina, Switzerland, 400km north-east of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. The Morteratsch is one of the largest glaciers in the Alps, and a popular attraction for sightseers and thrill-seekers, many of whom come to ski along its 6km back. Since 1860, though, the glacier has shrunk by 2.5km \u2013 an average of nearly 16 metres per year.</p> <p>Oerlemans believes lessons learned by studying the Morteratsch can aid anyone interested in saving snow and ice across the Alps. A Dutchman who grew up in Utrecht, Oerlemans is tall and handsome, and wears the thin-rimmed glasses of a Hollywood therapist (studiously removing them for photographs). He has been studying glaciers since 1980, when he earned his PhD from Utrecht University, where he is an emeritus professor. His weather station on the Morteratsch, which he personally built in 1995, was one of the first in the world designed to measure the effects of climate change on glaciers. By monitoring the Morteratsch\u2019s vital signs \u2013 fluctuations in the depth and temperature of its ice, as well as the ambient humidity \u2013 he hoped to solve a number of basic, yet unanswered, questions. \u201cIf the climate becomes one degree warmer,\u201d he told me recently, \u201cwhat happens close to the surface of a glacier: do you have 1 metre more of ice melt, or 10cm, or 10 metres? Nobody knew.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bfb4d355f23a504de61d1124116ea7f82a3888b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb4d355f23a504de61d1124116ea7f82a3888b7/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hans Oerlemans in the Swiss Alps.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hans Oerlemans in the Swiss Alps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Parkin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Oerlemans crested the mountain that overlooks the Morteratsch that July morning two decades ago, he expected to see the glacier in its state of typical summer resplendence \u2013 a great frozen river, flowing in imperceptible slow-mo down the mountain. Instead, he saw nothing but snow, covering the glacier in a half-metre-deep drift. In the weeks that followed, he noticed something even more surprising in the weather station readings: the glacier\u2019s thaw had halted almost entirely.</p> <p>Two processes melt ice: the transfer of heat from warm air, and solar radiation from the sun. Oerlemans\u2019s readings suggested that the latter had a much greater effect than scientists previously understood. The covering of snow from the unseasonable summer storm had apparently acted as a reflective shield, fending off enough solar radiation that it was equivalent to dropping the air temperature by a full degree. He wrote up his findings in a paper published in 2004 by the International Glaciological Society. Then, for a while, he put what happened to the back of his mind.</p> <p>This autumn, as Oerlemans and I took a bobbing cable car up to a viewing station overlooking the glacier and mountain-top restaurant \u2013 home to \u201cprobably the most expensive plate of spaghetti in Europe,\u201d he said \u2013 he explained what happened next. About five years after his paper was published, the villagers in Pontresina learned about an experiment in which polyester fleece has been used to cover snow to preserve it during warm weather. They laid the fleece on to the glacier in two-metre wide strips, like a blanket shorn from a massive sheep. \u201cThey put it out in the middle of May, and covered the ice till September,\u201d he said. Not only did the fleece blanket stall the effects of melting, it actually reversed them: measurements showed that, over the course of the summer, ice in some of the areas under the fleece grew in thickness by up to two metres.</p> <p>When news of this ice reversal reached Oerlemans, he immediately thought of the weather station reports following the heavy snow drift in July 2000. If it were possible to cover a glacier in a protective barrier during the spring and summer months, might this counteract a century of decline? \u201cThe scale is totally different,\u201d Oerlemans recalled. \u201cYou could not use fleece on a glacier the size of the Morteratsch, which moves, because it will be destroyed quickly. But, I thought: it might just be possible to use artificial snow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71c39026b7358dbf77826f08dad513192ed52316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c39026b7358dbf77826f08dad513192ed52316/0_359_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hans Oerlemans with the Morteratsch glacier in the Swiss Alps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oerlemans at the Morteratsch glacier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Parkin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To test the theory, in the summer of 2017 Oerlemans and his team sprayed a 2.5 metre-deep blanket of artificial snow over a small section of the Diavolezzafirn glacier, one of the Morteratsch\u2019s diminutive neighbours. The experiment, which ran to the autumn, was successful: further melting was prevented, and in some places the ice even grew.</p> <p>With positive results in hand, Oerlemans and his collaborators began to consider the much greater challenge of how to blast a sufficient amount of artificial snow over the much larger expanse of the Morteratsch. Snow cannons such as those installed in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re could not be placed on to the glacier, as they would be caught in the slow-moving current of the ice and torn from their pipes.</p> <p>Instead, Oerlemans and his colleague Felix Keller considered using a cable car equipped with a snow machine to travel above the glacier, dropping artificial snow as it went. (Oerlemans and Keller\u2019s partnership is not short on creative thinking \u2013 the pair also play in a two-piece tango band called Tango Glaciar and often splice musical performances into their lectures on glacial retreat; once they even performed on a glacier, which one onlooker drolly likened to the musicians on the Titanic stubbornly playing while the ship sank.) This idea stalled when it came to supplying a moving cable car with the necessary water to make the snow. Finally, in a eureka moment, the team settled on an ingenious invention: a \u201csnow rope\u201d, stretched in a zigzag pattern across the width of the glacier, hundreds of feet across. Acting like a sprinkler system, the rope could deposit snow from altitude while the glacier trundled conveyor belt-like beneath it.</p> <p>After two years of preparatory studies, finding willing engineering partners and filing patents, on 1 October 2019 Oerleman received a 2m Swiss franc grant from the Swiss Innovation Agency to begin work on his extravagant snow blanket scheme. \u201cWe have passed the point of no return,\u201d Oerlemans told me. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just theory; it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On a warm morning this past summer, I hiked with Hans Oerlemans along a dirt path from the village of Pontresina up to the Morteratsch glacier. Perhaps to convince sceptical visitors of the scale of the Morteratsch\u2019s retreat, the village council had erected 2.5 metre-tall markers along the path to show how far downhill the tip of the glacier stretched in certain years. With an accumulating sense of dread, we walked from the marker for 1865, which sits close to a car park at the base of the mountain, and past the ones for 1940, 1960, 1980. The farther we walked, the farther away the next marker was \u2013 the glacier\u2019s retreat was accelerating over the decades. The effect was like trekking along a countdown to the oblivion of the glacier, or perhaps even our own.</p> <p>Along the steep-sided valley carved out by the glacier over millennia, the cliff walls most recently vacated by the shrinking floe are packed with \u201cdead ice\u201d, a dark grey substance that looks like granite. Dead ice poses a major threat to sightseers because it can cause massive rock falls; last summer a boy ignored a set of warning signs and wandered less than 50 metres from the main tourist path. He was crushed to death by a falling boulder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b7da4ac7d23c90ca6568408845f777f5638cfe0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7da4ac7d23c90ca6568408845f777f5638cfe0/0_292_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pontresina, in the Swiss Alps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pontresina, in the Swiss Alps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Parkin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The villagers of Pontresina are distressed by the likely effects of the erosion of the ice on the village\u2019s tourist economy, Oerlemans told me. But not everyone is convinced that his snow-blanket scheme is the best use of 2m francs. \u201cI am sceptical of the entire project,\u201d an employee from the local council said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge amount of money, and it\u2019s not clear what effect it will have.\u201d Even if the scheme meets expectations, there is a sense that the funding behind the glacier-saving technology has essentially been awarded to prop up the skiing industry, the recreational embodiment of extreme privilege \u2013 just like the artificial snow operation in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re.</p> <p>Oerlemans and his team argue, however, that if the wealthy ski resorts of the Alps can facilitate the development of these technologies, they will have a knock-on effect in the coming years, enabling poorer communities around the world to benefit from these advances. The professors\u2019 snow rope system may provide a solution, ensuring the survival, not only of expensive tourist resorts, but also farming communities, such as those in India and Tibet, whose crops are reliant on glacial water. \u201cThere are 230,000 glaciers in the world, and it\u2019s unthinkable that you could use our technique on a scale that would, for instance, stop glaciers from contributing to sea-level rise,\u201d says Oerlemans. \u201cBut at a local level it could prove invaluable for local economies that depend on melt water from glaciers for their survival.\u201d</p> <p>That technologies developed for the rich will one day help the poor is a familiar refrain among tech idealists \u2013 and a dubious one. \u201cAssuming that western technologies can be easily implemented in developing countries is a bit naive,\u201d said Robert Steiger, from the University of Innsbruck. \u201cPoor regions in poor countries lack the institutional background that is required to implement new technologies and, even more importantly, to provide the knowledge and money to maintain this technology.\u201d Besides, Claus Dangel, the CEO of the snow machine company B\u00e4chler, which is currently developing Oerlemans\u2019 snow sprinkler, estimates that the company needs an additional 3.5m Swiss francs to fully develop the system \u2013 far more investment than is provided by the Swiss Innovation Agency grant.</p> <p>Dangel\u2019s hope is to make the system as low-energy as possible, perhaps by using gravity to feed the sprinkler system from lakes high in the mountains, above the snow rope. \u201cWe want it to work without using energy,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut this is very complicated because you need high water pressure, and the system will probably need to be heated in one way or another, to prevent it from freezing.\u201d</p> <p>In the long term, it seems unlikely that artificial snow will save even the wealthy Alpine ski industry. Resorts are beginning to consider how they might make more fundamental changes to their businesses in order to adapt to, rather than stave off, the effects of the climate crisis. For many resorts, this means reorienting themselves around non-skiing activities: hiking, mountain bike-riding, nature-watching, sightseeing. \u201cWe can see what is coming for us,\u201d said Olivier Simonin, the director of the resort at Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cThere will need to be a complete change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/29/the-air-conditioning-trap-how-cold-air-is-heating-the-world\">The air conditioning trap: how cold air is heating the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By 2050 Simonin hopes that 30% of the resort\u2019s income will be derived from activities other than skiing. The number of tourists visiting the Alps during the summer is already increasing year on year, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. Changes in climate are being matched by changes in what visitors, especially millennials, are looking for. But hiking and other summer activities are less profitable than skiing, so although tourism may endure, the stratospheric revenues of the heavy snow decades may not. \u201cWe may have a bit more time compared to others but, then again, we are a big resort,\u201d Simonin said of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cWe have a greater economic challenge in order to maintain our current levels of profit.\u201d</p> <p>For a few moments Simonin held his head in his hands. \u201cIt will require solidarity between the villagers, the resorts, the hotels,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cBut people who live in the mountains are hardy. We are used to having to adapt.\u201d Perhaps, he wondered, with a note of surprise at what appeared to be a fresh afterthought, whether in 50 years, people might come to Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, not to ski but simply to see snow \u2013 human-made or otherwise \u2013 precisely because of its scarcity. With a dry laugh, he added, \u201cMaybe the mere sight of snow will become a privilege.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 December 2019.

      "bodyText": "When the French entrepreneur Jacques Mouflier visited the remote Alpine village of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re in 1935, he saw the future before him. \u201cA miracle is going to happen,\u201d Mouflier told his young son, as he gestured towards the mountains encircling the village. \u201cSki champions from every country will come to compete where we\u2019re standing right now.\u201d He was right. In 1948 Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re produced France\u2019s first Olympic ski champion, and ever since, professional athletes have flocked to the village, which sits 1,850 metres above sea level, to train and compete. They are joined by tens of thousands of amateurs. Last year the resort sold 1.3m ski \u201cdays\u201d to tourists, and more Britons visit Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re each year than any other ski resort in the world. For a long time, the source of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re\u2019s enduring attraction \u2013 aside from its almost oppressively picturesque surroundings, five-star hotels and 300km of pistes, each one as groomed as a Surrey garden \u2013 has been that it is, in the parlance of the skiing industry, \u201csnow certain\u201d. Year in and year out, the arrival of the first snowfall, in mid-November, was as reliable as a Swiss watch. In 1955, when the resort began hosting an annual ski competition called the Crit\u00e9rium de la Premi\u00e8re Neige (\u201cthe competition of the first snow\u201d), its organisers boasted that Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re was the only French resort able to guarantee snow throughout December. Villagers claim to be able to predict the year\u2019s coming snowfall by the berries on the local rowan trees. Plump clumps in summer promise deep snow in winter. For decades, the branches drooped under the berries\u2019 weight. But in the mid-1980s, locals began to notice a change. The date of the first snowfall began to drift later. Patches of bare ground appeared on slopes that, in previous years, had been covered in an uninterrupted white drift. Some ski seasons would have an abundance of snow; others, a scarcity. More consistent was the retreat of the Pissaillas glacier, whose run-off water feeds the surrounding forests; each year it withdrew a little farther up the Pointe du Montet mountain, which dominates the jagged horizon. By 2014, snow was arriving so late to Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re that, for the first time in its history, the Crit\u00e9rium de la Premi\u00e8re Neige was relocated, to a more snow-reliable resort in Sweden. For reasons scientists don\u2019t fully understand, the Alps are warming faster than the global average. The 1.4C rise in the average global temperature since the end of the 19th century has translated into a 2C rise in the Alps. In the past hundred years, the number of hours that sunshine hits the mountains each year has increased by 20%. The heat and light cause snow to melt, or not to fall at all. In 2017 the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research recorded that less snow fell in the Alps during the winter months than in any year since 1874. In April a report by the European Geosciences Union showed that 90% of glacier volume in the Alps \u2013 an essential source of drinking water, crop irrigation and ski runs \u2013 could be lost by the end of this century. For the Alpine ski industry, which hosts 35% of the world\u2019s ski resorts across eight countries, and serves an estimated 120 million tourists each year, this is potentially an extinction-level event. Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re is one of the mountain range\u2019s highest resorts, so it will be one of the last to feel the full effects of the climate catastrophe. But farther down the mountains, the disappearance of snow has already begun to devastate the ski industry, as well as the communities that rely on it. Since 1960, the average snow season has shortened by 38 days, while \u201cseasonal drift\u201d has pushed the coldest weather from December to the early months of the year, throwing the ski season out of sync with the lucrative Christmas holidays. In November 2017 the EU launched the Prosnow project, whereby scientists advise Alpine resorts on how to \u201cmaintain the same season duration with 30% less snow\u201d. Such efforts have not been entirely successful. According to some reports, as many as 200 ski resorts now stand abandoned across the Alps, where bankrupt hotels have been left unoccupied, and forsaken ski lifts dangle in the wind. The disaster encroaching on Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re has been obvious to Olivier Simonin, the director of tourism at the resort, since the infamous 2006-7 season, when a scarcity of snow caused a 7% decline in revenues across Alpine resorts. This September, for the first time, the French ski industry\u2019s main union, Domaines Skiables de France, held an emergency meeting of directors from France\u2019s most important resorts to discuss the existential challenges they face. Twenty-five directors attended the meeting, which was held in the valley of Chamb\u00e9ry. The mood, according to Simonin, was sombre. \u201cThis is now the main topic of conversation among us,\u201d said Simonin. \u201cNobody wants to die.\u201d Unlike the islanders of Kiribati, whose homes will be swallowed by the Pacific Ocean in the coming years, or the farmers of rural Bangladesh, whose crops fail whenever their fields are flooded by saltwater, the Alpine ski industry, which turns over billions of euros every year, is disproportionately well-equipped to fight for its survival. And resorts like Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re have invested tens of millions of euros in the most straightforward solution imaginable: when the snow stops falling, it\u2019s time to make your own. * * * \u201cYou need four things to make snow,\u201d Pierre Mattis told me in September as we toured the control centre of the snow-making operation he runs in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cWater, air, cold and talent.\u201d One morning in 1995, Mattis, who was then a 28-year-old ski-lift engineer, was told he was being redeployed to look after the resort\u2019s handful of snow machines. Four years later, he began building his snow-making factory, or atelier neige, installing a 70km network of pipes beneath the mountain that now, after years of expansion and improvement, can cover 65 sq km of slopes in artificial snow at the touch of a button. It is one of the most sophisticated snow-making operations in the world. The first snow-making machines in Europe appeared in Italy in the early 1980s, just before the locals in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re began to notice the seasons shifting. (In 1963 snow-making equipment was installed at Mar Lodge in Scotland, but the project was abandoned after two seasons as the water kept freezing.) As winters with unreliable snow became more common in the Alps, so did the machines. Most were based on a design by a Pennsylvanian man named Herman K Dupr\u00e9, who in 1968 had fitted a water sprinkler to an air compressor system he bought at a scrapyard. Dupr\u00e9 pumped the air and water at high pressure through a lance-like nozzle to create a fine spray that, at sufficiently low temperatures, turned to snow before it hit the ground. The HKD snowmaking system, as Dupr\u00e9 named his invention, became the industry standard. The first one arrived in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re not long before the snow-scarce winter of 1986. Warm winters had occurred before the mid-1980s, Robert Steiger, an economist and tourism researcher at the University of Innsbruck, told me, \u201cbut at that time Alpine communities had not been so dependent on ski tourism.\u201d Today, 95% of Italian, 70% of Austrian, 65% of French and half of Swiss ski resorts are reliant on snow machines for their continued survival, according to estimates from Claus Dangel, CEO of B\u00e4chler, a snow-machine maker that supplies more than 200 resorts across the Alps. It takes an awful lot of technology, water and energy to manufacture the amount of snow that might have naturally blanketed the Alps two or three generations ago. Mattis\u2019s control centre in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re is housed in a cavern chiselled into the mountainside, like the bunker of a Bond villain. It is large enough to house some 40 double-decker buses, and home to six 10ft tall pumps, water filters, and a phalanx of computer screens \u2013 all maintained by Mattis\u2019s 12-member \u201csnow team\u201d. Using software developed in-house, the team controls a vast network of snow machines via a bank of 10 computers. Like the timer on a boiler, the software allows the team to set \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d periods for the snow machines, ensuring a consistent covering of snow throughout the season. Forecasts fed into the bunker from weather stations on the mountains help the team to adjust their schedules. During the ski season, three people monitor the system throughout the night, like security guards watching over a bank vault. They check the correct positions of the cannons in relation to the prevailing wind, watch the quality of snow, and ensure that the pump rooms are working satisfactorily. If a patch of ground appears in the melting snow, they can cover it before sunrise. The snow is shot on to the mountains at a speed of 250km/h via 650 snow cannons. Ten years ago the cannons could be spaced 80 metres apart from one another and still create an unbroken blanket of snow, but climate change has since forced Mattis to cut that distance in half. The system has to be continually upgraded to keep pace with the effects of climate change. The current iteration was completed in 2014 at a cost of \u20ac2m, and can produce 8,000 cubic metres of snow per hour \u2013 eight times the capacity of five years ago. The plant is one of the largest in the Alps, and differs from most of its rivals in that all of the equipment (bar HKD\u2019s nozzles, which are imported from Quebec) was designed in-house. Mattis claims his system is unique as it allows the team to control the density of the snow on a sliding 10-point scale, enabling him to create a more compact, \u201cfaster\u201d snow, ideal for professional competitions. This technology comes at a major financial and ecological cost. Today, one in every 20 euros spent anywhere in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re goes into the snow factory, covering energy costs, staffing, maintenance and upgrades (a hidden \u201cartificial snow\u201d tax that is continually increasing). Although snow machines are becoming increasingly efficient, a typical snowmaker still uses about the same amount of energy as a boiler in a family home. When multiplied into the tens of thousands across the Alps, snowmakers become something of a self-defeating invention: they worsen and sustain the climate problems they\u2019re supposed to solve. And yet, for life in the Alps as we\u2019ve come to know it, they remain essential. Steiger\u2019s most recent simulations suggest that unless every ski resort in the Alps installs state-of-the-art snowmaking facilities like the ones Mattis operates at Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, by the 2050s up to half will no longer be able to sustain their businesses. Only the wealthiest resorts, like Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re \u2013 where chalets can sell for more than \u20ac23,000 per sq metre, five times the average cost of property in London\u2019s most expensive borough, Kensington and Chelsea \u2013 are able to make the necessary investments to continually update and retool their snow-making facilities. Less-moneyed resorts rely on a cheaper source \u2013 snow farming, whereby snow is gathered or made in January and February, when manufacturing snow costs less than in warmer months. The snow is then placed under a 40cm layer of wood chippings, which absorb and release moisture and keep the snow cool, compact and manageable during the summer months. The wood chippings are then removed at the end of October, allowing the snow to be deployed on the slopes in time for the skiing season. Artificial snow, be it farmed or sprayed, is not only the would-be saviour of the ski industry, however. This is a region where, as the International Commission for the Protection of the Alps, Cipra, puts it, \u201cthere is an urgent need for innovative ideas and solutions\u201d. One Dutch professor believes artificial snow may also hold the key to saving glaciers, in the Alps and beyond \u2013 along with the communities that rely on them for their food and water. * * * On the morning of 11 July 2000, after a night of unexpectedly heavy summer snow, Hans Oerlemans went to check his weather station on the Morteratsch glacier, near the village of Pontresina, Switzerland, 400km north-east of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. The Morteratsch is one of the largest glaciers in the Alps, and a popular attraction for sightseers and thrill-seekers, many of whom come to ski along its 6km back. Since 1860, though, the glacier has shrunk by 2.5km \u2013 an average of nearly 16 metres per year. Oerlemans believes lessons learned by studying the Morteratsch can aid anyone interested in saving snow and ice across the Alps. A Dutchman who grew up in Utrecht, Oerlemans is tall and handsome, and wears the thin-rimmed glasses of a Hollywood therapist (studiously removing them for photographs). He has been studying glaciers since 1980, when he earned his PhD from Utrecht University, where he is an emeritus professor. His weather station on the Morteratsch, which he personally built in 1995, was one of the first in the world designed to measure the effects of climate change on glaciers. By monitoring the Morteratsch\u2019s vital signs \u2013 fluctuations in the depth and temperature of its ice, as well as the ambient humidity \u2013 he hoped to solve a number of basic, yet unanswered, questions. \u201cIf the climate becomes one degree warmer,\u201d he told me recently, \u201cwhat happens close to the surface of a glacier: do you have 1 metre more of ice melt, or 10cm, or 10 metres? Nobody knew.\u201d When Oerlemans crested the mountain that overlooks the Morteratsch that July morning two decades ago, he expected to see the glacier in its state of typical summer resplendence \u2013 a great frozen river, flowing in imperceptible slow-mo down the mountain. Instead, he saw nothing but snow, covering the glacier in a half-metre-deep drift. In the weeks that followed, he noticed something even more surprising in the weather station readings: the glacier\u2019s thaw had halted almost entirely. Two processes melt ice: the transfer of heat from warm air, and solar radiation from the sun. Oerlemans\u2019s readings suggested that the latter had a much greater effect than scientists previously understood. The covering of snow from the unseasonable summer storm had apparently acted as a reflective shield, fending off enough solar radiation that it was equivalent to dropping the air temperature by a full degree. He wrote up his findings in a paper published in 2004 by the International Glaciological Society. Then, for a while, he put what happened to the back of his mind. This autumn, as Oerlemans and I took a bobbing cable car up to a viewing station overlooking the glacier and mountain-top restaurant \u2013 home to \u201cprobably the most expensive plate of spaghetti in Europe,\u201d he said \u2013 he explained what happened next. About five years after his paper was published, the villagers in Pontresina learned about an experiment in which polyester fleece has been used to cover snow to preserve it during warm weather. They laid the fleece on to the glacier in two-metre wide strips, like a blanket shorn from a massive sheep. \u201cThey put it out in the middle of May, and covered the ice till September,\u201d he said. Not only did the fleece blanket stall the effects of melting, it actually reversed them: measurements showed that, over the course of the summer, ice in some of the areas under the fleece grew in thickness by up to two metres. When news of this ice reversal reached Oerlemans, he immediately thought of the weather station reports following the heavy snow drift in July 2000. If it were possible to cover a glacier in a protective barrier during the spring and summer months, might this counteract a century of decline? \u201cThe scale is totally different,\u201d Oerlemans recalled. \u201cYou could not use fleece on a glacier the size of the Morteratsch, which moves, because it will be destroyed quickly. But, I thought: it might just be possible to use artificial snow.\u201d To test the theory, in the summer of 2017 Oerlemans and his team sprayed a 2.5 metre-deep blanket of artificial snow over a small section of the Diavolezzafirn glacier, one of the Morteratsch\u2019s diminutive neighbours. The experiment, which ran to the autumn, was successful: further melting was prevented, and in some places the ice even grew. With positive results in hand, Oerlemans and his collaborators began to consider the much greater challenge of how to blast a sufficient amount of artificial snow over the much larger expanse of the Morteratsch. Snow cannons such as those installed in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re could not be placed on to the glacier, as they would be caught in the slow-moving current of the ice and torn from their pipes. Instead, Oerlemans and his colleague Felix Keller considered using a cable car equipped with a snow machine to travel above the glacier, dropping artificial snow as it went. (Oerlemans and Keller\u2019s partnership is not short on creative thinking \u2013 the pair also play in a two-piece tango band called Tango Glaciar and often splice musical performances into their lectures on glacial retreat; once they even performed on a glacier, which one onlooker drolly likened to the musicians on the Titanic stubbornly playing while the ship sank.) This idea stalled when it came to supplying a moving cable car with the necessary water to make the snow. Finally, in a eureka moment, the team settled on an ingenious invention: a \u201csnow rope\u201d, stretched in a zigzag pattern across the width of the glacier, hundreds of feet across. Acting like a sprinkler system, the rope could deposit snow from altitude while the glacier trundled conveyor belt-like beneath it. After two years of preparatory studies, finding willing engineering partners and filing patents, on 1 October 2019 Oerleman received a 2m Swiss franc grant from the Swiss Innovation Agency to begin work on his extravagant snow blanket scheme. \u201cWe have passed the point of no return,\u201d Oerlemans told me. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just theory; it\u2019s happening.\u201d * * * On a warm morning this past summer, I hiked with Hans Oerlemans along a dirt path from the village of Pontresina up to the Morteratsch glacier. Perhaps to convince sceptical visitors of the scale of the Morteratsch\u2019s retreat, the village council had erected 2.5 metre-tall markers along the path to show how far downhill the tip of the glacier stretched in certain years. With an accumulating sense of dread, we walked from the marker for 1865, which sits close to a car park at the base of the mountain, and past the ones for 1940, 1960, 1980. The farther we walked, the farther away the next marker was \u2013 the glacier\u2019s retreat was accelerating over the decades. The effect was like trekking along a countdown to the oblivion of the glacier, or perhaps even our own. Along the steep-sided valley carved out by the glacier over millennia, the cliff walls most recently vacated by the shrinking floe are packed with \u201cdead ice\u201d, a dark grey substance that looks like granite. Dead ice poses a major threat to sightseers because it can cause massive rock falls; last summer a boy ignored a set of warning signs and wandered less than 50 metres from the main tourist path. He was crushed to death by a falling boulder. The villagers of Pontresina are distressed by the likely effects of the erosion of the ice on the village\u2019s tourist economy, Oerlemans told me. But not everyone is convinced that his snow-blanket scheme is the best use of 2m francs. \u201cI am sceptical of the entire project,\u201d an employee from the local council said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge amount of money, and it\u2019s not clear what effect it will have.\u201d Even if the scheme meets expectations, there is a sense that the funding behind the glacier-saving technology has essentially been awarded to prop up the skiing industry, the recreational embodiment of extreme privilege \u2013 just like the artificial snow operation in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. Oerlemans and his team argue, however, that if the wealthy ski resorts of the Alps can facilitate the development of these technologies, they will have a knock-on effect in the coming years, enabling poorer communities around the world to benefit from these advances. The professors\u2019 snow rope system may provide a solution, ensuring the survival, not only of expensive tourist resorts, but also farming communities, such as those in India and Tibet, whose crops are reliant on glacial water. \u201cThere are 230,000 glaciers in the world, and it\u2019s unthinkable that you could use our technique on a scale that would, for instance, stop glaciers from contributing to sea-level rise,\u201d says Oerlemans. \u201cBut at a local level it could prove invaluable for local economies that depend on melt water from glaciers for their survival.\u201d That technologies developed for the rich will one day help the poor is a familiar refrain among tech idealists \u2013 and a dubious one. \u201cAssuming that western technologies can be easily implemented in developing countries is a bit naive,\u201d said Robert Steiger, from the University of Innsbruck. \u201cPoor regions in poor countries lack the institutional background that is required to implement new technologies and, even more importantly, to provide the knowledge and money to maintain this technology.\u201d Besides, Claus Dangel, the CEO of the snow machine company B\u00e4chler, which is currently developing Oerlemans\u2019 snow sprinkler, estimates that the company needs an additional 3.5m Swiss francs to fully develop the system \u2013 far more investment than is provided by the Swiss Innovation Agency grant. Dangel\u2019s hope is to make the system as low-energy as possible, perhaps by using gravity to feed the sprinkler system from lakes high in the mountains, above the snow rope. \u201cWe want it to work without using energy,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut this is very complicated because you need high water pressure, and the system will probably need to be heated in one way or another, to prevent it from freezing.\u201d In the long term, it seems unlikely that artificial snow will save even the wealthy Alpine ski industry. Resorts are beginning to consider how they might make more fundamental changes to their businesses in order to adapt to, rather than stave off, the effects of the climate crisis. For many resorts, this means reorienting themselves around non-skiing activities: hiking, mountain bike-riding, nature-watching, sightseeing. \u201cWe can see what is coming for us,\u201d said Olivier Simonin, the director of the resort at Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cThere will need to be a complete change.\u201d By 2050 Simonin hopes that 30% of the resort\u2019s income will be derived from activities other than skiing. The number of tourists visiting the Alps during the summer is already increasing year on year, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. Changes in climate are being matched by changes in what visitors, especially millennials, are looking for. But hiking and other summer activities are less profitable than skiing, so although tourism may endure, the stratospheric revenues of the heavy snow decades may not. \u201cWe may have a bit more time compared to others but, then again, we are a big resort,\u201d Simonin said of Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re. \u201cWe have a greater economic challenge in order to maintain our current levels of profit.\u201d For a few moments Simonin held his head in his hands. \u201cIt will require solidarity between the villagers, the resorts, the hotels,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cBut people who live in the mountains are hardy. We are used to having to adapt.\u201d Perhaps, he wondered, with a note of surprise at what appeared to be a fresh afterthought, whether in 50 years, people might come to Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, not to ski but simply to see snow \u2013 human-made or otherwise \u2013 precisely because of its scarcity. With a dry laugh, he added, \u201cMaybe the mere sight of snow will become a privilege.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 December 2019. Owing to a unit conversion error, an earlier version stated that property prices in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re were 20 times higher than in Kensington in London. It has been corrected to five times. A reference to an early snow-making programme in Scotland has also been added. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

In contrast, three months before the 2019 election, the Lib Dems\u2019 autumn conference was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/how-far-can-buoyant-liberal-democrats-bounce-back\">awash with bullish predictions</a> of winning 40 seats as a minimum, with 80 or even 100 possible. Buoyed by strong results in the local and European elections in May, and polling numbers that briefly exceeded 20%, the party entered the campaign with ambitions that were arguably not matched by sufficiently rigorous organisation or on-the-ground campaigning.</p> <p>Swinson faced criticism for an overly presidential approach, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/i-can-be-next-pm-says-jo-swinson-as-she-launches-election-campaign\">initial pitch to the public</a> as a prime minister-in-waiting, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum\">policy to revoke Brexit</a> without a second referendum.Some within the party say the revoke idea was sprung on the party by Swinson and her team at the autumn conference. As the flagship policy of a newly elected leader, they say, it could not realistically be refused, despite doubts among some senior members.</p> <p>\u201cPeople understood the revoke idea if you explained it on the doorstep,\u201d one candidate said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like Labour on Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s better to have a policy that doesn\u2019t need explaining in the first place. People understood the people\u2019s vote.\u201d</p> <p>Another candidate said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it was a mistake. But also, there\u2019s no data that backs up what people are saying about it costing us votes.\u201d</p> <p>For now, a sprinkling of gallows humour helps with the coping process. \u201cThe good thing about not winning so many seats is it\u2019s going to be pretty easy to get to know all the parliamentary party,\u201d one MP said.</p> <p>Serious, even potentially existential challenges loom as the process of choosing a new leader begins, not least deciding the raison d\u2019etre for a party that went into the election so closely defined by one, now largely defunct idea \u2013 remaining in the EU. Other key challenges include how to avoid the Lib Dem vote being squeezed yet again under a first past the post electoral system, escaping the legacy of the 2010-15 coalition, and improving party organisation.</p> <p>These questions will go hand-in-hand with the leadership race, the timetable for which has yet to be decided by the party\u2019s ruling federal board. One mooted option is to make the decision before the spring conference in York in mid-March.</p> <p>But with a battle-hardened interim leadership team of Ed Davey, Swinson\u2019s former deputy, and the Lib Dem peer and president, Sal Brinton, already in place, others are arguing for a longer process, one where the party membership \u2013 at a record 120,000-plus \u2013 could potentially make their decision in the light of Labour\u2019s new leader. Some even suggest keeping Davey in place for a year or more.</p> <p>A paradoxical advantage of the election result is that the field to replace Swinson is not exactly crowded. As one senior member put it: \u201cIf you take away the new MPs, and the ones who probably don\u2019t want it \u2013 Tim Farron, Alistair Carmichael and Jamie Stone \u2013 that leaves four people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7856763541faea772579423769281b3d288050d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7856763541faea772579423769281b3d288050d5/0_51_3658_2195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Layla Moran, regarded as a leadership frontrunner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Layla Moran, regarded as a leadership frontrunner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of those, Davey and Layla Moran, the latter <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000874\">returned to her Oxford West and Abingdon constituency</a> with a notably increased majority, are seen as the frontrunners, even though it is understood that Moran has yet to decide whether she will stand. Also in the frame are the Bath MP, Wera Hobhouse, and Christine Jardine in Edinburgh West, both 2017 entrants, as well as the brand new MP Daisy Cooper, who took St Albans from the Conservatives and has not ruled out a leadership bid.</p> <p>Davey, an MP since 1997 and a cabinet minister in the coalition, is seen by some senior Lib Dems as the safe, if perhaps shorter-term choice. \u201cThis is a time for experience and good judgment,\u201d one Lib Dem figure said. \u201cIt can be hard to run a party, especially when the party is at a low ebb.\u201d</p> <p>Others see Moran, a confident media performer who, at 37, is two years younger than Swinson, as the better option. \u201cIf she goes for it, you could say the leadership is hers to lose,\u201d a Lib Dem source said. \u201cEd doesn\u2019t really answer the big questions the party has got to answer. And under Layla we could finally stop having to talk about the coalition.\u201d</p> <p>Before the new leader is chosen comes a more immediate task: a formal postmortem into what went wrong with the 2019 election.</p> <p>It is a worry that too much emphasis was placed at the election on winning London seats for high-profile incomers from other parties, such as ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, both of whom achieved significant swings but fell short. \u201cI think maybe some people believed that if we focused on those we\u2019d just pick up other seats along the way,\u201d one party figure said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work like that. In retrospect, it might have been better to focus on a core strategy of something like 20 seats, go for at least some gains.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, at least some of the newcomers from other parties are understood to have been surprised at the lack of non-Brexit policy direction ahead of the election, even if some of this was down to the fact Swinson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/jo-swinson-elected-new-lib-dem-leader\">took over as leader</a> only in July.</p> <p>Perhaps most relevant to the eventual result was another insight gained by some of the defectors as they fought their first election within the new party: life as a Lib Dem is a difficult business even at the best of times.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the electoral system, or the lack of resources, there\u2019s also the media,\u201d recounted one new arrival. \u201cYou have to work 10 times as hard to get any cut-through. About 50% of any interviews I had were spent on questions about who we would or wouldn\u2019t prop up in government. That doesn\u2019t leave much time to talk about policies.\u201d</p>",

Serious, even potentially existential challenges loom as the process of choosing a new leader begins, not least deciding the raison d\u2019etre for a party that went into the election so closely defined by one, now largely defunct idea \u2013 remaining in the EU. Other key challenges include how to avoid the Lib Dem vote being squeezed yet again under a first past the post electoral system, escaping the legacy of the 2010-15 coalition, and improving party organisation. These questions will go hand-in-hand with the leadership race, the timetable for which has yet to be decided by the party\u2019s ruling federal board. One mooted option is to make the decision before the spring conference in York in mid-March. But with a battle-hardened interim leadership team of Ed Davey, Swinson\u2019s former deputy, and the Lib Dem peer and president, Sal Brinton, already in place, others are arguing for a longer process, one where the party membership \u2013 at a record 120,000-plus \u2013 could potentially make their decision in the light of Labour\u2019s new leader. Some even suggest keeping Davey in place for a year or more. A paradoxical advantage of the election result is that the field to replace Swinson is not exactly crowded. As one senior member put it: \u201cIf you take away the new MPs, and the ones who probably don\u2019t want it \u2013 Tim Farron, Alistair Carmichael and Jamie Stone \u2013 that leaves four people.\u201d Of those, Davey and Layla Moran, the latter returned to her Oxford West and Abingdon constituency with a notably increased majority, are seen as the frontrunners, even though it is understood that Moran has yet to decide whether she will stand. Also in the frame are the Bath MP, Wera Hobhouse, and Christine Jardine in Edinburgh West, both 2017 entrants, as well as the brand new MP Daisy Cooper, who took St Albans from the Conservatives and has not ruled out a leadership bid. Davey, an MP since 1997 and a cabinet minister in the coalition, is seen by some senior Lib Dems as the safe, if perhaps shorter-term choice. \u201cThis is a time for experience and good judgment,\u201d one Lib Dem figure said. \u201cIt can be hard to run a party, especially when the party is at a low ebb.\u201d Others see Moran, a confident media performer who, at 37, is two years younger than Swinson, as the better option. \u201cIf she goes for it, you could say the leadership is hers to lose,\u201d a Lib Dem source said. \u201cEd doesn\u2019t really answer the big questions the party has got to answer. And under Layla we could finally stop having to talk about the coalition.\u201d Before the new leader is chosen comes a more immediate task: a formal postmortem into what went wrong with the 2019 election. It is a worry that too much emphasis was placed at the election on winning London seats for high-profile incomers from other parties, such as ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, both of whom achieved significant swings but fell short. \u201cI think maybe some people believed that if we focused on those we\u2019d just pick up other seats along the way,\u201d one party figure said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work like that. In retrospect, it might have been better to focus on a core strategy of something like 20 seats, go for at least some gains.\u201d At the same time, at least some of the newcomers from other parties are understood to have been surprised at the lack of non-Brexit policy direction ahead of the election, even if some of this was down to the fact Swinson took over as leader only in July. Perhaps most relevant to the eventual result was another insight gained by some of the defectors as they fought their first election within the new party: life as a Lib Dem is a difficult business even at the best of times. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the electoral system, or the lack of resources, there\u2019s also the media,\u201d recounted one new arrival. \u201cYou have to work 10 times as hard to get any cut-through. About 50% of any interviews I had were spent on questions about who we would or wouldn\u2019t prop up in government. That doesn\u2019t leave much time to talk about policies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Cure 9pm, Channel 4 A gruelling true story from the writer Amanda Duke on the 2007 Stafford hospital care scandal, which exposed how patients were being left neglected in filthy wards. Sian Brooke is powerful as Julie Bailey, the ordinary woman who exposed the hospital\u2019s shocking failings after her mother was admitted for a treatable hernia, only to die eight weeks later. A testament to Bailey\u2019s tenacity and resilience with a strong moral message about the importance of advocating for those most in need. Ammar Kalia Heston\u2019s Marvellous Menu: Back to the Noughties 9pm, BBC Two If you are not ready for a Christmas feast yet, this will whet your appetite (to a Michelin-starred degree). Giles Coren challenges the chef Heston Blumenthal to recreate the 2001 tasting menu from his restaurant the Fat Duck, documenting how he became one of British cooking\u2019s brightest stars. AK Freddie Mercury: A Christmas Story 9pm, Channel 5 Being the only musical act to land a Christmas No 1 twice with the same song (Bohemian Rhapsody) might be a tenuous connection to Christmas for Queen, but a connection it is. And so to this documentary about the band\u2019s festivities, complete with some rarely seen footage of Freddie himself. Hannah J Davies Don\u2019t Tell the Bride: Christmas in the Snow 9pm, E4 As with every set-up in this glorious show, chilled groom Liam hasn\u2019t the faintest idea what his bride, Georgia, wants from their E4-funded wedding. His idea is for a romantic winter white wedding, and hers for sun and sand in Portugal. Who will win out? My money is on the fake snow. AK I\u2019ll Get This 10pm, BBC Two A festive return for this guiltily watchable nonsense in which five celebrities go for a meal and play daft games to decide who picks up the tab. Along the way, we learn that Gregg Wallace cannot resist a dad joke and Shirley Ballas can\u2019t hold her drink. But who will need an extra Christmas panto gig to pay the hefty bill?

      "body": "<p>S<em>eries 3, episode 4: The Crown. A BBC van pulls up at Buckingham Palace to record a royal documentary.</em></p> \n<p>As in life, so with television: timing is everything. Had The Crown aired its new series one week earlier \u2026 Had the fictional Queen been spotted squirming at the TV crews in her midst \u2026 Had the distant memories of a now-banned palace interview been fresher in our minds \u2026 It is entirely possible, and more than probable, that the Prince Andrew interview would never have happened.</p> \n<p>This is the discussion in the Newsnight office a couple of weeks after it aired. We still cannot quite believe it happened. We have to pinch ourselves seeing global headlines, day after day: the ramifications of all the painstaking observations he made to us in that hour of surreal television. I agreed to do an interview about the interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. \u201cWas this your \u2018Frost/Nixon\u2019 moment?\u201d they asked as I walked in. I had barely taken off my coat.</p> \n<p>I gulped. It felt like the finest thing I have ever been asked, but I couldn\u2019t find a way to respond without sounding like a muppet. They watched every frame. They could tell me the time of the clock hands in the opening shot. \u201cWhat about his tie?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhy was a member of the family of Windsor unable to tie a correct Windsor knot?\u201d I was stumped. I realised they had pored over the interview more intensely than me, one finger permanently on pause and rewind.</p> \n<p>People have asked what I was thinking as I sat there opposite the prince, preparing for the questions to come. How do you make small talk? How do you compose the tone you need for the hour ahead?</p> \n<p>My overriding emotion was relief. I expected the interview to be pulled at every stage. It had been months in the making and got sign-off just 48 hours earlier. Even then it was pushed back by a couple of hours, then brought forward by one.</p> \n<p>My fear was that any sign of procrastination, any shifting of the timetable, would ultimately end in cancellation. So I mainly felt joy we had got this far. The weight of expectation was second to that. No one knew the interview was coming. There had been no publicity. Indeed, the whole event had been kept intensely private.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"63356b20-f556-4e54-b591-93b8d910e97e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sE9iJPEuYHE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The prince put me at ease; chatty, relaxed. He showed us the end of the room where they kept a projector \u2013 it was turned into a cinema every Thursday evening for the palace staff. As we adjusted our seated positions for the photos, he asked if I had ever been interviewed by David Frost. It was not calculated to shock me, but it did. In his eyes, Frost is the convivial Sunday morning telly host, thrower of excellent parties. But in my head, Frost is the arsonist-in-chief of Frost/Nixon fame. I wonder if he caught my look of alarm at the mention of the name.</p> \n<p>I am always impressed by interviewers who can do the whole thing without notes. I can\u2019t. I need reminders on my knee. Dates, first names, quotes in bold text. I am addicted to the highlighter pen, my papers generally a garish mix of type, Biro, unreadable scribble and lashings of luminosity, as if they belong to the unhinged. It has to be something that catches my eye in a moment of amnesia or panic. Over the years, I have practised how to lift an entire sentence with a brief glance down, while trying to hold the gaze of whomever I\u2019m talking to. It is the little things that throw me \u2013 the wrong pen, the wrong font. An interview done standing up is a disaster. I need my knees to rest notes on.</p> \n<p>It is these weird superstitions that can make or break your confidence in those moments before the cameras start rolling. The interview itself, perhaps bizarrely, is the easiest bit. He is there. I am there. The prep is done.</p> \n<p>We had role-played the interview to prepare. We had imagined scenarios and responses, evasions and deviations. \u201cDo I have to say \u2018Sir\u2019 after each question?\u201d I pondered. My editor, Esme Wren, gave me a gentle look, as if I had gone slightly mad. \u201cYou are courteous and firm. This is a Newsnight interview, not a royal encounter.\u201d It was her focused, steely, enquiring look I found myself channelling each time nerves deserted me.</p> \n<p>We began to record. I thought about how reasonable he sounded. He was explaining why Jeffrey Epstein was never really his friend, more \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d. For one moment, I imagined I had got everything wrong, misunderstood the story entirely. But I stuck to the line of questioning. And it paid off.</p> \n<p>Does he regret the visit to stay with Epstein? \u201cYes.\u201d Does he regret the whole friendship?</p> \n<p>It was around 16 minutes into the interview \u2013 and it was the answer that, for me, changed everything.</p> \n<p>\u201cStill not,\u201d he said. And told me of the opportunities he was given by Epstein that were \u201cactually very useful \u2026\u201d. It was such a candid admission, such a bald refusal to play the game with any wider apology or regret. It would become the pivotal moment of the entire hour. This is a man \u2013 a prince \u2013 who did not come to repent. He came to earn back his right to tell the story his way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b556d51ec6550c0edcd0e96d702ba9f6234e94d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b556d51ec6550c0edcd0e96d702ba9f6234e94d/0_51_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bald refusal to show any \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This is a man \u2013 a prince \u2013 who did not come to repent. <br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Harrison/BBC/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Once I understood that, everything else flowed from there. Andrew was unleashed. Unstoppable. After a decade of silent frustration, he wanted to tell me everything. He paused being \u201ca royal\u201d and found his voice.</p> \n<p>He told me things he had no need to reveal. About his sweat problems and his trip to Woking, about his knowledge of Belgravia homes and London nightspots.</p> \n<p>I do not need to tell you the rest. The interview. The memes. The Pizza Express reviews. My single (and inadvertent) contribution to youth culture.</p> \n<p>And, after the allotted 45 minutes, we stopped. The prince was still charming, and even more relaxed. He took me off down the marble hall. We chatted about the famous King\u2019s speech and he pointed out the ministers\u2019 staircase, which the prime minister ascends each week to meet the Queen.</p> \n<p>We ended on good terms.

      "bodyText": "Series 3, episode 4: The Crown. A BBC van pulls up at Buckingham Palace to record a royal documentary. As in life, so with television: timing is everything. Had The Crown aired its new series one week earlier \u2026 Had the fictional Queen been spotted squirming at the TV crews in her midst \u2026 Had the distant memories of a now-banned palace interview been fresher in our minds \u2026 It is entirely possible, and more than probable, that the Prince Andrew interview would never have happened. This is the discussion in the Newsnight office a couple of weeks after it aired. We still cannot quite believe it happened. We have to pinch ourselves seeing global headlines, day after day: the ramifications of all the painstaking observations he made to us in that hour of surreal television. I agreed to do an interview about the interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. \u201cWas this your \u2018Frost/Nixon\u2019 moment?\u201d they asked as I walked in. I had barely taken off my coat. I gulped. It felt like the finest thing I have ever been asked, but I couldn\u2019t find a way to respond without sounding like a muppet. They watched every frame. They could tell me the time of the clock hands in the opening shot. \u201cWhat about his tie?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhy was a member of the family of Windsor unable to tie a correct Windsor knot?\u201d I was stumped. I realised they had pored over the interview more intensely than me, one finger permanently on pause and rewind. People have asked what I was thinking as I sat there opposite the prince, preparing for the questions to come. How do you make small talk? How do you compose the tone you need for the hour ahead? My overriding emotion was relief. I expected the interview to be pulled at every stage. It had been months in the making and got sign-off just 48 hours earlier. Even then it was pushed back by a couple of hours, then brought forward by one. My fear was that any sign of procrastination, any shifting of the timetable, would ultimately end in cancellation. So I mainly felt joy we had got this far. The weight of expectation was second to that. No one knew the interview was coming. There had been no publicity. Indeed, the whole event had been kept intensely private. The prince put me at ease; chatty, relaxed. He showed us the end of the room where they kept a projector \u2013 it was turned into a cinema every Thursday evening for the palace staff. As we adjusted our seated positions for the photos, he asked if I had ever been interviewed by David Frost. It was not calculated to shock me, but it did. In his eyes, Frost is the convivial Sunday morning telly host, thrower of excellent parties. But in my head, Frost is the arsonist-in-chief of Frost/Nixon fame. I wonder if he caught my look of alarm at the mention of the name. I am always impressed by interviewers who can do the whole thing without notes. I can\u2019t. I need reminders on my knee. Dates, first names, quotes in bold text. I am addicted to the highlighter pen, my papers generally a garish mix of type, Biro, unreadable scribble and lashings of luminosity, as if they belong to the unhinged. It has to be something that catches my eye in a moment of amnesia or panic. Over the years, I have practised how to lift an entire sentence with a brief glance down, while trying to hold the gaze of whomever I\u2019m talking to. It is the little things that throw me \u2013 the wrong pen, the wrong font. An interview done standing up is a disaster. I need my knees to rest notes on. It is these weird superstitions that can make or break your confidence in those moments before the cameras start rolling. The interview itself, perhaps bizarrely, is the easiest bit. He is there. I am there. The prep is done. We had role-played the interview to prepare. We had imagined scenarios and responses, evasions and deviations. \u201cDo I have to say \u2018Sir\u2019 after each question?\u201d I pondered. My editor, Esme Wren, gave me a gentle look, as if I had gone slightly mad. \u201cYou are courteous and firm. This is a Newsnight interview, not a royal encounter.\u201d It was her focused, steely, enquiring look I found myself channelling each time nerves deserted me. We began to record. I thought about how reasonable he sounded. He was explaining why Jeffrey Epstein was never really his friend, more \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d. For one moment, I imagined I had got everything wrong, misunderstood the story entirely. But I stuck to the line of questioning. And it paid off. Does he regret the visit to stay with Epstein? \u201cYes.\u201d Does he regret the whole friendship? It was around 16 minutes into the interview \u2013 and it was the answer that, for me, changed everything. \u201cStill not,\u201d he said. And told me of the opportunities he was given by Epstein that were \u201cactually very useful \u2026\u201d. It was such a candid admission, such a bald refusal to play the game with any wider apology or regret. It would become the pivotal moment of the entire hour. This is a man \u2013 a prince \u2013 who did not come to repent. He came to earn back his right to tell the story his way. Once I understood that, everything else flowed from there. Andrew was unleashed. Unstoppable. After a decade of silent frustration, he wanted to tell me everything. He paused being \u201ca royal\u201d and found his voice. He told me things he had no need to reveal. About his sweat problems and his trip to Woking, about his knowledge of Belgravia homes and London nightspots. I do not need to tell you the rest. The interview. The memes. The Pizza Express reviews. My single (and inadvertent) contribution to youth culture. And, after the allotted 45 minutes, we stopped. The prince was still charming, and even more relaxed. He took me off down the marble hall. We chatted about the famous King\u2019s speech and he pointed out the ministers\u2019 staircase, which the prime minister ascends each week to meet the Queen. We ended on good terms. He had been generous with his time. We may even \u2013 now I think about it \u2013 have pulled away first. And then we bundled into a black cab back to the office. The interview was ours. Tiny computer memory cards wrapped snug in a folded old envelope. A curious clash of the digital and the deeply analogue. Our producer, Jake, clutched them to his chest. We were sworn to silence for another 12 hours, the recording itself under literal lock and key. Until the rollout began the next morning. It has taken three weeks for my shoulders to finally drop. Three weeks to absorb that the interview we did that day may yet have the power to change the lives of Epstein\u2019s victims. Three weeks of headlines and blanket coverage. Three weeks to realise that questions about the clock and the tie knot and the meaning of a glance or a gesture will continue and ultimately overtake us.

      "body": "<p>Next year is likely to be another of the hottest on record, with global temperatures forecast to be more than 1.1C above the pre-industrial average, according to estimates from the Met Office.</p> <p>The forecast for 2020 is based on observations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/29/four-years-hottest-record-climate-change\">trends over recent years</a> that have seen a series of years more than 1C above pre-industrial levels, and bearing what meteorologists said was the \u201cclear fingerprint\u201d of human-induced global heating.</p> <p>That trend is likely to continue in 2020, the Met Office predicted on Thursday, barring unforeseeable events such as a major volcanic eruption, which would have a cooling effect from the dust thrown into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Next year is also unlikely to see a strong natural warming event, with no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/what-is-el-nino\">El Ni\u00f1o</a> predicted.

      "bodyText": "Next year is likely to be another of the hottest on record, with global temperatures forecast to be more than 1.1C above the pre-industrial average, according to estimates from the Met Office. The forecast for 2020 is based on observations of trends over recent years that have seen a series of years more than 1C above pre-industrial levels, and bearing what meteorologists said was the \u201cclear fingerprint\u201d of human-induced global heating. That trend is likely to continue in 2020, the Met Office predicted on Thursday, barring unforeseeable events such as a major volcanic eruption, which would have a cooling effect from the dust thrown into the atmosphere. Next year is also unlikely to see a strong natural warming event, with no El Ni\u00f1o predicted. El Ni\u00f1o is the weather system in the Pacific that can result in unusually high temperatures, as it did in 1998, which until 2005 held the crown of the warmest year since records began in 1850. For years, that fuelled false claims from some quarters that climate science was wrong and global heating was not occurring. The hottest year on record currently is 2016, when there was an El Ni\u00f1o effect, and the years since have all been close to the record. \u201cNatural events, such as El Ni\u00f1o-induced warming in the Pacific, influence the climate system,\u201d said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the Met Office. \u201cIn the absence of El Ni\u00f1o, this forecast gives a clear picture of the strongest factor causing temperatures to rise: greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d If the forecast is correct, the world will come even closer to the brink of climate breakdown next year.

The first year in which temperatures were certified to be more than 1C above the average from 1850 to 1900 was 2015, so the rate of change has been rapid. If current trends continue, we could breach the 1.5C threshold within two decades. Greenhouse gas emissions show little sign of abating, however: research published during the UN climate talks earlier this month showed that annual carbon emissions were now 4% higher than they were in 2015, when the historic Paris agreement on climate change was signed. The Met Office used the same methods last year to forecast 2019 temperatures, and observations this year show that temperatures tracked its central estimate closely. Its forecast for 2020 is for an increase in global average temperature of between 0.99C and 1.23C, with a central estimate of 1.11C. Temperature rises have been uneven across the globe, with the Arctic heating far faster than the average. Greenland ice is melting seven times faster than in the 1990s, according to research.",

Adjoining pastures remain verdant in the mild weather but cattle are back in covered yards, feeding on home-produced haylage until spring. Gateways into the few cultivated fields are rutted and puddled, and horses, kept at livery, poach the sodden ground. A tall spruce, felled from an outgrown plantation, was transported by a neighbouring farmer to the village hall and decorated with lights. Runoff rushes down narrow lanes between shoals of leaves that also accumulate in hedge footings and are trodden into muddy bridleways; in the hollow way beside Nanie Rowe\u2019s Wood, leaf mould seems to gleam purple against the lurid green of mosses, upright ferns and shining pennywort. Closer to the river, opposite shadowy woodland and above Cotehele\u2019s roaring millstream, pale sunlight glistens on droplets around hazel catkins and fluffy garlands of old man\u2019s beard. Nearby, within the National Trust\u2019s mother orchard, a few late cider apples cling to branches above trunks encircled by dropped, bitter-sweet and sharp-tasting fruit.",

      "bodyText": "Rewilding gardens may be growing in popularity but even a modest reduction in lawn mowing can boost wildlife, increase pollinators and save money, according to a study. Researchers from the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res found that reducing the intensity of trimming lawns in urban areas can also reduce pests and weeds that cause allergies. A meta-analysis of data from 15 years of studies in North America and Europe found strong evidence that increased mowing intensity of urban lawns \u2013 including public spaces such as parks, roundabouts and road verges \u2013 reduced the diversity of plants and invertebrates. Intensive lawn mowing also resulted in an increase in the abundance of weeds and lawn pests, according to data from eastern Canada. Dr Chris Watson, lead author of the study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, said: \u201cThese findings support a lot of research done by the turf industry that shows that the more disturbance a lawn gets, the higher the likelihood of pest and weed invasion.\u201d Watson cited common ragweed, a native of North America and highly allergenic plant, which is an invasive species in Europe, as an example of a plant that thrives under intense mowing.

      "bodyText": "Asylum seekers transferred from Manus Island to Australia for medical treatment under the now-defunct medevac laws have been held in a hotel in Melbourne\u2019s inner north under guard, in detention conditions they say are worse than Manus Island. Close to 180 people were brought to Australia under the medevac law and the majority of those were referred to specialists after an initial health assessment. They are being held in Australia in what the department refers to as \u201coffsite APODs\u201d (alternative places of detention) such as hospitals or hotels. More than 40 people are believed to have been held in the Mantra hotel in Preston, in Melbourne\u2019s inner north, for weeks and even months after being transferred to Australia for medical treatment. While the $160-a-night hotel might look like an upgrade from detention facilities on Manus Island or Nauru, Guardian Australia understands the men are being detained on whole floors of the hotel, under guard, and are unable to interact with other hotel patrons. The Age, which first reported the story, stated the men cannot leave the hotel or go outside, and have access to the hotel gym for two hours each day. One of those men, a Kurdish refugee named Moz, was transferred to Australia under the medevac legislation over 40 days ago, after nearly seven years of being detained on Manus Island. Moz was transferred to treat his asthma. He told Guardian Australia that when he was transferred to Australia he was given a chest x-ray and told his chest was clear, and that was the extent of the treatment. \u201cFor four years I\u2019m coughing, and there\u2019s no treatment.\u201d Moz has been in the hotel ever since, sharing a room with one other person. Some people had been there for five months, he said, adding that the situation was \u201cworse than Manus\u201d. \u201cThey have locked me up in a hotel and there is not any outdoor space for breathing. It\u2019s not an easy situation. \u201cIt\u2019s much worse than Manus because I suffer from asthma and I need an outdoor space.\u201d The only way people detained in the hotel can go outside is to visit the Melbourne immigration transition accomodation (Mita) in Broadmeadows for short periods. Moz said it took two days to receive allowance to go there. He also said he suffered from PTSD that can be triggered by all the security at the centre. \u201cWhen I go there, I\u2019m just trembling.\u201d He said there was no indication from the Department of Home Affairs on what the next stage would be, and whether he would be returned to Manus Island. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful. They don\u2019t tell us anything, and I don\u2019t know what is going to happen after this.\u201d The department did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. In a statement to the Age, the department indicated those transferred to Australia under medevac could be returned to offshore detention. Sarah Dale, principal solicitor at Refugee Advice and Casework Service, who has visited people who have stayed in the hotels, said it was fair to assume that people\u2019s mental health would deteriorate while in detention, even if it was in a hotel. \u201cUntil you\u2019re in the community or on a bridging visa, you\u2019re still under lock and key,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a guard outside your room, you\u2019re detained.\u201d Medical treatment takes time, Dale said, and for many brought to Australia the care needs to be more than just a few days. Refugee advocate Jane Salmon said a hotel was not a substitute for community detention and resettlement. \u201cWhat causes most harm is limited choice, perpetual uncertainty, and, of course, powerlessness. A view of a car park is no alternative to an adequate treatment plan by IHMS [International Health and Medical Services].\u201d The situation in the Mantra hotel is not unique to Melbourne, with refugees transferred to Brisbane also being detained in hotels. The federal government was successful in repealing the medevac law with the help of key crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie earlier this month.",

The video also showed the group chanting \u201cAussie, Aussie, Aussie\u201d while carrying and driving around with flags. Cottrell had his previous magistrates court conviction reinstated and he was fined $2,000 by the county court on Thursday. During the case Cottrell\u2019s lawyer, John Bolton, had argued his client had been protesting against local government and not Muslims. But Kidd said in his judgment that while the stunt was filmed outside the Bendigo council building it did not \u201ccure the vilification intended\u201d. \u201cThe fact that [Cottrell] may have wanted to incite extreme feelings against Muslims [because of their religion] for a political purpose to attend a political rally, does not cure the vilification intended,\u201d Kidd said in his judgment. \u201cThat is, even if the ends were political, the means remain vilifying. Having a political end is not a defence to the charge. The prohibition does not provide such a justification or excuse. Finally, I do not accept the appellant\u2019s bare denial in his evidence that he did not intend to stir up strong feelings. It does sit with the weight of all of the other evidence.\u201d",

They yelled excessively-punctuated praise for the president\u2019s allies and all-caps condemnation of his political enemies, real and perceived. \u201cCan you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG!\u201d he tweeted at 7:34am. \u201cA terrible Thing. Read the Transcripts. This should never happen to another President again. Say a PRAYER!\u201d There would be no divine intervention on the president\u2019s behalf. At 8.35pm ET on 18 December, in a deeply partisan vote and with the public gallery finally nearly full, Trump joined the ignominious pantheon of American presidents impeached by the House of Representatives for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d.",

Satellite photos have revealed that dozens of cemeteries in the north-western region of China have been destroyed in the last two years, as well as the demolition of Islamic religious sites. Cheng said there were 20,000 mosques and 29,000 Islamic clerical personnel in Xinjiang, and claimed internment camps had \u201cnothing to do with religion\u201d. Earlier in December, leading Uighur activist Rushan Abbas visited Australia to urge MPs to do more to speak up against the mass detention of Uighurs, which she labelled the \u201cunprecedented atrocity of the century\u201d. Cheng confirmed that Yang Hengjun, detained in Guangzhou in January, was only formally arrested in August and is being held on suspicion of espionage. Cheng said the case is still under investigation and \u201cin due course [Yang] will be formally charged\u201d \u2013 later backtracking to suggest that because the investigation is not complete it is also possible he will not be charged. Guardian Australia has reported that Yang is granted one half-hour consular visit each month but has not been allowed to communicate with his lawyers, after nearly 11 months in detention. For some of his incarceration, he had been subjected to a single interview each month during which he was not shackled, but earlier in December Yang was subjected to daily interrogation sessions, sometimes commencing at midnight, while his wrists and ankles were held in chains. Cheng said he did not accept claims Yang is being subjected to daily interrogations with his arms and legs shackled. Cheng deflected questions about why China has not invited Scott Morrison to visit, claiming that both countries are trying to facilitate \u201chigh-level exchanges and visits\u201d.",

However, we\u2019ll be taking in feedback from all parties before deciding on whether to make the trial permanent.\u201d</p> \n<p>Should the trial be deemed a success, non-standard times will presumably become increasingly familiar, though it would still remain to be seen if high-profile events such as Royal Ascot were willing to change race times that have been fixed for decades.</p> \n<p>The final day of the Royal meeting on 20 June next year, for instance, is one of six afternoon cards on the schedule, but it is difficult to see the traditional start time of 2.30 being switched to 2.34 to fit in with Perth, Redcar and Down Royal.</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets by Greg Wood</h2> \n<p>The going is heavy for both of today\u2019s jumps meetings with further rain<br>almost certain as the afternoon unfolds so proven form on testing ground<br>should be mandatory before anyone parts with their cash.</p> \n<p><strong>Exod\u2019ela</strong> (1.20) certainly qualifies on that score in the novice hurdle at<br>Exeter, having finished a close second at today\u2019s track in similar<br>conditions late last month. The time of that race was impressive for a<br>hurdling debut and today\u2019s step up in trip could bring further progress so<br>a price of around 15-8 looks reasonable.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere on the card, <strong>The Crooner</strong> (2.20) is another with form on the<br>ground, having shown improvement to register a first success on heavy going<br>at Leicester last week. That was a conditionals\u2019 event so he goes<br>unpenalized today and an extra two furlongs should also suit.</p> \n<p><strong>Grania O\u2019Malley</strong> (2.10) could prove to be the pick of the prices on the<br>day\u2019s other jumps card at Hereford, but the best bet of the day may be on<br>the all-weather as <strong>Locked N\u2019 Loaded</strong> (4.50) is a big price for the nursery<br>which kicks off the card at Wolverhampton later. All six of the runners<br>here go to post with some kind of chance but Tim Fitzgerald\u2019s colt<br>registered a good time in victory when stepped up to today\u2019s trip last time<br>out and a 7lb rise in the ratings may not be enough to stop him following<br>up.</p> \n<p><strong>Excellent George</strong> (7.00) was caught wide from a poor draw last time but PJ<br>McDonald has a better starting position to work with today, while the<br>lightly-raced <strong>Slingshot</strong> (2.30) could make a successful handicap debut in<br>the nursery at Southwell.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The 3.30 at Catterick or Kempton Park could become the 3.29 or the 3.33 in the new year, when the British Horseracing Authority will launch a trial of \u201cnon-standard\u201d race times in conjunction with its Irish counterpart, in an attempt to cut the number of clashes between events at different meetings. Races which are run simultaneously, or with an overlap when one contest finishes as another is in its early stages, cause significant irritation to punters and television viewers who are forced to watch the action on a \u201csplit-screen\u201d, potentially while following a bet in both contests. Clashes also cost the sport money, as betting turnover on both races is likely to be reduced. This is particularly frustrating for all concerned when a major race is affected, as was the case this month when the first half of the Grade One John Durkan Chase at Punchestown was shown on split-screen \u2013 and without commentary \u2013 on Racing TV while a less significant race at Huntingdon was followed to its conclusion. The trial of non-standard times will begin in February, on 11 days during the month \u2013 five Saturdays and six weekdays \u2013 when there are four or more meetings being staged concurrently in Britain and Ireland. The BHA said on Wednesday that the possible benefits of non-standard times \u201cmay include improving the scheduling of race times through periods of congestion so that there would fewer clashes and delayed races\u201d, while also \u201creducing the number of 35-minute intervals and introducing a more even distribution of time between races\u201d. It is also hoped that there will be fewer \u201con-the-day hold requests\u201d when races are delayed at short notice to allow another contest to conclude. Non-standard times are taken for granted by punters in the United States, where the number of meetings spread across the country on a daily basis makes it much more difficult to schedule contests on a five-minute basis without affecting betting turnover. It is a fresh departure in Britain and Ireland where it will have a noticeable effect on the \u201clook\u201d of the programme, which has been familiar to generations of punters and racegoers. The US stages only Flat racing, however, and the much longer duration of National Hunt events, along with occasional mishaps such as false starts, could mean that non-standard times are less effective in avoiding clashes. \u201cWorking closely with our colleagues in Ireland and other partners across the sport, we are always looking for ways to improve our scheduling of races to benefit racing\u2019s customers,\u201d Richard Wayman, the BHA\u2019s chief operating officer, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe impacts, both positive and negative, of non-standard race times will only be known once the initiative is trialled. \u201cThe hope is that they allow for a more even spread of races without requiring longer intervals between races, and potentially fewer clashes or delays. However, we\u2019ll be taking in feedback from all parties before deciding on whether to make the trial permanent.\u201d Should the trial be deemed a success, non-standard times will presumably become increasingly familiar, though it would still remain to be seen if high-profile events such as Royal Ascot were willing to change race times that have been fixed for decades. The final day of the Royal meeting on 20 June next year, for instance, is one of six afternoon cards on the schedule, but it is difficult to see the traditional start time of 2.30 being switched to 2.34 to fit in with Perth, Redcar and Down Royal. Thursday\u2019s best bets by Greg Wood The going is heavy for both of today\u2019s jumps meetings with further rain almost certain as the afternoon unfolds so proven form on testing ground should be mandatory before anyone parts with their cash. Exod\u2019ela (1.20) certainly qualifies on that score in the novice hurdle at Exeter, having finished a close second at today\u2019s track in similar conditions late last month. The time of that race was impressive for a hurdling debut and today\u2019s step up in trip could bring further progress so a price of around 15-8 looks reasonable. Elsewhere on the card, The Crooner (2.20) is another with form on the ground, having shown improvement to register a first success on heavy going at Leicester last week. That was a conditionals\u2019 event so he goes unpenalized today and an extra two furlongs should also suit. Grania O\u2019Malley (2.10) could prove to be the pick of the prices on the day\u2019s other jumps card at Hereford, but the best bet of the day may be on the all-weather as Locked N\u2019 Loaded (4.50) is a big price for the nursery which kicks off the card at Wolverhampton later. All six of the runners here go to post with some kind of chance but Tim Fitzgerald\u2019s colt registered a good time in victory when stepped up to today\u2019s trip last time out and a 7lb rise in the ratings may not be enough to stop him following up. Excellent George (7.00) was caught wide from a poor draw last time but PJ McDonald has a better starting position to work with today, while the lightly-raced Slingshot (2.30) could make a successful handicap debut in the nursery at Southwell.",

She also uses a rigid string of uncooked sausages as a microphone before ripping off her own fur to reveal another layer of fur and a pink, sequinned teddy \u2013 a shot that left many gasping. This confusion over what lies beneath the character\u2019s pelts persists in scenes in which Dench\u2019s already hirsute Old Deuteronomy walks around in an huge overcoat presumably fashioned from her own fur. Despite this, the UK ratings board that determines the certification of films being released in cinemas deemed Cats suitable for everyone. The British Board of Film Certification (BBFC) rated it U for \u201cvery mild threat, rude humour and language\u201d, while its US equivalent, the Motion Picture Association of America, opted for the second most accessible level: a PG, for \u201cperil, some thematic elements and rude humor\u201d. The BBFC\u2019s head of compliance, Craig Lapper, rejected suggestions that the board might have been too lenient. \u201cThere is no sexualisation of the cat characters and the dance routines are no more suggestive than what you would see in an average stage show, including the stage version of Cats, or prime-time TV programme. While there is some very mild threat, it\u2019s brief and broken up by a mixture of comedy, singing and dancing. Any threat that does occur takes place within a highly fantastical context featuring people dressed up as singing cats.\u201d Lapper did concede that the BBFC was aware of some disquiet, but said they felt any erotic overtones inferred by adults would likely go over the heads of children. \u201cThe fact that some people say they\u2019ve found the use of CGI a little unsettling or uncanny is not really a classification matter for the BBFC, and we don\u2019t think kids will find it as \u2018freaky\u2019 as some adults have.\u201d \u2022 Cats is released in the UK and the US on 20 December and in Australia on 26 December.",

The Office for Students said offering inducements such as last-minute bursaries to fill up undergraduate courses risked students being swayed by \u201ca sales pitch with questionable incentives\u201d rather than academic criteria. \u201cThere are concerns about the use of financial offers and inducements being made to prospective students going through the clearing process, a time when those students may be particularly vulnerable,\u201d Nicola Dandridge, the OfS\u2019s chief executive, said while launching her organisation\u2019s annual report. While the regulator declined to name any universities or colleges that had recently used inducements or misleading advertising, Dandridge warned institutions that exaggerating the quality of teaching or misrepresenting the content of their courses would attract the OfS\u2019s attention. \u201cThere can be no place for false and misleading advertising in how universities sell themselves to prospective students,\u201d Dandridge said. \u201cWe cannot have a situation where students\u2019 expectations are raised unrealistically before they go to university, only to be dashed when they get there.\u201d The annual report also highlighted the need for greater efforts to improve access to universities by disadvantaged groups, with the OFS backing a radical overhaul of the way students from poor backgrounds are admitted and retained on courses. But the report also revealed the regulator is unhappy at the failure of many English universities to produce workable student protection plans, which the OfS has touted as a major feature of the new regulatory regime launched in 2017. These are intended to reassure prospective students on what action a university will take in the event of a course, campus or institutional closure disrupting their education. The OfS complained that many university plans were \u201cvery poor\u201d and admitted it had approved inadequate protection plans to avoid suspending the institutions involved. \u201cIt would not have been in the interests of students to delay registration in so many cases, so we have approved a number of plans that are significantly below the standard we would expect,\u201d the OfS said. Michael Barber, the OfS\u2019s chair, has previously said that it will not be able to bail out universities in the event of financial failure, regarding its only role as being to protect students\u2019 interests, saying he expected universities \u201cto develop realistic plans for the future\u201d. The OfS report comes as the UK higher education sector is in the middle of a battle between unions and employers over their pensions, pay and conditions. On Wednesday, the University and College Union, which represents researchers, librarians, technicians and administrators as well as lecturers, announced it will reballot its members at 36 universities next month over continued strike action. In the last month UCU members have taken eight days of strike action at 60 universities. The new votes could potentially add to that total. \u201cWe have been clear from the outset that UCU members are prepared to take serious and sustained action to defend their pay and conditions, as well as their pensions,\u201d Jo Grady, UCU\u2019s general secretary, said. \u201cThis is the time for employers to demonstrate they are serious about wanting to avoid further and even more widespread disruption at our universities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The filming of Cats is a difficult matter, It isn\u2019t just one of your holiday games, Each actor involved here looks mad as a hatter, When the trailer came out, we were CALLING THEM NAMES. It began with Cat poems from old TS Eliot, In the 80s, Lloyd Webber just put them on stage That was frankly a bit of a gamble for Andrew, but Coach-loads of punters made Cats all the rage. Now Cats is on film, with many a lonely puss Played by performers of A-lister class. But the number of mammaries looks frankly erroneous And tails that appear to emerge from each arse. There are lots of big names here, names we see daily, Names that supposedly give us a lift. Nothing like Jonathan Pie or Bill Bailey, But names like James Corden, and \u2013 yes \u2013 Taylor Swift. The setting is London, it does look post-nuclear There aren\u2019t any people, so maybe there were Bomb blasts \u2013 or maybe a bio disaster Causing cat-human mutants with digital fur. The twitching of ears on their heads is distracting As they gaze at the greenscreen and sashay and crawl, It\u2019s weird to behold them all gurning and acting, And why do so many resemble Darth Maul? Did director Tom Hooper intend this appearance? Did it make him feel happy \u2013 or cause him some stress? We have to assume that he gave it his clearance But THE MAN HIMSELF KNOWS and will never confess. These are the Jellicle felines of legend, All elbows and shoulders and undulant arms. Each male in the cast looks a bit of a bellend, And those bizarre whiskers don\u2019t add to their charms. The Jellicles welcome Victoria: a new cat, Francesca Hayward\u2019s the thesp with this role, She\u2019s sleek, unlike Corden \u2013 well known for TV chat But it\u2019s his size that reveals that he\u2019s meant to be droll. And then Idris Elba comes on as McCavity, (A boomy-voiced villain in anyone\u2019s book) There\u2019s a prominent gap in his penis locality. I honestly didn\u2019t \u2026 well \u2026 know where to look. As Grizabella, Jennifer Hudson will sniffle Singing Memory, this movie\u2019s moment of truth. But it\u2019s warbling warbling warbling piffle From a bag lady drama-queen obsessed with lost youth. The Jellicles\u2019 leader is Old Deuteronomy Judi Dench has this part, looking very bemused. What\u2019s with that extra big fur coat? You\u2019ve got me. She looks bewildered and (like us) confused. Obviously, Ian McKellen is in it, And he\u2019s got a tatty old topcoat as well. The other cats\u2019 nude state is clearly permitted. But why? That is something that no cat will tell. There\u2019s another cat in it, by name Mungojerrie, Not the 70s pop group who once raised a cheer, With their Summertime chart hit that really was very Much better, more catchy, than anything here. Ray Winstone\u2019s the creepiest cat in this feature His Growltiger sends a sharp chill down your spine With his hissing he looks like he\u2019s having a seizure, It\u2019s scary \u2013 like adverts for betting online. When you notice these cats in profound meditation With a digitally created frown on their brow Their minds are engaged in a rapt contemplation Of the thought, of the thought, of what on earth to do now. \u201cPretend to be cats!\u201d says a director. They reply \u2026 \u201cMe? How?\u201d \u2022 Cats is released in the UK and the US on 20 December and in Australia on 26 December.",
