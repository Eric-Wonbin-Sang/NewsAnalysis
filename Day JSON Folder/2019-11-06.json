Ludlam had been charged with not complying with police direction regarding a road closure. On Thursday his lawyer Russell Byrnes told registrar Stephen Lister that the former federal senator, as well as six other protesters, would all be pleading not guilty. The case will have its first hearing date on 21 November. Ludlam was not present in court on Thursday. Police have charged Ludlam with breaching section 148B(2) of the Road Transport Act, which has a maximum penalty of a $2,200 fine. Byrnes told Guardian Australia outside court that this was \u201ca very simple charge\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re pleading not guilty, and we hope justice prevails,\u201d he said. Ludlam was initially given strict bail conditions which banned him from coming within 2.5km of the Sydney Town Hall or attending future Extinction Rebellion events. Other protesters arrested were given bail conditions that banned them from \u201cgoing near\u201d or talking to other members of Extinction Rebellion, which civil liberties lawyers said could breach the constitution. In October, Ludlam and other protesters had these bail conditions dismissed by judges. Thirty other protesters, including four teenage girls, were arrested at the same time, as they called on the government to take action on the climate crisis. Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u201cspring rebellion\u201d was a week-long series of protests across Australia \u2013 from road blockages to singalongs. New South Wales police prosecutor, senior sergeant Jamie Palmer, said there were \u201csome 40 people co-accused in these matters\u201d, and it would \u201cneed to run as one hearing\u201d. She told the court that some of the other protesters had already pleaded guilty and been sentenced. In October, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy. \u201cThe people [arrested] are very well aware that if you are disrupting traffic that will invoke a police response. People are not surprised to hear these are arrestable offences. \u201cThe question really is, if the government wants us to stop \u2013 whether that is the school kids or people doing banner drops \u2013 they have a very simple and clear path to do that. \u201cNobody is doing this for fun.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/nov/06/general-election-news-latest-boris-johnson-corbyn-dismisses-boris-johnsons-stalin-slur-as-nonsense-live-news?page=with:block-5dc2846a8f0867dcebfcf955#block-5dc2846a8f0867dcebfcf955\"> 9.06am.)</a> Later, in his speech outside Downing Street, Johnson said the Conservatives \u201cdon\u2019t sneer\u201d at people who set up businesses, but \u201ccheer for them, and do what we can to help\u201d.</p> \n  <p>At the Q&amp;A after his speech earlier today Jeremy Corbyn was asked by my colleague Kate Proctor if it was true that he despised billionaires. He did not answer initially (they take questions in groups of fours at Labour events now), but later, after he had finished taking questions from journalists and when he was taking questions from activists, Corbyn remembered that he had forgotten the question, and he provided an answer. This is what he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My personal view on billionaires is that they\u2019ve obviously got a great deal of money, and therefore they\u2019re in a very strong position to pay a lot more in tax. And I think it would be a really good idea if they do.</p> \n   <p>So our tax plans will affect the richest 5% of our society, we will be chasing down tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax havens, because at the end of the day if you are doing some, what you believe to be, very clever wheeze which somehow or other is avoiding the levels of taxation that you should be paying - go further away, what happens then? You\u2019ve got an underfunded school, an underfunded hospital, underfunded public services as a whole. It\u2019s a moral obligation to pay your taxes, [so] that the others might get the services they need.</p> \n   <p>Because you know what? However rich, powerful and famous you are, however brilliant and clever you are, and you\u2019ve got loads of money, one day you might have a heart attack. And then you\u2019re going to need the ambulance, then you\u2019re going to need the A&amp;E, then you\u2019re going to need the public services that we all pay for our as downpayment on our own security. There\u2019s a moral case for paying that properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2da4871c57d61442644109b6b9ee32255a26d9\"> \n   <img

SNP</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Scottish Labour\u2019s campaign launch in Glasgow has just wrapped up, with <strong>R</strong><strong>ichard Leonard</strong> telling the audience that Scotland had the choice whether Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn was in Downing Street for Christmas, and warning voters that voting SNP was not a short cut to a Labour government.</p> \n  <p>He categorically ruled out any post-election deal with the SNP, rejecting i Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s suggestions that she would be open to a confidence and supply-style arrangement similar to that reached between the DUP and the Tories in 2017, with a second independence referendum as her price for support.</p> \n  <p>It was also notable that one of the early speakers was a community activist called Sean Bailey, who had voted yes to independence in 2014 and only recently joined the Labour party, a clear signal of the kind of voters Scottish Labour desperately needs to win over in the coming weeks. </p> \n  <p>But Leonard could offer little clarity on Labour\u2019s position on an independence referendum if the SNP should win a mandate in the 2021 Holyrood elections, saying that the party was opposed to independence but that there were too many unpredictable factors in play, including the possibility of a second referendum on EU membership offered by his own party, which he argued would remove the SNP\u2019s main argument for another independence poll.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73e637e985100edbe7b32333fb84c0579a03e4b\"> \n   <img

class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon says she wants to hold second Scottish independence referendum in 2020</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In his speech outside Downing Street <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> repeated his claim that a vote for Labour would amount to a vote for two referendums in 2020. \u201cImagine waking up on Friday 13 December and finding [Jeremy] Corbyn at the head of his technicolour yawn of a coalition and they would spend the whole of 2020 having two referendums,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n  <p>This has always been a dubious claim because, although Labour is committed to holding a Brexit referendum next year, it has said it would not approve a Scottish independence referendum next year \u2013 even though it would not object to holding one later in the parliament. It is also, in practice, hard to imagine Scotland holding two referendums within the space of only a few months. The last Scottish independence referendum took place almost two years after it was agreed between London and Edinburgh.</p> \n  <p>But <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has been saying today that she would insist on holding a Scottish independence referendum in 2020. She has already said that as soon as the election is over she will ask the Westminster government for permission to hold one (which is necessary for it to have legal force). And this is what she told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is my intention to have a referendum next year.</p> \n   <p>On this question of will Westminster allow it or not, we are at the start of an election campaign \u2013 this is an opportunity for the people in Scotland to have their say and make their views known.</p> \n   <p>If the SNP win this election, I think that demand becomes irresistible. This idea that for self-interest reasons Westminster politicians can stand in the way of people in Scotland choosing their own future, we already see that start to crumble.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0051c8287eb4184a6923372ba4083db398247b6b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0051c8287eb4184a6923372ba4083db398247b6b/0_177_4141_2485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon with the Ochil &amp; South Perthshire SNP candidate John Nicolson posing with an SNP-decorated cake at a Syrian bakery in Alloa, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon with the Ochil and South Perthshire SNP candidate, John Nicolson, posing with an SNP-decorated cake at a Syrian bakery in Alloa, Scotland.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T17:25:14.573Z\">at 5.25pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc2e4a88f08be4a102e40c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T15:21:51.205Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ofcom </strong>may investigate Kay Burley\u2019s \u201cempty chairing\u201d of James Cleverly (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/nov/06/general-election-news-latest-boris-johnson-corbyn-dismisses-boris-johnsons-stalin-slur-as-nonsense-live-news?page=with:block-5dc2966d8f0867dcebfcf9be#block-5dc2966d8f0867dcebfcf9be\">9.56am)</a>, PA Media reports.

Locally the Green party has about 1,400 members.</p> \n  <p>The biggest cheers were for calls for more social housing, greener transport and action on the climate emergency. \u201cThe time is now,\u201d activists shouted as they gathered to be photographed. \u201cClimate change is the most urgent problem we face\u201d was a common theme among the activists gathered, who hope to frame this election as one of the last chances to avert climate chaos.</p> \n  <p><strong>Lauren James</strong>, of Newport West, who works as a freelance virtual assistant, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This needs to be the climate election \u2013 climate change is knocking on our door. We have been Labour and Tory forever and it doesn\u2019t change. You can vote Labour but sooner or later you get another Tory government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The electoral system was another top concern. <strong>Dominic Tristram</strong>, prospective candidate for Bath, argued that Labour\u2019s opposition to proportional representation meant that a vote for Labour just meant \u201canother Tory government eventually\u201d, as governing swung back and forth among the two main parties under first-past-the-post.</p> \n  <p>The Greens hope that their clear anti-Brexit policies will also distinguish them from Labour. Denyer believes that Debbonaire, who increased Labour\u2019s vote in 2017 while the Greens fell back from their strong showing in 2015, benefited from voters mistaking Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party for remain-supporters. Local Green activists also point to what they see as divisions within the Labour ranks in Bristol.<br></p> \n  <p>All who talked to the Guardian were happy for the party leadership to seek a pact with the Liberal Democrats and potentially other parties that would involved dropping candidates in some seats. They also noted wryly that other parties were keen to follow the Green\u2019s lead in proposals for climate policies such as a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, which mirrored policies pioneered by the Green party. \u201cWe are the thought leaders, they are trying to catch up,\u201d said <strong>Jude English.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ba0cdcf34c952d779851cfbd0d26ef13923bc52\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ba0cdcf34c952d779851cfbd0d26ef13923bc52/0_80_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green party co-leader Sian Berry (left), deputy leader and Candidate for Newport West Amelia Womack (right), and Bristol West candidate Carla Denyer (centre) at the launch of the party\u2019s general election manifesto in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green party co-leader Si\u00e2n Berry (left), the deputy leader and candidate for Newport West, Amelia Womack, (right), and Bristol West candidate, Carla Denyer, (centre) at the launch of the party\u2019s general election manifesto in Bristol.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T13:38:37.231Z\">at 1.38pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc2c3138f08be4a102e3f4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T12:58:38.464Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Johnson finishes, and heads back into No 10, Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton, who is presenting Sky News from Downing Street, shouts at him to ask if people can trust him.

It\u2019s all quite presidential. </p> \n  <p>As an aside, this is a Chinese-made electric bus, one of two the party has in service. The electric one, for obvious reasons, does the briefer trips. </p> \n  <p>The bus is currently between Golders Green in north London and Watford, on a trip which will see Swinson visit three Conservative-held constituencies where the Lib Dems came a pretty distant third in 2017. </p> \n  <p>The first stop was a cafe in Golders Green run by a mental health charity \u2013 mental health provision is one of the day\u2019s themes. Luciana Berger, once of Labour, is the candidate, and local activists were bullish about her prospects, despite the party winning fewer than 3,500 votes in 2017. After Watford we head to the Esher and Walton seat of Dominic Raab, who has a 23,000 majority. </p> \n  <p>Are the party being ambitious or delusional with such campaigning? Only time will tell.

But his party will be bringing people together, he says.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are you worried the Tory attacks on you personally will have an impact on voters?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says he does not do personal abuse.

Has that been dropped?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says the manifesto will be launched in due course. It is not finished. Conference policy has been passed. Some of it will go into the manifesto. On private schools, the main point is for them to pay tax. </p> \n  <p>He thinks schools should be properly funded.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Do you think Chris Williamson and Keith Vaz should be allowed to stand as Labour candidates?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting at this moment to consider this.

(She is a Telegraph reader, but quite what she makes of this diatribe is anyone\u2019s guess.)</p> \n  <p>Here is the key quote from Johnson\u2019s article, which the Telegraph has plastered all over its front page.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The tragedy of the modern Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn is that they detest the profit motive so viscerally \u2013 and would raise taxes so wantonly \u2013 that they would destroy the very basis of this country\u2019s prosperity. They pretend that their hatred is directed only at certain billionaires \u2013 and they point their fingers at individuals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks. In reality they would end up <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/09/dont-put-taxes-cut-reward-strivers-give-economy-jolt-energy/\">putting up taxes on everyone</a>: on pensions, on businesses, on inheritance, on homes, on gardens.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is Corbyn\u2019s response on Twitter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1191857603774693382\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The nonsense the super-rich will come out with to avoid paying a bit more tax... <a href=\"https://t.co/FlUl29ksvz\">pic.twitter.com/FlUl29ksvz</a></p>\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1191857603774693382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It goes without saying, of course, that, whatever you think about the rights and wrongs of Labour\u2019s tax plans and its attitudes to business, any comparison with a dictator responsible for mass slaughter is preposterous.</p> \n  <p>In his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, Charlie Cooper suggests that Johnson\u2019s Stalin reference could be <a href=\"https://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2013/11/24/the-dead-cat-strategy-how-the-tories-hope-to-win-the-next-el\">a classic Lynton Crosby \u201cdead cat\u201d</a> , intended to distract attention from the multiple mishaps that hit the Tory campaign yesterday. Perhaps. But a more likely explanation is that Johnson wanted today\u2019s Telegraph front page to be dominated by claims based on the Treasury costing of Labour\u2019s spending plans, and that he had to rustle up something else after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/05/tories-prevented-from-using-civil-service-to-rubbish-labour-plans\">Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, kiboshed that plan</a>. </p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, visits Golders Green.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister launched the Conservative party\u2019s election campaign, saying he did not want the vote, but felt he had had not choice but to call it. Boris Johnson, whose trustworthiness has been questioned by some who have worked with him, gave a speech in Birmingham that was riddled with misleading and outright false claims. Johnson had earlier used No 10 as a backdrop for a speech in which he made several similar claims. The debate about Labour\u2019s direction under Jeremy Corbyn threatened to erupt again as the party\u2019s deputy leader, with whom he has often clashed, announced he was stepping down. Tom Watson will leave his position within the party and will not seek reelection to the Commons. He said the decision was a \u201cvery personal\u201d one. Read the full story on that in our splash: The Welsh secretary resigned as he faced questions over what he knew about the alleged role of a former aide in the collapse of a rape trial. There have been calls for Boris Johnson to drop Alun Cairns as a Conservative party candidate as the issue threatened to overshadow the party\u2019s election campaign launch. The Tory MP, Andrew Bridgen, apologised for comments about Grenfell Tower disaster survivors. Bridgen was seeking to defend his party colleague, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had suggested people who died in the tower lacked the \u201ccommon sense\u201d to ignore the advice of the fire brigade and leave. Jeremy Corbyn said he would be a very different type of PM to Boris Johnson. The Labour leader set out 10 goals for the government he hopes to form as he delivered a campaign speech in Telford. Corbyn refused to confirm John McDonnell\u2019s claim they would both have to stand down if Labour loses and said billionaires were in a \u201cvery strong position to pay lot more in tax\u201d. Three of the smaller opposition parties announced an electoral pact in some parts of the UK. The Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens finalised a plan to step aside for each other in 60 seats across England and Wales. Scottish Labour ruled out post-election pact with the SNP. The Green party launched its campaign in Bristol, where it has significant support. The local party believes it has a good chance of ousting Labour\u2019s Bristol West incumbent, Thangam Debbonaire, in the 79% remain-voting constituency. Brexit is the UK\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d since the war, according to the recently retired Commons Speaker, John Bercow. He said the Brexit crisis will not be resolved any time soon. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens have finalised a plan to step aside for each other in 60 seats across England and Wales in the general election, Peter Walker and Heather Stewart write. The alliance is intended to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency. The agreement, which does not include Labour, covers 49 seats in England and 11 in Wales. It was made under the banner of a cross-party group called Unite to Remain, which has spent several months trying to broker the plan. A so-called progressive alliance plan, also including Labour, was attempted before the 2017 election but arrangements were only made for a handful of seats \u2013 in part because of the difficulty of getting local parties to agree. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has said: We are delighted that an agreement has been reached. We would like to thank Unite to Remain for making this possible. This is a significant moment for all people who want to support remain candidates across the country. We look forward to sharing the detail of the seats tomorrow. Labour\u2019s outgoing deputy leader, Tom Watson, says his decision to step down and quit parliament was a \u201cvery personal\u201d one. Watson, who has represented West Bromwich East since 2001 and is one of Labour\u2019s most recognisable figures, denied the move was the result of concerns over the direction of the party under Jeremy Corbyn, with whom he has often clashed. I want every Labour supporter campaigning for the Labour team to make sure we can get a Labour government elected. The former Derby North MP, Chris Williamson, has resigned his membership of the Labour party and announced he will stand as an independent in the general election. The party\u2019s national executive committee ruled earlier today that they would not endorse him. In the letter to Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, Williamson wrote: I am dismayed that Labour party officials have enabled and executed what I believe to be a witch hunt against hundreds of socialists loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and his transformative, socialist, anti-imperialist worldview. Many of the victims of this witch hunt have been Jewish socialists, whose anti-Zionism is anathema to the apartheid apologists apparently influencing Labour foreign and domestic policy. Harvey Proctor, the former Conservative MP who was falsely accused of being part of a VIP pedophile ring in Westminster, has said Watson has \u201cdone his constituents a great favour\u201d by stepping down. Proctor, who served in the Commons in the 1970s and 1980s, has now abandoned his plans to run against Watson in next month\u2019s general election. He said: By standing down, Tom Watson has done his constituents a great favour. The next parliament will be a healthier place without him. He will be unable to use public office in future to promote false accusers for personal and political ends. Although this is not the end of it for Tom Watson, I feel vindicated. I can now confirm I will not be standing in the West Bromwich East constituency at the general election. Daniel Janner, the son of Lord Janner \u2013 one of the victims of the VIP abuse probe sparked by Carl Beech \u2013 said Tom Watson\u2019s position had become \u201cuntenable\u201d. Janner has been a fierce critic of Watson, whom he has previously accused of applying \u201cpressure on the police\u201d. Tom Watson whipped up the post-Savile hysteria which damaged falsely accused innocent prominent figures like my late father Lord Janner. His position had become untenable. He has stood down because he would have been defeated. Returning to Labour, here\u2019s a little reaction to the news the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is standing down. From Labour: And from the Conservatives: In his letter to Watson, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has said: Few people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have and I know that many thousands of members and trade unionists that you have inspired and worked with over the years will be very sorry to see you go. Here\u2019s the full letter: Johnson has concluded his speech, thanking supporters and telling them: \u201cI will see you at the barricades.\u201d The prime minister repeated the claim that Corbyn has done a deal with the SNP. We covered the provenance of that here. And he said he didn\u2019t know what Corbyn wanted to achieve in renegotiations with the EU. Writing for the Guardian in September, the Labour leader outlined what he wanted to see in his Brexit deal: And the party backed a motion at its conference that said: Labour\u2019s leave deal would include a new UK-EU customs union, a close relationship with the single market, protections of the Good Friday agreement with no hard border, securing the permanent rights of three million EU nationals in the UK and one million UK nationals in Europe, guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections, and membership of key bodies to ensure joint cooperation in areas like climate change, counter-terrorism and medicines. Johnson has said Corbyn wants \u201cunlimited and uncontrolled immigration\u201d. Labour has expressed support for no such thing. At its conference, the party backed a policy that would protect the current principle of free movement rights enjoyed by EU citizens and extend them; though it\u2019s not entirely clear to what extent. It\u2019s also committed to closing all immigration detention centres and ending \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d policies. Here\u2019s the full motion. Tom Watson is quitting parliament and stepping down as Labour\u2019s deputy leader, reopening the debate about the party\u2019s direction under Jeremy Corbyn. Watson, who is one of Labour\u2019s best-known figures, has represented the constituency of West Bromwich East since 2001. He has repeatedly clashed with Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and his handling of antisemitism, and the party\u2019s conference in Brighton in September was overshadowed by a botched bid to abolish his post. Johnson has also attacked the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage: And Johnson makes further claims about the number of police officers he plans to recruit. We covered that here. Johnson claims \u201c40 new hospitals [have been] green-lighted\u201d as part of the Tories\u2019 policies. This claim is false. The government has announced six hospital upgrades. Dozens of other hospitals have received money to develop plans for upgrades \u2013 but not for the actual upgrades themselves. Full Fact have a good explainer here. Boris Johnson is now up on the stage and he opens with a joke about Andy Street\u2019s name. He claims he \u201cdidn\u2019t want an election\u201d, saying he has no choice because parliament is \u201cparalysed\u201d and refuses to finish the Brexit process. In fact, the Commons voted in favour of giving the bill that would have implemented Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal its second reading. It was Johnson who pulled it after MPs refused to allow him to ram it through parliament within days. It must also be noted that Johnson voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal twice, relenting only at the third time of asking. In addition, Patel claims a vote for Labour would mean two more referendums in 2020: One on Brexit and one on Scottish independence. This echoes Johnson\u2019s claim earlier today that Labour had done a deal with the SNP (see: 12.55pm). In fact, Labour is opposed to Scottish independence and has ruled out a referendum on it in 2020, committing instead to a second Brexit referendum. We set out earlier how dubious the two referendums claim is. In addition, Scottish Labour has explicitly ruled out a post-election pact with the SNP. Next on to the stage is the Tory chairman, James Cleverly, who repeats the claims Labour will hold two referendums. Next up is the home secretary, Priti Patel, who claims the Tories have delivered their promise on a huge NHS infrastructure investment. My colleague, Andy Sparrow, covered that earlier \u2013 suffice to say, it\u2019s not all it seems (see 12.52pm). She also claims the party is delivering on its pledge to put 20,000 more police officers on the streets. Labour have accused the Tories of misleading the public over this, saying their claims don\u2019t stack up because thousands of the new officers are likely to be recruited away from frontline roles. Moreover, the total number of police officers has fallen under successive Tory governments by slightly more than the 20,000 Johnson has promised to recruit. You can read more on that here: The Tory mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, is up on the stage to introduce the prime minister\u2019s election launch speech. You\u2019ll be able to watch that and Boris Johnson\u2019s address at the top of this page. If the video is not yet appearing for you, please refresh the page. Correspondents in Birmingham are reporting that a small group of anti-racism and austerity demonstrators has appeared in the building where Johnson is due to deliver his general election campaign launch speech shortly: Lady Sylvia Hermon, who was until today Northern Ireland\u2019s only unionist remainer MP, will not contest the general election. She has announced she will not be defending the North Down seat she took in 2001. Serving as an MP is a tremendous privilege and I remain profoundly grateful to all those who placed their trust and confidence in me in the last five general elections. It has undoubtedly been the greatest honour of my life to serve the people of North Down as their member of parliament since 2001 and, so, it is with enormous sadness that I have decided not to contest the next general election in December. There is some new YouGov polling out tonight, showing the Conservatives down two points since over the weekend. But a movement of this kind is within the margin of error, the Tory lead is still 11 points anyway and, as everyone knows, in 2017 opinion polls turned out to be a very unreliable guide to the final result. Here are the figures anyway. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. In an interview with Sky News Jeremy Corbyn has refused to confirm John McDonnell\u2019s claim that, if Labour loses the election, both of them will have to stand down. McDonnell said this in an interview for GQ with Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctor. But when asked if McDonnell was right to say Corbyn would stand down as party leader in the event of a Labour defeat, Corbyn refused to answer. He told Sky News: John McDonnell got enticed into areas of discussion that I\u2019m not prepared to get enticed into. Yesterday my colleagues Aamna Mohdin and Ben Quinn published a Guardian story about how the Lib Dems have been accused of misleading voters after a number of candidates published leaflets featuring data from an obscure company, Flavible, that is not a member of the British Polling Council to suggest they are ahead of other parties in various constituencies. Now Flavible itself has said that in some cases its data has been misrepresented by the Lib Dems, either unintentionally or deliberately. It says: As many have seen, campaign material has been distributed by the Liberal Democrats, tweets have been shared by individual candidates and local parties. Most have correctly labelled this data. However, a few have either themselves misinterpreted the data or intentionally mislabelled the data for political advantage. The full statement is here. Here is the latest Guardian Politics Weekly podcast. Heather Stewart is joined by Katy Balls, Anoosh Chakelian, and Jon Mellon of the British Election Study to discuss how everyone\u2019s general election campaigns have gone so far. Plus, Peter Walker reports from the Brexit party\u2019s official launch. In his Telegraph article this morning Boris Johnson suggests that Jeremy Corbyn would persecute billionaires in the way that Stalin purged the kulaks. (See 9.06am.) Later, in his speech outside Downing Street, Johnson said the Conservatives \u201cdon\u2019t sneer\u201d at people who set up businesses, but \u201ccheer for them, and do what we can to help\u201d. At the Q&amp;A after his speech earlier today Jeremy Corbyn was asked by my colleague Kate Proctor if it was true that he despised billionaires. He did not answer initially (they take questions in groups of fours at Labour events now), but later, after he had finished taking questions from journalists and when he was taking questions from activists, Corbyn remembered that he had forgotten the question, and he provided an answer. This is what he said: My personal view on billionaires is that they\u2019ve obviously got a great deal of money, and therefore they\u2019re in a very strong position to pay a lot more in tax. And I think it would be a really good idea if they do. So our tax plans will affect the richest 5% of our society, we will be chasing down tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax havens, because at the end of the day if you are doing some, what you believe to be, very clever wheeze which somehow or other is avoiding the levels of taxation that you should be paying - go further away, what happens then? You\u2019ve got an underfunded school, an underfunded hospital, underfunded public services as a whole. It\u2019s a moral obligation to pay your taxes, [so] that the others might get the services they need. Because you know what? However rich, powerful and famous you are, however brilliant and clever you are, and you\u2019ve got loads of money, one day you might have a heart attack. And then you\u2019re going to need the ambulance, then you\u2019re going to need the A&amp;E, then you\u2019re going to need the public services that we all pay for our as downpayment on our own security. There\u2019s a moral case for paying that properly. Scottish Labour\u2019s campaign launch in Glasgow has just wrapped up, with Richard Leonard telling the audience that Scotland had the choice whether Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn was in Downing Street for Christmas, and warning voters that voting SNP was not a short cut to a Labour government. He categorically ruled out any post-election deal with the SNP, rejecting i Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s suggestions that she would be open to a confidence and supply-style arrangement similar to that reached between the DUP and the Tories in 2017, with a second independence referendum as her price for support. It was also notable that one of the early speakers was a community activist called Sean Bailey, who had voted yes to independence in 2014 and only recently joined the Labour party, a clear signal of the kind of voters Scottish Labour desperately needs to win over in the coming weeks. But Leonard could offer little clarity on Labour\u2019s position on an independence referendum if the SNP should win a mandate in the 2021 Holyrood elections, saying that the party was opposed to independence but that there were too many unpredictable factors in play, including the possibility of a second referendum on EU membership offered by his own party, which he argued would remove the SNP\u2019s main argument for another independence poll. In his speech outside Downing Street Boris Johnson repeated his claim that a vote for Labour would amount to a vote for two referendums in 2020. \u201cImagine waking up on Friday 13 December and finding [Jeremy] Corbyn at the head of his technicolour yawn of a coalition and they would spend the whole of 2020 having two referendums,\u201d Johnson said. This has always been a dubious claim because, although Labour is committed to holding a Brexit referendum next year, it has said it would not approve a Scottish independence referendum next year \u2013 even though it would not object to holding one later in the parliament. It is also, in practice, hard to imagine Scotland holding two referendums within the space of only a few months. The last Scottish independence referendum took place almost two years after it was agreed between London and Edinburgh. But Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has been saying today that she would insist on holding a Scottish independence referendum in 2020. She has already said that as soon as the election is over she will ask the Westminster government for permission to hold one (which is necessary for it to have legal force). And this is what she told the Today programme: It is my intention to have a referendum next year. On this question of will Westminster allow it or not, we are at the start of an election campaign \u2013 this is an opportunity for the people in Scotland to have their say and make their views known. If the SNP win this election, I think that demand becomes irresistible. This idea that for self-interest reasons Westminster politicians can stand in the way of people in Scotland choosing their own future, we already see that start to crumble. Ofcom may investigate Kay Burley\u2019s \u201cempty chairing\u201d of James Cleverly (see 9.56am), PA Media reports. The media watchdog has received numerous complaints about the Sky News presenter\u2019s actions. Complaints are understood by the news agency to relate to Burley\u2019s claims and the empty chair gesture. A spokeswoman for Ofcom said: \u201cWe are assessing these against our broadcasting rules before deciding whether or not to investigate.\u201d Labour\u2019s governing body has decided that the party will not endorse Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn and Roger Godsiff as candidates in the election, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: The national executive committee (NEC) ruled that the three former Labour MPs would not be able to stand as candidates for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party in the December poll. Instead, the party will select other candidates to stand in their former constituencies. Williamson, who represents Derby North, was suspended from the party in February after he claimed that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to criticism of its handling of antisemitism allegations. He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning following a hearing of an NEC antisemitism panel in June \u2013 prompting an outcry from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. But he was suspended again in July after a second panel reviewed the decision to reinstate him and found it \u201ccannot safely stand\u201d. Hepburn, who represents Jarrow in Gateshead, had the whip withdrawn last month following a complaint of sexual harassment. Under party rules, individuals suspended from the party are not eligible to be Labour candidates. Godsiff, who was reprimanded by Labour\u2019s chief whip Nick Brown in the summer for his stance on LGBT rights, was undergoing a reselection process by his local party when the election was called. It is understood the chief whip recommended that Godsiff, who represents Birmingham, Hall Green, should not be endorsed by the NEC to stand in the election. Jeremy Corbyn has said that, following his resignation from cabinet, Alun Cairns should also stand down as a Tory election candidate. Corbyn told journalists: Obviously, legally [Cairns] can stand as a candidate but does he have a moral right to stand as a candidate? If he\u2019s stepping down as a minister because of his involvement then I would have thought the very least the Conservative party can do is not put him up as a candidate in the next election. Plaid Cymru has also said Cairns should stand down as an election candidate. (See 12.41pm.) Cairns is the candidate in Vale of Glamorgan, where he had a majority of just 2,190 over Labour in 2017. At the moment Cairns does want to fight the election as a candidate although, as the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg points out, that might change. This is from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader. On the BBC\u2019s World at One Stephen Crabb, the former Conservative Welsh secretary, said that the story about how a former Tory aide in Wales had sabotaged a rape trial had caused considerable damage to the party in Wales. Crabb said the Tory response reflected badly on the Welsh party. He said: A number of us who are fighting very, very tight marginal seats in Wales have felt increasingly anxious about the story \u2013 not just from a PR point of view, the story not going away \u2013 but the perception that the party itself isn\u2019t addressing the issue in the correct way. The nature of the story demands a far better response from the party \u2026 It shines a light on the party in Wales. It\u2019s problematic we don\u2019t have a woman in a senior position in Wales, we\u2019ve never had a female Welsh conservative member of parliament and I think that reflects poorly on us in 2019. The National Union of Students (NUS) has launched its election manifesto, which is built around three priorities - an education system that is \u201caccessible, funded and life-long\u201d, an end to Brexit and \u201ca healthy society for the good of everyone\u201d, with affordable housing and action to tackle the climate crisis. With the student vote expected to play a significant role in a number of constituencies, the NUS has been working hard on campuses to ensure that as many students as possible are registered to vote, despite the awkward end-of-term election date. The NUS\u2019s recent financial troubles mean it is not the campaigning force it once was but its leader, Zamzam Ibrahim, issued a suitably stirring rallying cry to students up and down the country at the manifesto launch at Brunel University today, calling the 12 December vote \u201cthe election of our lives\u201d. She said: Investment is falling, in our education, in our health, in our businesses. Crises are growing; climate change, social care, and more. Our society is failing, and students across the UK have told us, loud and clear, that this isn\u2019t the future they want. The views of young people have been ignored for too long, so we\u2019re calling on all parties to listen and commit to the action needed to create a future in which everyone can thrive. Commenting on Alun Cairns\u2019 resignation, the shadow Brexit secretary, and former director of public prosecutions, Sir Keir Starmer, said: [Cairns] is right to resign but he has got to face an investigation. This is a very, very serious issue. It goes well beyond a ministerial investigation. Resigning was right to do but it is not enough on its own. The Green party campaign launch took place in Bristol, where the local party believes it has a good chance of ousting Labour\u2019s Bristol West incumbent Thangam Debbonaire, in the 79% remain-voting constituency. Bristol also has a high student population, an acute affordable housing problem and at least 10,000 Extinction Rebellion members, according to local estimates. It has just become the first British city to ban diesel vehicles from parts of the centre. More than 100 activists crowded into a small room in the We The Curious science museum on Wednesday morning to hear Si\u00e2n Berry, co-leader and London mayoral candidate, announce plans to borrow \u00a3100bn a year to spend on measures to cut emissions and protect against the impacts of climate chaos. She shared the platform with the Bristol West candidate, Carla Denyer, a mechanical engineer who designs wind farms, and Amelia Womack, deputy leader and candidate for Newport West, also high on the Green\u2019s target list. Several activists noted with approval that there were three women on the platform, unusual in British politics. A majority of the members gathered for the launch were women, with many veteran activists and a large number of younger people \u2013 the youngest of all a baby and a toddler. Locally the Green party has about 1,400 members. The biggest cheers were for calls for more social housing, greener transport and action on the climate emergency. \u201cThe time is now,\u201d activists shouted as they gathered to be photographed. \u201cClimate change is the most urgent problem we face\u201d was a common theme among the activists gathered, who hope to frame this election as one of the last chances to avert climate chaos. Lauren James, of Newport West, who works as a freelance virtual assistant, said: This needs to be the climate election \u2013 climate change is knocking on our door. We have been Labour and Tory forever and it doesn\u2019t change. You can vote Labour but sooner or later you get another Tory government. The electoral system was another top concern. Dominic Tristram, prospective candidate for Bath, argued that Labour\u2019s opposition to proportional representation meant that a vote for Labour just meant \u201canother Tory government eventually\u201d, as governing swung back and forth among the two main parties under first-past-the-post. The Greens hope that their clear anti-Brexit policies will also distinguish them from Labour. Denyer believes that Debbonaire, who increased Labour\u2019s vote in 2017 while the Greens fell back from their strong showing in 2015, benefited from voters mistaking Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party for remain-supporters. Local Green activists also point to what they see as divisions within the Labour ranks in Bristol. All who talked to the Guardian were happy for the party leadership to seek a pact with the Liberal Democrats and potentially other parties that would involved dropping candidates in some seats. They also noted wryly that other parties were keen to follow the Green\u2019s lead in proposals for climate policies such as a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, which mirrored policies pioneered by the Green party. \u201cWe are the thought leaders, they are trying to catch up,\u201d said Jude English. As Johnson finishes, and heads back into No 10, Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton, who is presenting Sky News from Downing Street, shouts at him to ask if people can trust him. But he does not get a reply. Johnson says: if he comes back with a majority, he will get parliament working \u201cfor you\u201d. Parliament would come back in December, so it could get Brexit done in January. He thanks his staff in No 10. And he says he is now going out to campaign, and to get Brexit done. Johnson says the choice is \u201ccome with us\u201d, a government that believes in a dynamic economy, or go with Labour, the only alternative. Labour would ban Ofsted. And Labour would also have an uncontrolled immigration system. He says his government would stand up for Britain in the world. Or you can go with Labour, who sided with Putin over the Salisbury poisoning attacks. He says Labour would have two referendums in 2020: one on Scotland, because Corbyn has done a deal with the SNP, and one on Brexit. He says people do not know what Corbyn\u2019s Brexit deal would contain. And would it then be \u201cbest of three\u201d with referendums, or \u201ccall it quits\u201d, he says. Johnson says his deal delivers everything he wanted from Brexit. He says if parliament had its way, the UK would not even leave on 31 January. If Brexit is delivered, there will be a surge of investment into the UK, he says. He says he is very proud of what he has achieved so far as PM; the biggest investment in the NHS, 40 new hospitals. (Actually, it is six.) He says he is championing an enterprise economy. When people take risks, and have the guts to find a new market, he does not sneer at them, he says. He does what he can to help. Only by having a dynamic economy can you have a successful market economy. UPDATE: To clarify, the government has announced six hospital upgrades, not six new hospitals. Full Fact have a good explainer here. Boris Johnson is speaking outside No 10. He says he has just been to see the Queen, and she has agreed to dissolve parliament. He does not want an election, he says. But he says there has to be one because parliament is frustrating Brexit. He says it has been so frustrating he has been tempted to chew off his tie. Speaking following an election visit to a factory in Watford, the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said: It\u2019s right that [Alun Cairns has] resigned. The allegations that were made are incredibly serious and I think there are real questions to be asked about why it\u2019s taken him so long to come to this conclusion, and why he said the things he did before. I imagine as time goes on we\u2019ll find out the answers to some of those questions. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From the broadcaster Michael Crick And this is from Liz Saville Roberts, who has been leader of Plaid Cymru at Westminster. I hope that Alun Cairns\u2019 resignation as secretary of state proves to be some solace to the woman at the centre of this case, who still has received no apology from the Conservative party. Mr Cairns\u2019 conduct proved unquestionably that he is not fit to hold ministerial office. You simply cannot be complicit in the attempted cover-up of sabotaging a rape trial and hope to get away with it. Such conduct is neither befitting of a government minister, nor of a member of parliament. Mr Cairns should do the honourable thing and withdraw from the election \u2013 and if he doesn\u2019t, the Conservative party should insist he withdraws. The Welsh Conservatives have put out this statement about Alun Cairns\u2019 resignation from Paul Davies, leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh assembly: I am sorry to see Alun resign today as the secretary of state for Wales. However, under the circumstances this was the right decision for him. Alun has rightly stated that he will cooperate fully with any investigations. I would like to thank Alun for his service to Wales as our secretary of state where he brought an end to the Severn Bridge tolls which will leave a lasting legacy on the Welsh economy. This is from Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, on Alun Cairns\u2019 resignation. John Bercow, who stood down as Commons Speaker last week, has been speaking at the Foreign Press Association this morning. He has described Brexit as the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d by the UK since the war, and said that the Brexit crisis will not be resolved any time soon. These are from La Repubblica\u2019s Antonello Guerrera. And Bercow is writing a book, too. Here is Alun Cairns\u2019 resignation letter. Here is the exchange of letters between Boris Johnson and Alun Cairns. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, is quitting in the light of the BBC Wales story yesterday saying that he had not told the truth when he said that he did not know an aide, who he had backed as a Welsh assembly candidate, had previously sabotaged a rape trial. Boris Johnson has posted this video of himself on Twitter discussing why he is holding an election ahead of his meeting with the Queen this morning. How do we know for certain that the election campaign is under way? Because I\u2019m on a battle bus \u2013 the Lib Dem bus, which has a huge picture of the party leader on the side and the slogan \u201cJo Swinson\u2019s Lib Dems\u201d. It\u2019s all quite presidential. As an aside, this is a Chinese-made electric bus, one of two the party has in service. The electric one, for obvious reasons, does the briefer trips. The bus is currently between Golders Green in north London and Watford, on a trip which will see Swinson visit three Conservative-held constituencies where the Lib Dems came a pretty distant third in 2017. The first stop was a cafe in Golders Green run by a mental health charity \u2013 mental health provision is one of the day\u2019s themes. Luciana Berger, once of Labour, is the candidate, and local activists were bullish about her prospects, despite the party winning fewer than 3,500 votes in 2017. After Watford we head to the Esher and Walton seat of Dominic Raab, who has a 23,000 majority. Are the party being ambitious or delusional with such campaigning? Only time will tell. I shall ask Swinson when we get a promised chat with her soon. Q: Do you think renegotiating a Brexit deal with the EU will be undermined by five of your shadow cabinet saying they will vote remain? Corbyn says his policy has always been to bring people together. He says people who voted leave and people who voted remain are likely to face the same problems, for example on housing. They have the same interests. He says he will negotiate a customs union with the EU, with protection of consumer and workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. And he will hold a referendum. A special conference of the party will decide Labour\u2019s stance. He says all frontbenchers during the election are behind this policy. He says this is sensible, and \u201cgrown-up politics\u201d. Q: In your speech you talk of holding open the door. Is this to a future leader? Rebecca Long-Bailey has posted an interesting video on Twitter. Corbyn says he was elected leader of the party, and will carry on leading it. At some point, \u201cin the long distant future\u201d, there will be another leader, he says. He says he has a very talented frontbench team. He says Labour does genuinely represent people all over the country. Q: Would the A&amp;E unit in the Wrekin stay open under Labour? Corbyn says there should be an A&amp;E department in Shrewsbury and in Telford. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: You say leaders must allow others to play their part. But aren\u2019t your poll ratings so bad you are part of the problem? Corbyn says he never comments on polls. He says he has been elected twice to lead this party, and he will be campaigning for it in the election. He says his message to people in the campaign is that people should register to vote. He says at the start of the 2017 campaign people were writing off Labour. But his party will be bringing people together, he says. Q: Are you worried the Tory attacks on you personally will have an impact on voters? Corbyn says he does not do personal abuse. When they go lie, he will go high, he says. Q: In your list of benchmarks for a Labour government, you did not mention abolishing private schools. Has that been dropped? Corbyn says the manifesto will be launched in due course. It is not finished. Conference policy has been passed. Some of it will go into the manifesto. On private schools, the main point is for them to pay tax. He thinks schools should be properly funded. Q: Do you think Chris Williamson and Keith Vaz should be allowed to stand as Labour candidates? Corbyn says Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting at this moment to consider this. He does not dictate to his party, he says. He leads it. He wants to have the greatest level of democracy in the party. Here is the broadcaster Michael Crick on the NEC meeting. Q: What will you offer on freedom of movement under your Brexit plan? Corbyn says EU nationals who have made their home in the UK have made a fantastic contribution. The insecurity and uncertainty they have been put through has been horrendous, he says. He says, after the referendum, he put a motion to parliament saying EU nationals should have a right to remain in the EU. Boris Johnson voted for it, he says. So, yes, there has to be that movement of people, he says. He says he wants young people to be able to continue to take part in the Erasmus scheme. He ends by saying he wants EU nationals to continue to live here and to be able to come here. Corbyn is now on his peroration. I\u2019ve spent much of my life travelling around the country and the world listening to people. That\u2019s how you learn about the world as people actually experience it \u2013 their struggles and their hopes, their dreams and their frustrations. And that\u2019s why I believe that good leadership is about compassion and understanding not ego. I want to lead a government that\u2019s on your side. That puts power and wealth into your hands. I want to lead a government that works for you. And Corbyn turns to the controversy about Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments about Grenfell Tower. Actually there is one more thing you need to know. They shamefully seem to think the victims of the Grenfell fire died because they didn\u2019t have the common sense to save themselves. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s common sense: Don\u2019t put flammable cladding on people\u2019s homes. That\u2019s common sense. Don\u2019t close fire stations and don\u2019t cut fire fighters. That\u2019s common sense. And don\u2019t ignore residents when they tell you their home is a death trap. Corbyn refers to yesterday\u2019s Guardian story about what pledges Tory candidates have been allowed to sign. Corbyn says: And isn\u2019t it telling that Conservative candidates in this election have been told by Tory HQ that they\u2019re not allowed to pledge to tackle the climate emergency? They\u2019re not allowed to pledge not to privatise our NHS. They\u2019re not allowed to pledge not to sell out our NHS in a trade deal with Donald Trump ... But you know there is something that Conservative candidates are allowed to pledge. Tory HQ says they can pledge to defend shooting animals for sport. Doesn\u2019t that tell you all you need to know about the Conservatives? Corbyn says he wants to lead a Labour government judged by whether it has made a difference to people\u2019s lives. And he sets out 10 benchmarks for success. Here\u2019s how you\u2019ll be able to judge the success of the next Labour government: Judge us on whether in-work poverty still exists in five years\u2019 time. Judge us on whether people are still sleeping rough after five years of a Labour government. Judge us on whether proud women and men are still having to depend on food banks in five years\u2019 time. Judge us on whether 1.4 million older people are still not getting the help they need after five years of Labour. Judge us on whether tuition fees have been scrapped for all students so that no one is priced out of education. Judge us on whether we\u2019ve built hundreds of thousands of genuinely affordable homes, so that decent and secure housing is within the reach of everybody. Judge us on whether patients are still waiting more than four hours in A&amp;E, and tens of thousands are waiting months for cancer treatment. Judge us on whether we\u2019ve got Brexit sorted within six months so we can get on with delivering the real change that Britain needs. Judge us on whether primary school children \u2013 including more than 2,500 children here in Telford \u2013 are still learning in class sizes of larger than 30 after five years of a Labour government. Judge us on whether we\u2019ve unleashed a green industrial revolution, created hundreds of thousands of green energy jobs in the communities that need them most and significantly reduced our greenhouse emissions. Corbyn says being an MP is not meant to be a glamorous job. He says his view of leadership is different from the conventional one. That has led to him being criticised in the papers, he says. You know my view of leadership is different from the one people are used to. Yes, I believe leaders should have clear principles that people can trust, and the strength and commitment not to be driven off course. You have to stand for something. But leaders must also trust others to play their part. Think of it like this: a good leader doesn\u2019t just barge through a door and let it swing back in the faces of those following behind. A good leader holds open the door for others to walk through because everyone has a contribution to make. And when I talk about real change, that isn\u2019t something that will be done to you. It\u2019s something that can only be done with you. So if you, the British people, elect a Labour government on December 12, I will be proud to be your prime minister. Because I will be a very different kind of prime minister. Not the kind of prime minister who believes he was born to rule. Not the kind who thinks politics is a game Corbyn says real politics, for him, is not about shouting abuse in parliament. He does not do personal attacks, he says. He says he is interested in bringing about real change. He says the Labour candidate in Telford has been campaigning against the downgrading of the A&amp;E unit. For him, that is real politics. Corbyn says he started campaigning in Telford for a better society. And he has never stopped, he says. The Labour party is united, and determined to win this election, he says. He says this election is a once in a generation chance to transform society, \u201cby taxing those at the top to properly fund the services for everyone else\u201d. And he says it is also a chance to tackle the climate emergency. Labour is proposing a green industrial revolution, he says. Jeremy Corbyn has just started delivering a speech in Telford. There is a live feed at the top of the page. Corbyn grew up in Shropshire and he says this feels like coming home for him. The Facebook live feed from the Green party launch has gone back to the beginning. But a colleague is at the event, and so I will be posting more from it soon. This picture shows (left to right) Sian Berry, Carla Denyer and Amelia Womack. Sian Berry, the party\u2019s co-leader, is speaking at the launch now. She says this election is about far more than Brexit. This must be the climate election. The future won\u2019t get another chance. Back at the Green party launch Amelia Womack, the party\u2019s deputy leader, has just finished speaking. She said voters should accept no imitations. The Greens were the only party truly serious about tackling the climate emergency, she argued. According to the Press Association, Boris Johnson spent just over 25 minutes with the Queen at Buckingham Palace this morning. Carla Denyer, the Green party candidate in Bristol West, is speaking at the launch now. She says ordinary people all over the country are demanding climate action. The Greens will galvanise the country during the campaign with the most ambitious green new deal proposed anywhere in the world. My colleague Fiona Harvey has written up the Greens\u2019 plans here. The Green party election launch has just started. There is a (rather shaky) live feed on the Green party\u2019s Facebook page. Boris Johnson\u2019s audience with the Queen is over. He is now heading back to No 10. He is due to give a speech outside Downing Street at 1pm. Yesterday afternoon, long after Jacob Rees-Mogg had apologised for his comment about the Grenfell Tower victims lacking the sense to ignore the advice to stay put, the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen (a Brexiter, and hence a natural ally of Rees-Mogg\u2019s) went on the PM programme and in part defended what the cabinet minister had said. Bridgen suggested that Rees-Mogg may indeed have been cleverer than the Grenfell Tower victims. This morning Bridgen himself has apologised for what he said. Boris Johnson has tweeted this. The PM\u2019s audience with the Queen is little more than a pointless photo opportunity. In the past prime ministers who wanted to hold a general election had to ask the Queen to dissolve parliament, and so a trip to Buckingham Palace was always part of the election ritual. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act means that the timing of an election is no longer in the gift of the Queen. This election is happening because, in order to get round the FTPA, parliament passed legislation, the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019. But since the passing of the FTPA prime ministers have continued to insist on driving up the Mall to the palace at the start of an election, as if they believe that voters won\u2019t believe it\u2019s a real election unless they have seen the Queen somehow sanction it. Boris Johnson has just left Downing Street to drive to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen. Ed Vaizey, the Conservative former culture minister, has announced that he is standing down. He was one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed in September after rebelling over Brexit, but he was also one of the 10 from that group who recently had the whip restored. In an open letter to the PM, he says that he remains an \u201centhusiastic supporter\u201d of Johnson and of Johnson\u2019s \u201cone-nation agenda\u201d. Johnson claims to be committed to one-nation Conservatism, but many of the most prominent supporters of this brand of Toryism (centrism, as they would call it in the Labour party) have either had the whip removed, or are leaving parliament, leading many to conclude that Johnson\u2019s administration would be better described as firmly rightwing. Broadcasters are often reluctant to \u201cempty chair\u201d politicians. They worry that it makes them look confrontational and partisan, in breach of their impartiality obligations \u2013 even though not highlighting a party\u2019s refusal to answer legitimate questions could arguable be seen as conferring some sort of advantage. So it was surprising \u2013 and refreshing, if you approve of these tactics \u2013 to see Sky\u2019s Kay Burley pillory the Conservative chairman James Cleverly this morning, in his absence, for ducking out of her TV interview. Do watch it. It\u2019s quite a moment, not least because Burley\u2019s summary of all the awkward questions facing the Tories is hard to fault. Former Scottish secretary David Mundell believes Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments about the Grenfell victims were \u201cinappropriate\u201d but insists it is \u201ctotally without foundation\u201d to infer that they show Conservatives do not understand how the majority of people in the UK live their lives. Interviewed on BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, Mundell said: Most Conservative MPs are very well grounded, they come from a huge variety of backgrounds and the caricature that everybody is like Mr Rees-Mogg is wrong. Meanwhile, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has released an open letter to Scotland\u2019s remain voters, urging them: \u201cDon\u2019t sit back and let the Tories decide your future.\u201d This early message not to \u201csit back and do nothing\u201d on 12 December indicates how focused the party are on former SNP voters who did not turn out in the 2017 general election, leading to significant losses. In 2017, analysts also suggested that independence supporters were not convinced of the need for a second independence referendum so soon after the 2014 vote; SNP strategists are banking on the fact that two more years of Brexit chaos has substantially increased their appetite. The Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, has been doing a round of interviews this morning. Here are the key points from his interview on the Today programme. Cleverly defended the Conservative party\u2019s decision to post a doctored video on social media edited in such a way as to imply that Labour\u2019s Sir Keir Starmer could not answer a Brexit question. Asked about it, Cleverly said: What we also did, and this is not unique to us, is we did a lighthearted satirical video, obviously so with a comedy soundtrack, highlighting the Labour party\u2019s chaotic position on Brexit. Asked whether his party had \u201cposted a lie\u201d online, Cleverly replied: \u201cI disagree with your assessment of it.\u201d Cleverly said he accepted that the comment from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, about Grenfell Tower residents not having the sense to ignore advice to stay put \u201ccaused a huge amount of hurt and distress\u201d. Cleverly said a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period was still an option, because no deal was the \u201cdefault setting\u201d. But it was not what the party wanted, he said. Asked whether a no-deal Brexit was still possible, in the light of Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to rule out extending the transition and to abandon a promise made two weeks ago to give MPs a vote on this, Cleverly said: Ultimately, the default setting has always been no deal. That is not what we want. The prime minister has demonstrated, as have the EU, that, when you are focused and both trying to get a good outcome, it can be done. Cleverly described as \u201cunacceptable\u201d a past comment from a Tory candidate in Wales about how people on the reality TV programme Benefits Street needed \u201cputting down\u201d. But he would not commit the party to removing Francesca O\u2019Brien, the woman who made the comment, as the candidate in Gower. Cleverly said: This is a comment that the candidate themselves recognised was unacceptable. People often tweet in haste and regret what they have done afterwards. But, asked whether O\u2019Brien should be replaced, Cleverly said: I think there are always things that people do which they regret. They say foolish, sometimes insensitive things. We do take very seriously the language we use and sometimes we recognise that people make a mistake and, when they do so, if they recognise what they have done wrong and they apologise, I think that is taken into consideration. I think that\u2019s a balanced approach. Almost every general election in Britain in living memory has started with pundits predicting that the campaign is going to end up being the nastiest and dirtiest ever. In truth, those claims are probably often wrong, but it is going to be hard to pretend otherwise in 2019 when Boris Johnson is formally launching the Conservative general election campaign by comparing Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin. The prime minister has said so in an article (paywall) in the Daily Telegraph, a few hours before he goes to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen. (She is a Telegraph reader, but quite what she makes of this diatribe is anyone\u2019s guess.) Here is the key quote from Johnson\u2019s article, which the Telegraph has plastered all over its front page. The tragedy of the modern Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn is that they detest the profit motive so viscerally \u2013 and would raise taxes so wantonly \u2013 that they would destroy the very basis of this country\u2019s prosperity. They pretend that their hatred is directed only at certain billionaires \u2013 and they point their fingers at individuals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks. In reality they would end up putting up taxes on everyone: on pensions, on businesses, on inheritance, on homes, on gardens. And here is Corbyn\u2019s response on Twitter. It goes without saying, of course, that, whatever you think about the rights and wrongs of Labour\u2019s tax plans and its attitudes to business, any comparison with a dictator responsible for mass slaughter is preposterous. In his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, Charlie Cooper suggests that Johnson\u2019s Stalin reference could be a classic Lynton Crosby \u201cdead cat\u201d , intended to distract attention from the multiple mishaps that hit the Tory campaign yesterday. Perhaps. But a more likely explanation is that Johnson wanted today\u2019s Telegraph front page to be dominated by claims based on the Treasury costing of Labour\u2019s spending plans, and that he had to rustle up something else after Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, kiboshed that plan. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, visits Golders Green. Later she will be in Watford on another campaign visit. Morning: Boris Johnson goes to the palace to formally notify the Queen about the election. On his return he is due to make a statement in Downing Street. 10.30am: The Green party launches its election campaign at an event in Bristol. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn delivers a speech in Telford. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, visits Workington. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, visits Ochil and South Perthshire 12pm: The National Union of Students launches its manifesto for the election. 1.20pm: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, launches the Welsh Labour party campaign in Cardiff. 1.30pm: Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, launches the Scottish Labour party campaign. 7.30pm: Johnson formally launches the Conservative election campaign at a rally in the West Midlands. Unless there is some major non-election news, I will just be focusing on the election campaign, covering breaking news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian election coverage here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Christian Porter has suggested company directors could be disqualified from sitting on boards for underpayment of workers and endorsed union calls for a new small claims process to grant compensation. In an interview with the Australian following the $300m underpayment of salaried staff at Woolworths, the attorney general and industrial relations minister said that \u201cfor a substantial section of corporate Australia, they just don\u2019t get it, and the message isn\u2019t getting through\u201d. Porter\u2019s comments foreshadow a tougher response to underpayments in a future industrial relations discussion paper, after earlier statements that criminal penalties will be confined to cases of serious, deliberate and systemic wage theft. The Australian Industry Group immediately poured cold water on the proposals, noting there were already \u201cvery heavy penalties\u201d for breaches of awards and arguing giving a tribunal the power to order backpay may breach the constitution. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has lobbied the government for criminal penalties and a small claims process for the Fair Work Commission to rectify underpayments without the need to go to court. Porter told the Australian the small claims process is \u201ca good idea\u201d that would address an apparent \u201cgap in the market\u201d and allow workers to have their concerns about underpayment dealt with quickly and efficiently. Porter said the law is not currently providing effective deterrence and that if corporate Australia had its \u201ceye on the ball\u201d the spate of recent underpayments \u201cwouldn\u2019t happen\u201d. However, he said it is \u201cmonstrously unlikely\u201d big companies are underpaying workers deliberately. \u201cI accept that some awards are complicated, particularly in the restaurant and retail environments, but these are unbelievably very sophisticated organisations \u2014 Bunnings, the ABC, Maurice Blackburn, Woolies \u2014 and they have huge HR departments. \u201cThese organisations have a massive amount of time, energy and resources devoted to ensuring they don\u2019t pay a cent more tax than they have to; they get involved in sporting teams and social issues. \u201cIf they put commensurate resources into making sure they got their payrolls working in accordance with [enterprise agreements], awards and the law, they wouldn\u2019t be having this problem.\u201d Porter proposed adding to the list of directors\u2019 duties in the Corporations Act to include the responsibility to ensure their companies pay staff correctly, allowing the Fair Work Ombudsman to pursue banning orders if they failed that duty. \u201cThis would provide the real potential that directors of companies that fail to pay their staff appropriately could lose their position and the ability to hold directorships in the future for a period of time,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cAny such changes would therefore apply to directors of Australia\u2019s largest companies.\u201d AiG chief executive Innes Willox called for \u201ccalm consideration\u201d of potential changes because \u201cthe vast majority of businesses do the right thing and if errors are discovered they quickly remedy them\u201d. \u201cThe ACTU\u2019s proposal to give the Fair Work Commission the power to deal with underpayments, breaches the separation of powers in the Australian constitution as determined in the high court\u2019s Boilermakers Case in 1956,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, the high court held that the predecessor tribunal to the Fair Work Commission could not exercise judicial powers because these powers can only be exercised by a relevant court. \u201cThe commission does not have the power to order employers to make back-payments and it cannot impose penalties.\u201d In the final sitting weeks of 2019 the Coalition is set to push through its bill to increase court powers to deregister unions or disqualify their officials. One of the key union counter-arguments against the proposal was that directors of companies responsible for underpayment, such as George Colombaris, are not currently subject to disqualification. Porter can guarantee passage of the bill by making amendments to accommodate Centre Alliance while counting on the vote of Jacqui Lambie, who will vote for it because controversial unionist John Setka has refused to resign, or seek to push it through with Lambie and One Nation\u2019s support. The proposal for director disqualifications is likely to be met with scepticism by Labor, which has accused the Coalition of failing to deliver on its commitment to create a director identification number to prevent phoenixing, a process whereby businesses go broke to avoid paying worker entitlements. Labor has circulated amendments which will force the government to vote on the director identification number in parliament, but the Morrison government has repeatedly pulled the combatting illegal phoenixing bill from being debated and voted on.",

Medical developments have made the test much more accurate, and testing less frequent - which may help those most at risk.</p> <p>Pap smears, the tests used from 1991 until the new screening was introduced in 2017, are at best a nuisance, at worst a traumatic ordeal. For many, that has meant foregoing them altogether.</p> <p>Only six out of 10 Australian women test at the required interval of every two years.

      "bodyText": "The way we screen for cervical cancer in Australia has changed dramatically, bringing us closer than ever to achieving eradication of the disease by 2035. Medical developments have made the test much more accurate, and testing less frequent - which may help those most at risk. Pap smears, the tests used from 1991 until the new screening was introduced in 2017, are at best a nuisance, at worst a traumatic ordeal. For many, that has meant foregoing them altogether. Only six out of 10 Australian women test at the required interval of every two years. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and the economically disadvantaged are overrepresented in the number that don\u2019t test. This has real consequences for those individuals. More than 80% of cervical cancer occurs in people who aren\u2019t screened regularly or at all, and therefore aren\u2019t warned early enough to prevent cancer developing. DIY makes testing an option for more people People can administer the new cervical screening test themselves, providing a more acceptable option for women, nonbinary or transgender people who don\u2019t currently test and are most at risk. Cervical screening is a very intimate procedure. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and used to widen the opening, allowing the doctor or nurse to take a sample of cells from the cervix, which sits at the neck of the uterus. If you feel uncomfortable, you\u2019re not alone. Dr Lara Roeske, a spokeswoman for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), says it can be overwhelming for some. \u201cFear, embarrassment, pain, or the perception of pain, are big barriers to getting tested,\u201d she says. Also, cultural sensitivities, a history of abuse, trauma, and discrimination experienced by women and LGBTQI people can make what is an already a potentially difficult experience much worse. \u201cThat\u2019s not a small group,\u201d says Dr Roeske, a co-author of the National Cervical Screening Program guidelines. With the help of detailed instructions, people can perform the test alone, in a private room, at their GP or family planning clinic (it can\u2019t be taken home).

Alli looks to have been bundled over amid the melee, but the ball breaks to Kane, who pulls a volley across the face of goal, left to right. Son tries to bundle the ball home, but hits the bar. And finally the man who started it all, Lo Celso, crashes home! That ... was <em>intense</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"202bc3420239662eab7306456ef42a939e23014b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/202bc3420239662eab7306456ef42a939e23014b/0_0_2300_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lo Celso scores the opener for Tottenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lo Celso scores the opener for Tottenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T20:40:32.583Z\">at 8.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc32de48f08c2d1f80dafbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T20:33:30.498Z\">8.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>32 min: </strong>Now Garcia is clattered by Rose, who was late and clumsy.

They\u2019re a different proposition in Serbia: they\u2019ve won 13 of their 14 league matches so far this season, and have lost only two of their last 21 home games in Europe.

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was at the Marakana to witness Tottenham\u2019s first away win in any competition since the Champions League semi at Ajax, nearly six months ago. Here\u2019s his report. Enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Mauricio Pochettino speaks. \u201cIt is good, we are happy with the performance of the team. Our approach was fantastic. We controlled the game, and we were better. This game will help us stay together, and now we need to keep going. We need three points more to qualify, but it\u2019s a good feeling after Everton.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s two-goal hero Son Heung-min speaks. \u201cIt was so important to win this game, especially against a team who were unbeaten at home. We played really well. It\u2019s a really difficult place, and we should take confidence, the positive things. It has been a tough few days, but my team-mates and supporters have made me realise how lucky I am. Everyone gave me strong messages. Of course I feel really, really sorry about this accident ... [long pause] ... but I had to focus for the team.\u201d Easy to forget that Red Star could - and probably should - have scored two goals in the first half. But they didn\u2019t manage it, and Spurs were utterly dominant in the second half. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men thoroughly deserved their victory, and they\u2019re now looking good for a place in the knockout stage. One more win will guarantee it - and if Bayern win at Red Star next time round, they\u2019ll be through no matter what. Special praise goes to Son Heung-min, who responded to the emotional tumult of Goodison by scoring twice, and Giovani Lo Celso, so impressive on his full debut. It\u2019s been a good night for Tottenham. A magnificent performance by Spurs, who now just need to beat Olympiacos on matchday five to progress to the knockout stage. 90 min +4: The Red Star coach Vladan Milojevic isn\u2019t happy with that Skipp challenge. He\u2019s bouncing around on the touchline, beyond furious. Boakye limps off, unable to continue. The hosts will end the game with nine men. 90 min +2: Skipp is booked for an extremely over-zealous slide on Boakye. That could easily have been a red. Needlessly aggressive. 90 min +1: Eriksen should free the lively Sessegnon down the left, but opts to attempt to spring Kane in the middle instead. Wrong choice. His pass is easily cut out. 90 min: But there will be four added minutes. Poor Red Star. 89 min: Ndombele sends Sessegnon away down the left. Sessegnon spots Kane free in the centre, but he slips as he tries to hook a cross towards his captain. Red Star are all over the shop now, in tatters, and are desperate to hear the final whistle. 88 min: Red Star don\u2019t often get battered like this at home. I wonder when the Marakana was last as quiet as it is now? 86 min: The excellent Lo Celso is replaced by Oliver Skipp. Rose feeds Sessegnon down the left. Sessegnon pulls one back for Eriksen, who shapes to send a shot towards the bottom right. But it takes a deflection and dribbles apologetically past a wrong-footed Borjan and into the bottom left. 83 min: Sessegnon combines with Lo Celso and tees up Eriksen, who tries to fire low into the bottom right from 20 yards. It\u2019s an easy gather for Borjan. 81 min: Red Star have used all their subs, so they\u2019re down to ten men now. Ninety minutes can\u2019t tick round fast enough for the hosts. 79 min: Pavkov crumples in a heap, having jumped for a high ball and landed awkwardly on his ankle. He\u2019s in some pain, and won\u2019t be able to continue. He departs on an electric buggy. 77 min: Kane crosses from the left. Lo Celso wafts a weak volley wide right. That was a good chance, he should have done much better. But he\u2019s had a fine game tonight, as has Ndombele. Throw in the beginning of Sessegnon\u2019s Spurs career, and Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s second-wave Spurs side is beginning to take shape. 75 min: Tottenham\u2019s two-goal hero, Son Heung-min, is replaced by Ryan Sessegnon, making his Champions League debut, three days after turning out for Spurs for the first time in the Premier League. 73 min: A lull ... and a sense that both teams would quite happily declare now, given the opportunity to do so. 71 min: Ndombele rolls a pass down the right for Eriksen, who cuts one back from the byline. Kane meets it, 10 yards out and level with the right-hand post. He drags his shot inches wide right. Or was it deflected? It looks deflected. It should have been a corner. Kane is incensed, though the scoreline being what it is, it doesn\u2019t really matter. But Kane will be wanting a goal. 69 min: Ndombele cuts in from the right and finds the top-left corner ... of the stand behind the goal. That was a wild old slash. 68 min: Marin waits to take, but before he does so, Richmond Boakye comes on for Mateo Garcia. The free kick\u2019s then whipped towards the bottom-left corner. Lo Celso blocks for a corner that\u2019s easily dealt with by the Spurs defence. 67 min: Marin busies himself down the left and is crudely bundled over by Foyth. Just outside the box, but a free kick in a dangerous position nonetheless. The crowd find their voice again. 66 min: The home crowd, so intimidating early on, have fallen almost totally silent. The only songs to be heard are coming from the away end. Glory, glory, all that. 65 min: Petrovic slides in late, though not particularly recklessly or dangerously, on Rose. It\u2019s mistimed enough to earn a booking, though. 64 min: That was a quite magnificent one-two from Spurs, who drew the sting from a re-energised Red Star, calmly and methodically, before springing forward and surely putting this game beyond the hosts. Four minutes that could get their season back on track. 62 min: A couple of changes in the wake of the third goal. Jose Canas comes on for Dusan Jovancic, while Christian Eriksen replaces Dele Alli. Spurs are in total control now! Kane slips a glorious pass down the left for Rose, who scampers into space and squares for Son, who slams home from close range at the far post! 59 min: Red Star win a corner down the left. Marin takes, but it\u2019s easily cleared and Lo Celso nearly breaks clear into the Red Star half on his own. Red Star want to watch themselves here. And then Spurs, having bored Red Star into submission, break quickly upfield! Sissoko powers with great grace down the inside right, holding off his man and drawing another defender. He\u2019s got Alli and Son to his left. He feeds Alli, who shuttles the ball on to Son, and the striker roofs one past Borjan. A wonderful goal on the break! Tottenham\u2019s away-day woes could be coming to an end here in Belgrade. 56 min: Spurs pass it around the back in the sterile fashion. It\u2019s clever, because it\u2019s getting on the home crowd\u2019s nerves. It doesn\u2019t make for great viewing, admittedly, but Spurs haven\u2019t won on the road for nearly six months, so you do what you have to do. 54 min: All a bit scrappy again. Spurs will be happy enough with that, in the wake of Red Star\u2019s recent burst of increased energy. 52 min: So having said that, Spurs nearly make it two, Alli sashaying into the box through the middle only to be robbed just as he\u2019s cocking his leg back to shoot. The ball\u2019s poked out for a corner, from which nothing much occurs, despite the very impressive Lo Celso\u2019s prompting. 50 min: Degenek, quarterbacking from deep, fires a long pass down the inside-left channel and nearly finds Garcia in the Spurs box. Not quite. Another goal kick. But this is much better from Red Star. 49 min: Red Star should be level. Ndombele gifts the ball to Marin in midfield. Suddenly Red Star are two on two. Marin instigates a one-two with Pavkov, and should be sent clear into the box on the left, but the return pass is a real clunker. Goal kick, and Marin is beyond livid. 47 min: Tottenham impose themselves on the second half immediately. They stroke the ball this way and that. Then Kane bursts into the box down the left. Kane goes over very easily in a barging match with Milunovic, who did shove the Spurs captain in the small of the back, but very gently indeed, so come on. The referee\u2019s not having it, quite correctly. We\u2019re back! Spurs get the second half underway. Red Star have made a change at right back, with Jander coming on for Marko Gobeljic. Half-time entertainment. A few episodes of the magnificent Nessun Dorma pod for your leisure and pleasure. Includes a fine dissection of Ossie Ardiles and the Famous Five, the cult attacking quintet of Teddy Sheringham, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, Ilie Dumitrescu, Darren Anderton and Nick Barmby. Enjoy! And that\u2019s the end of the first half. If you didn\u2019t know better, you could be forgiven for thinking this game has a multi-ball feature. Two amazing pinball sequences, one at each end, both going Tottenham\u2019s way. It\u2019s been great fun. More in ten minutes! 45 min +2: Van la Parra earns a corner for Red Star in the second of two added minutes. Marin floats it in from the left. Pavkov is penalised for pushing. For a second, the home crowd think the referee\u2019s signalling for a penalty. But it\u2019s not to be. 45 min: This has been all Spurs, really, and yet Red Star must wonder how they\u2019ve managed to pass up two gilt-edged invitations to score. 43 min: More pinball madness, this time in the Spurs box! Van la Parra bursts into the box on the right and smacks a shot against the base of the right-hand post. Sanchez, facing his own net, loops the rebound over his own keeper Gazzaniga and off the crossbar! Spurs clear, having got away with that big-style! 42 min: Son earns a corner on the left. He possibly should have laid the ball off for Alli. From the set piece, he tries to mend fences by slipping a pass down the left wing for Alli. Too much juice on the ball, and it\u2019s out for a goal kick. Alli doesn\u2019t look particularly pleased. 41 min: Alli considers a shot from 20 yards, but thinks twice and slips the ball right for Lo Celso, who is brimming with confidence after his goal. We know this because he\u2019s just tried to flick an insouciant shot into the bottom right from the edge of the box, first time, with the outside of his boot. It flies wide, but full marks for ambition. 40 min: Some more space for Kane down the inside right. He floats a chip over Borjan and over the bar. The flag goes up for offside, so it didn\u2019t really matter. 38 min: Lo Celso\u2019s finish was quite sublime, by the way. A cushioned first touch and a deft swish into the top right, calmness personified amid some wild nonsense. 36 min: The previous entry was brought to you by Bally Entertainment. Pinball madness! Lo Celso wins the ball in the midfield and sends Kane clear down the inside right. Kane enters the box and should score, but slips the ball past Borjan and off the base of the right-hand post. Son volleys the rebound goalwards, but it\u2019s hacked off the line. Alli looks to have been bundled over amid the melee, but the ball breaks to Kane, who pulls a volley across the face of goal, left to right. Son tries to bundle the ball home, but hits the bar. And finally the man who started it all, Lo Celso, crashes home! That ... was intense. 32 min: Now Garcia is clattered by Rose, who was late and clumsy. But it\u2019s just a free kick, he gets away without a booking. So each side has had one. Fair\u2019s fair. 30 min: Dier goes up to challenge for a high ball, and clacks Pavkov in his startled coupon. He goes in the book. That was completely unnecessary. Now he\u2019s tip-toeing gingerly along that metaphorical ribbon of censure, the disciplinary tightrope. He\u2019ll be up on that an hour! 29 min: Ndombele is fine, all right. He nearly releases Son with a glorious slide-rule pass down the inside-left channel, but just as Son is shaping to meet it first time and shoot on goal from an inviting position, Milunovic slides in to intercept. Fine football all round. 26 min: Son is crudely stopped in his tracks by Gobeljic, and that\u2019s a free kick just to the left of the Red Star box. Ndombele wafts the set piece into the box, and it\u2019s eyebrowed out for a corner by Van la Perra. Lo Celso takes the corner from the right. The ball\u2019s punched clear by Borjan, then lashed wildly high and wide by Sissoko. A sense that a goal\u2019s coming soon, one way or another. 25 min: Well, that got the home crowd going again. Red Star needed that, because Spurs have enjoyed nearly 70 percent possession so far. 23 min: So after all that, it\u2019s Red Star who nearly take the lead. Pavkov, who scored twice against Liverpool here last year, barges his way through a couple of poor Spurs challenges, and he\u2019s free in the box! He opens his body and sidefoots powerfully towards the bottom right, but Gazzaniga has read his intentions well, and sticks out a strong leg to block and clear! 22 min: Sissoko drives Spurs forward, winning possession and finding Lo Celso in a central area, 25 yards from goal. Lo Celso slips the ball to Son on his left; Son drops a shoulder and drags a shot across Borjan and wide right. 21 min: Foyth and Lo Celso combine well down the right again. Foyth pushes the ball along the byline only to lose control before he can find a team-mate, and Degenek is able to clear. Most of the game is now being played in Red Star\u2019s final third, though Spurs haven\u2019t warmed Borjan\u2019s hands yet. A sense that it\u2019s only a matter of time. 19 min: Sanchez\u2019s long pass down the middle nearly causes havoc in the Red Star box, but Borjan manages to slap the ball out of harm\u2019s way with Son and Kane lurking, hoping to pick up the pieces. Spurs are beginning to cause Red Star a little trouble. 18 min: Lo Celso finds Foyth on the overlap down the right. Foyth\u2019s cross isn\u2019t all that, but it\u2019s good enough to win the first corner of the game. Lo Celso sends a vicious inswinger into the mixer, a fine delivery, but Borjan punches clear with confidence from the middle of a packed box. Lo Celso has looked lively in these early exchanges. 16 min: Son reaches the byline down the left and scoops a dangerous ball over Borjan. It\u2019s begging to be prodded home, but there\u2019s nobody there in dark blue, and turns out he was offside anyway, the flag going up late. 15 min: Rose and Pavkov clash heads in the middle of the park. Ooyah oof. Totally accidental, and while Rose furrows his brow and attends to his sore neep by rubbing it with great vigour, both players look fine to continue. We play on. 13 min: Suddenly Spurs spark into life. Sissoko slips a quick ball down the inside-right channel. Ndombele shuttles it further on to Kane, who takes a stride into the box and lashes the evening\u2019s first shot in anger into the side netting on the right. 12 min: Spurs knock it about the back for a while. They go absolutely nowhere, but that\u2019s not really the point. They continue to work their way into this game, and are quieting down the crowd a little. Just a little, mind, it\u2019s all relative. 10 min: Lo Celso plays a cute ball around the corner for Kane, who makes good down the right and tries to interact with Son just inside the Red Star box. But Kane leans unnecessarily on a nearby defender and it\u2019s a pressure-releasing free kick. 8 min: Lo Celso has the ball at his feet and options ahead of him. But he can\u2019t pick a pass. Possession\u2019s given up to Van la Parra, who draws a foul from Lo Celso. All a bit scrappy at the moment. 6 min: Borjan launches a goal kick long. Pavkov flicks on for Garcia, who threatens to get the better of Foyth, but the Spurs man nudges a weak pass backwards towards Dier, who sorts out the bother. Another slightly uncertain moment for Foyth; a worry for Spurs unless he finds his feet soon. 4 min: Foyth hassles Rodic out on the Spurs right. The ball breaks to Kane, just inside the box, and he tries to combine with Ndombele, but Red Star swarm around and refuse to be opened up. That\u2019s a first sortie into the Red Star half for Spurs, and a small foothold in the game after that early home flourish. 2 min: Marin attempts a dribble down the left but the Red Star captain goes down a dead end. He might have taken a little knock while doing so, and grimaces accordingly. Ah, panic over, he looks fine to continue and trots back upfield. Here we go, then! The hosts get the ball rolling. It\u2019s launched forward quickly, and Foyth hesitates with the ball at his feet. He\u2019s nearly closed down by Van la Parra, but a rebound goes out for a goal kick. Red Star are soon coming back at Spurs, Garcia nearly besting Rose down the right. But Rose keeps cool and clears. A fast start from the home side, though. The teams are out! The 1991 champions Red Star sport their world-famous red and white stripes, while Spurs are shunted into second-choice dark blue. There is, it goes without saying, one hell of an atmosphere at the Marakana. Red Star don\u2019t lose here often. In fact they rarely concede, so let\u2019s not be too disappointed if we don\u2019t get another 4-4 tonight. But whatever happens, it\u2019ll be a big test of Tottenham\u2019s moxie. Handshakes and coin tossing to come, but we\u2019ll be off before you know it! Incidentally, in the early kick-off in Group B, Bayern Munich have beaten Olympiacos 2-0. So they\u2019ve qualified for the knockout stage already. The abridged pre-match thoughts of Mauricio Pochettino. He tells BT Sport it\u2019s the \u201cright moment\u201d for Giovani Lo Celso to make his full debut, having finally got himself up to full fitness. Meanwhile Son Heung-min has \u201cmoved on quick\u201d after the distressing injury to Andre Gomes at Goodison Park. \u201cHe\u2019s started to realise it wasn\u2019t his fault. He is in a perfect state to perform.\u201d One last point: it\u2019s going to be a \u201ctough game\u201d. So here\u2019s how the players get from the changing room to the pitch at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. (Actually this is the NFL Tunnel Club under the East Stand, but it mirrors the Spurs Tunnel Club in the West Stand, so you get the general idea.) And now here\u2019s the corresponding route at Red Star\u2019s Marakana. Good luck, Harry! Good luck, everyone! Tottenham make five changes to the XI sent out at Everton last Sunday. Toby Alderweireld, Christian Eriksen, Lucas Moura and Ben Davies drop to the bench, while Serge Aurier is out altogether. In come Danny Rose, Eric Dier, Giovani Lo Celso, Juan Foyth and captain Harry Kane, who has recovered from a virus. Red Star Belgrade - Crvena zvezda to the purist - make three changes to the side thrashed at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium two weeks ago. Midfielders Milos Vulic and Jose Canas, and striker Tomane, are replaced respectively by Njegos Petrovic and Dusan Jovancic, and Milan Pavkov. Red Star Belgrade: Borjan, Gobeljic, Milunovic, Degenek, Rodic, Jovancic, Petrovic, Garcia, Marin, van La Parra, Pavkov. Subs: Popovic, Pankov, Vulic, Richmond Boakye, Jander, Simic, Canas. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Foyth, Sanchez, Dier, Rose, Sissoko, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Alderweireld, Vorm, Sessegnon, Eriksen, Lucas Moura, Skipp, Davies. Referee: Carlos Del Cerro (Spain). Spurs swatted Red Star aside a fortnight ago in north London. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min both scored twice in an easy 5-0 win at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Erik Lamela also getting on the scoresheet. In that sense, they should be confident of getting the victory tonight in the return match, one that\u2019d help immensely in their quest to qualify for the knockout stage. Nevertheless, they\u2019ll be wary. Red Star were pasted 4-0 at Liverpool last season, yet bounced back to beat the eventual champions 2-0 in Belgrade soon after. They\u2019re a different proposition in Serbia: they\u2019ve won 13 of their 14 league matches so far this season, and have lost only two of their last 21 home games in Europe. And this season they\u2019ve already got a 3-1 win over Olympiacos in their Group B bag. A home win tonight will give Red Star a boost in their hopes of reaching the last 16. Spurs are also, that Red Star home game aside, woefully out of form. They\u2019re struggling in the league, lost to Colchester in the League Cup, and of course went down freakishly, 7-2, to Bayern Munich last month. Factor in the harrowing events of their match at Everton last weekend - Son shaken after his involvement in Andre Gomes\u2019s awful injury - and theirs is not a happy ship right now, for one reason or another. But what succour a win would give last year\u2019s finalists. A good performance tonight, and their European adventure, along with their season, is back on track. It\u2019s a big one for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men, as the group stage enters the business end. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT, 9pm at the Stadion Rajko Miti\u0107 in Belgrade.",

The Atalanta striker saw an opportunity to go down and caressed Bravo\u2019s back with his trailing leg as he went to ground. But through his impetuousness, Bravo gave the referee a decision to make; whether or not he made the right one \u2013 in consultation with VAR \u2013 is open to debate. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dc343e48f0867dcebfd019e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-06T22:10:06.283Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy speak ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Benjamin Mendy:</strong> \u201cI think tonight was a very tough game, City\u2019s left-back tells BT Sport. \u201cWe know it before the game.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAll the season, for the injuries, for the problems that we have,\u201d he says, when asked by BT Sport about the various problems he had to deal with tonight. \u201cIn this competition you have chances and moments, and when you have chances and moments you have to take it. We had a good first half, but in the second half we suffered a lot. In the last 15 minutes we had the situation we had with the new goalkeeper in our squad.\u201d Upon being asked if Ederson would be fit to face Liverpool on Sunday afternoon, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d He goes on to say that tonight\u2019s result is a good one away from home, then tells Des Kelly that he and his players are going to have their dinner, go home and then start preparing for Liverpool tomorrow. Jamie Jackson was at the San Siro to see the spoils shared on an occasionally crazy night. Here\u2019s how he saw the action unfold ... Looking at Bravo\u2019s dismissal: Studying replays of the incident that led to Bravo\u2019s red card, I think the goalkeeper was hard done by. His decision to rush out of his penalty area was undeniably idiotic, but he didn\u2019t bring Ilicic down. The Atalanta striker saw an opportunity to go down and caressed Bravo\u2019s back with his trailing leg as he went to ground. But through his impetuousness, Bravo gave the referee a decision to make; whether or not he made the right one \u2013 in consultation with VAR \u2013 is open to debate. Benjamin Mendy: \u201cI think tonight was a very tough game, City\u2019s left-back tells BT Sport. \u201cWe know it before the game. I say again, thank you, Kyle [for saving the free-kick].\u201d Kyle Walker: \u201cI think it was a little bit of both,\u201d says City\u2019s emergency stand-in goalkeeper upon being asked if he was appointed or volunteered. \u201cSometimes I criticise our goalkeepers for not catching the ball in training but as I found tonight that sometimes you have to take two touches. We came here looking for a point or a victory, but they\u2019re a very good side.\u201d City need a point: Elsewhere in this group, Dinamo Zagreb and Shakhtar Donetsk have played out a 3-3 draw. the upshot is that City need one more point to guarantee their paaage to the knockout stages. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at the San Siro, where the spoils have been shared. Manchester City went ahead through Raheem Sterling, but a spirited comeback in the second half led to an Atalanta equaliser from Mario Pasalic. Following the dismissal of their substitute goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, a halftime replacement for Ederson, Kyle Walker went in goal for Manchester City. Their hosts were unable to capitalise, however, as City did an excellent job in controlling possession and preventing them from testing the novice keeper. 90+7 min: The first free-kick Kyle Walker had to face aside, Atalanta have failed to create a chance that has tested him. Their fans are not happy and are whistling and jeering. 90+6 min: Manchester City have a throw-in, deep in Atalanta territory. Bernardo Silva gets a yellow card, although I\u2019m not sure why. Time-wasting, would be my guess. 90+4 min: Papu Gomez lofts a dinked cross straight into Walker\u2019s arms, rather than unleash a shot from distance. 90+3 min: Hateboer attempts to test Walker with a high ball into the Manchester City penalty area. The \u201cgoalkeeper\u201d remains anchored to his line and watches gratefully as the ball sails out for a throw-in by the corner flag. 90+2 min: Atalanta substitution: Luis Muriel replaces Timothy Castagne. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into the first of seven minutes of added time. I think it should be nearer 10 minutes, considering all the substitutions and the six-minute delay between Bravo being sent off and play resuming after Kyle Walker replaced him. 89 min: Hats off to Atalanta\u2019s fans, by the way, for giving Kyle Walker a huge cheer when they saved that free-kick from 25 yards out. 88 min: Malinovsky shoots low and hard through the wall but Walker saves, albeit unconvincingly. He fails to hold on to the ball first time around, but grabs it at his second attempt. 86 min: We\u2019re still waiting for somebody to make way for Kyle Walker after a delay of about five minutes. There seems to be some sort of problem with the fourth official\u2019s electronic board. finally, Riyad Mahrez walks off and is replaced by Kyle Walker, who goes in goal for City. His first job is to line up a wall to face a free-kick from his fellow substitute Malinovsky. The red card stands! Bravo walks off the pitch then turns around and walks back on because his red card has yet to be officially confirmed on the big screen. It looks like Kyle Walker will be taking his jersey and gloves. Laughing with the fourth official, Kyle Walker pulls the goalkeeper gloves on, looking a vision in his pink jersey. I\u2019m not sure who he\u2019ll be replacing. Atalanta substitution: Malinovsky on for Remo Freuler. 82 min: We all love to see an outfield player in goal, so I can\u2019t be the only one delighted to see Bravo get his marching orders for a foul that could scarcely have been more idiotic. What on earth was he thinking!?!?!? Fun and games at the San Siro! With Ederson off injured, his replacement is sent off for charging out of his penalty area and bringing down Ilicic, who was through on goal. That was bonkers, but it\u2019s being checked by VAR. 79 min: Timothy Castagne is booked for a foul on Fernandinho. 78 min: Atalanta have been very impressive in this second half, almost unrecognisable from the comparatively meek version of themselves that played the first 45 minutes. They\u2019re fighting for every ball here, putting City\u2019s players under heavy pressure, whereas in the first half they were pedestrian, content to sit back and let their visitors play it out from the back. 75 min: Good defending from Hateboer, who does well to get back and slide in to intercept an attempted pull-back from the byline by Raheem Sterling. Manchester City win a corner, which Kevin De Bruyne makes a mess of. He is only human, after all. 74 min: Manchester City substitution: Sergio Aguero on for Gabriel Jesus, who hasn\u2019t had one of his better nights. 73 min: Atalanta win a free kick a long way out and the ball is curled across the face of goal. It looks to be on a plate for Djimsiti, but he fails to make contact and a wonderful chance goes begging. 72 min: Claudio Bravo is forced to backpedal as he collects a steepling cross from deep. 69 min: Fernandinho is booked for barging Hans Hateboer over as they gallop down the touchline. Despite sprinting alongside them, the linesman didn\u2019t raise his flag, but the referee over-ruled him. Manchester City\u2019s players protest at length, although replays suggest the referee was correct to brandish his yellow. 68 min: A promising Atalanta move breaks down when Pasilic sells Gomez short with a pass as the Italian side\u2019s captain was galloping into the Manchester City penalty area. 64 min: City break upfield with Riyad Mahrez on the ball. Play is switched to the left, where Raheem Sterling plays the ball inside to Fernandinho and carries on his run into the penalty area. Fernandinho plays the ball into his path and Sterling looks certain to score or pass to Jesus for the tap-in, only to check his stride and miscontrol the ball straight to the goalkeeper, Gollini. 61 min: Atalanta right wing-back Hans Hatebor takes on Benjamin Mendy down the right flank and wins his side a corner. The ball\u2019s sent into the mixer by Gomez and Berat Djimsiti gets a flick-on at the near post. His effort skids narrowly wide of the far post. Atalanta are playing with seriously renewed vigour in this second half. 60 min: Papu Gomez wriggles away from Riyad Mahrez oand into the left side of the Manchester City penalty area. He unleashes a shot, which is blocked at close quarters by Nicolas Otamendi. 58 min: Palomino brings down Gabriel Jesus with a late challenge and avoids a yellow card. That\u2019s his third or fourth such foul of the evening, but he\u2019s yet to be booked. 57 min: Palomino dispossesses Raheem Sterling and advances on the counter-attack for Atalanta, who have been much more proactive in trying to win the ball back from Manchester City in this second half. They\u2019ve certainly knocked City\u2019s players off their stride with this more aggressive approach. 56 min: Claudio Bravo dashes out of his penalty area and clears with a diving header as Ilicic bears down on him chasing a ball over the top. Good goalkeeping ... I think. 54 min: Riyad Mahrez tries to curl an effort inside the far post but his shot is deflected out for a corner. 53 min: Chelsea fans may recognise tonight\u2019s goalscorer, Mario Pasalic, who is a 24-year-old Croatian international who is on loan at the Serie A club from the Stamford Bridge outfit. 51 min: Atalanta waste a free-kick in a decent position outside the Manchester City penalty area as Ilicic dilly-dallies on the ball and allows Gundogan and Jesus to charge down his effort. Atalanta equalise. And it couldn\u2019t be more straightforward. Manchester City\u2019s defenders switch off, Ilicic crosses from the right and an unmarked Pasalic doesn\u2019t have to break stride as he nods past Bravo. 48 min: Ilicic gets in behind the Manchester City to pick up a pass from deep near the penalty spot. He tries to control the ball on his chest, but his touch is diabolically bad and takes him away from goal. 47 min: Des Kelly, BT Sport\u2019s intrepid and dashing touchline reporter, has reported that Ederson is off for precautionary reasons after suffering a \u201cminor injury\u201d. 46 min: Manchester City get the second half started and there\u2019s one curious change in their line-up. Ederson has gone off for reasons that remain unclear and Claudio Bravo is on between the sticks in his place. Ederson didn\u2019t look injured at any point during a first half in which he didn\u2019t have much to do, so Pep may just have decided to give his understudy some minutes on the pitch. We\u2019ll find out soon enough. Peep! The teams go in for their half-time refreshments with ManchesterCity an excellent Raheem Sterling goal to the good. They should be a lot further ahead, but several missed chances, not least a dreadful penalty by Gabriel Jesus, means Atalanta need not be too disheartened as they try to claw something back in the second half. 45+1 min: Free-kick for Atalanta in a good position right in line with the right edge of the City penalty area. Ilicic takes it and the ball is deflected out for a corner, which Cancelo heads clear. 44 min: Some house-keeping: Illicic was booked for handling the ball to give away that penalty. As his team-mates jumped to try and block Sterling\u2019s free-kick, he turned side-on and put his arms out, only for the ball to strike them. Gabriel Jesus misses with an atrocious effort. He rolls the ball a yard wide of the left upright, but even if his effort had been on target, it was so weak that Atalanta goalkeeper Gollini had it covered. 41 min: Atalanta form a defensive wall, which refuses to retreat behind the white line sprayed in the grass by the referee. Raheem Sterling takes the free-kick and fires it into the wall. It\u2019s blocked by Josip Ilicic\u2019s arms, as he turns his back to the ball. The ref checks his pitchside monitor and awards City a penalty. After a VAR consultation, the penalty is overturned and it\u2019s a free-kick right on the edge of the area instead. Toloi is booked. Raheem Sterling is brought down by Rafael Toloi with a foul that began outside the penalty area. The referee awards a penalty. 37 min: A rare poor touch by Raheem Sterling in the centre-circle gifts possession to Atalanta, who are plugging away gamely. 35 min: More slick and mesmerising build-up play leads to Riyad Mahrez shooting low and hard for the bottom corner. Pierluigi Gollini gets down to save well, although I suspect the goal might have been chalked off if Mahrez had scored, as Jesus was offside and interfering with play. 32 min: Sterling squares the ball for Bernardo Silva who is loitering with intent about seven yards out from the Atalanta goal. The pass is slightly wayward and Palomino is able to shepherd it to safety, while holding off Silva 29 min: City almost double their lead with one of their trademark goals. They get in behind Atalanta and Kevin De Bruyne pulls the ball back into the penalty area from the angle of six-yard box and byline. Sterling shapes to pull the trigger but is denied by Jose Luis Palomino who makes a timely last-ditch block. 26 min: Berat Djimsiti is booked for dragging out of Riyad Mahrez as, not for the first time this evening, the Manchester City winger galloped past the defender. 25 min: Ilkay Gundogan plays the ball out wide to Mahrez, who pulls it across the edge of the Atalanta six-yard box. Sterling had read his intention and made a lung-busting run to try to convert at the far post, but the ball was too far ahead of him. 24 min: Palomino almost makes a pig\u2019s ear of trying to defend a Mendy pass towards Sterling in the penalty area, but recovers in time to hack clear. 22 min: Atalanta are doing reasonably well here, despite being a goal down and being dominated in the possession stakes. One gets the felling, however, that Manchester City are taking it pretty easy on them and could move through the gears pretty quickly should the need arise. 20 min: Ederson plays it long to Raheem Sterling, who controls the inch-perfect pass expertly, beginning another phase of possession for Manchester City. They win a free-kick and then a corner, when a defender hooks the ball off Jesus\u2019s foot and out of play. 18 min: Benjamin Mendy is penalised for handball as he controls the ball with his arm just inside his own half. 16 min: Gabriel Jesus is bundled over about 30 metres from the Atalanta goal and appeals for a free-kick, but doesn\u2019t get one from Aleksei Kulbakov, tonight\u2019s referee. 15 min: Atalanta attack, with Illicic controlling the ball beautifully in the inside right channel before playing it inside to Remo Freuler on the edge of the penalty area. City clear. 14 min: Bernardo Silva plays the ball wide to Riyad Mahrez as Manchester City continue to turn the screw on the edge of the final third. They\u2019re starving Atalanta of possession and forcing the Italian side to feed off scraps. 12 min: City attack down the right, with Joao Cancelo pinging a pass towards Gabriel Jesus. His touch is poor and the ball goes out for a throw-in. 11 min: Gabriel Jesus leaps to try and head a Riyad Mahrez corner goalwards. The delivery is a mite too high and he is unable to get much purchase on the ball. Atalanta are seriously under the cosh here. 9 min: Kevin De Bruyn whips a cross from the right in towards Gabriel Jesus, who is a couple of yards from the penalty spot. His touch is poor and allows Atalanta to clear. With a better connection, he could have volleyed home for a spectacular second. 8 min: Raheem Sterling passes wide and left to Bernardo Silva and gallops forward. Silva picks out Gabriel Jesus on the left side of the penalty area and he back-heels the ball into Sterling\u2019s path with a deft no-look back-heel. Sterling takes the ball in his stride and curls it around the despairing dive of Pierluigi Gollini and inside the upright. Raheem Sterling opens the scoring for City with a beauty. 4 min: Atalanta right wing-back Hans Hatenboer volleys into the side-netting after ghosting in at the Manchester City far post and getting on to the end of a Timothy Castagne cross from deep. That was a decent chance. 3 min: Atalanta enjoy a spell of possession, which comes to an abrupt end when Papu Gomez is fouled by Gabriel Jesus. 2 min: Ederson shapes to kick the ball long, then is (mildly) panicked into passing short to his right as he\u2019s pressed by Josip Ilicic. 1 min: Atalanta kick off, their players wearing blue and black striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Manchester City\u2019s players are wearing that luminous yellow and orange kit that makes them look like ice lollies. Not long now: With their own stadium not up to Champions League scratch, Atalanta\u2019s players make their way out on to the San Siro sward alongside their opponents. There\u2019s a crowd of about 30,000 in the stadium, who are all in fine voice as the Champions League anthem blares out over the PA. City will guarantee themselves top spot in Group C if they beat Atalanta and Dinamo Zagreb draw with Shakhtar Donetsk in the evening\u2019s other game. Pep rings the changes: With a Premier League game against Liverpool to come on Sunday afternoon, Manchester City\u2019s manager has made five changes from the side that laboured to victory against Southampton last Saturday. Benjamin Mendy, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Nicolas Otamendi come into defence, while Riyad Mahrez is in for the injured David Silva. Bernardo Silva is expected to fill in for his namesake, with Mahrez lining up on the right of a front three. Sergio Aguero makes way for Gabriel Jesus, who will play as the central striker. Atalanta: Gollini, Toloi, Djimsiti, Palomino, Hateboer, de Roon, Freuler, Castagne, Pasalic, Gomez, Ilicic. Subs: Kjaer, Masiello, Muriel, Guilherme Arana, Malinovsky, Sportiello, Barrow. Man City: Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Fernandinho, Otamendi, Mendy, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling. Subs: Doyle, Bravo, Walker, Stones, Aguero, Jose Angelino, Garcia. Referee: Aleksei Kulbakov (Belarus) Having thrashed Atalanta at the Etihad Stadium in the last round of group games, Manchester City will be hoping to register another win and book their place in the knockout stages with two matches to spare. While Atalanta have yet to get off the mark in the group, having conceded 11 goals in their three defeats so far, they can still technically qualify. Fifth in the Serie A table, eight points off leaders Juventus, Atalanta are having a decent season on the domestic front, but come into tonight\u2019s match with just one win from their past five games. Kick-off at the San Siro is 8pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

After all, it was he who was credited with being a factor in Gordon Brown\u2019s mission to get rid of Tony Blair. He took on Rupert Murdoch in the phone-hacking scandal and played a role in the closure of the News of the World newspaper; surely he would be able to finish off the Labour leader, backbenchers would say. Colleagues believe he has left after too many internal battles with Corbyn\u2019s senior aides. But friends say Watson has found other interests such as public health and has a happy life outside politics. Nevertheless, his departure will force many in the party to reassess their own futures. Born Thomas Anthony Watson in Sheffield in 1967, he was named after his great-grandfather, a Yorkshire miner. His grandmother, Elsie Watson, was a communist who stayed in the party until the collapse of the Soviet Union. His parents were both Labour supporters. His father had various odd jobs, as a binman and bread delivery man, until he began a new career in 1970 as a social worker in Kidderminster, where Watson grew up. In 1984, aged 17, Watson landed a job in Labour\u2019s then headquarters in Walworth Road, south London. Long a music obsessive, he was thrilled in 1987 to help organise Red Wedge, a collaboration with musicians such as Billy Bragg and Paul Weller that sought to draw young people to the party. After a stint as a union official, Watson entered parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He became a whip in 2004 and in 2006 was given a role as defence minister. Watson was one of many figures in the Labour party who wanted Blair to stand down. But he was one of the few to say so publicly and signed a letter urging Blair to quit.

After Brown became prime minister, Watson returned to government as a whip. In 2008 he briefly joined the Cabinet Office, where he was minister for digital engagement and civil service issues. He was planning to stand down in 2010, friends said, because his marriage was ending. But during a hearing of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, in which he had taken up a role, a story broke about the News of the World paying out for hacking the telephone of Gordon Taylor, a Professional Footballers\u2019 Association official. Over the next few years, he joined the Guardian in pursuing the Murdoch empire, memorably quizzing the media mogul in front of the Commons committee. Watson enhanced his reputation as a fixer in 2010 when he helped Ed Miliband beat his brother David to become leader of the party. He was rewarded with a job as general election coordinator. However, he stood down from that role in 2013 following rows over the selection of a Labour candidate for Falkirk, where Karie Murphy, Watson\u2019s then office manager and a close friend of the Unite leader Len McCluskey, was standing. Since his election as deputy leader in 2015, there has been a war of attrition between Watson and Corbyn\u2019s closest lieutenants, although the men themselves are often said to get on amicably. McCluskey, with whom he had fallen out, has often called for him to be removed for allegedly undermining Corbyn. Watson\u2019s interests in public health took off last year after he lost 44kg (7st) and reversed his type 2 diabetes. In his role as shadow culture secretary, and as deputy leader, Watson has campaigned against a freewheeling gambling industry, urging a review of online casino licences and an overhaul of regulations. However, his instinct for tackling powerful interests came spectacularly unstuck over the claims of historic sexual abuse allegations in Westminster. A report by the former high court judge Sir Richard Henriques into the police investigation into the allegations fabricated by the fantasist Carl Beech said officers may have been put \u201cin a state of panic\u201d by a letter Labour\u2019s deputy leader sent on House of Commons notepaper. Henriques also said Watson \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d one suspect who was never charged. Watson responded by saying the report had been selectively leaked to minimise criticism of the police and that it contained \u201cmultiple inaccuracies\u201d. In September, Corbyn was forced to personally intervene to defuse an attempt by Momentum chair Jon Lansman to oust Watson.

It was made under the banner of a cross-party group called Unite to Remain, which has spent several months trying to broker the plan. A so-called progressive alliance plan, also including Labour, was attempted before the 2017 election but arrangements were only made for a handful of seats, in part because of the difficulty of getting local parties to agree. The template for the Unite to Remain idea was the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection in August, where the decision of Plaid Cymru and the Greens to stand aside helped the Liberal Democrats overturn a Conservative majority of 8,000 to take the seat. Heidi Allen, the Conservative-turned-Lib-Dem MP, who is standing down in December\u2019s election, was involved in organising the Brecon and Radnorshire pact and subsequently co-launched Unite to Remain. Allen said the level of cross-party working was \u201cunprecedented in modern British political history\u201d.

Beyond giving the split of the seats between England and Wales, the group has not provided details of which seats will be involved, although they are billed as stretching from Cornwall to Yorkshire, and from Sussex to north Wales. The majority of candidates given a free run will be Lib Dems given that the party had 20 MPs when parliament was dissolved this week, against four for Plaid Cymru and one for the Greens. Peter Dunphy, the former Lib Dem treasurer who is a director of Unite to Remain, said Brecon and Radnorshire had been a successful test-case of the approach. \u201cPeople want to back a winner, people want to back a contender,\u201d he said. He conceded that in some cases the remain alliance would be fielding candidates against sitting Labour MPs, but said the group\u2019s main aim was to reduce the number of Brexit-backing MPs in parliament, most of whom were Conservatives. \u201cWhat we have sought to do is focus on the bigger picture,\u201d he said. Other directors of Unite to remain include Jim Knight, a former Labour MP who is now a peer, and Jessica Simor, a prominent remain-supporting QC. Such alliances have proved problematic in the past because of the perceived unwillingness of parties, especially Labour, to give ground. The Greens expressed scepticism about taking part in a similar process again. However, a general election dominated by Brexit has focused minds, with some local arrangements already in place. Tthe Lib Dems in Beaconsfield have already announced they will not stand a candidate against the former Tory MP Dominic Grieve, who is standing as an independent.",

      "bodyText": "Alone on a remote mountain road after witnessing the slaughter of nine close relatives, the wounded children who had survived a cartel ambush in northern Mexico then endured 10 hours hiding in the barren landscape as they waited for help. One of the survivors, 13-year-old Devin Langford, hid his six surviving siblings in bushes near the road, and set out walking to raise the alarm. But when he failed to return \u2013 and with night drawing over the mountainside \u2013 his nine-year-old sister McKenzie, headed into the wilds in search of him \u2013 even though she had been shot in the wrist. Shocking new details of the attack in which three women and six children were killed emerged on Wednesday, making plain the horror unleashed on the Mexican-American Mormon family \u2013 and piling fresh pressure on Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, to confront organized crime. \u201cOur cry for help is being listened to now,\u201d Adri\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n, father of Rhonita LeBar\u00f3n and grandfather of four of the children killed, told the Televisa network on Wednesday. \u201cMy feeling, though, is that if we hadn\u2019t gone to the place it happened \u2013 if we hadn\u2019t shouted and talked \u2013 then the bodies would still be there.\u201d LeBar\u00f3n was speaking from the community of La Mora near the border between the states of Sonora and Chihuahua where he was preparing funeral services for the murdered members of the family who mostly belong to a breakaway branch of the Mormon religion. The three women and their 14 children from the Langford, Miller and Johnson families were traveling in three SUVs from a small village in Sonora to meet relatives in neighboring Chihuahua state. LeBar\u00f3n\u2019s daughter and her four children were all in a Chevrolet Tahoe which was attacked at 9.40am on Monday, the Mexican army\u2019s chief of staff said on Wednesday. Gen H\u00e9ctor Mendoza said all five were killed immediately and the vehicle burst into flames. The two other vehicles were attacked 18 kilometers up the unpaved road at around 11am. Lafe Langford \u2013 a relative of the victims \u2013 told CNN that the occupants of the second car saw that the lead vehicle had been attacked and knew they were in danger. \u201cThey started grabbing the babies and trying to hide them \u2013 and all of a sudden bullets just rained down from above,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the firing stopped, these men came down off the mountain and pulled all the kids out of the vehicle and basically told them to get out of there.\u201d The children managed to walk about 300 meters, taking turns to carry their eight-year old brother Cody, who had been shot in the jaw and the leg, before they decided to take cover, he said. After hiding the younger children, Devin, who was unharmed, then walked 23 kilometers back to his village to get help. At first the search parties were driven back by further gunfire. By the time they reached the site with an army escort, it was well after dark and the terrified and wounded children still there had been left alone for 10 hours. The rescuers also found an unharmed seven-month-old baby still in her carseat. McKenzie, who had set out to find Devin and walked 10 miles before getting lost in the dark, was not found until several hours later. At Wednesday\u2019s press conference Gen Mendoza said the initial investigation suggested that the family had been unwittingly caught in a turf battle between the La L\u00ednea cartel, based in Chihuahua, and a branch of the Sinaloa cartel, known as the Salazar, based in Sonora. Relatives, however, point out that their vehicles were well known in the area, and that one of the mothers was killed after she got out of the car with her hands above her head. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that can be confusion,\u201d Adri\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n said in Wednesday\u2019s interview. The attack was the latest of a string of mass killings which have tested President L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs not bullets\u201d strategy of tackling the social roots of crime instead of confronting the cartels head-on. After the murder of US citizens, Donald Trump called on L\u00f3pez Obrador to launch a \u201cwar\u201d against the cartels, but the massacre also prompted criticism from the Mexican left. Film star Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, who endorsed L\u00f3pez Obrador in the run-up to his landslide election victory last year, tweeted on Tuesday that the president \u201cmust change the narrative\u201d or \u201cWhy the hell did we vote for you?\u201d The president, widely known as Amlo, argues that the clumsy militarized strategy attempted by his predecessors underpins the violence lacerating Mexico today, but he is also extremely keen to keep his relationship with Trump on good terms. On Wednesday, he tried to reconcile those two urges, saying that those calling for a tougher line against the cartels were indulging in \u201cfascist thinking\u201d \u2013 but going out of his way to not only thank Trump for his offers of help, but to also thank him for not trying to impose them. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say \u2018we are thinking of sending a team to Mexico\u2019 but \u2018We are here to help if you want us to,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cThat is something we are very grateful for.\u201d However, he stopping short of endorsing Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, sad, because children died.

But with that comes criticism, so we just need to take it with a pinch of salt and not get too involved and not get too bogged down in it.\u201d Watching the team struggle from the sofa has been tough. \u201cSitting at home watching the games has been quite frustrating but I\u2019m really pleased to be back in the fold.\u201d Now, having returned for Manchester City, White has been switched from a non-playing squad member to being in Neville\u2019s plans, and a Wembley appearance would be emotional. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible thing to know we\u2019re playing at Wembley and to make it even more special we\u2019re playing against Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m super patriotic in terms of being very English and the rivalry between England and Germany is massive and those games are so exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration at the same time, to thank the fans for supporting us at the World Cup, and hopefully the progression of women\u2019s football to grow and to get bigger and bigger. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be crying if I\u2019m walking out, to be honest, because it\u2019s such an amazing occasion. You can\u2019t help but be swept up in that emotion. Even at the World Cup it was emotional before walking out for games. It\u2019s an amazing achievement to be part of a World Cup, to be walking out with people supporting you, and it\u2019s going to be an amazing occasion with lots of family and friends there as well. If you\u2019re not nervous I don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d",

Millett said the coordinates of the detention centre had been given to Haftar\u2019s forces so the strike against the detention centre was either the product of a dreadful accident or a terrible crime.

At the UN security council session, the international criminal court (ICC) prosecutor Fatou Bensouda pointed out that one of Haftar\u2019s supporters wanted by the ICC over alleged war crimes had been promoted from major to lieutenant general in July. \u201cTwo arrest warrants against Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli remain unexecuted more than two years since the first warrant was issued,\u201d she said.",

This is unlikely to make it into the party\u2019s manifesto.</p> \n<p>Johnson did not attack Farage, who is popular with many Brexiters, by name but said those who \u201ccast aspersions\u201d on the deal with the EU have a vested interest in Brexit not happening.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are like candle-makers at the dawn of the electric lightbulb,\u201d he said, adding that there was a \u201cterrible sense they are about to lose their market\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson moved to criticise Farage after the Brexit party leader refused to stand down candidates \u2013 despite pleas from pro-leave Tories that by doing so he could prevent a split in the Brexit vote. Farage\u2019s party is still taking a substantial chunk of leave support, which Johnson would need to eat into if he has a chance of winning a majority.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives remain ahead in the polls but it is not clear yet if events of the last few days will have affected their chances.</p> \n<p>The party\u2019s troubles with the Welsh Conservatives are particularly serious for Johnson as the Tories would need to make inroads in leave-voting areas of the country to win the election outright.</p> \n<p>Cairns sent a letter to Johnson on Wednesday saying he was confident he would be cleared by any investigation into his behaviour, but he was stepping down because it was such a \u201csensitive matter\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson thanked Cairns for his role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/toll-severn-bridges-scrapped-17-december\">abolishing toll charges</a> on the Severn Bridge and his \u201cunstinting record of service for the party in Wales\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, Corbyn said the prime minister should prevent Cairns from standing again to be an MP. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s a victim here,\u201d he told broadcasters after a speech in Telford. \u201cThat victim needs to be apologised to and needs to be supported.</p> \n<p>\u201cSecondly, if he\u2019s resigning because of his behaviour and involvement in this as the secretary of state, then shouldn\u2019t he also be resigning as a Conservative party candidate in the election? That\u2019s my question.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously, legally he can stand as a candidate, but does he have a moral right to stand as a candidate? If he\u2019s stepping down as a minister because of his involvement then I would have thought the very least the Conservative party can do is not put him up as a candidate in the next election.\u201d</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and a former director of public prosecutions, said: \u201cHe is right to resign but he has got to face an investigation. This is a very, very serious issue. It goes well beyond a ministerial investigation. Resigning was right to do, but it is not enough on its own.\u201d</p>",

He attempted to reposition himself as leader of a \u201cmoderate, one nation Conservative\u201d government. However, his campaign has already been overshadowed by a series of damaging blunders in recent days. His ally, Jacob Rees-Mogg, suggested that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense; and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, resigned over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson is now facing calls to remove Cairns as a Conservative candidate, with the furore threatening to derail the Tory campaign in Wales. The cabinet crisis erupted just as Johnson went to Buckingham Palace to discuss the dissolution of parliament with the Queen. He later gave a speech on the steps of Downing Street insisting he had not wanted an election \u2013 and claiming he was \u201cchewing my own tie\u201d with frustration that Brexit had not yet happened. Later, in Birmingham, Johnson was flanked by his remaining cabinet and arrived to chants of \u201cBoris, Boris\u201d, shortly after a group of anti-racism campaigners were manhandled away from the venue by security. He focused his speech on his intention to pass his \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal through parliament quickly if he gets a majority and promised a year of \u201cgrowth and prosperity\u201d. But Johnson also launched a personal attack on Corbyn, claiming he was a proponent of \u201cBolivarian socialism\u201d who would pursue a \u201cderanged\u201d programme of nationalisation and bring in higher taxes on \u201cpensions, corporations, inheritance, homes, gardens\u201d. The Labour manifesto has not yet been published and the party has said tax rises would focus on the very wealthy and companies. He also said Corbyn wanted to have totally unlimited immigration, even though the party has not unveiled its policy in this area yet, and wanted to \u201cexpropriate\u201d the assets of schools \u2013 referring to a motion at party conference that called for the assets of private schools to be redistributed. This is unlikely to make it into the party\u2019s manifesto. Johnson did not attack Farage, who is popular with many Brexiters, by name but said those who \u201ccast aspersions\u201d on the deal with the EU have a vested interest in Brexit not happening. \u201cThey are like candle-makers at the dawn of the electric lightbulb,\u201d he said, adding that there was a \u201cterrible sense they are about to lose their market\u201d. Johnson moved to criticise Farage after the Brexit party leader refused to stand down candidates \u2013 despite pleas from pro-leave Tories that by doing so he could prevent a split in the Brexit vote. Farage\u2019s party is still taking a substantial chunk of leave support, which Johnson would need to eat into if he has a chance of winning a majority. The Conservatives remain ahead in the polls but it is not clear yet if events of the last few days will have affected their chances. The party\u2019s troubles with the Welsh Conservatives are particularly serious for Johnson as the Tories would need to make inroads in leave-voting areas of the country to win the election outright. Cairns sent a letter to Johnson on Wednesday saying he was confident he would be cleared by any investigation into his behaviour, but he was stepping down because it was such a \u201csensitive matter\u201d. Johnson thanked Cairns for his role in abolishing toll charges on the Severn Bridge and his \u201cunstinting record of service for the party in Wales\u201d. However, Corbyn said the prime minister should prevent Cairns from standing again to be an MP. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s a victim here,\u201d he told broadcasters after a speech in Telford. \u201cThat victim needs to be apologised to and needs to be supported. \u201cSecondly, if he\u2019s resigning because of his behaviour and involvement in this as the secretary of state, then shouldn\u2019t he also be resigning as a Conservative party candidate in the election? That\u2019s my question. \u201cObviously, legally he can stand as a candidate, but does he have a moral right to stand as a candidate? If he\u2019s stepping down as a minister because of his involvement then I would have thought the very least the Conservative party can do is not put him up as a candidate in the next election.\u201d Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and a former director of public prosecutions, said: \u201cHe is right to resign but he has got to face an investigation. This is a very, very serious issue. It goes well beyond a ministerial investigation. Resigning was right to do, but it is not enough on its own.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Even Dominic Cummings had to admit that the Tory election campaign hadn\u2019t got off to the best of starts. The Art of War was all very well, but you could take \u201cdoing what your opponents least expect\u201d too far. Jacob Rees-Mogg saying the Grenfell residents lacked the common sense to save their own lives had been a masterstroke. As had Sajid Javid being prevented from publishing costings of Labour promises on the grounds the Tories hadn\u2019t a clue how to cost their own. Classic Dom could also just about live with James \u201cAmateur Hour\u201d Cleverly failing the nominative determinism test by crashing and burning during a series of media interviews about the misleadingly edited Keir Starmer video. But even he had had to concede that Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, who had been lined up as point man for the Tory campaign in Wales, having to resign over allegations that he had known a former aide had deliberately sabotaged a rape trial, was not a great look. At the current rate of ministerial attrition, the Conservatives would have to wheel out Chris Grayling by the end of the week. Or possibly even Priti Patel. \u201cWe need to get back on the front foot,\u201d Dom Tzu barked, angrily drumming his fingers on the prime minister\u2019s desk. \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d asked Boris Johnson, looking on helplessly. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing for it. I know we\u2019ve been trying to keep you under wraps because no one much likes you, but it\u2019s now shit or bust. We\u2019re going to have to wheel you out and try and play to your strengths. What\u2019s the one thing everyone can rely on you to be?\u201d \u201cCompletely untrustworthy?\u201d Boris offered tentatively. \u201cPrecisely!\u201d Dom snapped. \u201cSo after a quick warm-up lying to the Queen again at Buckingham Palace \u2013 just do your prorogation shtick again \u2013 you\u2019re going to give a five-minute TV clip in which your one goal is to tell as many lies as possible. The punters will go mad for it. There\u2019s nothing they like more than being taken for fools.\u201d Shortly before 1pm, Johnson stepped out into Downing Street. He looked pastier than usual, having been kept hidden indoors for so long, and gripped the podium to dissipate the tension. This was his big moment and he was determined not to screw up. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle chewing my tie,\u201d he began. \u201cNo, no, no, you moron,\u201d yelled Dom Tzu, kicking the wall in frustration. This wasn\u2019t the time for Boris to do his Archie Rice tribute act. He just wanted lies. The more the better. Give me lies, give me lies, give me sweet little lies. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this election,\u201d Johnson said. That was more like it. Of course he wanted an election. He\u2019d tried to call one three times under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and failed. \u201cParliament had blocked my Brexit deal.\u201d YES! Of course it hadn\u2019t. The Commons had actually passed it by 30 votes at second reading. For the first time in weeks, Dom Tzu could feel himself begin to relax. Everything was going to be OK after all. Now that the first two lies were out the way, Boris was totally in the lying zone. Forty new hospitals, when six would be lucky to get a minor refurb. More money for all schools. Apart from the schools that would be getting nothing. Jeremy Corbyn was going to murder millions of kulaks and encourage bullying in schools. The Tories were pro business. Fuck business. Labour were going to have two referendums in a year. Dom Tzu had to smile. Surely no one would believe that? On it went. Boris was the man to save the Union. As long as no one mentioned Northern Ireland. The Conservatives were a moderate, one nation party. Which is why all the moderates were standing down and only the outright lunatics were left. \u201cRespect,\u201d said Dom Tzu, high-fiving Boris as he returned indoors. \u201cYou excelled yourself. I made it at least 10 barefaced lies in under five minutes, Though it\u2019s possible a couple even slipped beneath my radar. That\u2019s a record even for you. Now, all you have to do is go out there and do the same thing again at the campaign rally in Birmingham.\u201d Later that evening, 400 Tory activists were kitted out with \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019 T-shirts and placards and shunted into one corner of a large hall of the National Exhibition Centre along with the cabinet and treated to a warm up act of a smirking Patel and a startled Cleverly. The lack of talent on display was terrifying. The 30-second campaign video that preceded Johnson\u2019s arrival was by far the most professional thing on show all night. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle anaconda tapir bendy bus,\u201d he began nervously. The Great Pretender was back, trying to charm his audience with a few gags that even Benny Hill would have rejected. The audience tried to appear charmed but looked mostly nervous or bored, until a few minders prodded them into waving their placards for the TV cameras. Then he relaxed into his lying and Dom Tzu breathed a little easier. Get Brexit Done. No chance of that. The withdrawal agreement was barely the start. He still didn\u2019t want an election. Parliament was still blocking him. He had a deal that he had campaigned for. Even though he had told the DUP it was a deal the UK could never accept less than a year earlier. The lying then became so out of control, that the lies started backing up on each other so that he couldn\u2019t even connect them into meaningful sentences. He accused Corbyn of dithering when he could barely hang on to a single thought. Unable even to realise just how badly he comes across. Johnson fails both as a serious politician and as a comedy performer. At a newcomers\u2019 open-mic night he would have been booed off in under 30 seconds. Still, he had got all his lies in and that\u2019s what really counted. And with any luck, some of them might have been believed.

The party\u2019s conference in Brighton in September was overshadowed by a botched bid to abolish his post. The Labour leader called off the attempt to clip Watson\u2019s wings at the last minute \u2013 but it prompted soul-searching among some centrist Labour MPs about whether they could continue in the party. Watson was a hate figure for some on the left of his party because of the challenge he presented to Corbyn, and activists had been planning to boycott his speech to Labour conference before it was called off as MPs dashed back to a reopened parliament after the supreme court judgment. In his letter to Watson, the Labour leader said: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have and I know that many thousands of members and trade unionists that you have inspired and worked with over the years will be very sorry to see you go.\u201d He said he had enjoyed \u201cconvivial\u201d chats with Watson, including about their shared love of gardening. \u201cI hope the horseradish plants I gave you thrive,\u201d he said. Watson is the most prominent of a string of centrist MPs to leave Labour \u2013 or quit parliament altogether \u2013 since Corbyn took over his party in 2015. Others have included Tristram Hunt and Andy Burnham, now metropolitan mayor of Manchester. Owen Smith, who challenged Corbyn for his party\u2019s leadership in 2016, has also said he will not stand again. Part of Corbyn\u2019s political project has always been to reshape the Labour party, and Watson\u2019s departure is likely to cement the sense among some Labour MPs that that process is complete. The announcement of Watson\u2019s departure was carefully choreographed with Corbyn\u2019s office, and there was speculation at Westminster that he could be granted a peerage by the Labour leader after the general election. After the news was announced, one senior party figure spoke of \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d. Watson\u2019s job of deputy leader is directly elected by Labour members, giving him an independent power base \u2013 which he has used to speak out on a series of issues, most recently Brexit. Corbyn has determinedly resisted efforts by grassroots members and his shadow cabinet to persuade him to commit to backing remain at a future Brexit referendum. He has sought to exert discipline over his front bench in recent days, telling the Guardian on Sunday, \u201cthe debate is over\u201d on Brexit. Watson has repeatedly intervened in the Brexit debate publicly, insisting in one recent speech that \u201cour hearts are remain, our values are remain\u201d. Watson was one of the most prominent champions of the battle against phone hacking by News International when he was a backbencher serving on the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. He was a junior defence minister in Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2006, when he was closely involved in a bid to persuade the then prime minister to resign. More recently, he has become an enthusiastic advocate for healthy eating and exercise, after drastically losing weight following a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Watson is a friend of Luciana Berger, who left Labour to found the breakaway Change UK party, and has since defected to the Liberal Democrats. After she and other Labour MPs including Chuka Umunna left, Watson formed a caucus he called the \u201cfuture Britain\u201d group, saying he felt the voice of social democrats was not being heard in the party\u2019s decision-making. At the time, he warned of a \u201ccrisis for the soul of the Labour party,\u201d and called on Corbyn to \u201cdo more to unite the party and reshuffle the shadow cabinet to give greater weight to MPs with social democratic rather than socialist views\u201d. He has also clashed with Momentum chair Jon Lansman over the process of trigger ballots for Labour MPs, which Watson claimed were the result of a \u201chard left faction\u201d who were jeopardising Labour\u2019s election chances. Despite his vocal disquiet, Watson continued to serve as Corbyn\u2019s shadow culture secretary, and only this week made a pre-election announcement that the party would restore free TV licences to the over-75s. His West Midlands constituency is among those being targeted by the Conservatives, though he had a majority of more than 7,000 and had been confident of holding it. Watson is likely to be replaced as deputy leader by a significantly more leftwing figure. Potential candidates include Rebecca Long-Bailey, Laura Pidcock and Angela Rayner. Watson has appeared increasingly divorced from Labour\u2019s direction in recent months, and some friends had even begun to speculate that he could be considering joining the Lib Dems. But in his resignation letter, he insisted he would continue to fight for Labour, and would back Labour candidates in the general election campaign. Colleagues paid tribute to Watson, with Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, saying his \u201cpassion for politics and commitment to campaigning \u2013 whether fighting against Tory austerity or for better regulation of the gambling industry \u2013 will be much missed\u201d. Watson also faced controversy over his role in raising the profile of the accusations of Carl Beech about a VIP abuse ring in Westminster, which turned out to be false. Harvey Proctor, a former Tory MP who was one of those falsely accused, said Watson had \u201cdone his constituents a great favour\u201d by stepping down. Proctor has now abandoned his plans to run against him in the election. Both major parties will be significantly reshaped whatever the result of the general election, with many moderate Conservatives, including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, leaving the House of Commons for good. Corbyn had made efforts to build bridges with his deputy in recent weeks, but shadow cabinet colleagues said Watson appeared detached and had not attended a number of recent meetings.",

The shocking figures come as the state\u2019s police watchdog investigates the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018 and have led to calls from the Redfern Legal Centre \u2013 which first obtained the data \u2013 for a ban on strip-searching minors unless a court order is obtained. Scientists have detailed serious deficiencies by Australia\u2019s chemical regulator that failed to prevent pollution of the Great Barrier Reef catchment, where they found excessive levels of several pesticides banned by other countries. A new paper, co-authored by reef water quality expert Jon Brodie and fisheries veterinarian Matt Landos, found that pesticide regulation and management in the reef catchment areas of Queensland had failed to prevent the exposure of ecosystems to the significant risk of agricultural chemicals. Australia Labor needs to fire up on behalf of working people to punch through the \u201cpandemic of populism\u201d locking progressive parties out of government, and it needs to pitch an \u201cAustralian new deal\u201d grounded in the Hawke/Keating principles of economic reform with a social dividend, according to Chris Bowen. The price of lamb has soared by 200% since the 90s \u2013 now the drought is sending it even higher. Looking at the production of lamb is a very good indicator for monitoring the severity of a drought, writes Greg Jericho. Communications minister Paul Fletcher has suggested the Morrison government will extend and restructure taxpayer assistance for regional newspapers, but rebuffed a push to water down media ownership rules or cut licence fees for regional TV. The world Public impeachment hearings will begin next week, it has been announced in Congress, marking a new phase in the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s effort to compel Ukraine to investigate his political opponents. A woman married to the slain Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been captured and is in Turkish custody, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said. Eight people including four foreign tourists were stabbed on Wednesday in Jordan, at the ancient Roman city of Jerash, one of Jordan\u2019s most popular sites for visitors. The world will be dealing with ever-rising sea levels into the 2300s, regardless of prompt action to address the climate crisis, according to the new study. The distinctive human habit of walking upright may have evolved millions of years earlier than thought, according to researchers who uncovered the remains of an ancient ape in southern Germany. Recommended reads Martin Scorsese\u2019s the Irishman won\u2019t be coming to a cinema near you, writes Stephanie Convery. \u201cIf there was ever a sign that cinema-going was becoming a niche experience, it must be that a major feature directed by one of the godfathers of modern film will grace only a handful of big screens around the world. Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, a crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, is not the first likely blockbuster to bypass wide theatrical release before heading to the binge-box of home entertainment, but it is perhaps the most notable.\u201d Would you let an AI rephrase the tone of your emails? asks Aleksandra Bliszczyk. \u201cYou install the artificial intelligence-powered plugin on to your web browser, where it scans your emails and grades them as \u2018confident\u2019, \u2018optimistic\u2019, \u2018worried\u2019 or \u2018sceptical\u2019 \u2013 it claims to identify 40 tones. Much like a spellchecker, it will read through your text and then make suggestions at the bottom of your screen, or when you hover your mouse over a grumpy red underline. It feels neat and familiar, but the software raises a broader question than the one it asked its users: to what standard are our interactions being steered?\u201d Listen On Today in Focus, Tom Phillips joins the search for some of the thousands of people who have gone missing or been murdered in Mexico\u2019s bloody drug wars. Plus Luke Harding on the government\u2019s delay in releasing a report on Russian meddling in UK politics. Sport The history of Indigenous women in football is often overlooked, but there is much to be gained by listening to the stories of the current crop of Aboriginal players in the W-League, especially during Indigenous Football Week. Women\u2019s cricket in Australia has burgeoned in the past five years, since the WBBL provided a forum for players and the pay deal of 2017 provided professional contracts. And with the emergence of players such as 16-year-old Phoebe Litchfield this season, the growth and development of the game is showing no signs of slowing down. Media roundup The Australian reports that Karl Stefanovic will return to the Today show next year, \u201cif he is willing to take a major pay cut\u201d. NSW treasurer Dominic Perrottet has told the Sydney Morning Herald that \u201cstate and federal governments must \u201cbreak the emergency glass\u201d and pursue major structural reforms in a bid to revive economic growth.

      "body": "<p>With a year until the next election, Jacinda Ardern may be extraordinarily personally popular, and Labour polling well, but neither fact will determine her fate.</p> <p>In the end, all eyes will be on a handful of low-polling minor parties that could wield influence well beyond their size and ultimately determine the outcome.</p> <p>Ardern\u2019s Labour and the centre-right opposition National party are both currently polling around 40-45%. If we in New Zealand had a first-past-the-post election system, the largest party would be likely to win a majority of seats, delivering a single-party government (even without necessarily winning more than 50% of the vote).But under proportional representation, it\u2019s not enough for either party to form a government. Both will need friends in parliament.</p> <p>Currently, the minor parties have very low levels of support and may not survive beyond the next election. In recent times, New Zealanders have shied away from supporting these minnows.

      "bodyText": "With a year until the next election, Jacinda Ardern may be extraordinarily personally popular, and Labour polling well, but neither fact will determine her fate. In the end, all eyes will be on a handful of low-polling minor parties that could wield influence well beyond their size and ultimately determine the outcome. Ardern\u2019s Labour and the centre-right opposition National party are both currently polling around 40-45%. If we in New Zealand had a first-past-the-post election system, the largest party would be likely to win a majority of seats, delivering a single-party government (even without necessarily winning more than 50% of the vote).But under proportional representation, it\u2019s not enough for either party to form a government. Both will need friends in parliament. Currently, the minor parties have very low levels of support and may not survive beyond the next election. In recent times, New Zealanders have shied away from supporting these minnows. In fact, since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1996, every single minor party that has been in government has subsequently been punished with a worse election result. Survival is complicated by a threshold in the MMP system. To get into parliament, parties need to either reach 5% of the national vote or win an electorate seat. For example, if a party wins 10% of the national vote, it would win about 10% of the seats. A party is exempt from needing to reach the 5% national threshold it wins an electorate seat outright.

But there are no guarantees the Greens will make it over 5%. At times during the past two years they have dropped below that in opinion polls. And at the last election, a scandal involving one of its co-leaders admitting to benefit fraud saw its support levels plummet overnight. On current polling, Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First would be out of parliament. Although many expect their support will pick up in election year, it\u2019s far from certain, and they have dropped below 5% in two elections before, both times after periods in government. NZ First might have a chance of winning the seat of Northland. There is speculation the party\u2019s outspoken MP and cabinet minister Shane Jones \u2013 a likely replacement for Peters when he eventually leaves politics \u2013 could take the seat off the main opposition National party, especially if Labour agrees to only run a soft campaign against him.

He\u2019s had brilliant successes, such as Alibaba, the huge Chinese internet retailer, but WeWork will be hard to live down. It was a boring property business \u2013 there was nothing visionary about it.",

First to testify will be the seasoned ambassador who thought what he was seeing was \u201ccrazy\u201d. Then the Ukraine specialist who warned about a US policy gone \u201cwrong\u201d. Then a career ambassador who was \u201cshocked\u201d to discover a plot to undermine her in Ukraine \u2013 carried out by an agent of her own government. Their biographies seemed designed to tacitly rebut the wild attacks that seem sure to rain down from Trump\u2019s Twitter account as soon as they are introduced to the public. The trio \u2013 ambassador Bill Taylor, state department official George P Kent and former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 are also positioned to tell complementary parts of the story of Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, and its disastrous effects on US national security interests. In previous testimony behind closed doors, the three have described how they were flabbergasted at the direction US policy took on Ukraine as Trump ramped up his re-election campaign. Together, they described a plot to coerce Ukraine into announcing investigations tied to Trump\u2019s rival former vice-president Joe Biden. And they have described the official channel of US policy in the region being circumvented, and subverted, by an informal policy channel led by the unofficial Trump emissary Rudy Giuliani. Taylor may describe the moment he realized the suspension of almost $400m in military aid for Ukraine was tied to Trump\u2019s desire for Ukraine to manufacture bad news about Biden. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted a colleague. Kent, whose portfolio included Ukraine, may describe how Trump\u2019s shadow agenda in Ukraine shook the state department, especially when it came to the attacks on Yovanovitch, whom Kent has said fell victim to a \u201cfake news smear\u201d full of \u201ccomplete poppycock\u201d. For her part, Yovanovitch might testify to the creeping realization that she had a target on her back. She first heard about the campaign against her from Ukrainian officials, she testified.

Yovanovitch could also speak to being attacked directly by Trump, who told the Ukrainian president in a July phone call that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it meant,\u201d Yovanovitch testified last month. \u201cI was very concerned. I still am.\u201d \u201cDid you feel threatened?\u201d she was asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied. Like her fellow witnesses, Yovanovitch has a compelling personal story. Born in Canada, she is a 33-year veteran of the foreign service with posts in during six administrations, including under four Republican presidents.

The heavily indebted shopping centre operator said its like-for-like rental income had fallen by about 9% this year and would fall again next year owing to the tough retail climate. Intu blamed the declines in part on the company voluntary arrangements \u2013 an insolvency process used to reduce rent bills and close stores \u2013 used by Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group and Monsoon Shares in Intu fell on Wednesday by 17% to just 33p on the back of the gloomy update. Its chief executive, Matthew Roberts said options on the table also included selling some of the company\u2019s assets in order to reduce its near-\u00a35bn debt pile. Intu had had a difficult four months, with the CVAs \u201cslightly worse than expected\u201d, he said. \u201cOur number one priority is to fix the balance sheet. We have a clear plan to do this \u2026 these options include disposing of assets, where we are in the advanced stages of selling two of our Spanish assets, through to raising equity, which is also likely to form part of the solution.\u201d",

Troup\u2019s intervention on Wednesday came in response to a Guardian report on Tuesday showing thousands of the country\u2019s richest people were exploiting the policy to pay as little as 10% tax on billions of pounds\u2019 worth of capital gains. \u201cThis inequity would be almost entirely eliminated by the abolition of entrepreneurs\u2019 relief,\u201d Troup, who had been a commissioner of HMRC since 2012, tweeted. \u201cIt gives \u00a32bn CGT savings every year to those who have already made their gains and provides no incentive for real entrepreneurship.\u201d Troup later said that entrepreneurs\u2019 relief \u2013 which reduces the tax bill on capital gains from 20% to 10% \u2013 had a \u201cminimal impact on encouraging entrepreneurship in the UK\u201d.

As Maya Angelou put it: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d Here was a confession, an insight into a worldview steeped in a sense of class privilege and social superiority. We don\u2019t need to read between the lines: the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has done it for us. When the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis put it to him that Rees-Mogg was effectively saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice,\u201d Bridgen did not demur, adding \u2013 after a sigh-filled pause \u2013 \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we, Evan? \u2026 That\u2019s a byproduct of what Jacob is, that\u2019s why he is in a position of authority.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thatcher is frequently portrayed as a challenge to the old Tory toffs, but her snobbery was no less great</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Leave aside that the Grenfell disaster itself was an indictment of a rotten social order that values money over people\u2019s lives. Here, in the minds of Rees-Mogg and Bridgen, is a world in which the masses are feeble, ignorant, simple-minded, requiring leadership by their supposed social betters who are, quite literally, born to rule. If Rees-Mogg is indeed \u201cvery clever\u201d, it needs more proof than pretentious smatterings of Latin phrases recalled from Eton, and there it is lacking. Accusations of \u201cclass warfare\u201d have always been a staple Tory attack line, normally when confronted with calls to more equitably tax wealth and income.

      "bodyText": "Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that those who perished in Grenfell Tower lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d was not a gaffe, as one BBC journalist declared. As Maya Angelou put it: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d Here was a confession, an insight into a worldview steeped in a sense of class privilege and social superiority. We don\u2019t need to read between the lines: the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has done it for us. When the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis put it to him that Rees-Mogg was effectively saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice,\u201d Bridgen did not demur, adding \u2013 after a sigh-filled pause \u2013 \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we, Evan? \u2026 That\u2019s a byproduct of what Jacob is, that\u2019s why he is in a position of authority.\u201d Leave aside that the Grenfell disaster itself was an indictment of a rotten social order that values money over people\u2019s lives. Here, in the minds of Rees-Mogg and Bridgen, is a world in which the masses are feeble, ignorant, simple-minded, requiring leadership by their supposed social betters who are, quite literally, born to rule. If Rees-Mogg is indeed \u201cvery clever\u201d, it needs more proof than pretentious smatterings of Latin phrases recalled from Eton, and there it is lacking. Accusations of \u201cclass warfare\u201d have always been a staple Tory attack line, normally when confronted with calls to more equitably tax wealth and income. But to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, one side preaches the class war while the other vigorously fights it. While other Tories may choose their words more carefully, the attitude underpinning Rees-Mogg\u2019s and Bridgen\u2019s words are a feature, not a bug, of their party.

      "bodyText": "There was little sympathy for Alun Cairns on High Street in Cowbridge, a bustling market town in the heart of his Vale of Glamorgan constituency, following his resignation as Welsh secretary. \u201cI probably would have voted for him but I won\u2019t now,\u201d said Steve Roadhouse as he fixed a wheel in the cycle shop. \u201cHe should have had enough intelligence and sensitivity to approach a case that involves rape very differently to this. You have to remember there\u2019s a victim at the centre of this. He really shouldn\u2019t stand again here.\u201d Cairns stepped down after being accused of lying about his knowledge of an allegation that a former adviser had sabotaged a rape trial. He has been MP in south Wales since 2010 but many locals at the Vale of Glamorgan pub doubted he would win this time \u2013 if he chooses to stand in the first place. Ron Davies said Cairns had no option but to resign as Welsh secretary. As a retired police officer, he instinctively distrusts anyone who has derailed a trial as a judge decided Cairns\u2019s ex-aide did. \u201cThe law is the law,\u201d he said. Davies said he used to vote Labour but lost respect for the party over the Iraq war and changed his vote. \u201cBut to be honest, I\u2019ve lost trust in the lot of them,\u201d he added. Roger Price, a retired local government officer, succinctly summed up his feelings about Cairns: \u201cGood riddance. He should stand down \u2013 he has totally lost credibility.\u201d Patrick Sheehan, a painter and decorator, at least had some respect for Cairns\u2019s longevity. The MP served as Welsh secretary under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good going,\u201d he said. Sheehan said he would study the ins and outs of the case before deciding if he would vote for Cairns if he does stand again. Cowbridge is a tightknit little town.

Some executives at the world\u2019s biggest social network appeared to refer to the strategy of promoting a privacy-focused explanation for the change as the \u201cSwitcharoo Plan\u201d, internal emails included in sealed California court filings show. The emergence of nearly 7,000 pages of company emails and executive documents comes as Facebook faces multiple investigations into possible antitrust violations by regulators around the world. The emails could supply valuable evidence to investigators, including a panel of US lawmakers that sought company records in September on Facebook\u2019s decisions to bar apps from its social graph, which maps out relations between users. The documents come from a lawsuit filed in 2015 by Six4Three, the developer of a now-shuttered bikini photo app that lost access to Facebook user data as a result of the changes, which were announced in 2014 and implemented the following year. Six4Three alleges that Facebook\u2019s data policies were anticompetitive and that the company misrepresented those policies both to developers and the public. Facebook has described the case as baseless. A company spokeswoman told Reuters the documents were \u201ctaken out of context by someone with an agenda against Facebook\u201d and made public \u201cwith a total disregard for US law\u201d. Portions of the material have been released over the course of the past year, but provided an incomplete picture of the period between 2012 and 2014 when policy changes were debated within the company. The new documents contain exchanges between executives discussing cutting off access to user data for developers seen as potential competitors at a time when the company said publicly that it provided an open and neutral platform. One executive, writing in 2013, described dividing apps into \u201cthree buckets: existing competitors, possible future competitors, developers that we have alignment with on business models\u201d as part of the project to restrict access to user data, dubbed PS12N. Those in the last category were able to regain access by agreeing to make mobile advertising purchases or provide reciprocal user data to Facebook under \u201cPrivate Extended API Agreements\u201d, according to the emails. As thousands of developers lost access to user data, the executives decided to announce the changes publicly. They elected to link what they referred to as the \u201cbad stuff of PS12N\u201d to an unrelated update of the Facebook login system which gave people greater control over their privacy. The \u201cnarrative\u201d for the announcement \u201cwill focus on quality and the user experience which will potentially provide a good umbrella to fold in some of the API deprecations\u201d, one executive wrote in an email. Another invited colleagues in a February 2014 email to review the \u201cSwitcharoo Plan\u201d, calling it \u201ca good compromise\u201d that will enable them \u201cto tell a story that makes sense\u201d. The month prior, the same executive wrote: \u201cMy concern is around the perception that we can\u2019t hold our story together.\u201d When Facebook enacted the changes in 2015, executives told journalists the company had conducted research on user sentiment about Facebook apps and decided on policies that would help build confidence in data privacy, according to a report by the tech publication TechCrunch. The documents were initially produced by Facebook during the discovery process of Six4Three\u2019s 2015 lawsuit and were sealed by by the California state judge overseeing the case. They were obtained by the UK parliament under extraordinary circumstances in November 2018. When Six4Three founder Ted Kramer was in London that year he provided them to Damian Collins, the chair of the parliamentary committee that was investigating Facebook, after Collins told Kramer that failure to do so put him in \u201ccontempt of parliament\u201d. Kramer\u2019s access to the documents and whether he should have provided them to Collins while in the UK despite the court order, were the subject of considerable criticism by the California court \u2013 and by Facebook.",

      "body": "<p>The distinctive human habit of walking upright may have evolved millions of years earlier than thought, according to researchers who uncovered the remains of an ancient ape in southern Germany.</p> <p>Excavations from the Hammerschmiede clay pit in Bavaria turned up fossilised bones belonging to a previously unknown baboon-sized ape that lived nearly 12m years ago, long before humans split from their modern-day cousins, the chimpanzees and bonobos.</p> <p>Analysis of the bones shows that the animal, named <em>Danuvius guggenmosi</em>, had an unusual mix of anatomical features. While its long forearms, curved fingers and powerful, grasping thumbs were hallmarks of life spent dangling from branches, the hips, knees and feet were more human-like and better suited to walking upright, the scientists said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b01c4bf577b37504fcabe3d6bd3227c14446354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b01c4bf577b37504fcabe3d6bd3227c14446354/23_55_2777_4075/681.jpg\" alt=\"Impression of Danuvius guggenmosi.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impression of <em>Danuvius guggenmosi.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Velizar Simeonovski/Nature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was astonishing for us to realise during the process of research how similar certain bones were to humans, as opposed to great apes,\u201d said Madelaine B\u00f6hme, who led the study at the University of T\u00fcbingen. The fossils, which include remains from two females, a male and a juvenile, were excavated between 2015 and 2018.</p> <p>According to B\u00f6hme, the findings suggest that our upright posture can be traced to a common ancestor of humans and great apes that lived in Europe rather than Africa. When <em>D</em> <em>guggenmosi</em> was alive, Bavaria was far hotter than it is today, and streams bordered by gallery forests meandered through the region.</p> <p>The clay pit haul of fossils included teeth, pieces of jaw and spine, and a big toe that would have been handy for grasping tree branches. Arguably the most important fossils were a forearm and shin bone, which informed the scientists\u2019 speculation about how the ape moved around.</p> <p>The most complete skeleton, with 21 bones, was thought to belong to a male that stood a metre high and weighed about 30kg. He had a broad chest and the curved, S-shaped spine seen in humans.</p> <p>Measurements of the teeth placed the ape in an extinct group called the dryopithecins, which lived in Europe in the middle to late Miocene, an epoch that lasted from about 23m years ago to five million years ago.

      "bodyText": "The distinctive human habit of walking upright may have evolved millions of years earlier than thought, according to researchers who uncovered the remains of an ancient ape in southern Germany. Excavations from the Hammerschmiede clay pit in Bavaria turned up fossilised bones belonging to a previously unknown baboon-sized ape that lived nearly 12m years ago, long before humans split from their modern-day cousins, the chimpanzees and bonobos. Analysis of the bones shows that the animal, named Danuvius guggenmosi, had an unusual mix of anatomical features. While its long forearms, curved fingers and powerful, grasping thumbs were hallmarks of life spent dangling from branches, the hips, knees and feet were more human-like and better suited to walking upright, the scientists said. \u201cIt was astonishing for us to realise during the process of research how similar certain bones were to humans, as opposed to great apes,\u201d said Madelaine B\u00f6hme, who led the study at the University of T\u00fcbingen. The fossils, which include remains from two females, a male and a juvenile, were excavated between 2015 and 2018. According to B\u00f6hme, the findings suggest that our upright posture can be traced to a common ancestor of humans and great apes that lived in Europe rather than Africa. When D guggenmosi was alive, Bavaria was far hotter than it is today, and streams bordered by gallery forests meandered through the region. The clay pit haul of fossils included teeth, pieces of jaw and spine, and a big toe that would have been handy for grasping tree branches. Arguably the most important fossils were a forearm and shin bone, which informed the scientists\u2019 speculation about how the ape moved around. The most complete skeleton, with 21 bones, was thought to belong to a male that stood a metre high and weighed about 30kg. He had a broad chest and the curved, S-shaped spine seen in humans. Measurements of the teeth placed the ape in an extinct group called the dryopithecins, which lived in Europe in the middle to late Miocene, an epoch that lasted from about 23m years ago to five million years ago. Some researchers believe dryopithecins were the ancestors of the ancient African apes who ultimately gave rise to great apes more generally, including the gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans. Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists make the case for danuvius employing what they call \u201cextended limb clambering\u201d to get around. Rather than swinging from branches or walking cautiously on branches, extended limb clambering uses both arms and legs equally. \u201cThe emerging picture of its locomotion is different from any known living creature,\u201d said B\u00f6hme.

      "bodyText": "The Green party has set its sights firmly on Bristol West in its drive to push its parliamentary representation up from one MP, but other target seats hang in the balance as activists await the outcome of negotiations with the Liberal Democrats over a pact to avoid splitting the pro-remain vote. At the party\u2019s launch in Bristol on Wednesday, the climate emergency took centre stage and is likely to dominate the party\u2019s manifesto, due out within a few days, with pledges to borrow \u00a3100bn to cut emissions and protect against the impacts of global heating. But Si\u00e2n Berry, the party\u2019s co-leader and London mayoral candidate, made it clear that social justice was also high on the party\u2019s agenda, and the biggest cheer in Bristol came for a promise to build affordable housing. Nationally, the Greens had their best ever year in this year\u2019s local and European elections, rising to 362 local councillors and seven MEPs. But in the 2017 general election, the party\u2019s share of the national vote more than halved to just 1.8%, compared with its record 3.8% in 2015. Carla Denyer, the Green candidate for Bristol West, thinks that fallback was largely because of the impact of the Brexit referendum on the 2017 result, but believes much has changed since then, particularly in voters\u2019 perceptions of the Labour party. She said: \u201cIn the 2017 election a lot of people were Corbyn fans in Bristol but they are going off him. A lot of people believed in 2017 that Labour was a remain party. I think the political atmosphere is much closer now to 2015 than it was in 2017.\u201d Activists believe Labour\u2019s seemingly comfortable majority in Bristol West is less robust than it appears. In 2017, on a 77% turnout in this constituency that voted 79% for remain in the referendum, the Labour incumbent Thangam Debbonaire won a 37,000 majority \u2013 one of the biggest in the country \u2013 on a 30% swing to Labour. The Greens won fewer than 10,000 votes. But in 2015, Labour took the seat on a much smaller margin with 22,900 votes compared with 17,200 for the Greens in second place, with the Lib Dems trailing far behind. Denyer, a mechanical engineer and wind farm designer, told the Guardian voters were also thinking beyond Brexit, saying: \u201cPeople are much more aware of the climate emergency now. Bristol wants to be a green city, and people all over the country recognise that we need a big change to deal with the climate.\u201d Extinction Rebellion is estimated to have about 10,000 supporters in the Bristol area, and there has been strong local support for measures such as the council declaring a climate emergency, and the council\u2019s decision to ban diesel cars from areas of the centre. Many people on the streets of Bristol seem receptive to environmental messages. Rachel Fountain, a local voter, said: \u201cI think this election will be an environment election. Extinction Rebellion are very strong here. But there is also a social housing problem here, that will be an issue.\u201d Nick Swales, a council worker, also cited the climate crisis and the environment as top issues for people in the area, though he predicted that Brexit would dominate the election.

They must also teach freedom of expression, not as an abstract ideal, but as the basis of life within the university \u2013 making it clear that disagreement is fine, but threats of any kind are not. The report also urges the Foreign Office to broaden its focus beyond protecting universities from intellectual property theft and risks arising from joint research projects. That must be done quickly: Brexit will exacerbate the cash-hunger. The government should engage with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US, where there has been much closer attention to the issue. (At least 10 American universities have closed their Confucius Institutes, Beijing-funded language and cultural centres.) Unnecessary hostility to overseas students and partners is a danger of its own; racial profiling must be avoided and international collaboration can bring immense benefits. But it must be on the right terms \u2013 not those dictated in exchange for funding.",

The move emerged on Wednesday after the government angered survivors by including Rydon Construction Ltd (RCL) on a list of 12 companies suitable for carrying out works on public high-rise housing in the south of England. The Cabinet Office said it had no choice but to include Rydon under EU rules and was abiding by UK law, but the bereaved and survivors accused ministers of \u201chiding behind red tape\u201d after Khan\u2019s decision. The Labour mayor signed an order in 2018 asserting it was not in the public interest to allow the company to bid for works until the public inquiry into the disaster \u201chas reported on the extent to which any Rydon group companies or employee contributed to causing or exacerbating the Grenfell Tower fire\u201d. Rydon qualified to be one of 30 companies recommended to build residential-led developments, but Khan quietly suspended it from the list, according to documents seen by the Guardian. City Hall appears to have been willing to take a risk that its decision would be challenged by Rydon, because, in common with central government, it is bound by EU procurement rules. Rydon was the main contractor on the \u00a310m Grenfell refurbishment, which wrapped the tower in combustible cladding. A public inquiry concluded last week that this was the main cause of the spread of the fire. It also found the works were in breach of building regulations.

The cardinal reluctantly agreed, saying: \u201cWe are full of contradictions. Yes, I failed.\u201d</p> <p>The exchanges came at the end of the day when details emerged of a series of emails sent by a woman who had been sexually abused as a teenager by a member of the Servite Order. As a loyal supporter of the church she had not pursued a criminal case or asked for compensation but was seeking a response to her complaints, which had been transferred to the Westminster diocese headed by Nichols.</p> <p>Over several months she emailed the cardinal four times but he declined to respond in person because he did not think it was his role to \u201cadjudicate\u201d on her complaints about his diocese\u2019s safeguarding commission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/28/child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-criticises-lack-of-cooperation-from-vatican\">Child sexual abuse inquiry criticises lack of cooperation from Vatican</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His private secretary told her she should approach another part of the Catholic church. In one email, the woman, who has not been identified, wrote: \u201cI feel incredibly let down and ignored by Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry was shown emails in which the woman was described by officials as \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d. Fr Jeremy Trood, a priest in Westminster, wrote to Peter Houghton, the chair of the diocesan safeguarding commission, saying: \u201cThis woman is deeply manipulative.\u201d</p> <p>In reply, the inquiry was told, Houghton wrote: \u201cAgreed.

      "bodyText": "Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic cleric in England and Wales, has been lambasted at the child sexual abuse inquiry for \u201cshutting out\u201d a complaint from a victim whom one priest privately dismissed as \u201cdeeply manipulative\u201d. The archbishop of Westminster, 73, faced questions at the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) all day on Wednesday as its lead counsel, Brian Altman QC, also criticised him for delaying church reforms and for defending the Vatican\u2019s refusal to cooperate with investigators. While publicly declaring that the church was trying to place sexual abuse victims at the centre of its concerns, Nichols was privately refusing to answer a victim\u2019s emails and \u201cshutting out\u201d her complaints, suggested Altman. The cardinal reluctantly agreed, saying: \u201cWe are full of contradictions. Yes, I failed.\u201d The exchanges came at the end of the day when details emerged of a series of emails sent by a woman who had been sexually abused as a teenager by a member of the Servite Order. As a loyal supporter of the church she had not pursued a criminal case or asked for compensation but was seeking a response to her complaints, which had been transferred to the Westminster diocese headed by Nichols. Over several months she emailed the cardinal four times but he declined to respond in person because he did not think it was his role to \u201cadjudicate\u201d on her complaints about his diocese\u2019s safeguarding commission. His private secretary told her she should approach another part of the Catholic church. In one email, the woman, who has not been identified, wrote: \u201cI feel incredibly let down and ignored by Westminster.\u201d The inquiry was shown emails in which the woman was described by officials as \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d. Fr Jeremy Trood, a priest in Westminster, wrote to Peter Houghton, the chair of the diocesan safeguarding commission, saying: \u201cThis woman is deeply manipulative.\u201d In reply, the inquiry was told, Houghton wrote: \u201cAgreed. We need to keep playing the good practice card if we are to contain this person\u2019s manipulative behaviour.\u201d Asked about those exchanges, Nichols, who has since met the victim, admitted he had not spoken to Houghton about his description of the woman. The cardinal said he was sorry he had not responded to her directly and not handled her complaint differently. Nichols, who is also president of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of England and Wales, agreed with Altman that in terms of introducing a new code of conduct for priests, \u201cthe wheels of change had been turning slowly\u201d and accepted that there was \u201ca crisis [over child abuse] in the Catholic church\u201d. The cardinal conceded: \u201cOver the past 20 years the experience in this country is that we have been struggling to cope with the presence of evil embodied in [the Catholic church\u2019s] own members which has shocked us to the core.\u201d Asked whether he \u201cgot\u201d the issue of child abuse, the cardinal insisted that he understood the traumatic impact of abuse on victims. He said he had met victims of clerical sexual abuse and \u201cwept with them\u201d on several occasions. The Vatican has repeatedly refused to cooperate with official investigations into paedophile priests and has been censured by the inquiry for years of delays in stripping convicted offenders of their clerical status. Asked what he made of the Holy See\u2019s plea of diplomatic immunity in declining to explain the role of the church\u2019s Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), which is supposed to discipline priests who commit offences, Nichols said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand the niceties of international law in these things \u2026 I believe it\u2019s a statement of international law.\u201d The cardinal said the Vatican\u2019s own police service had not been given sufficient credit for its cooperation with British detectives in locating and helping to extradite Fr Laurence Soper, who had fled to Kosovo in 2011 after withdrawing \u00a3182,000 from a Vatican bank account. He was subsequently jailed for 18 years for abusing boys at St Benedict\u2019s school in Ealing, west London. David Enright, a solicitor at the law firm Howe and Co who represents 20 clients at the inquiry, said they had been \u201crebuffed\u201d by the church. Richard Scorer, a solicitor at Slater and Gordon who acts for 27 victims of Catholic church abuse in the inquiry, said: \u201cDespite all the rhetoric, there is no \u2018one church\u2019 approach to safeguarding; improvements have been lamentably slow; treatment of survivors has been consistently poor, including in Cardinal Nichols\u2019s own diocese; and it is clear that culturally and structurally the Catholic church is simply incapable of delivering the changes survivors need.\u201d Keith Porteous Wood, president of the National Secular Society, who has given evidence to the inquiry, said: \u201cThe church cannot be trusted to mark its own homework.

      "bodyText": "Nick Ames was at the Est\u00e1dio D Afonso Henriques for the Guardian and this is how he saw this wet Wednesday afternoon\u2019s action unfold. Shkodron Mustafi speaks: \u201cThey throw everything up front,\u201d he tells BT Sport, having said he wished he\u2019d scored a little later. \u201cIt\u2019s not organised any more and they keep crossing. I think we could have done better but in the end we have to accept it and take the point home with us. I think we could have dealt with it earlier and stopped them making the cross, but we have to accept it and take the point. They are a good side.\u201d Group F standings: Arsenal still have a bit of work to do to guarantee their passage through to the knockout stages, but even they seem unlikely to mess it up with two games to spare. Vitoria\u2019s interest in this competition will not extend to the new year, but they will be annoyed not to have taken all three points from this game, given the many chances they created. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over in Portugal, where Arsenal have surrendered another lead. They dominated possession throughout and created very little but went ahead through Shkodron Mustafi. A late rally by Vitoria in the knockings was enough to earn them a draw, but not the win they needed to keep any hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages alive. 90+3 min: Back to the equaliser. Edwards got the better of Holding down the right flank and crossed to the far post. The ball was headed downwards and Duarte demonstrated perfect technique to get airborne and with an acrobatic swivel his hips fire home with his left peg. 90+2 min: Crikey! Shkodran Mustafi goes perilously close to scoring an own goal after unwittingly deflecting a flick into the penalty area narrowly wide of his own goal after good work down the left from Edwards. Arsenal manage to defend the corner. The home side equalise and it\u2019s no more than they deserve. An acrobatic finish from Duarte, whose left-footed volley leaves them in with a squeak of snatching the win with four minutes of added time to go. 90 min: Bonatini blazes over the bar to ruin Vitoria\u2019s best move of the night. They carved Arsenal open, with Duarte and Rochinha combining to tee up the substitute with a glorious opportunity to equalise from close range. 89 min: Matteo Guendouzi is felled in midfield and wins a free-kick as the clock ticks down. 86 min: Marcus Edwards has an attempted through ball into the Arsenal penalty area blocked by Holding. Assuming they fail to win, Vitoria will feel they left this one behind them tonight - they\u2019ve had plenty of chances, but were unable to convert any of them into goals. Arsenal, by contrast, have scored with their only effort on target and look like labouring their way to victory. 84 min: Rob Holding puts the ball behind for a corner after intercepting a Rafa Soares cross. The ensuing set=piece is cleared comfortably. 82 min: Arsenal score with their first effort on target, meaning Vitoria goalkeeper Douglas still hasn\u2019t made a save. The Portuguese side make their final substitution, with Leo Bonatini, on loan from Wolves, replacing Lucas Evangelista. They must win tonight, to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages. I suspect the opportunity has passed them by. Pepe curls the ball towards the far post, where Mustafi rises highest and sends a fine downward header back across the face of goal and into the bottom left-hand corner. 80 min: Martinelli goes down under a challenge from Evangelista and Arsenal have a free-kick from about 35 yards out, well left of centre. 78 min: Arsenal substitution: Lucas Torreria on for Joe Willock. 76 min: Arsenal are allowed to play the ball around at the back uncontested and unpressed by any Vitoria players. They seem happy to do exactly that. And indeed, for all the penetration they\u2019ve displayed up front they might as well just pass it around at the back. 75 min: Play resumes with a Vitoria free-kick, about 25 yards from goal in line with the left edge of the penalty area. Evangelista stands over the ball, but chips it straight into the arms of Martinez. A poor, poor effort. 72 min: Arsenal continue to dominate and create nothing. They concede a free-kick, however, when Guendouzi hauls Rochinha to the ground. He clatters into Mustafi on his way down and has to receive medical treatment. 68 min: Vitoria substitution: Davidson off, Diogo Rochinha on. Bolton fans may remember the 24-year-old Portuguese, who made four appearances for them on a loan spell from Benfica four years ago. 65 min: A comically bedraggled looking Rob Holding gets booked for a trip on Lucas Evangelista. That looked a bit harsh, as the two players crossed each other\u2019s paths and it\u2019s difficult to know who - if anyone - fouled who. The rain has been relentless tonight and there\u2019s a bit of surface water on the pitch. We\u2019re not into comedy splashing and aqua-planing territory yet, mind. 64 min: Sokratis puts a cross from the left into the stand. Vitoria substitution, halfway inside the Arsenal half. Arsenal substitution: Alexandre Lacazette comes on for Bukayo Saka. 63 min: Mustafi heads over the bar from a Nicolas Pepe corner. 62 min: Vitoria substitution: the number of players on the pitch named Pepe is halved with one hoist of the fourth official\u2019s board - Vitoria\u2019s midfielder is replaced by Dennis-Will Poha, who is on loan at the club from Rennes. 60 min: From the edge of the penalty area, Guendouzi plays a weighted pass to the edge of the six-yard box for Nicolas Pepe to latch on to. the Frenchman is flagged for offside. 59 min: Arsenal continue to dominate possession but are doing little or nothing with it. They\u2019ve been incredibly pedestrian tonight. 58 min: Rafa Soares hacks the ball out for a corner under pressure from Saka. The ensuing dead ball delivery is poor and Evangelista heads clear. 55 min: Kieran Tierney threads a weighted pass between two defenders for Saka to chase down the inside left channel. He\u2019s flagged for offside but that looked very tight indeed. 52 min: Nicolas Pepe loses the ball, allowing Davidson to charge up the left flank. His attempt to square the ball across the face of the Arsenal goal is atrocious and goes wide. Arsenal substitution: Matteo Guendouzi replaces the hamstrung Dani Ceballos, who limps straight back to the dressing-room. 51 min: Joe Willock tries to advance into the Vitoria penalty area, but is dispossessed by Lucas Evangelista. Arsenal are bossing this second half in the early stages, but are seriously lacking in anything resembling cutting edge. 50 min: Ceballos pulls up with what looks like a hamstring injury to his left leg and signals to the bench. He then carries on, but is clutching the back of his leg. 47 min: A rogue pass to Rob Holding results in Vitoria winning the ball and Marcus Edwards galloping into the space left by the Arsenal skipper. With Ceballos racing back to provide cover, the Vitoria midfielder hesitates briefly and what looked a great chance for him to go clean through on goal goes to waste. 47 min: A marauding run up the inside left from Martinelli, who plays the ball inside for Saka and runs on to collect the return pass. It\u2019s overhit. 46 min: It continues to hammer down with rain and the confused mess that is Arsenal gets the ball rolling for the second half. There are no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! The deadline remains unbroken in Guimares, but it\u2019s the home side who have enjoyed all the best chances. THey\u2019ve brought several smart saves out of Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, while Arsenal have yet to test his opposite number, Douglas. 44 min: Saka and Tierney both go down injured for Arsenal and Pepe is penalised for his foul on the young Scot. Free-kick for Arsenal, just outside the Vitoria box. Nicolas Pepe fires a poor effort high over the bar. 42 min: Arsenal throw-in, deep in Vitoria territory as approach half-time. Holding loses the ball and Edwards surges forward. Rushing back to recover, Holding fouls his fellow Englishman. He\u2019s fortunate to avoid a booking. 41 min: Evangelista becomes the latest Vitoria player to shoot high and wide of the Arsenal goal with a speculative shot from distance. 40 min: A series of free-kicks for fouls on players from both teams has made things a little scrappy. With Davidson lurking in the penalty area, trying to get on the end of a deft little back-heel from Evangelista, Sokratis takes no chances and hacks the ball into Row Z. 39 min: From wide on the right, in line with the edge of the penalty area, Ceballos swings the ball across the face of goal. Rob Holding jumps highest, but the delivery is too high for him. 36 min: Not much happens for a couple of minutes ... we\u2019re in what is technically known as a lull. An Arsenal throw-in, deep in Vitoria territory, eventually results in Maitland-Niles drawing a foul from Davidson. 33 min: Vitoria\u2019s Rafa Soares is not so lucky and gets his name taken for a late challenge on Nicolas Pepe. 32 min: Martinelli loses the ball as he tries to run out of defence. Arsenal promptly win it back again and with Saka setting off on the counter-attack, he\u2019s cynically fouled by Bruno Duarte, who is lucky to avoid a yellow card. 30 min: Vitoria win a free-kick wide on the right. Pepe curls another ball into the penalty area, where an unmarked Venancio gets a free header. His effort is poor is as poor as Arsenal\u2019s defending and sails high over the bar. 29 min: Kieran Tierney goes on another speculative gallop down the left for Arsenal, but is dispossessed not far inside the Vitoria half by Lucas Evangelista. 27 min: Arsenal corner. The ball\u2019s swung into the penalty area, where Sokratis is penalised for grabbing a rival player\u2019s shirt. 23 min: Rob Holding is penalised for a foul on Marcus Edwards. Free-kick for Vitoria in line with the right side of the Arsenal penalty area. The ball\u2019s curled into the penalty area, where Arsenal clear ... but only as far as Davidson 20 yards from goal. He tries to curl the ball goalwards but sends it wide. 21 min: Arsenal win a throw-in deep in Vitoria territory. Martinelli sends a good cross towards the far post, where Victor Garcia gets the ball stuck under his feet. His captain Frederico Venancio steps in to hack the ball out for a corner. From that, Arsenal win another one and Rob Holding heads the ensuing cross from Bukayo Saka over the bar. 17 min: The rain continues to spill down in Portugal as Shkodran Mustafi is penalised for dragging out of Davidson, who had got in behind him and was chasing a ball over the top. From the ensuing free-kick, Pepe picks out Edmond Tapsoba with a wonderful cross and the defender brings another good save out of Martinez with a glancing header from about eight yards. 15 min: Another effort from Vitoria, who have Arsenal under the cosh. This time it\u2019s Mikel Agu who drags the ball wide. 12 min: After a slow opening couple of minutes, Vitoria are starting to dominate. They\u2019re dominating midfield and this time Davidson gets forward and plays a decent cross into the Arsenal penalty area. Bruno Duarte is unable to get on the end of it. 11 min: Arsenal fail to clear properly and now it\u2019s the turn of Marcus Edwards to try his luck from distance. His rasping drive is heading towards goal, but Martinez dives to his right and claws it away for a corner. He gathers the ensuing inswinger under his crossbar. 10 min: Joe Willock loses the ball in midfield and Vitoria advance again. They switch the play from right to left, but a good move breaks down when Davidson is fouled on the left flank. Pepe swings the ball into the mixer, where Mustafi clears. 8 min: Chance!!! Davidson tees up Pepe - the Vitoria version - and he unleashes a shot from distance. It beats Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez all ends up, but rattles the left upright. That was a formidable strike and Arsenal have dodged an early bullet. 6 min: Pepe picks out Maitland-Niles in space on the right. His attempted cross is blocked by Vitoria centre-half Edmond Tapsoba. 5 min: Looking at a replay, it seems Nicolas Pepe actually got a touch on that Maitland-Niles cross, but could only steer the ball wide of the far post. 3 min: A rampaging run and Kieran Tierney sends a cross in from the left, which is a mite too high for Nicolas Pepe, who didn\u2019t make much of an effort to reach it, truth be told. The ball carries through to Ashley Maitland-Niles on the right flank and it squares it across the face of goal. Somewhat miraculously, it contrives to avoid two players from each side on it\u2019s way. Arsenal should have scored. 2 min: With the home side wearing white shirts, white shorts and white socks, Arsenal\u2019s players are wearing yellow shirts, navy shorts and yellow socks. Unai Emery has his lined up in a back three, with wing-backs. 2 min: An early speculative shot from distance by Davidson sails high and wide of the Arsenal goal. 1 min: Rob Holding wins the coin-toss, completely justifying his manager\u2019s decision to make him captain for the evening. In your face Emery-haterz!!! On a seriously sodden afternoon in Guimaraes, the home side get the ball rolling. Not long now: There appears to be a reasonably decent crowd in the stadium, considering the game is being played on a school-day, due in no small and ironical part to the fact that Vitoria have given away loads of tickets to local schoolchildren. With what look suspiciously like strobe lights flashing in the tunnel, the teams make their way out on to the pitch. It is lashing with rain in northern Portugal. Unai Emery speaks: The Arsenal manager is asked about his decision to make Rob Holding captain tonight and sounds a mite tetchy when he replies. \u201cToday it is Rob Holding and he is perfect,\u201d he says. When asked \u201cwhy?\u201d by BT Sport\u2019s reporter he says: \u201cBecause he is.\u201d Further questions about his team selection prompt similarly brief answers. I suspect he\u2019s not in a very good mood. Edwards? The chap named Edwards in the Vitoria SC line-up is an attacking midfielder named Marcus, who signed a four-year deal with the Portuguese club last summer after leaving Tottenham Hotspur. The 20-year-old had a stint on loan at Dutch club Excelsior last season, making 25 appearances. Before that, he had a spell at N|orwich City, but only made one Championship appearance under Daniel Farke. Edwards has represented England at U16, U17, U18, U19 and U20 levels and was part of the side that won the European U19 Championship in 2017. Vitoria Guimaraes: Douglas Jesus, Garcia, Frederico Venancio, Tapsoba, Rafa Soares, Pepe, Agu, Evangelista, Edwards, Duarte, Davidson. Subs: Leo Bonatini, Rochinha, Al Musrati, Andre Pereira, Poha, Hanin, Miguel Silva. Arsenal: Martinez, Mustafi, Papastathopoulos, Holding, Tierney, Ceballos, Maitland-Niles, Willock, Pepe, Martinelli, Saka. Subs: Leno, Bellerin, Lacazette, Torreira, Nelson, Guendouzi, Kolasinac. Referee: Halis Ozkahya (Turkey) Kick-off: 3.50pm (GMT) Early team news: Arsenal manager Unai Emery has adopted something of a free-form jazz approach to today\u2019s team selection and has made no fewer than eight changes to the side that drew with Wolves at the Emirates over the weekend. Defenders Sokratis and Kieran Tierney keep their places, as does midfielder Dani Ceballos. Rob Holding skippers the side in the absence from the starting line-up of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hector Bellerin, Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut Ozil \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s group of \u201ccaptains\u201d . Granit Xhaka has been stripped of the armband following his outburst after being substituted during Arsenal\u2019s match against Crystal Palace and is not in tonight\u2019s squad. Arsenal? Playing in Europe on a Wednesday? Surely some mistake? Well, in a word: no. While the Europa League has traditionally been a Thursday night staple, this match is being played this afternoon because Portuguese side Braga are also playing in the competition and are slated to entertain Besiktas tomorrow. With the two towns just 25 kilometres apart, Uefa decided to switch Vitoria\u2019s game to Wednesday, in a bid to avoid traffic congestion and lighten the load on Portuguese police. The reason for the early kick-off is that Europa League matches can\u2019t clash with this evening\u2019s Champions League fixtures for broadcasting reasons. So, now you know. The Est\u00e1dio D. Afonso Henriques in Guimaraes is the venue for this Europa League clash between Vitoria and Arsenal. Unai Emery\u2019s side are top of the group with maximum points from their three games, while their hosts have yet to get a point on the board after losing their opening three fixtures. A win today will guarantee Arsenal qualification for the knockout stages, but having twice fallen behind to tonight\u2019s opponents before going on to win at the Emirates in their last game, they may not have things all their own way this afternoon. Kick-off is at the decidedly odd time of 3.50pm (GMT) (more of which anon) but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

Edmond Tapsoba should have done better with a free header, Mart\u00ednez saving superbly again, and Edwards hesitated at the crucial moment when running clear shortly after the interval.</p> <p>Their manager, Ivo Vieira, said his team had \u201cmore goal chances and more attacking volume\u201d than Arsenal, which was entirely true. So if Vit\u00f3ria are defensive, what exactly are Arsenal?

      "bodyText": "It was in Napier, the art deco-styled coastal city on the North Island playing host to Friday evening\u2019s fourth T20 between New Zealand and England, that Alan Mullally once left a dead shark in Mike Atherton\u2019s bed as a prank. On his first tour with England in the winter of 1996-97, the left-armer was ribbing his captain for a lack of fishing success and was then left out of the next match. Even if there were chiefly cricketing reasons at play, a bloodied 90kg mako with a note attached to its fin \u201cAthers, this is a fish\u201d \u2013 probably did not help Mullally\u2019s case. There are five enthusiastic newcomers in the current touring party (six if you count Mullally\u2019s fellow southpaw, Sam Curran, who had already won caps in the other formats). But as much as the head coach, Chris Silverwood, intends to continue the relaxed environment of his predecessor, Trevor Bayliss, the chances of Eoin Morgan finding the catch of the day under his covers after a defeat feel slim. Tuesday\u2019s collapse in Nelson has made the only day-night match of this tour a must-win given Morgan\u2019s continued assertion that, while blooding players is high on the list of priorities, a series victory remains top. With that in mind, sitting 2-1 down, the experienced Jonny Bairstow and Chris Jordan are both in line for returns to the XI one match sooner than previously planned. England will want another look at Tom Banton, the 360-degree Somerset opener who briefly crackled on debut for 18 before being bowled on the scoop. As well as a seamer making way \u2013 Pat Brown is shading Saqib Mahmood by way of returns but has played one more match \u2013 James Vince, whose loose dismissal for 49 felt the most squandered opportunity on the day, may well be the one left out. After Adil Rashid\u2019s first two outings demonstrated a touch of rustiness following his shoulder injury \u2013 England say he still feels \u201c70-80%\u201d by way of confidence in the joint \u2013 another opportunity should still be handed to Matt Parkinson, the Lancashire leg-spinner who struck with his fifth ball in international cricket. This sweet moment for the 23-year-old from Bolton was, like the best exponents of his craft, a rewarding piece of calculation too. Suspecting Tim Seifert to be lining up the reverse slog-sweep, Parkinson had the confidence to fire down a slider that nutmegged the right-hander and lit up the stumps. Parkinson admitted afterwards he was \u201cgutted\u201d to only get two overs (one for 14) though understood why Morgan held him back from a later spell; the wind had changed and two left-handers were at the crease. Nevertheless, with a strong action and the bravery to toss the ball up, he looked the part in this brief showing. \u201cThere were no nerves playing the game, that was more the build-up, waking up in the morning and trying to go to sleep the night before,\u201d said Parkinson. \u201cTrying to get through the time between waking up and then getting to the ground and training too. The actual game came as a relief.\u201d Parkinson is one of four England players in both squads on tour (Mahmood, Sam Curran and Joe Denly, nursing an ankle injury, are the other three). His spot follows a second season as the T20 Blast\u2019s leading spinner and a 10-wicket championship match at Hove played over the same weekend that England won the World Cup. Just hours after the Sussex match he and his twin brother, Callum \u2013 the Leicestershire left-arm spinner who was glad to see England bowl first on Tuesday due to a bleep test the next morning \u2013 lost their mother, Maria, aged only 50. \u201cI like to think that I\u2019ve used the tragic thing that happened in July to spur me on.

At Napier\u2019s McLean Park, a rugby-cum-cricket ground with a reputation for runs, Parkinson will be bowling to shorter square boundaries. England\u2019s batsmen failed to adapt to similar dimensions during the second game at Wellington\u2019s Cake Tin and now have a fresh angle to deal with in Trent Boult.

Irrespective of the report\u2019s claims, it is already well-established that such an influence operation took place.</p> <p>In February the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\" title=\"\">report into disinformation and fake news</a> described how Kremlin-aligned media published significant numbers of unique articles about the EU referendum. It referred, for example, to research by the campaigning organisation 89up, which analysed the most shared of the articles and identified 261 with a clear anti-EU bias.</p> <p>The two main outlets were Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik (a news agency, website platform and radio broadcast service established by the Russian government-owned news agency Rossiya Segodnya), with video produced by Ruptly.271 (a video news agency owned by RT). The articles that went most viral had the heaviest anti-EU bias.</p> <p>The social reach of these anti-EU articles was 134m potential impressions, in comparison with a total reach of just 33m and 11m impressions for all content shared from the Vote Leave and Leave.EU websites respectively. The cost for a comparable paid social media campaign would be millions of pounds.</p> <p>Furthermore, data released by Twitter last year revealed that, on the day of the Brexit vote, an \u201carmy\u201d of Russian trolls sent thousands of messages with the hashtag #ReasonsToLeaveEU.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street\u2019s unexplained refusal to publish the intelligence and security committee (ISC) report on Russian interference in UK politics is not only an outrageous denial of information that voters need to make sound electoral decisions, but has chilling implications for our democracy after the election (PM accused of cover-up over report on Russian meddling in UK politics, 5 November). If the prime minister gets away with being this autocratic now, how much more so will an elected Johnson government become after it? According to openDemocracy, the Met has already passed a file of criminal evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service relating to Boris Johnson\u2019s and Dominic Cummings\u2019 Vote Leave campaign in 2016. Johnson has risked a collapse of confidence in his integrity and suitability to govern as the election campaign progresses. The stench of electoral manipulation and Russian meddling will only grow stronger. Robin Gill Oxford \u2022 Your piece (Downing Street accused of Russia report cover-up, 1 November) suggested the ISC report features claims that Russia launched a major influence operation in 2016 in support of Brexit. Irrespective of the report\u2019s claims, it is already well-established that such an influence operation took place. In February the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport\u2019s report into disinformation and fake news described how Kremlin-aligned media published significant numbers of unique articles about the EU referendum. It referred, for example, to research by the campaigning organisation 89up, which analysed the most shared of the articles and identified 261 with a clear anti-EU bias. The two main outlets were Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik (a news agency, website platform and radio broadcast service established by the Russian government-owned news agency Rossiya Segodnya), with video produced by Ruptly.271 (a video news agency owned by RT). The articles that went most viral had the heaviest anti-EU bias. The social reach of these anti-EU articles was 134m potential impressions, in comparison with a total reach of just 33m and 11m impressions for all content shared from the Vote Leave and Leave.EU websites respectively. The cost for a comparable paid social media campaign would be millions of pounds. Furthermore, data released by Twitter last year revealed that, on the day of the Brexit vote, an \u201carmy\u201d of Russian trolls sent thousands of messages with the hashtag #ReasonsToLeaveEU. At one stage 3,800 fake accounts tweeted out 1,102 posts using the hashtag. In total, data from Twitter showed Russian and Iranian internet trolls sent more than 10m tweets around the time of the referendum in an effort to spread disinformation. Wherever the latest report is, the threat posed by Russia to the UK is real, alive and well, and will no doubt be going up a gear in the coming weeks. Andrew Kemp Exeter, Devon \u2022 How predictable that a government which has already repeatedly shown its contempt for any attempt to scrutinise its actions should now refuse to publish the intelligence and security committee report into alleged Kremlin involvement in the referendum campaign. It has direct relevance to the current election; the government\u2019s record suggests this is precisely why it wants to keep the report under wraps. The fact that eminent crossbenchers in the Lords argued for immediate publication is highly persuasive. In denying the public access to this material at the time it is most needed, Downing Street may well find that the electorate has become infected by the new cynicism it has fostered and draws its own conclusions. Charlie Duncan Oxford \u2022 Re the ISC report on Russian interference in British politics, where is the modern-day Katharine Gun when you need her? Alan Connell Harrogate, North Yorkshire \u2022 The government\u2019s refusal to release the ISC\u2019s report into Russian activity against the UK is only one example of the impact of government delay on the work of this committee. The ISC was reconstituted as a parliamentary committee in 2013, but in many respects remains subject to government control. This is not the first time the committee has expressed concern about the time taken by government to review its reports. It took more than four months to review the committee\u2019s report on lethal drone strikes, which was sent back to the committee just six days before the 2017 general election, with the result that the committee was forced to accept all of the government\u2019s proposed redactions in order to ensure the report was published before the election. Similarly, despite a commitment to respond to ISC reports within 60 days of publication, the government has routinely missed this target, for example, taking five months to respond to the committee\u2019s report on detainee mistreatment and rendition. There have also been delays in appointing the ISC. Although it is now appointed by parliament, members must first be nominated by the government. Delays in this process have meant that the ISC was one of the last parliamentary committees to be appointed following the 2015 and 2017 general elections, leaving the UK without an intelligence oversight committee for a total of 12 months. It is time that control over the operation of this important committee was taken out of the hands of the government and placed firmly in the hands of the committee and parliament where it belongs.

His apparent ignorance of this design flaw led to the deaths of 189 people in October 2018, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/03/why-did-it-fly-grief-mixes-with-anger-over-crashed-lion-air-flight\" title=\"\">Lion Air Flight 610 slammed into the Java Sea</a>. Five months later, once Boeing had convinced most of the world that poorly trained Indonesian pilots were probably to blame for the disaster, another 157 people died on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash-flight-et302-visual-guide-to-what-we-know-so-far\" title=\"\">Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302</a>.</p> <p>To the ordinary person in the street, glaring similarities between the crashes \u2013 both of which involved the same, brand new aircraft type nosediving at the same stage of their flight \u2013 made it obvious that the 737 Max should be grounded.</p> <p>There were, after all, just 350 of those planes in service at the time of the second crash \u2013 a fraction of the global commercial jet fleet. And, with less than two years of operational history behind it, Boeing\u2019s newest model had not yet attained a proven track record for safety.</p> <p>But to Boeing\u2019s management, acknowledging a potential design flaw was seen as a commercially ruinous step. Even as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/24/global-grounding-of-boeing-737-max-will-cost-company-more-than-1bn\" title=\"\">the rest of the world grounded the jet</a>, they wielded their influence over the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to keep the 737 Max flying for three long days after Flight 302. It was <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/13/politics/donald-trump-boeing-faa/index.html\" title=\"\">President Trump</a> \u2013 no expert in air crash investigations, but a man who at least seems to grasp risk management \u2013 who eventually forced Boeing\u2019s hand. And even then Muilenburg was dismissive, saying he will endeavour to \u201cmake a safe aircraft even safer\u201d.</p> <p>Ensuring that blood is never again spilled by this design flaw is, of course, the industry\u2019s top priority.

      "bodyText": "Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, last week told US lawmakers that he would have grounded the 737 Max in a heartbeat \u2013 if only he\u2019d known about the dangers posed by the aircraft\u2019s anti-stall mechanism. His apparent ignorance of this design flaw led to the deaths of 189 people in October 2018, when Lion Air Flight 610 slammed into the Java Sea. Five months later, once Boeing had convinced most of the world that poorly trained Indonesian pilots were probably to blame for the disaster, another 157 people died on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. To the ordinary person in the street, glaring similarities between the crashes \u2013 both of which involved the same, brand new aircraft type nosediving at the same stage of their flight \u2013 made it obvious that the 737 Max should be grounded. There were, after all, just 350 of those planes in service at the time of the second crash \u2013 a fraction of the global commercial jet fleet. And, with less than two years of operational history behind it, Boeing\u2019s newest model had not yet attained a proven track record for safety. But to Boeing\u2019s management, acknowledging a potential design flaw was seen as a commercially ruinous step. Even as the rest of the world grounded the jet, they wielded their influence over the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to keep the 737 Max flying for three long days after Flight 302. It was President Trump \u2013 no expert in air crash investigations, but a man who at least seems to grasp risk management \u2013 who eventually forced Boeing\u2019s hand. And even then Muilenburg was dismissive, saying he will endeavour to \u201cmake a safe aircraft even safer\u201d. Ensuring that blood is never again spilled by this design flaw is, of course, the industry\u2019s top priority. But it is right that questions are also asked about whether Boeing \u2013 and in particular its chief executive \u2013 behaved irresponsibly. Did Muilenburg shrug off warnings about the aircraft\u2019s anti-stall mechanism before and after the disasters, blinded by a desire to stay competitive with Airbus, Boeing\u2019s European rival? Was passenger safety his overriding concern at all times? More importantly, but less tangibly, is it likely that the culture he presided over will give rise to a similar crisis in the future? These are difficult questions to answer. But thanks to a steady trickle of leaked documents and whistleblowers, we know much more now than in the immediate wake of the tragic crashes. Take messages sent in 2016 by Mark Forkner, then Boeing\u2019s chief technical pilot for the 737 Max, in which he complained that the aircraft\u2019s anti-stall mechanism was \u201crunning rampant\u201d in simulator tests. He later convinced the FAA that it wasn\u2019t necessary to mention this mechanism in pilot manuals \u2013 an omission that boosted sales of the plane because Boeing could claim that flight crews on older 737 models needed almost no retraining. Forkner and others now say his comments referred to faulty simulator software, rather than an inherent design flaw. But they also seem to show that he understood how the anti-stall mechanism \u2013 which is programmed to tip the nose of the plane down \u2013 can violently override pilot inputs. And that appears to make advice to the FAA incomprehensible. Another document from 2015 shows that a Boeing employee warned about what later proved to be the achilles\u2019 heel of the 737 Max\u2019s anti-stall mechanism \u2013 its reliance on data from one \u201csingle\u201d sensor. Flying is the safest mode of transport precisely because modern aircraft are designed in a manner that ensures no single point of failure can ever spell doom. The 737 Max seems to have been approved despite appearing to violate this long-standing engineering principle. Red flags might have been ignored because the FAA was in the process of changing the way it certifies aircraft \u2013 in effect, sub-delegating many of its checks back to Boeing. The arrangement isn\u2019t as crazy as it sounds: Boeing\u2019s workforce is better funded, better resourced and arguably more experienced than the FAA\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "The head of the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees has resigned after becoming embroiled in a scandal involving accusations of nepotism, abuses of authority and having an affair with an employee. In a statement on Wednesday, the UN said Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl had resigned with immediate effect his from role as commissioner general at the agency after an internal investigation found \u201cmanagement issues.\u201d Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl tendered his resignation to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday amid widespread coverage of the scandal just hours after he had agreed to step aside temporarily earlier in the day. Preliminary findings \u201cexclude fraud or misappropriation of operational funds\u201d by Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, a UN spokesman said separately. \u201cThere are, however, managerial issues that need to be addressed.\u201d The Swiss national has previously strongly denied allegations of impropriety. A leaked internal investigation into misconduct at UNRWA, completed late last year, accused the agency of \u201ccredible and corroborated\u201d allegations of serious ethical abuses, including some involving Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl. Announcing Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl was stepping aside, the UN secretary general\u2019s office said the continuing inquiry had \u201crevealed management issues which relate specifically\u201d to the agency\u2019s head. UNRWA said he had stepped aside until the completion of the process and the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had appointed Christian Saunders as the officer in charge for the interim period. Sources said the allegations concerning Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl involved his relationship with a female member of staff, with whom he flew around the world travelling in business class and staying in boutique hotels. According to Swiss media reports earlier this year, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, who is married, reportedly created a post for a woman with whom he was allegedly in a relationship. The cost of the role was funded by the Swiss foreign ministry from March 2015 to December last year. Several donor countries, including Switzerland and Belgium, suspended funding to UNRWA, which provides support to 5.5 million Palestinian refugees, over the allegations. The alleged misbehaviour at the top of the agency also reportedly involved other senior staff, with some of the complaints allegedly involving attempts to cover up other wrongdoing. The problems at the agency are believed to have come to light after two dozen senior staff complained to UNRWA\u2019s ethics officer, who completed a report on the allegations for Guterres in December last year. The report was leaked this summer, apparently at a time of frustration with the slow progress of the UN\u2019s investigation, prompting further revelations. Although Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl was regarded as a highly effective advocate for his agency \u2013 replacing the shortfall in US funds after Donald Trump cut them \u2013 the allegations suggest an organisation riven by discontent. The leaked investigation depicted an \u201cinner circle\u201d around Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl who were suggested to have benefited themselves. They were accused of \u201cengag[ing] in misconduct, nepotism, retaliation ... and other abuses of authority.\u201d The UNRWA statement said a continuing review by the UN internal oversight office found a number of areas that required strengthening. The apparent relationship at the heart of the allegations had prompted widespread speculation within the agency, as the two officials had flown around the world together, allegedly sometimes staying in a separate hotel to other staff. In a statement earlier this year regarding the claims, the agency\u2019s spokeswoman, Tamara Alrifai, said: \u201cThere is an ongoing investigation concerning UNRWA, and nothing that is being disseminated or discussed are findings of the investigation, only allegations and rumours.\u201d She appealed for people to \u201cwait for the actual conclusions\u201d and for donors to \u201ckeep their funding in place\u201d for Palestinian refugees. In early July, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl said he \u201cunreservedly\u201d rejected the report\u2019s characterisation of the agency and its senior leadership. \u201cIf the current investigation \u2013 once it is completed \u2013 were to present findings that require corrective measures or other management actions, I will not and we will not hesitate to take them,\u201d he said. Israel expressed \u201cgreat concern\u201d over the findings, saying they confirmed the need for \u201cdeep and comprehensive change\u201d at UNRWA. \u201cThe stepping aside of Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl is but the first step in a long process that is needed to eliminate corruption, increase transparency and prevent politicisation of the agency,\u201d the foreign ministry said.",

As her promoter, Frank Warren, observed with pride: \u201cNicola has that star quality in abundance that very few possess.\u201d It took Bradley Wiggins\u2019s Tour de France victory to stop her winning the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year award in 2012. And she never did get her chance to fight in Vegas. But Adams has so many gilded memories to cherish none of that will bother her. Nothing does, it seems. And that is her real genius.",

But there are now signs that the weakness is spreading...</p> <p>The IMF says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> For most of the region, the slowdown remains externally driven. However, some signs of softer domestic demand have started to appear, especially in investment. Services and domestic consumption have been buoyant so far, but their resilience is tightly linked to labor market conditions, which, despite some easing, remain robust. Expansionary fiscal policy in many countries and looser financial conditions have also supported domestic demand.</p> <p>On balance, Europe\u2019s growth is projected to decline from 2.3% in 2018 to 1.% in 2019. A modest recovery is forecast for 2020, with growth reaching 1.8%, as global trade is expected to pick up and some economies recover from past stresses. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1192103114008092672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The European Economic Outlook shows that growth is projected in 2019 to decline in most European countries and only modestly recover in 2020.

      "bodyText": "Finally, a rather uneventful day\u2019s trading is over in the City. The FTSE 100 closed just 8 points higher at 7,396. Growth across the world\u2019s companies has hit its lowest level in nearly four years. That\u2019s according to October\u2019s PMI surveys, released over the last few days: Some good news: The International Monetary Fund has issued a fresh warning that Europe\u2019s economy has weakened this year. In its new Regional Economic Outlook for Europe, the IMF points out that growth has slowed this year. That\u2019s mainly due to weaker trade (thanks to the US-China tariffs), and a slowdown in factories this year. But there are now signs that the weakness is spreading... The IMF says: For most of the region, the slowdown remains externally driven. However, some signs of softer domestic demand have started to appear, especially in investment. Services and domestic consumption have been buoyant so far, but their resilience is tightly linked to labor market conditions, which, despite some easing, remain robust. Expansionary fiscal policy in many countries and looser financial conditions have also supported domestic demand. On balance, Europe\u2019s growth is projected to decline from 2.3% in 2018 to 1.% in 2019. A modest recovery is forecast for 2020, with growth reaching 1.8%, as global trade is expected to pick up and some economies recover from past stresses. This echoes the message from the IMF\u2019s Autumn Meeting last month, when it clashed growth forecasts for some European economies. It only expects the eurozone to grow by 1.2% in 2019 (down from 1.3% previously), and by 1.4% in 2020 and 2021 (down from 1.5%). The Fund also warns European leaders to prepare for the next crisis, and boost spending where they can, saying: Countries with ample fiscal space should take measures to boost potential output, while countries with elevated debt and deficit levels should generally proceed with fiscal consolidation. This would also help address external imbalances. Given elevated downside risks, contingency plans should be at the ready for implementation in case these risks materialize, not least because the scope for effective monetary policy action has diminished. Just in: America stockpiled a lot more crude oil than expected last month. Stocks of refined hydrocarbon products, such as gasoline, fell. That suggests that US refiners reined in their activity last week; perhaps a sign of slowing demand? City news: Jupiter has named fund management veteran Nichola Pease as its new chairman -- despite her husband, Crispin Odey, betting against the company. Pease is an experienced financial executive, having run JO Hambro Capital Management and served on the board of Schroders, one of Jupiter\u2019s rivals, since 2012. She says: \u201cJupiter is an exceptional firm with a high-quality team and an ambitious strategy to build the business over the next five years. I look forward to joining the Board at a very exciting time for the business.\u201d But does Crispin agree? Earlier this week his hedge fund held a 0.66% short position in Jupiter\u2019s shares, which would be profitable if they fell in value.... The FT\u2019s heard that Odey has now closed the short position. Very wise, if only for domestic harmony.... Shares in ride-sharing firm Uber have hit a fresh record low today, as some company insiders get the chance to sell. It\u2019s six months since Uber floated, meaning the lock-up period preventing some insiders and early investors from cashing in has just expired. This puts fresh pressure on Uber\u2019s stock, which has already fallen by a third since it floated at $45/share in May. The shares are down 3% today at $27.15. CNN thinks the impact from the lockup expiration could be \u2018muted\u2019, as Uber\u2019s share price is now below the price some insiders bought in at. Ding ding! Shares in Hewlett-Packard have surged by 17% at the start of trading in New York. Traders are enthused by the prospect of a takeover move from smaller rival Xerox (see earlier post). However, it\u2019s not clear how a merger of these two makers of increasingly legacy tech would be financed, points out Daniel Howley of Yahoo Finance. The broader market is quiet, though, with the Dow down 27 points at 27,465 (-0.1%). Eek! US productivity has suffered its biggest decline in four years. Labor Department figures show that the economic output per hour of US workers fell by 0.3% in July-September, the largest drop since late 2015. Over the last year, US productivity is only 1.4% higher, despite president Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulation push which was meant to make the economy more productive. It\u2019s a blow to the White House, as the Associated Press explains: The Trump administration promoted its 2017 corporate tax cut as a policy that would raise productivity by encouraging businesses to invest in more computers, machinery and other equipment. Productivity did pick up in the first half of this year after growing modestly in 2018, but it now appears to be dropping back to the slow growth that has occurred since the Great Recession ended. Over in Berlin, the government is trying to cool suggestions that it supports a deposit insurance scheme to protect eurozone savers from a bank collapse. Yesterday, finance minister Olaf Scholz appeared to back the idea of a common scheme to protect savers\u2019 deposits. Writing in the Financial Times, Scholz argued that Europe must complete the process of banking union. \u201cThe need to deepen and complete European banking union is undeniable. After years of discussion, the deadlock has to end. Significantly, Scholz said such integration must include a European deposit protection, so that national governments could honour their legal obligation to protect deposits of up to \u20ac100,000. Such a move was deposit insurance \u201cno small step for a German finance minister\u201d, Scholz wrote, acknowledging Berlin\u2019s reluctance to pick up the bill for bank problems abroad. However, Angela Merkel\u2019s administration may not be convinced yet! German government spokesman Steffen Seibert has told reporters that Scholz was merely contributing to the debate, rather than announcing a change of policy..... Scholz certainly wasn\u2019t offering a blank cheque. In return for a deposit insurance scheme, he also wants to beef up bank supervision rules, harmonise bankruptcy law, and tackle bad debts in the system. The US president wants to take the credit for the stock market rally: It could be a quiet day on Wall Street, judging by these opening calls: Back in London, shares in communications group BT have slumped after it lost a key contract. Virgin Media has dropped BT as its mobile network provider in favour of Vodafone, and is promising new services such as super-fast mobile broadband. Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, says the move could benefit Virgin\u2019s three million customers. \u201cIn theory, customers shouldn\u2019t see any disruption when they are moved over from late 2021, and users won\u2019t need to change their SIM cards. \u201cThe agreement means that Virgin Media customers will get to enjoy Vodafone\u2019s 5G network, which launched more than three months ahead of BT\u2019s 5G technology. \u201cVodafone has been offering its customers tariffs based on unlimited data, so any similar offering by Virgin Media could be a huge draw for new users. BT are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 4.5%, while Vodafone are up 1.5%. According to the BBC, the contract was worth around \u00a3200m to BT. Over in New York, shares in tech firm Hewlett-Packard have surged almost 9% as print rival Xerox ponders an audacious takeover. Xerox\u2019s board considered whether to bid for its larger rival this week, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. Such a deal would unite two faded tech giants; a few decades ago, Xerox\u2019s printers and copiers and HP\u2019s workstations, laptops and peripherals helped both firms dominate the IT space. But it would be a stretch for Xerox -- it\u2019s worth $8bn, compared to HP\u2019s $27bn. The WSJ says: Xerox is considering making a cash-and-stock offer for HP, which has a market value of about $27 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The copier maker\u2019s board discussed the possibility Tuesday, the people said. There is no guarantee Xerox will follow through with an offer or that one would succeed. HP, which installed a new chief executive just last week, is more than three times the size of Xerox and any bid would be at a premium to its current stock price, the people said. Although markets are quiet today, the mood has changed in recent days. Rightly or wrongly, many investors are more optimistic about the global outlook, and hopeful that the US and China will declare a trade war truce soon. This has pushed equities higher, with the blue-chip FTSE 100 gaining over 4% since the start of ~Octobe.r Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, explains: Investors want to believe good news \u2013 especially equity market investors. Subject to the ever-erratic newsflow on a \u201cphase one\u201d deal in the Sino-American trade dispute, such a deal would obviously remove a short-term \u201cdownside risk\u201d for the global economy. Investors also are looking at incoming economic data and hoping that the global economic downturn is bottoming out.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s CEO Steve Rowe has faced the press (by phone) to explain why profits have slumped 17%, with yet another drop in clothing sales. Rowe, who was appointed in 2016, has admitted that the company failed to execute its strategy well enough (as with the \u2018Jeansgate\u2019 debacle, when it didn\u2019t stock enough pairs of trousers worn by TV presenter Holly Willoughby) European stock markets are very subdued this morning. Despite the pick-up in German factory orders, the Frankfurt markets is slightly lower this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 10 points or 0.15%. Property firms British Land and Land Securities are among the top fallers, following Intu\u2019s warning that its rental income is falling. Asia-Pacific markets have closed, with China\u2019s CSI300 and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX both dropping 0.5%. UJ shopping centre owner Intu has sent shivers through the property sector, by warning that it expects rental income to fall sharply this year. Intu blamed a surge in UK companies using administration agreements (or CVAs) to shed underperforming stores, which hit its income in recent months. It also cited political uncertainty (such as Brexit) for deterring potential customers. Intu told the City: Although new lettings and rent reviews are still positive overall, CVAs in the period were slightly worse than expected and the political and economic uncertainty is causing customers to delay new lettings, with letting activity in the third quarter slower than forecast and at a lower level than 2018. We anticipate that like-for-like net rental income for 2019 will be down by around 9 per cent, with more than half the reduction coming from the impact of CVAs such as Arcadia and Monsoon. Intu\u2019s CEO Matthew Roberts says the \u201cnumber one priority\u201d is to fix the firm\u2019s balance sheet before it faces significant debt repayments in 2021. Options include selling assets and issuing fresh equity, he says. Intu\u2019s shares have tumbled 16% this morning, to a two-month low. More from Ofcom: Just in: Eurozone retail sales are a little stronger than expected in September: Newsflash: Ofcom has chosen Melanie Dawes, one of the UK\u2019s most senior civil servants, as its next CEO. My colleague Mark Sweney has the scoop: The 53-year-old, the most senior female in the civil service, is currently permanent secretary at the ministry of housing, communities and local government, which she took over from Bob Kerslake in 2015. The UK media and telecoms regulator\u2019s selection panel, led by the Ofcom chairman Lord Burns, is ready to appoint Dawes who is understood to be keen to take up one of the biggest regulatory jobs in Britain. However, the announcement of a successor to Sharon White is not likely to be officially confirmed until after the general election, which could - but is unlikely - to have an impact on her appointment. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has abandoned plans to announce his choice to be the next governor of the Bank of England until after the election. Dawes will succeed Sharon White, who is becoming the new chairman of John Lewis. Here\u2019s Mark\u2019s story: The eurozone economy continues to be dragged back by manufacturing gloom. Data firm Markit reports that the eurozone\u2019s private sector barely grew last month (despite the pick-up in German factory orders reported this morning). Markit says: Weakness was centred on the manufacturing economy, where another marked fall in new orders was recorded, whilst there was also a sharp reduction in foreign demand. Overall exports were down for a thirteenth successive month, with the rate of decline amongst the sharpest in the series history. Its Eurozone Composite PMI index has come in at 50.6, up from 50.1 in September, but still close to stagnation. Although France posted stronger growth, Germany\u2019s private sector contracted. Markit says: There remained a divergence between the manufacturing and service sectors during October. Whereas manufacturing firms recorded a ninth successive month of declining production, service sector companies indicated further growth, albeit at the second-weakest rate since January. But encouragingly, German, France and Italy all reported stronger service sector PMIs than predicted this morning. This lifted the eurozone\u2019s Service Sector PMI to 52.2 in October, up from September\u2019s 51.6. That shows faster growth, but is also the second-lowest reading since January. Service sector companies reported a small rise in new business volumes was signalled during October, although exports fell for the 14th month in a row. Backlogs of work fell for a third successive month, keeping employment growth at an eight-month low. Back in the UK, Marks &amp; Spencer has admitted it is \u201cmaking up for lost time\u201d after yet another poor performance in clothing sales (down 5.5% in the last six months) M&amp;S suffered some serious supply chain problems this year, leading to empty shelves and racks (and the sacking of fashion boss Jill McDonald). Today, CEO Steve Rowe has insisted it is seeing \u201ca positive response\u201d from shoppers, and suggested clothing sales are turning around. Here\u2019s the full story: M&amp;S shares are up 4.4% this morning, as traders take heart from Rowe\u2019s upbeat comments. To Masayoshi Son\u2019s credit, he isn\u2019t ducking the WeWork issue. Speaking to journalists in Tokyo, SoftBank\u2019s CEO admits that he blundered by pumping so much money into the office rental company, which had to be bailed out last month. Son says: \u201cThe perception is that SoftBank is being dragged down into the quagmire of WeWork.\u201d \u201cI am looking back with true regret about the mistaken investment moves that I have made.\u201d But Son also insisted that WeWork, which leases offices and desk space, can have a bright future. Associated Press has the details: In a presentation, Son said WeWork was losing money from initial construction and design costs but, with time, property will become profitable. A reporter asked how WeWork was an internet company when it was real estate, a question that has been on many minds on WeWork. But Son said internet technology is incorporated into WeWork\u2019s concept. WeWork focuses on offering office space to startups. Son also argued that it\u2019s common for new companies to start out with losses, including those considered successes such as Amazon and Facebook, and they were able to eventually grow. SoftBank has said it has ample cash to handle the WeWork woes. \u201cThere is no storm, and things are under control,\u201d he said, although he smiled when the crowd responded with giggles. Today\u2019s huuuge loss is actually SoftBank\u2019s first quarterly loss in 14 years. It\u2019s a day of reckoning for SoftBank, as Bloomberg puts it: Masayoshi Son is finally disclosing the damage from SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s bets on WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. The Japanese investment powerhouse on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years -- about $6.5 billion --after writing down the value of a string of marquee investments. It swallowed a charge of 497.7 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for WeWork, whose spectacular implosion turned the once high-flying shared-office startup into a Silicon Valley punchline. SoftBank Group, the Japanese tech investor, has slumped to a massive quarterly loss after the valuations of US companies WeWork and Uber plunged, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes. The company, run by billionaire investor Masayoshi Son, made an operating loss of 704bn yen (\u00a35bn) in the three months to the end of September, in results published on Wednesday. The loss comes after a dreadful quarter for the tech companies backed by Son\u2019s venture capital funds, the $100bn Vision Fund and the smaller Delta Fund. SoftBank\u2019s operating loss was due to the \u201cdecrease in the fair values of investments including Uber and WeWork and its three affiliates\u201d held by SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund and Delta Fund, it said. The two funds together made a quarterly loss of 970bn yen. Son acknowledged his judgement around the $10.3bn investment in WeWork was not right, and admitted his faith in WeWork founder Adam Neumann was misplaced, in a presentation to investors on Wednesday. Son said he turned a blind eye to Neumann\u2019s bad side over issues such as corporate governance and that he had learned a harsh lesson, according to Reuters. He added that WeWork was not a sinking boat, despite a need to cut spending. WeWork\u2019s parent, the We Company, was forced to abandon an initial public offering of its shares on US stock markets at the end of September after investors queried the massive valuation given to the office space rental company. SoftBank then led a $9.5bn bailout of WeWork, and founder Adam Neumann was forced out. The debacle wiped $7.8bn from WeWork\u2019s valuation, SoftBank said. Shares in Uber, which listed in May, fell to a new record low on Tuesday as it posted yet another loss, despite beating revenues estimates. Some investors in its stock market float will on Wednesday be able to sell their shares for the first time, when a lock-up period expires. Son\u2019s net worth has plunged by about $6bn since July, when it peaked at about $20bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks billionaires\u2019 wealth. That left Son with $13.8bn on Tuesday. The difficult quarter could complicate Son\u2019s efforts to raise a second Vision fund if investors question his high-risk strategy of making significant bets on big-spending, young companies. Preparations for a \u201cfull-scale launch\u201d are still underway, SoftBank said. Economists are hailing today\u2019s rise in German factory orders. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says the 1.3% monthly increase is \u2018solid\u2019, but may not prevent the economy falling into recession. Viraj Patel, strategist at Arkera, says it\u2019s an encouraging sign for the eurozone economy. Bloomberg\u2019s Yuko Takeo says Germany\u2019s factory sector is showing welcome signs of life: A rebound in German factory orders is adding to signs that the euro-area economy has passed the worst of its recent troubles. Demand rose 1.3% in September, far exceeding estimates of a 0.1% gain. The first increase in three months was driven by a solid pickup in investment and consumer goods, with demand from outside the euro area providing a particular boost. The euro rose after the report and traded at $1.1076 at 8:54 a.m. Frankfurt time. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is Germany turning a corner? After many months of gloom, Europe\u2019s largest economy may finally be bottoming out. German factory orders jumped by 1.3% month-on-month in September, comfortably beating expectations of a 0.1% rise. That follows a 0.6% decline in August, and is one of the best months for German manufacturing this year (although that\u2019s not difficult!) The pick-up in demand was driven by orders within Germany, and from countries outside the eurozone. Destatis, the statistics body, explains: Domestic orders increased by 1.6% and foreign orders rose 1.1% in September 2019 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area were down 1.8%, new orders from other countries increased 3.0% compared to August 2019. Encouragingly, orders for expensive, heavy-duty machinery and equipment rose strongly. Destatis says: In September 2019 the manufacturers of intermediate goods saw new orders decrease by 1.5% compared with August 2019. The manufacturers of capital goods showed increases of 3.1% on the previous month. For consumer goods, a rise in new orders of 0.8% was recorded. Encouraging stuff. But on an annual basis, sales were still 5.4% lower than in September 2018. This may not prevent Germany falling into recession, but it does offer hope that growth could pick up again soon. Also coming up today Over in Japan, technology investor Softbank has just posted a whopping operating loss of \u00a5700bn for the last quarter (almost \u00a35bn), due to disappointing bets on companies such as WeWork and Uber. That\u2019s a stark reversal on the \u00a5706bn profit in July-September 2018, and much worse than the \u00a548bn loss which analysts expected. SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son is presenting the report now, and admitting that \u201cwe are in a rough sea\u201d... The latest surveys of eurozone purchasing managers are expected to show that Europe\u2019s services sector continued to grow last month. But with manufacturing shrinking, the euro economy remains subdued. After a few days of gains, stocks are dipping today. Equity indices in Asia have dropped back, and a weakish open is expected in Europe. Traders are now questioning whether a US-China trade pact is achievable, with Beijing pushing Washington On the corporate front, UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer has just posted a 17% drop in profits as clothing sales continue to slide - down another 5.5%!

      "body": "<p>If only there were indeed some art to find the mind\u2019s construction in the face. What a different world that would be. Instead, we live in this one and its horrors may live anywhere.</p> <p>In Cleveland, Ohio in 1985, John Demjanjuk, a nationalised Ukrainian immigrant and Ford auto worker of 30-plus years\u2019 good standing, was arrested as a war criminal. The US Office of Special Investigations (OSI) \u2013 Nazi hunters \u2013 had amassed evidence that he was the notoriously sadistic death camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible, an operator of the gas chambers at Treblinka who would beat, torture and cut off the breasts of Jewish captives as he herded thousands of the estimated 850,000 men, women and children killed there to their deaths.</p> <p>Netflix\u2019s new true-crime series <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80201488\" title=\"\">The Devil Next Door</a> tells, over five instalments, the story of what became the highest-profile and most bitterly emotive trial since Adolf Eichmann\u2019s 25 years before. Both the survivors and the perpetrators of the Holocaust were ageing and dying; it would be one of the last chances to deliver justice for what had gone before.</p> <p>Demjanjuk never moved from his position that he was a victim of mistaken identity. The US stripped him of citizenship and Israel extradited him for trial in Jerusalem. A year of trying to prove the verity or otherwise of documents and photographs ensued. Should they be considered suspect because they came from the KGB at a time when the Soviets were trying to drive a wedge between Ukrainian and Jewish American communities allied by their anti-communist sympathies? Or was that a spur to releasing the truth? Facial-recognition experts testified for and against the 66-year-old Demjanjuk being the man in Nazi ID card photos taken more than 40 years before. Lawyers battled for supremacy, sometimes even when they were on the same side. One of Demjanjuk\u2019s lawyers, Yoram Sheftel, remains vocal about it being \u201ca show trial\u201d designed to bring succour to survivors, with unreliable evidence at every stage.</p> <p>Above all, it was a year of survivor testimony. Of them insisting they recognised the man before them as the man who sliced at bodies as he forced them into the gas chambers, and of trying to resolve unspeakable atrocities into words. One, Pinhas Epstein, recalled a 12-year-old girl emerging alive from the chamber crying \u201cI want my mummy\u201d, before she was shot and thrown into a pit. What do you do with that sight, that knowledge? Forty years on her voice still rang in his head as if it were yesterday.</p> <p>The Devil Next Door rarely touched on wider questions, although, during their contributions, both Israeli state prosecutor Eli Gabay and Eli Rosenbaum of the OSI considered the moral and practical implications of letting war criminals go unpunished, and Demjanjuk\u2019s supervisor at the Ford plant noted the US\u2019s willingness to let bygones be bygones when they found former Nazis who could, for example, help with their space programme. It largely stuck to the relatively straightforward task of delineating events as they unfolded, although even here there were leaps and gaps in the telling I needed to fill in for myself via the internet after it was all over.</p> <p>Perhaps the makers, understandably, felt that a sober, traditional approach was the most respectful. Although they used substantial amounts of footage of the witnesses\u2019 testimonies and the appalling newsreel footage that came from inside the death and concentration camps, they did so in a way that avoided sensationalism or any sense of viewer manipulation. But the best of Netflix\u2019s true-crime series (and, indeed, any other broadcaster\u2019s, even if they haven\u2019t made them such a central feature of their offerings) manage to ask bigger questions, often about entire systems of justice or government, the corruption therein or just the innate human fallibility that attends even our best endeavours.</p> <p>There was scope in The Devil Next Door for much more context and philosophising about truth and memory, the difficulty of weighing evidence impartially in the face of overwhelming emotion, or how you ever find justice \u2013 collective, individual, true or symbolic \u2013 or any kind of peace when you have witnessed more acts of purest evil than a human soul can surely bear.</p> <p>The Jerusalem court\u2019s verdict was that Demjanjuk was indeed Ivan the Terrible. It was overturned on appeal, but when the Berlin Wall came down it led to new documents being accessed and, eventually, another trial, where the 91-year-old Demjanjuk was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/john-demjanjuk-guilty-nazi-war-crimes\" title=\"\">found guilty</a> as an accessory to 28,500 murders as a guard at Sobib\u00f3r, but not found to be Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka.</p> <p>Questions, from the smallest to the very largest we ever ask of ourselves, remain. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2019 because an earlier version referred to \u201cgas ovens\u201d, rather than gas chambers. </p>",

      "bodyText": "If only there were indeed some art to find the mind\u2019s construction in the face. What a different world that would be. Instead, we live in this one and its horrors may live anywhere. In Cleveland, Ohio in 1985, John Demjanjuk, a nationalised Ukrainian immigrant and Ford auto worker of 30-plus years\u2019 good standing, was arrested as a war criminal. The US Office of Special Investigations (OSI) \u2013 Nazi hunters \u2013 had amassed evidence that he was the notoriously sadistic death camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible, an operator of the gas chambers at Treblinka who would beat, torture and cut off the breasts of Jewish captives as he herded thousands of the estimated 850,000 men, women and children killed there to their deaths. Netflix\u2019s new true-crime series The Devil Next Door tells, over five instalments, the story of what became the highest-profile and most bitterly emotive trial since Adolf Eichmann\u2019s 25 years before. Both the survivors and the perpetrators of the Holocaust were ageing and dying; it would be one of the last chances to deliver justice for what had gone before. Demjanjuk never moved from his position that he was a victim of mistaken identity. The US stripped him of citizenship and Israel extradited him for trial in Jerusalem. A year of trying to prove the verity or otherwise of documents and photographs ensued. Should they be considered suspect because they came from the KGB at a time when the Soviets were trying to drive a wedge between Ukrainian and Jewish American communities allied by their anti-communist sympathies? Or was that a spur to releasing the truth? Facial-recognition experts testified for and against the 66-year-old Demjanjuk being the man in Nazi ID card photos taken more than 40 years before. Lawyers battled for supremacy, sometimes even when they were on the same side. One of Demjanjuk\u2019s lawyers, Yoram Sheftel, remains vocal about it being \u201ca show trial\u201d designed to bring succour to survivors, with unreliable evidence at every stage. Above all, it was a year of survivor testimony. Of them insisting they recognised the man before them as the man who sliced at bodies as he forced them into the gas chambers, and of trying to resolve unspeakable atrocities into words. One, Pinhas Epstein, recalled a 12-year-old girl emerging alive from the chamber crying \u201cI want my mummy\u201d, before she was shot and thrown into a pit. What do you do with that sight, that knowledge? Forty years on her voice still rang in his head as if it were yesterday. The Devil Next Door rarely touched on wider questions, although, during their contributions, both Israeli state prosecutor Eli Gabay and Eli Rosenbaum of the OSI considered the moral and practical implications of letting war criminals go unpunished, and Demjanjuk\u2019s supervisor at the Ford plant noted the US\u2019s willingness to let bygones be bygones when they found former Nazis who could, for example, help with their space programme. It largely stuck to the relatively straightforward task of delineating events as they unfolded, although even here there were leaps and gaps in the telling I needed to fill in for myself via the internet after it was all over. Perhaps the makers, understandably, felt that a sober, traditional approach was the most respectful. Although they used substantial amounts of footage of the witnesses\u2019 testimonies and the appalling newsreel footage that came from inside the death and concentration camps, they did so in a way that avoided sensationalism or any sense of viewer manipulation. But the best of Netflix\u2019s true-crime series (and, indeed, any other broadcaster\u2019s, even if they haven\u2019t made them such a central feature of their offerings) manage to ask bigger questions, often about entire systems of justice or government, the corruption therein or just the innate human fallibility that attends even our best endeavours. There was scope in The Devil Next Door for much more context and philosophising about truth and memory, the difficulty of weighing evidence impartially in the face of overwhelming emotion, or how you ever find justice \u2013 collective, individual, true or symbolic \u2013 or any kind of peace when you have witnessed more acts of purest evil than a human soul can surely bear. The Jerusalem court\u2019s verdict was that Demjanjuk was indeed Ivan the Terrible. It was overturned on appeal, but when the Berlin Wall came down it led to new documents being accessed and, eventually, another trial, where the 91-year-old Demjanjuk was found guilty as an accessory to 28,500 murders as a guard at Sobib\u00f3r, but not found to be Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka. Questions, from the smallest to the very largest we ever ask of ourselves, remain. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2019 because an earlier version referred to \u201cgas ovens\u201d, rather than gas chambers.",

I was in shock all weekend, on the verge of tears the whole time,\u201d she said. The Jesus in Wadsworth\u2019s painting is the fashion model Tafari Hinds. Using him was a way of challenging perceptions, of asking people to \u201clook with fresh eyes at something you think you know\u201d. Wadsworth said she had no interest in copying Leonardo and it is purposefully titled A Last Supper. All the disciples are deliberately \u201chot\u201d young actors and models who she corralled into her east London studio, with the promise of food and booze, on a freezing cold November night in 2008. Judas is a blond-haired, blue-eyed boy she came across in a cafe. Whoever shot the painting, which is on aluminium, would seem to have chosen their spot purposefully. It is on Christ\u2019s right side, the place a Roman soldier made the final wound into the body of Jesus to be sure he was dead. The chances of ever conclusively getting to the bottom of the mystery of who pulled the trigger \u2013 and why \u2013 are slim. The work will go on display at a show celebrating the work of Sheffield-born Wadsworth. Also in the exhibition are portraits of the actors Rupert Friend, David Tennant and Michael Sheen, the writer Neil Gaiman, the milliner Victoria Grant and the 6ft Thatcher in what was the last formal portrait she ever sat for, created over five sittings. That painting has been described by the art dealer and broadcaster Philip Mould as \u201carguably the boldest formal life portrait of a prime minister ever painted in Britain\u201d. Wadsworth\u2019s charcoal cartoon, or preparatory drawing, for A Last Supper has also gone on display in the chapel of the Holy Spirit at Sheffield cathedral where it is due to hang for a year. The plan for the the main painting is to repair the damage after the Sheffield show before it goes back to Nailsworth, a place it must return to, said Wadsworth. \u201cThe joy of this painting was that I painted it not as an academic exercise but as a devotional object that lives in a church.\u201d \u2022 Gaze, a retrospective of paintings by Lorna May Wadsworth, is at the Graves gallery, Sheffield, 9 November to 15 February 2020.",

Trinity Hall announced that its governing body had accepted the resignation of Dr Peter Hutchinson, an emeritus fellow, with immediate effect. The college will also undergo a review of its \u201cdecision making processes and an external review of [its] handing of harassment and other disciplinary issues\u201d, according to a statement published on Wednesday. Hutchinson agreed to his permanent exclusion from Trinity Hall in 2017 following allegations that he had breached a ban preventing him from contacting undergraduates. In a statement issued through Cambridge University at the time, he said: \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to publicly apologise to those students.

The decision prompted outrage, with more than 1,400 current and former Trinity Hall and other Cambridge University students, fellows and staff signing an open letter calling for Hutchinson\u2019s removal and a review of how the college handles complaints of sexual misconduct.

It is about standing at a cabinet, hands on a robust, noisy joystick, shoulder-to-shoulder with a rival as you physically jostle for presence in a clash of skill. That is rather hard to replicate at home. You can invest a great deal of money and space into setting up original arcade hardware in your living room. Or you can settle for the legally murky world of \u201cemulation\u201d, running old games on a modern computer with considerable effort.

Salomon was supposed to be forgotten, erased from history, along with the millions of Jews murdered in the 1940s. But after the defeat of Nazi Germany, her father and stepmother \u2013 who in genocide\u2019s lottery survived their daughter \u2013 found a cache of her paintings that included one of the most astonishing autobiographical documents of the 20th century. Before she was put on a train to her death, Salomon had set down everything about herself, her family and her world in a coruscating expressionist comic book that she named Life? or Theatre?</p> <p>To be caught up in Salomon\u2019s modern masterpiece is to meet her, love her \u2013 and mourn her. Through this intimate visual narrative, we come to know Salomon. Today, we commemorate the victims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust\">the Holocaust</a> with monuments: ranks of concrete blocks or libraries of books closed for ever.

We see her parents by the lake where she died, read the terse newspaper report. This was the aunt the artist was named after. In brilliantly compressed gouache paintings that combine rawness with clever perspectives and intercutting, Salomon shows how her parents met in a field hospital and married during the first world war. The scene depicting their honeymoon has three layers on top of each other, with the newlyweds\u2019 feet coming down a red carpet watched by a bell boy, then entering a hotel bedroom \u2013 until finally we glimpse the couple in bed together in the dark.</p> <p>It\u2019s like a storyboard for a Wes Anderson film.

Her telling of Kristallnacht \u2013 the Night of the Broken Glass, in 1938, when Jewish people and property were attacked \u2013 takes just two images. In one, a crowd of tiny people read a giant poster that spits race hate.

Or Theatre? is subtitled a \u201csingspiel\u201d, meaning a light opera, and songs are even specified for many scenes. In one, a singer on a stage belts out a lyric about love and death.

The singer in this crackly recording is Paula Lindberg, a star in Weimar Berlin who would marry Salomon\u2019s father, Albert, a celebrated doctor, after her mother\u2019s death.

      "bodyText": "One of the sharpest aspects of droughts is that the impacts are pretty immediate. In an industry where seasons mean everything, the lack of rain is not something that can be hidden. Yes farmers can eat into their savings or go into more debt, but they can\u2019t reduce their inventories in the same way other businesses can. Last year\u2019s lambs are not able to be stored just in case you need to help boost supply this year. It is why looking at the production of lamb is a very good indicator for monitoring the severity of a drought. The latest figures, released on Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, showed that in September the fewest numbers of lambs were slaughtered in any month since April 2012: The 1.65 million lambs slaughtered in September was 18% down on the record number achieved in May 2018. As expected this drop has been accompanied by a similar fall in the \u201clamb production\u201d (ie the amount of lamb). Thirteen of the past 15 months have seen production below what it was a year earlier. This is a far cry from the 2012-15 period where production constantly grew off the back of good weather conditions: And with this drop in supply the market forces have well and truly kicked in. In the past year, if we exclude tobacco (which is always has the biggest price jumps due to increases in government excise), the item with the biggest price increase was lamb. Of the top 10 biggest price increases, six were related to agriculture: This is a standard occurrence and if we look at the annual price growth of lamb compared with overall inflation over the past 25 years, it is clear when we have been in drought: Fortunately the overall drought conditions have not been as brutal as the early 2000s, when lamb prices on average grew by nearly 30% in 2001. But the big spike in prices since the end of last year shows the impact has well and truly hit the markets. But these periods of drought have also had a cumulative effect on what we choose to eat. When I was growing up in country South Australia, lamb was very much a staple meal; now it is a luxury. Households now consume a lot more chicken than in the past and a lot less lamb. Somewhat interestingly we still spend similar proportions of our weekly shopping on lamb and chicken. The big fall occurred in the 1980s when the ABS estimated household went from spending on average 0.46% of their money each year on lamb to 0.36% by 1992. It now sits at 0.29%. By contrast our spending on poultry has remained steady at around 0.4%. There has also been a massive drop in the level of money we spend on beef each week \u2013 clearly as much due to cultural and health factors as anything. In the 1980s not too many people were worried about red meat consumption in the way it now influences our eating habits: But the lamb and chicken levels seem a bit counterintuitive \u2013 after all, if we are consuming more chicken, why are we not spending a bigger percentage of our money on it? The reason is price. We are still spending about the same per cent of our money on chicken and slightly less on lamb, but what we get for that money has greatly changed. The price of lamb has increased over the past 25 years out of all proportion to other meats. To purchase the same amount of chicken that cost $10 in 1994 you would now need to pay just $13.64 \u2013 a 36% increase over a period where the average male full-time earnings have risen 161% from $659 a week to $1,726. By contrast, to get the same amount of lamb that cost you $10 in 1994, you would now need to outlay $32.26 \u2013 a 222% increase. No other food item has risen by that much over the past 25 years, and the only item that has risen by less than poultry is breakfast cereal. That makes for a profound change in eating habits. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we spent nearly double the amount each week on beef as we did on chicken; now it is almost the same. But with the price of rump steak rarely below $20/kg while you can get a packet of chicken drumsticks for around $6/kg, that means we are eating a lot more chicken. And we are certainly eating a lot less lamb. When droughts hit, the price impacts flow through to the grocery aisle, but we don\u2019t just keep buying the same amount of food \u2013 we adjust. But that does not mean we return once the impact of the drought passes. Indeed, with the number of droughts over the past quarter of a century, the price of lamb has risen dramatically but then barely fallen during good times. And with the growing export market furthering the increase level of demand and thus prices, lamb is one case where the drought has meant farmers have seen record prices. But this has seen households move steadily away from choosing lamb to serve up at dinner time to a point where chicken is closer to our traditional meal.

But when it came time to broker a deal with distributors for theatrical release, parties couldn\u2019t agree.</p> <p>Traditionally, cinemas have demanded a 90-day window between theatrical release and on-demand availability, essentially giving them the first exclusive bite of the revenue pie. But negotiations between the Netflix/Scorsese team and two major US cinema chains, AMC Theatres and Cineplex, fell apart earlier this year when Netflix reportedly wanted that window closed to 45 days at most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\">The Irishman review: Martin Scorsese's finest film for 30 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other major cinema chains in the UK and Europe followed suit. The Irishman is reported to have opened in only eight cinemas in New York and Los Angeles. The trend has also spread to Australia, where the only cinemas to be showing the film will be \u201cindependent\u201d chains such as Dendy and Classic cinemas \u2013 companies that have a stronger market in niche fare than major multiplexes like Village and Hoyts.</p> <p>The Irishman is not the only film to have broken the 90-day rule. Last year\u2019s Oscar-winning Roma, for example, had a three-week run in cinemas before becoming available on Netflix. But whether due to the auteur\u2019s prestige or whether cinemas have hit peak frustration at streaming services\u2019 encroachment on traditional box office revenue, the bite-back from the industry has been sharp.</p> <p>Last week, the president of the US cinema industry association, John Fithian, called the outcome of the negotiations in the US a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/irishman-netflix-theaters.html\">disgrace</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNetflix is facing a challenge to their business model for the first time and missed a strategic opportunity,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-missed-a-strategic-opportunity-irishman-release-theater-chief-says-1251740\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe point of an exclusive theatrical window is for movies to reach their full commercial potential. Netflix chose to artificially limit The Irishman\u2019s theatrical release,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sent a signal to filmmakers that even if you\u2019re Martin Scorsese, you won\u2019t get the wide theatrical release you want through Netflix.\u201d</p> <p>His Australian counterpart, David Seargeant, chairman of the National Association of Cinema Operators (NACO), <a href=\"https://www.if.com.au/theatrical-release-window-in-australia-is-being-challenged/\">told Inside Film in October</a>: \u201cSeveral exhibitors, who are not our members, are taking a short-term view and showing films without an appropriate theatrical season.\u201d</p> <p>If it\u2019s preferable for films funded by streaming companies to go straight to the home, why bother with theatrical release at all? Part of the answer is acclaim: eligibility for major accolades such as the Academy Awards is still tied to first release in cinema. There\u2019s also an aesthetic consideration: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/cannes-is-right-netflix-movies-just-arent-the-same-95866\">films made for TV are structurally different</a> to those made for the proportions of a cinema screen.

      "bodyText": "If there was ever a sign that cinema-going was becoming a niche experience, it must be that a major feature directed by one of the godfathers of modern film will grace only a handful of big screens around the world. Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, a crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, is not the first likely blockbuster to bypass wide theatrical release before heading to the binge-box of home entertainment, but it is perhaps the most notable \u2013 and it\u2019s sparked a coordinated response from cinema operators internationally, who see the rise of the streaming giants as an existential threat. The $159m film and passion project for Scorsese was financed by Netflix after years of languishing in development. The director wrote in the New York Times earlier this week that Netflix \u201calone allowed us to make The Irishman the way we needed to\u201d. But when it came time to broker a deal with distributors for theatrical release, parties couldn\u2019t agree. Traditionally, cinemas have demanded a 90-day window between theatrical release and on-demand availability, essentially giving them the first exclusive bite of the revenue pie. But negotiations between the Netflix/Scorsese team and two major US cinema chains, AMC Theatres and Cineplex, fell apart earlier this year when Netflix reportedly wanted that window closed to 45 days at most. Other major cinema chains in the UK and Europe followed suit. The Irishman is reported to have opened in only eight cinemas in New York and Los Angeles. The trend has also spread to Australia, where the only cinemas to be showing the film will be \u201cindependent\u201d chains such as Dendy and Classic cinemas \u2013 companies that have a stronger market in niche fare than major multiplexes like Village and Hoyts. The Irishman is not the only film to have broken the 90-day rule. Last year\u2019s Oscar-winning Roma, for example, had a three-week run in cinemas before becoming available on Netflix. But whether due to the auteur\u2019s prestige or whether cinemas have hit peak frustration at streaming services\u2019 encroachment on traditional box office revenue, the bite-back from the industry has been sharp. Last week, the president of the US cinema industry association, John Fithian, called the outcome of the negotiations in the US a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. \u201cNetflix is facing a challenge to their business model for the first time and missed a strategic opportunity,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThe point of an exclusive theatrical window is for movies to reach their full commercial potential. Netflix chose to artificially limit The Irishman\u2019s theatrical release,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sent a signal to filmmakers that even if you\u2019re Martin Scorsese, you won\u2019t get the wide theatrical release you want through Netflix.\u201d His Australian counterpart, David Seargeant, chairman of the National Association of Cinema Operators (NACO), told Inside Film in October: \u201cSeveral exhibitors, who are not our members, are taking a short-term view and showing films without an appropriate theatrical season.\u201d If it\u2019s preferable for films funded by streaming companies to go straight to the home, why bother with theatrical release at all? Part of the answer is acclaim: eligibility for major accolades such as the Academy Awards is still tied to first release in cinema. There\u2019s also an aesthetic consideration: films made for TV are structurally different to those made for the proportions of a cinema screen. And for the right films, extraordinary profits can still be made from those public showings \u2013 as Marvel, and its parent company Disney, have shown. Scorsese\u2019s recent comments about the lack of \u201crevelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger\u201d of those massive Marvel films \u2013 opinions he first expressed in October \u2013 were accompanied by a more general lamentation about the state of cinema today. \u201cEvery new Hitchcock picture was an event. To be in a packed house in one of the old theatres watching Rear Window was an extraordinary experience: It was an event created by the chemistry between the audience and the picture itself, and it was electrifying,\u201d Scorsese wrote, while simultaneously acknowledging that filmmakers like himself were hamstrung between wanting to make films for that collective, aesthetic experience of the theatre, while also being required to follow the funding. It\u2019s a justification some smaller cinema operators, many of whom aren\u2019t members of the industry association NACO, have made for showing Netflix\u2019s films, despite the bigger players showing a united front. Australian indie chain Dendy, for example, plans to release other Netflix films \u2013 including The King, Marriage Story and The Two Popes \u2013 ahead of their on-demand release, despite many of them breaking the 90-day window. \u201cConsumers want to see niche and alternative content on our cinema screens,\u201d says Scott Mota from Dendy, explaining their decision to screen the films. But it\u2019s a decision they might not always be able to make. Once the 90-day window breaks and the precedent is set for shorter theatrical runs, cinemas fear their box office takings will suffer \u2013 and so will the chances of many more films making it to the big screen at all.",

There\u2019s a particular thrill to seeing someone perform at a level that seemingly should be beyond them; they can\u2019t yet legally buy a tequila shot but here they are rifling a forehand winner or doing a line at an Oscars after-party. Our hearts swell with vicarious pride. It\u2019s hard though for <em>wunderkinder</em> as grow older, and the precociousness that set them apart evaporates as their contemporaries catch up. Hingis retired aged 22, Ashraful never made good on his promise and was eventually banned for corruption.</p> <p>The point about Litchfield was that another huge talent is on the way for Australian cricket. Add her to the list. The women\u2019s game in this country has burgeoned in the past five years, since the WBBL provided a forum for players and the pay deal of 2017 provided professional contracts. The success is especially evident in the make-up of national squads.</p> <p>The movement is most apparent in comparison with England, the only other national with fully professional women\u2019s contracts. For a long time both line-ups had been very static, with only a handful of top-line players available for selection. The same names were picked regardless of recent results. There was little competition for the best talent. By 2016 Australia started bringing in a few WBBL players ahead of that year\u2019s T20 World Cup, but accelerated that change after losing the final.

      "bodyText": "There was a buzz this season when Phoebe Litchfield started her Big Bash career. A 16-year-old playing a ramp shot for four over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head a few balls into her batting debut. The way she flayed boundaries from Australian national representatives Ash Gardner and Erin Burns. She made 26 that day, then doubled it next game in a big run chase for the Sydney Thunder. Martina Hingis was 16 when she won Wimbledon, Sachin Tendulkar was 16 on Test debut, Mohammad Ashraful was 16 for Bangladesh\u2019s first Test century, and 16 was one of the many ages that Shahid Afridi could have been when he made the then-fastest ODI hundred from 37 balls. Sport, music, writing, art: audiences love prodigies. There\u2019s a particular thrill to seeing someone perform at a level that seemingly should be beyond them; they can\u2019t yet legally buy a tequila shot but here they are rifling a forehand winner or doing a line at an Oscars after-party. Our hearts swell with vicarious pride. It\u2019s hard though for wunderkinder as grow older, and the precociousness that set them apart evaporates as their contemporaries catch up. Hingis retired aged 22, Ashraful never made good on his promise and was eventually banned for corruption. The point about Litchfield was that another huge talent is on the way for Australian cricket. Add her to the list. The women\u2019s game in this country has burgeoned in the past five years, since the WBBL provided a forum for players and the pay deal of 2017 provided professional contracts. The success is especially evident in the make-up of national squads. The movement is most apparent in comparison with England, the only other national with fully professional women\u2019s contracts. For a long time both line-ups had been very static, with only a handful of top-line players available for selection. The same names were picked regardless of recent results. There was little competition for the best talent. By 2016 Australia started bringing in a few WBBL players ahead of that year\u2019s T20 World Cup, but accelerated that change after losing the final. England moved on a couple of older players after a semi-final collapse, but changed very little from then on. If you look at 50-over cricket, still the premium format of the women\u2019s international game, England debuted six players from 2016 to today. Australia debuted 14. England\u2019s Beth Langston, Alice Davidson-Richards, Katie George and Bryony Smith have barely played: eight matches between the five of them. Alex Hartley played 28 but this year lost her national contract this year, while only fellow left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone has played consistently since her debut.

Only Aley would be unlikely, at age 35 with selectors favouring a youth policy, but she is still one of the WBBL\u2019s most parsimonious bowlers and can\u2019t be ruled out.

For Melburnians 2017 was a bad year, with the number of eye injuries caused by magpies rising significantly. This year, a Wollongong cyclist died after he swerved from the path to avoid being swooped by a magpie, hit a fence post and fell to the ground. And the residents of Sydney\u2019s Hills district have been at war with a \u201cparticularly aggressive magpie\u201d that was \u201cterrorising residents\u201d. A council spokesperson said in a statement: \u201c[It was] swooping underneath helmets ... to attack people\u2019s faces. This bird was very aggressive and uncharacteristically territorial.\u201d The council had the magpie shot. Greystanes resident Peter Danieluk said the magpie was responsible for giving him a heart attack last year during a swooping frenzy. \u201cIt just did not stop, even as I was losing consciousness on the ground.\u201d Swoopings tap into an area of deep human vulnerability: attacks to the eye. We\u2019re squeamish about damage to the eye (inflicting it/it being inflicted on us) more so than any other body part. When I did self-defence class and we were told to gouge at the eyes of anyone that tried to rape or assault us, there was visceral ripple of disgust in the room. To gouge out someone\u2019s eyes felt impossible, undoable \u2013 even if it would save our life.

But it\u2019s not just magpies and eyes. Other species can also be scary. Earlier this year Gizmo, a chihuahua, was taken by a seagull in Devon, never to be seen again. Its owner told the BBC: \u201cA seagull swooped down and grabbed him by the scruff of his neck. My partner tried to grab his legs, but he was not tall enough and ... the seagull flew away.\u201d Then there\u2019s the ibis. In an effort to investigate a case I\u2019d heard about of an ibis that stole someone\u2019s tofu from their laksa while lunching in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park, I heard stories about ibises stealing the beef out of someone\u2019s wrap, an ibis stealing a piece of salmon \u201cfrom [my] mouth. Bruised my lip\u201d and an ibis stealing a food blogger\u2019s macaroon as he exited the Zumbo pastry shop in Balmain.

There was no other way to my car \u2013 I had to walk the path. When it became clear that I could lose an eye, I improvised, crawling then later rolling across the lawn to the car. When that didn\u2019t work, I wore a bin over my head and sprinted to the car. It was horrible. I would turn up to my law firm job covered in dirt, and reeking of bin. (Soon after I would lose my job and move to journalism \u2013 proving the adage true that you should dress for the job that you want.) A few years later, the fear of low-flying birds implanted in my subconscious, I was with friends in Cornwall, England. We were at the seaside, each with boxes of fish and chips, ready for a nice relaxing lunch on a bench by the water. Ahead the seagulls circled. Something about them didn\u2019t look right. For a start they were twice the size of Australian seagulls. As we sat on the bench, I warned my friends, \u201cBe careful transferring the chips from the box to your mouth. Maybe bring the box right up to your mouth, like this \u2026 These seagulls look large and nasty.\u201d My friends laughed at me as I demonstrated lifting the box to head-height, sliding a chip through a crack in the box and quickly eating it \u2013 minimising the amount of time the food was in the open. The laughter stopped when I fumbled with closing the box and my food spilled all over me. Arrrghhh! Ouch! No! A dozen large birds materialised and launched themselves at me like missiles. In a brief second, several horrible things happened at once: the food which was too hot, burned into my lap; the birds landed on me, clawing at my clothes and getting purchase on all areas of my body as they fed off the food that was scattered about my person; my friends ran away, leaving me alone on the bench; and my screams attracted the attention of patrons on a restaurant balcony above our bench, some of whom started filming me. I\u2019ll get over it. I\u2019ll have to. It\u2019s their world as well as ours \u2013 and occasionally they\u2019ll let us know who\u2019s boss. \u2022 Vote for your favourite bird in the poll",

Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that police in New South Wales have strip-searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds, in the past three years. The shocking figures come as the state\u2019s police watchdog investigates the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018 and have led to calls from the Redfern Legal Centre \u2013 which first obtained the data \u2013 for a ban on strip-searching minors unless a court order is obtained. In 2011, Madz Piper, now 23 and living in Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast, was taken to a Sydney police station after a minor incident.

The inquiry heard some officers at the festival were not aware of their obligations in relation to the search of minors, and one senior constable admitted that all 19 of the searches he conducted may have been illegal. Last week the LECC revealed it investigated six separate allegations of misuse of strip-search powers by police last year. After the Guardian revealed on Wednesday that 122 minors including two 12-year-olds had been strip-searched in the last three years, the NSW police minister, David Elliott, said he \u201cwould want\u201d officers to strip-search his children if they were suspected of breaking the law.",

Ursula von der Leyen has written to the prime minister asking him to propose a British candidate or candidates for EU commissioner \u201crapidly, in the shortest time possible\u201d, one of her spokespeople said on Wednesday.

The novel follows a soldier who bonds with a labrador called Jack during the conflict, but is ordered to leave the dog behind, along with thousands of others, when the US military pulls out. The film-makers will use pre-existing film and photographs to create a \u201cfull body\u201d CGI version of Dean, with another actor providing his voice. Ernst told the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cWe searched high and low for the perfect character to portray the role \u2026 which has some extreme complex character arcs, and after months of research, we decided on James Dean.\u201d \u201cWe feel very honoured that his family supports us and will take every precaution to ensure that his legacy as one of the most epic film stars to date is kept firmly intact. The family views this as his fourth movie, a movie he never got to make. We do not intend to let his fans down.\u201d Dean died aged 24 in 1955 after crashing his Porsche Spyder in California, having completed three lead roles in major films: East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant, the last two of which were released posthumously.",

Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p> \n<p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever.

      "bodyText": "Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future. Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; now there are 15. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city \u2013 and it\u2019s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road. When we started Guardian Cities in 2014, many of the stories we reported, on topics such as gentrification and car use, were ultimately about division and inequality \u2013 and that was before the votes for Donald Trump and for Brexit upended the US and UK, the war in Syria sparked an unprecedented migration crisis, and climate change finally seized the imagination of those who realised that it was likely to be the poor who suffered most. Divided Cities is the result of that reckoning \u2013 a new global documentary series of five stories, from five cities around the world, that reflect these major faultlines in surprising and troubling ways. Over the last 12 months our team \u2013 Guardian executive producer Jess Gormley, producer Anetta Jones, film-maker Max Duncan and myself \u2013 worked with our contacts around the world to identify what we believe to be some of the more vital and startling ways cities are divided today.

Democratic governor Ralph Northam will now have scope to press ahead with legislation such as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/30/20689359/gun-control-virginia-november-election\">tighter gun control</a> in the state.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to officially declare today, November 5 2019, that Virginia is officially blue,\u201d Northam, told a crowd of supporters in Richmond.</p> \n<p>In Kentucky, which Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in the 2016 election, Andy Beshear \u2013 the Democratic challenger to unpopular incumbent governor Matt Bevin \u2013 declared victory as he was narrowly ahead of the Republican, who has refused to concede in a race that was still too close officially to call on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>\u201cTonight voters in Kentucky sent a message loud and clear for everyone to hear. It\u2019s a message that says our elections don\u2019t have to be about right versus left, they are still about right versus wrong,\u201d Beshear said.</p> \n<p>The brightest spot for Republicans came was in the Mississippi\u2019s governor\u2019s race, where Democrat Jim Hood, the state\u2019s attorney general, ran a competitive, but ultimately unsuccessful, race against Republican Tate Reeves, the lieutenant governor.</p> \n<p>Yet a year before the presidential election, the results offered warning signs for both parties. Voters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/democrats-2020-election-suburbs-battle\">suburban swaths of Kentucky and Virginia sided with Democrats</a>, a trend that would complicate Trump\u2019s path to re-election in 2020 if it holds. And the Democrats who made gains in Tuesday\u2019s election did so by largely avoiding positions such as the government-run healthcare plan \u201cMedicare for All\u201d that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/democrats-progressive-moderate-strategy\">animated the party\u2019s left flank</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/01/elizabeth-warren-healthcare-plan-taxes\">Democratic presidential primary race</a>.</p> \n<p>The elections also offered insight into Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans as he battles an accelerating impeachment inquiry. Democratic-aligned groups pumped huge amounts of money into the contests as a way to test-drive messaging and campaigns ahead of the 2020 election, particularly on gun control and clean energy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/democrats-2020-election-suburbs-battle\">Why the battle for the suburbs is Democrats\u2019 key to winning 2020</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Beshear declared himself the winner in Kentucky after securing 49.2% of the vote to Bevin\u2019s 48.8%.

      "bodyText": "Democrats have won control of Virginia\u2019s state legislature for the first time in a generation, while the Democratic candidate for governor of Kentucky also claimed victory in what could be a huge double blow to Donald Trump one year out from the 2020 election. The Democratic party prevailed in both the state house and senate in Virginia, a state often viewed as a \u201cbellwether\u201d for national politics and a battleground in presidential elections. Democratic governor Ralph Northam will now have scope to press ahead with legislation such as tighter gun control in the state. \u201cI\u2019m here to officially declare today, November 5 2019, that Virginia is officially blue,\u201d Northam, told a crowd of supporters in Richmond. In Kentucky, which Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in the 2016 election, Andy Beshear \u2013 the Democratic challenger to unpopular incumbent governor Matt Bevin \u2013 declared victory as he was narrowly ahead of the Republican, who has refused to concede in a race that was still too close officially to call on Wednesday morning. \u201cTonight voters in Kentucky sent a message loud and clear for everyone to hear. It\u2019s a message that says our elections don\u2019t have to be about right versus left, they are still about right versus wrong,\u201d Beshear said. The brightest spot for Republicans came was in the Mississippi\u2019s governor\u2019s race, where Democrat Jim Hood, the state\u2019s attorney general, ran a competitive, but ultimately unsuccessful, race against Republican Tate Reeves, the lieutenant governor. Yet a year before the presidential election, the results offered warning signs for both parties. Voters in suburban swaths of Kentucky and Virginia sided with Democrats, a trend that would complicate Trump\u2019s path to re-election in 2020 if it holds. And the Democrats who made gains in Tuesday\u2019s election did so by largely avoiding positions such as the government-run healthcare plan \u201cMedicare for All\u201d that have animated the party\u2019s left flank in the Democratic presidential primary race. The elections also offered insight into Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans as he battles an accelerating impeachment inquiry. Democratic-aligned groups pumped huge amounts of money into the contests as a way to test-drive messaging and campaigns ahead of the 2020 election, particularly on gun control and clean energy. Beshear declared himself the winner in Kentucky after securing 49.2% of the vote to Bevin\u2019s 48.8%. As of late Tuesday night, Beshear led Bevin by a margin of more than 5,000 votes. But Bevin, who took the stage at the Republican party across town, called it a \u201cclose, close race\u201d and said he was not conceding \u201cby any stretch\u201d. \u201cWe want the process to be followed, and there is a process,\u201d he said. Bevin was elected in 2015 and had portrayed this election as a referendum on Trump, who stumped for the governor at a rally in Kentucky on Monday night and called Beshear \u201ctoo liberal, too extreme and too dangerous\u201d. At the rally, Trump told the crowd: \u201cIf you lose, it sends a really bad message \u2026 you can\u2019t let that happen to me.\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, sought to frame the Kentucky outcome as a net positive for Trump. \u201cThe president just about dragged Gov Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end.\u201d In a late-night tweet after results came in, Trump appeared to concede the Republican may have lost: \u201c@MattBevin picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!).\u201d A bullish Bevin had told the New York Times last month that he anticipated winning the election by between six and 10 points. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be shocked at how uncompetitive this actually is,\u201d he told the paper at the time. But while Trump won Kentucky with more than 60% of the vote in 2016 and remains popular in the state, with Republicans in other races there doing well on Tuesday, Bevin \u2013 who polls as one of America\u2019s most unpopular governors \u2013 could not ride that popularity to victory. Beshear, the state\u2019s attorney general and the son of Kentucky\u2019s last Democratic governor, made public education the cornerstone of his campaign, choosing a public high school assistant principal as his running mate and accusing Bevin of bullying schoolteachers who protested against proposed pension reforms. Bevin, who accused protesting teachers of acting \u201cthuggish\u201d and said school closures as a result of their actions would lead to children suffering sexual abuse and ingesting poison, said he did not regret his words. Beshear promised he would never bully anybody as governor. Bevin, meanwhile, fought on broader, national and cultural issues, highlighting his relationship with Trump and his support for the second amendment, while touting himself as the \u201cmost pro-life\u201d governor in America. While Bevin performed well in much of the state, in parts of Kentucky\u2019s largest city, Louisville, one could drive by dozens if not hundreds of \u201cStop Bevin \u2013 Vote Beshear!\u201d yard signs before passing any sign of support for the Republican. At the Democrats\u2019 election party at an event center in the predominantly African American Louisville neighbourhood of Smoketown, the mood turned from nervous to jovial as returns showed Beshear taking the lead. \u201cWe\u2019re off the bus, Bevin is out of here,\u201d said Jennifer Leano, 49, as she left the Beshear celebration. \u201cAfter he insulted the teachers, Bevin dug his own grave.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s race was one of several closely watched elections in states across the US on Tuesday. Republican Daniel Cameron made history in a resounding win in Kentucky\u2019s election for attorney general, becoming the first African American to win the office. Trump rallied Republican voters on Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, which he lost in 2016. Democrats have pledged that when they take power, they will pass an agenda that Republicans have blocked for years, including stricter gun laws, a higher minimum wage and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.",

      "bodyText": "Civil servants in Zimbabwe are demanding higher pay as economic conditions in the southern African country continue to deteriorate. Growing discontent in the public sector is a further challenge to the government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa as it struggles to battle soaring inflation, collapsing confidence in the country\u2019s multiple currencies, the effects of an acute drought and rolling power cuts. A small group of civil servants marched in Harare, the capital, on Wednesday. Authorities allowed the demonstration but deployed a heavy police presence. Organisers of the protest talked about \u201ca real crisis of existence\u201d. David Dzatsunga, the secretary general of the Apex Council, a grouping of government workers\u2019 unions representing 230,000 employees, said civil servants should be described as \u201ccivil slaves\u201d. \u201cNo matter what happens, we have made a statement as civil servants [today] that we are dying and we are dying slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cEven others who were supposed to march with us in solidarity cannot come. I don\u2019t know what we should do. I think our conversations must now be around what is it we should do as workers in this country. Our situation is dire.\u201d Inflation in Zimbabwe has reached 175% and basic goods \u2013 including food and medicine \u2013 are increasingly rare. Fuel prices have quadrupled since the start of the year. Obert Masaraure, leader of Artuz, which represents rural teachers, said that many of his union\u2019s members earned less than US$40 (\u00a331) per month, barely enough to buy flour, sugar and cooking oil for a family of four. \u201cOur members are severely incapacitated. They can\u2019t afford the basics,\u201d Masaraure said. Mnangagwa took power after Robert Mugabe, the former president, was ousted in a military takeover nearly two years ago. Mnangagwa, a former spy chief, won a disputed election in 2018 with a pledge to revive the economy, tackle widespread corruption and end the country\u2019s international isolation. The government has launched a series of initiatives aimed at bolstering the economy, and earlier this week the Zimbabwe anti-corruption commission (Zacc) detained a cabinet minister for abuse of office alleged to have cost the government $3.7m. Officials at the commission said further arrests could be expected. However, Mnangagwa has been either unable or unwilling to push through measures that might have convinced investors and multilateral institutions to provide the funds to resuscitate the economy. A spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party, said the graft charges were a \u2018publicity stunt\u2019. In an attempt to break a strike by medical staff, who also want a pay rise, the government fired 77 doctors earlier this week. Piers Pigou, an expert at the International Crisis Group, said the move was aimed at making clear that protest would have consequences. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear factor involved. The government clampdown on doctors is intended to send a message. People are hunkering down. It\u2019s all survival at the moment,\u201d Pigou said. Many of the economic problems are a legacy of decades of mismanagement under Mugabe, who died in September. The rising prices reminded many of the economic collapse a decade ago, when hyperinflation emptied shelves of basic foodstuffs and led the country to abandon its currency. In January, Mnangagwa announced an increase in fuel prices of more than 100%, triggering widespread protests that left at least 17 people dead and scores injured when soldiers opened fire on the strikers. The situation in rural areas is particularly bad, aid workers in Zimbabwe said, though there is growing evidence of widespread malnutrition in cities too. A government document early this year said about 7.5 million people \u2013 about half of the country\u2019s population \u2013 in both rural and urban areas would require emergency food aid between February 2019 and March next year.

      "bodyText": "Labour has blocked the leftwing campaigner Chris Williamson from standing as a candidate in the general election after he was suspended over accusations he had downplayed antisemitism in the party. The MP for Derby North was one of three former Labour MPs who were told they will not stand as candidates following a day-long meeting of the party\u2019s ruling body. A decision has not yet been made by the national executive committee (NEC) on the future of the former minister Keith Vaz, who was given an unprecedented six-month ban from parliament for offering to buy cocaine for sex workers and obstructing inquiries by the standards commissioner. He is one of six prospective candidates who will face questions this week from an NEC endorsement panel, consisting of three NEC members, before the party decides whether they can stand. It comes amid mounting criticism of the party over its decision to allow Vaz to keep the party\u2019s whip and membership, despite a damning verdict from the Labour-led standards committee. Martin Bell, the anti-sleaze campaigner who unseated the scandal-hit Tory MP Neil Hamilton in Tatton in 1997, told the Guardian he would endorse a local independent candidate if Labour chooses to allow Vaz to run. \u201cI saw the behaviour of Vaz for myself during a standards and privileges committee inquiry when I was an MP. I think it would be important for someone to take a stand against him if Labour let him run as their candidate,\u201d he said. Bell, a former war reporter known for his white suit, stood against Hamilton after the Guardian accused the Tory MP of taking \u201ccash for questions\u201d from Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods. Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the NEC was made up of representatives of unions, MPs and party members. It had endorsed about 600 candidates out of 632 by the early evening. Williamson was suspended in February after he was recorded on video telling a meeting that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d over antisemitism allegations that had led to the party being \u201cdemonised\u201d. He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning after a hearing of an NEC antisemitism panel in June, prompting an outcry from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. He was suspended again in July. Labour also imposed a separate suspension on 3 September over additional allegations of misconduct. Last month, Williamson lost a high court bid to be reinstated to the party. The Jarrow MP, Stephen Hepburn, was also kicked off the party\u2019s candidates\u2019 list over allegations of sexual harassment. Hepburn, 59, allegedly targeted a female party member in her 20s at an Indian restaurant 14 years ago, according to HuffPost. The Labour party has referred the case to its ultimate disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee. Hepburn has previously said he \u201ccompletely refutes\u201d the allegation. Roger Godsiff, the Birmingham Hall Green MP, has also been dropped as a candidate, although he never lost the Labour whip, a source confirmed. Godsiff faced a re-selection battle after Labour members demanded a trigger ballot in his constituency following a row over his support for demonstrators against LGBT equality lessons in a Birmingham primary school. Godsiff declined to comment. Hepburn and Williamson have been approached for a comment. Diane Abbott was among NEC members calling for Vaz to stand down.

And the Indonesian version, <em>nasi goreng</em>, is right up there in the top tier \u2013 \u201cone of the world\u2019s great comfort foods\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rick-stein\" title=\"\">Rick Stein</a>, who developed a taste for it while filming there with a crew who apparently preferred to start the day with a full English. <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/06/nasi-goreng-recipe.html\" title=\"\">Jakarta-born food writer Pat Tanumihardja explains that it\u2019s the use of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/06/nasi-goreng-recipe.html\" title=\"\">kecap manis</a></em><a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/06/nasi-goreng-recipe.html\" title=\"\"> (Indonesian soy sauce) and </a><em><a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/06/nasi-goreng-recipe.html\" title=\"\">terasi</a></em><a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/06/nasi-goreng-recipe.html\" title=\"\"> (Indonesian shrimp paste)</a> that \u201csets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you\u2019ll see in other countries\u201d.</p> <p>Not that there\u2019s just one version of nasi goreng, obviously; a country made up of more than 14,000 islands contains multitudes in this respect as much as any other: there\u2019s <em>nasi goreng kambing</em> with mutton, <em>nasi goreng ayam</em> with chicken, and <em>nasi goreng gila</em>, or <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/a-love-letter-to-nasi-goreng-jakarta\" title=\"\">crazy fried rice, which can apparently contain anything the cook happens to have to hand</a>, from corned beef to sausages. But for those of us without easy access to Indonesia\u2019s many night markets and street stalls, what\u2019s the best way to make it at home?</p> <h2>The rice</h2> <p>Clearly, the most important ingredient, and all the recipes I try call for <a href=\"http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/18/types-of-rice.html\" title=\"\">long-grained varieties</a>, occasionally basmati, but more often jasmine, which goes slightly sticky when cooked, making it easier to eat. That should, in theory, also make it less satisfactory for stir-frying, but actually, as long as you break up any clumps beforehand, this tacky plumpness makes for a very alluring texture. So, though you can use just about any rice you like, jasmine is my preference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd9373a5b4625c905a8bbfe3a70375f0474029c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd9373a5b4625c905a8bbfe3a70375f0474029c5/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Tanumihardja\u2019s nasi goreng: it\u2019s the kecap manis and shrimp paste that \u2018sets nasi goreng apart\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat Tanumihardja\u2019s nasi goreng: it\u2019s the kecap manis and shrimp paste that \u2018sets nasi goreng apart\u2019. Thumbnails: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prevailing wisdom with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/05/how-do-you-make-chinese-takeaway-style-fried-rice\" title=\"\">fried rice</a> is that you need to let the rice cool completely first, with Tanumihardja recommending using day-old rice for this purpose, and Indonesian food writer and cook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/ofm-classic-cookbook-sri-owen-the-rice-book-bee-wilson\" title=\"\">Sri Owen telling readers of her Rice Book</a> to let it cool for at least two hours before use. Some recipes, however, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/meera-sodhas-recipe-for-sprout-nasi-goreng\" title=\"\">Meera Sodha\u2019s in East</a>, use freshly cooked rice \u2013 and, to my surprise, this works just fine. As Serious Eats\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fried-rice-chinese-thai-wok-technique-right-type-of-rice.html\" title=\"\">J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt</a>, who has investigated the subject with characteristic rigour, explains, as cooked rice ages, it dries out, which means it\u2019ll fry more quickly and is less likely to stick together \u2013 he recommends leaving it under a fan for an hour, but says even freshly cooked rice spread out on a tray to cool slightly before use is superior to drier, day-old rice, which has a tendency to go hard and chewy in a hot wok. Personally, I rather like a few rogue, crunchy grains, but still, it\u2019s good to know that a sudden craving for fried rice isn\u2019t necessarily a hiding to disappointment.</p> <h2>The fat</h2> <p>Owen uses a mixture of oil and butter, which is hard to prevent burning at such a high heat. If you\u2019d like butter in there \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t seem to be common, as far as I can tell \u2013 add it at the end: a neutral oil seems the best bet for stir-frying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a172e37c2326116082791b20f3dc48f1cad606cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a172e37c2326116082791b20f3dc48f1cad606cf/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sri Owen\u2019s version: if you are going to add meat or seafood, cook it through first, is Owen\u2019s advice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sri Owen\u2019s version: if you are going to add meat or seafood, cook it through first, is Owen\u2019s advice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The base</h2> <p>Almost every recipe starts with some sort of onion \u2013 whether yellow, as in Owen\u2019s version and <a href=\"https://www.wanderlust.co.uk/content/indonesian-nasi-goreng-recipe/\" title=\"\">Eleanor Ford\u2019s in Fire Islands</a>; red as in Sodha\u2019s; or shallots as in <a href=\"https://gastronomictravels.com/recipe/nasi-goreng-a-la-rick-stein/\" title=\"\">Rick Stein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/australia/bbc-good-food/20180823/282020443137473\" title=\"\">Jennifer Joyce</a> and Tanumihardja\u2019s recipes \u2013 and garlic. My testers and I like the sweetness of the shallots, but red onion makes a good substitute, with some fresh spring onion stirred in at the end as in Ford, Stein and <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/recipe/nasi-goreng-recipe\" title=\"\">Anissa Helou</a>\u2019s recipes.</p> <p>Chillies are also vital, both medium and mild and small and vicious, though Tanumihardja suggests stirring in some <em>sambal oelek</em>, or tangy Indonesian chilli paste instead. Helou makes her own <em>sambal bajak</em>, a brick-red mixture of fried chillies, shallots, palm sugar, bay leaves, lemongrass, galangal, tamarind and nutmeg, which gives her dish a lovely, warm sweetness. Stein, meanwhile, gives us a recipe that starts with a Balinese spice paste made from pepper, nutmeg, candlenuts, sesame seeds, shallots, ginger, galangal, turmeric, (pauses for breath) lemongrass, garlic, chillies, shrimp paste, palm sugar, salt, lime juice and oil.</p> <p>Fortunately, my lovely accountant recently brought me back from Malaysia a gift of <a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/candlenuts\" title=\"\">candlenuts</a>, which look deceptively like macadamias but are toxic raw \u2013 and, perhaps unsurprisingly, can be hard to source in this country \u2013 and this feels like the perfect excuse to use some of them up. The results are deliciously aromatic \u2013 a real special-occasion dish \u2013 but it can\u2019t be denied that these may not be ingredients that everyone will have to hand, and as this is essentially a way with leftovers for most home cooks, I\u2019m going to pare it back to the essentials, while keeping the paste idea, which seems to distribute the flavours better through the rice than chopped ingredients. Shallots, chilli, garlic and shrimp paste feel like the cornerstones; add other ingredients as you fancy \u2013 and note that <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ej3cNgbF90gC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=jane+grigson+nasi+goreng&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ht0UbK4n3z&amp;sig=ACfU3U1J810ZNNtgYBnoeYeTyILCCUaTpQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFkPDW4Z7lAhXMbVAKHerpAMQQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jane%20grigson%20nasi%20goreng&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Jane Grigson includes a recipe using anchovies instead of shrimp paste in her Fruit Book</a>, which may sound unlikely, especially in combination with her banana garnish, but actually works surprisingly well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bdb9d40848dba9c6c84332b149016ba047fb6e5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdb9d40848dba9c6c84332b149016ba047fb6e5b/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Grigson\u2019s effort uses strips of omelette rather than a fired egg mixed in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Grigson\u2019s take on nasi goreng uses strips of omelette rather than the more common fried egg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://food52.com/blog/16102-indonesia-s-favorite-condiment-how-to-make-and-use-it-yourself\" title=\"\">Kecap manis</a></em>, a sweet, thick soy sauce, is, as Tanumihardja observes, a must, though you could use dark soy sauce and sugar if you can\u2019t find it, and most recipes also include some light soy sauce, too, for a more salty, savoury note. Some recipes include an acid as well \u2013 Sodha goes for white-wine vinegar, Helou for tamarind and Stein for lime juice \u2013 but I find the oily starchiness of the rice more comforting without. Tomatoes are also a possibility, generally in the form of puree, though Owen allows for ketchup as an alternative, which also ticks the sweet-and-sour box, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.</p> <h2>Eggs</h2> <p>Almost all the recipes come garnished with a fried egg (which is why nasi goreng is the best of all fried rices). But some also incorporate eggs in other forms: Grigson goes for strips of omelette, while Helou cracks an egg directly into the wok, explaining that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/williamwongsokuliner/\" title=\"\">William Wongso</a>, Indonesia\u2019s foremost celebrity chef, reckons it must brown on the base \u201cto release the aroma\u201d before adding the rice. I\u2019m with him; egg-fried rice is never a bad idea.</p> <h2>The meat and 10 veg</h2> <p>Helou writes in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feast-9781526602862.html\" title=\"\">her book Feast</a> that \u201cyou can add what you want to the rice, but traditionally it is made simply with spring onions and fresh chillies and served for breakfast with a fried egg\u201d. As Owen notes, if you are going to add meat or seafood, as Stein does with his chicken and prawns, and Grigson with her ham (definitely non-traditional in a country that\u2019s 87.7% Muslim), it\u2019s best to cook it through first. That way, you don\u2019t overcook the other ingredients.

      "bodyText": "Though there are many worthy contenders for the title, all right-thinking people surely agree that fried rice is the very best kind of rice. And the Indonesian version, nasi goreng, is right up there in the top tier \u2013 \u201cone of the world\u2019s great comfort foods\u201d, according to Rick Stein, who developed a taste for it while filming there with a crew who apparently preferred to start the day with a full English. Jakarta-born food writer Pat Tanumihardja explains that it\u2019s the use of kecap manis (Indonesian soy sauce) and terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste) that \u201csets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you\u2019ll see in other countries\u201d. Not that there\u2019s just one version of nasi goreng, obviously; a country made up of more than 14,000 islands contains multitudes in this respect as much as any other: there\u2019s nasi goreng kambing with mutton, nasi goreng ayam with chicken, and nasi goreng gila, or crazy fried rice, which can apparently contain anything the cook happens to have to hand, from corned beef to sausages. But for those of us without easy access to Indonesia\u2019s many night markets and street stalls, what\u2019s the best way to make it at home? The rice Clearly, the most important ingredient, and all the recipes I try call for long-grained varieties, occasionally basmati, but more often jasmine, which goes slightly sticky when cooked, making it easier to eat. That should, in theory, also make it less satisfactory for stir-frying, but actually, as long as you break up any clumps beforehand, this tacky plumpness makes for a very alluring texture. So, though you can use just about any rice you like, jasmine is my preference. The prevailing wisdom with fried rice is that you need to let the rice cool completely first, with Tanumihardja recommending using day-old rice for this purpose, and Indonesian food writer and cook Sri Owen telling readers of her Rice Book to let it cool for at least two hours before use. Some recipes, however, such as Meera Sodha\u2019s in East, use freshly cooked rice \u2013 and, to my surprise, this works just fine. As Serious Eats\u2019 J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt, who has investigated the subject with characteristic rigour, explains, as cooked rice ages, it dries out, which means it\u2019ll fry more quickly and is less likely to stick together \u2013 he recommends leaving it under a fan for an hour, but says even freshly cooked rice spread out on a tray to cool slightly before use is superior to drier, day-old rice, which has a tendency to go hard and chewy in a hot wok. Personally, I rather like a few rogue, crunchy grains, but still, it\u2019s good to know that a sudden craving for fried rice isn\u2019t necessarily a hiding to disappointment. The fat Owen uses a mixture of oil and butter, which is hard to prevent burning at such a high heat. If you\u2019d like butter in there \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t seem to be common, as far as I can tell \u2013 add it at the end: a neutral oil seems the best bet for stir-frying. The base Almost every recipe starts with some sort of onion \u2013 whether yellow, as in Owen\u2019s version and Eleanor Ford\u2019s in Fire Islands; red as in Sodha\u2019s; or shallots as in Rick Stein, Jennifer Joyce and Tanumihardja\u2019s recipes \u2013 and garlic. My testers and I like the sweetness of the shallots, but red onion makes a good substitute, with some fresh spring onion stirred in at the end as in Ford, Stein and Anissa Helou\u2019s recipes. Chillies are also vital, both medium and mild and small and vicious, though Tanumihardja suggests stirring in some sambal oelek, or tangy Indonesian chilli paste instead. Helou makes her own sambal bajak, a brick-red mixture of fried chillies, shallots, palm sugar, bay leaves, lemongrass, galangal, tamarind and nutmeg, which gives her dish a lovely, warm sweetness. Stein, meanwhile, gives us a recipe that starts with a Balinese spice paste made from pepper, nutmeg, candlenuts, sesame seeds, shallots, ginger, galangal, turmeric, (pauses for breath) lemongrass, garlic, chillies, shrimp paste, palm sugar, salt, lime juice and oil. Fortunately, my lovely accountant recently brought me back from Malaysia a gift of candlenuts, which look deceptively like macadamias but are toxic raw \u2013 and, perhaps unsurprisingly, can be hard to source in this country \u2013 and this feels like the perfect excuse to use some of them up. The results are deliciously aromatic \u2013 a real special-occasion dish \u2013 but it can\u2019t be denied that these may not be ingredients that everyone will have to hand, and as this is essentially a way with leftovers for most home cooks, I\u2019m going to pare it back to the essentials, while keeping the paste idea, which seems to distribute the flavours better through the rice than chopped ingredients. Shallots, chilli, garlic and shrimp paste feel like the cornerstones; add other ingredients as you fancy \u2013 and note that Jane Grigson includes a recipe using anchovies instead of shrimp paste in her Fruit Book, which may sound unlikely, especially in combination with her banana garnish, but actually works surprisingly well. Kecap manis, a sweet, thick soy sauce, is, as Tanumihardja observes, a must, though you could use dark soy sauce and sugar if you can\u2019t find it, and most recipes also include some light soy sauce, too, for a more salty, savoury note. Some recipes include an acid as well \u2013 Sodha goes for white-wine vinegar, Helou for tamarind and Stein for lime juice \u2013 but I find the oily starchiness of the rice more comforting without. Tomatoes are also a possibility, generally in the form of puree, though Owen allows for ketchup as an alternative, which also ticks the sweet-and-sour box, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. Eggs Almost all the recipes come garnished with a fried egg (which is why nasi goreng is the best of all fried rices). But some also incorporate eggs in other forms: Grigson goes for strips of omelette, while Helou cracks an egg directly into the wok, explaining that William Wongso, Indonesia\u2019s foremost celebrity chef, reckons it must brown on the base \u201cto release the aroma\u201d before adding the rice. I\u2019m with him; egg-fried rice is never a bad idea. The meat and 10 veg Helou writes in her book Feast that \u201cyou can add what you want to the rice, but traditionally it is made simply with spring onions and fresh chillies and served for breakfast with a fried egg\u201d. As Owen notes, if you are going to add meat or seafood, as Stein does with his chicken and prawns, and Grigson with her ham (definitely non-traditional in a country that\u2019s 87.7% Muslim), it\u2019s best to cook it through first. That way, you don\u2019t overcook the other ingredients. However, some vegetables can be added straight to the wok, as long as they\u2019re chopped up fairly small: I try recipes using mushrooms, carrots, green beans and even, to my utter joy, shredded Brussels sprouts (thanks, Meera!). I can confirm that, as long as it will cook in time, this is an infinitely generous dish, ready to welcome with open arms almost anything you throw into it. The garnish Fried eggs are the classic choice, but sliced cucumber and tomato are also popular, the cucumber in particular adding a soothing crunch. Prawn crackers are also sometimes used as a secondary piece of cutlery. Crispy shallots, of the kind sold in south-east Asian food stores, are a great idea. Grigson\u2019s salted peanuts and banana are perhaps more leftfield choices, but as I have not, as yet, been lucky enough to visit Indonesia, I\u2019m unable to pronounce on their popularity in the field, so I\u2019ll just say anchovies and banana is not a combination I\u2019m keen to repeat.

We have given quite a few of our young lads the chance to play and they have all acquitted themselves very well.\u201d That policy may change in the knockout stages next year, especially if United find there is too much ground to make up in the league. United won the Europa League under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2017 and with the club currently 10th in the Premier League the competition could once again be their most realistic route to Champions League participation. \u201cIt\u2019s one route into the Champions League,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cWe are not about to give up on the other one at the beginning of November. It is still too early for anyone to predict the final league table. At the moment we don\u2019t have as many points as we would like but things can change very quickly.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r believes the return of Anthony Martial has made a difference and hopes to have more of his more experienced players back from injury after the international break. \u201cAnthony is a vital player for us, he\u2019s got different attributes to the rest of our attacking players,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe holds the ball up well for us on the pitch, for example, but he\u2019s been missed in training as well. When he\u2019s in a good mood he really lifts the atmosphere.\u201d Ashley Young claims Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s enthusiasm is equally important in that regard. \u201cHe\u2019s very positive,\u201d said United\u2019s likely captain on Thursday. \u201cSometimes in training you feel he wants to put his boots on and join in. We like that, but we don\u2019t let him.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the face of it, 15-year-old Matty is not like many children in care in North Yorkshire. He has a part-time job, goes to college, and plans to study A-levels. But a few weeks ago he was kicked out of his family home after being arrested for possession of a knife.</p> \n<p>The teenager, who had never previously been in trouble with the police, was taken into care and placed temporarily with a family friend until he can be found somewhere permanent to live. Care workers also want to steer him away from a troublesome group of friends.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe is on the edge,\u201d said Jezz Pratt, a former police officer turned children\u2019s worker. \u201cThe next two to three months are going to be crucial for him. He\u2019s one of those where you could see him in five or six years and he\u2019s happy with a house and a job.\u201d Or, he adds, Matty could be yet another looked-after child who ends up homeless or involved in serious criminality.</p> \n<p>Matty is one of 66 children in care in North Yorkshire who are part of a pioneering scheme that aims to stop the \u201csystemic problem\u201d of the criminalisation of looked-after children. Those living in care are 15 times more likely to be criminalised than other children, according to <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/news/criminalisation-of-children-in-residential-care-should-be-a-national-concern/\">research</a> by the Howard League for Penal Reform. Often, looked-after children are prosecuted over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/06/vulnerable-children-care-home-to-court\">minor incidents</a> that would never warrant police action if they happened in family homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c340f590-e142-40ae-b1e7-8b060b68dbdb\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Children in the dock is an investigation into the youth justice system in England and Wales, which in 2018 saw 26,881 children aged 10-17 cautioned or convicted of crimes ranging from shoplifting and joyriding to rape and robbery.</p>\n    <p>No other EU country puts such young children on trial. Most other nations do not use an adversarial system which can see children separated from their parents and lawyers via bulletproof glass in what is essentially an adult courtroom with a different sign on the door.</p>\n    <p>Officially, the focus in youth courts is on rehabilitation, tackling the underlying causes of youth offending. But although there has been an 88% drop in the number of children cautioned or convicted since 2007, reoffending rates have increased. Just over 40% of children who go to court reoffend within a year; for those sent to youth custody, that figure rises to 71.6%.</p>\n    <p>Children who end up in trouble now are disproportionately likely to be of black, Asian or minority ethnicity. They are vastly more likely to be in care and they are extremely likely to have ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and communication difficulties. This series examines how the court system deals with these vulnerable children and explores whether there is a better way to break the cycle of offending and help them build productive and fulfilling lives.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The North Yorkshire initiative, called <a href=\"https://www.northyorks.gov.uk/no-wrong-door\">No Wrong Door</a>, is based on a dedicated team of specialists including a police officer, a clinical psychologist and a speech and language therapist who are based at each of the region\u2019s two council-run children\u2019s homes, in Scarborough and Harrogate.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, 15-year-old Matty is not like many children in care in North Yorkshire. He has a part-time job, goes to college, and plans to study A-levels. But a few weeks ago he was kicked out of his family home after being arrested for possession of a knife. The teenager, who had never previously been in trouble with the police, was taken into care and placed temporarily with a family friend until he can be found somewhere permanent to live. Care workers also want to steer him away from a troublesome group of friends. \u201cHe is on the edge,\u201d said Jezz Pratt, a former police officer turned children\u2019s worker. \u201cThe next two to three months are going to be crucial for him. He\u2019s one of those where you could see him in five or six years and he\u2019s happy with a house and a job.\u201d Or, he adds, Matty could be yet another looked-after child who ends up homeless or involved in serious criminality. Matty is one of 66 children in care in North Yorkshire who are part of a pioneering scheme that aims to stop the \u201csystemic problem\u201d of the criminalisation of looked-after children. Those living in care are 15 times more likely to be criminalised than other children, according to research by the Howard League for Penal Reform. Often, looked-after children are prosecuted over minor incidents that would never warrant police action if they happened in family homes. The North Yorkshire initiative, called No Wrong Door, is based on a dedicated team of specialists including a police officer, a clinical psychologist and a speech and language therapist who are based at each of the region\u2019s two council-run children\u2019s homes, in Scarborough and Harrogate. There are no uniforms, no suits and no appointments \u2013 the professionals have a mentor-like relationship with the children based on informal chats over breakfast, in the car, or at the gym. And the scheme is having impressive results: an independent report by Loughborough University found a 38% drop in arrests, a 68% reduction in children going missing, a 33% fall in drug use, and hospital admissions reduced by 92% in its first 18 months from 2015 to 2017.

At least, that\u2019s the impression you probably have of the 2019 Great British Bake Off winner, David Atherton. Wrong. In person, he\u2019s an adventurous extrovert with a hippy streak. \u201cMost of my practices I did in my pants while eating pizza and watching RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. The person in the edit is not me,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end, it showed me singing to myself and dancing around, but actually I did that the whole way through.

Yet the 36-year-old health adviser is such an experienced and confident cook (\u201cOttolenghi is my absolute hero,\u201d he says, and he is a big fan of baker Dan Lepard), he didn\u2019t panic or even change any social plans. \u201cThe weekend before the show, I decided to cycle to Paris. It was good for my headspace.\u201d</p> <p>A fitness fanatic, he had made his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwjjzxzPXI#t=3m10s\" title=\"\">stunning snake cake</a> only once before the opening show. \u201cMy thought was that if you\u2019ve tried something and it\u2019s worked, don\u2019t keep on practising it, because if you try it again and it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s just going to stress you out. A lot of Bake Off is your mental strength.\u201d</p> <p>He thought dessert week might be his undoing. \u201cSweet, fancy, fluffy desserts are not my thing. I like robust flavours and hearty bakes. I like breads. If I do a cake, I want it to be a carrot cake. If I do biscuits, I want them to be spicy.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Paul Hollywood wasn\u2019t initially a fan of his flavours. \u201cPaul has, I think, quite simple tastes. He likes really obvious flavours \u2013 chocolate and caramel and raspberry and white chocolate and lemon.\u201d Yet Atherton won a handshake and is happy to return the compliment: \u201cHe\u2019s very technical. I always agreed with their constructive criticisms. He was really helpful with tips. He must enjoy teaching because he\u2019s really good at that.\u201d</p> <p>While all around him were dropping their creations or gasping as they ran out of time<strong>,</strong> the cheerful, unfazed Atherton always seemed to finish with a few moments to clean his workbench.<strong> </strong>Is he really this perfect \u2013 prissy even \u2013 in real life?</p> <p>Not at all. \u201cI\u2019m not that clean and tidy. I don\u2019t like showering. I never wear shoes. I\u2019ve not washed my hair in more than 15 years. I didn\u2019t go to a hairdresser until I was about 28. I think these things are healthy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very hippy and outdoorsy. I love talking about my bowels and anything disgusting and medical.\u201d</p> <p>His Bake Off persona only shows a sliver of his interests \u2013 and hardly nods to his adventures. A trained nurse, he lives in south London<a href=\"https://www.vsointernational.org/news/blog/from-volunteer-nurse-to-great-british-bake-off-winner-david-atherton\"> and works for </a><a href=\"https://www.vsointernational.org/news/blog/from-volunteer-nurse-to-great-british-bake-off-winner-david-atherton\">Voluntary Services Overseas</a>. He has a post-graduate degree in wilderness and expedition medicine. And he has travelled around Africa, living in Malawi for two years. \u201cI left home at 18 and went to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. I\u2019ve been evacuated from two wars, once by the British special forces, once by the Americans. I went to Ethiopia when it was in a state of emergency and 10,000 people were arrested. I was in Nigeria during massive demonstrations and we were in lockdown for three days. I\u2019ve had malaria nine times. I\u2019ve been quarantined in a shack in New Guinea for a week because I got a violent strain of measles. I\u2019ve lived in a lot of countries and I really like that adventurous lifestyle.\u201d</p> <p>No wonder he didn\u2019t flap under pressure in the tent. What about the comments that he looked arrogant? \u201cI was never smug. You\u2019re so nervous that whatever your face is, it\u2019s probably just you trying to be composed. I didn\u2019t know I pouted, but I do. Get over it.\u201d</p> <p>One of five children, Atherton was brought up by strict evangelical parents in Whitby, North Yorkshire. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to watch TV. There was a period where we were allowed to watch one programme a day and you had to circle it in the Radio Times. We had breakfast every morning as a family of seven and my dad did a bible study and everyone had to pray at the end. Some of the things were so nice. We\u2019d play board games and do crafts and cooking together. It was a very loving family and we spent a lot of time together.\u201d</p> <p>His mother was health-conscious and cooked from scratch. As a result, Atherton grew up vegetarian, without a potato waffle in sight. \u201cIn our lunchbox we never had crisps or chocolate biscuits, it would be nuts and seeds. Figs and prunes would be our sweet things. Carrot sticks. We never had butter or margarine. We never had icing on our cakes.</p> <p>\u201cFor my mum, making bread was a way of keeping us busy. She would make the dough and we would play with it like Play-Doh. She would make rolls and we would make rabbits, cats and crocodiles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80898ac56a7fd2a50653e10602e19990d614b765\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80898ac56a7fd2a50653e10602e19990d614b765/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Steph Blackwell in the GBBO final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Steph Blackwell in the GBBO final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His grandmother taught him to sew, knit and crochet. In the living room of the small flat he has just moved into with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3XT-b0l0lQ/\" title=\"\">his boyfriend, Nik,</a> he proudly shows me the practical but stylish things he has crafted: a quilt, bowls and platters (\u201cmy Ottolenghi salad plates\u201d), a table and bench (\u201cHonestly, it took about 20 minutes\u201d).</p> <p>He met Nik, a brand manager who helps him with social media, on a dating site. They are both into fitness. \u201cOur second date was a 100km London to Brighton bike ride. When he agreed to that, I was: \u2018Brilliant, this is it.\u2019 We did it not realising it was the big charity one, which was great because all the roads were closed.\u201d</p> <p>Atherton came out seven years ago by writing to his parents. He chose this method, he says, to give them time to process the news. \u201cThe reaction that someone might have from it being sprung on them might not be the reaction they\u2019d want to have if they\u2019d considered it. You\u2019ve been thinking about it for ages, but it\u2019s new for them. I told my parents in a letter and said: \u2018Speak to my twin brother before you speak to me because he wants to be able to answer certain questions first that might seem offensive to me.\u2019 They took it very well.\u201d </p> <p>He loves the fact that LGBT teenagers now contact him for advice, but is aware of the irony. \u201cThey say I\u2019m an inspiration, but I didn\u2019t come out until I was 29. But they\u2019re seeing me after that, where I don\u2019t live with shame any more. I\u2019m really happy. Shame just eats away at you. I encourage people that the soonest time it\u2019s right for them, they should come out, because I didn\u2019t do that and so many people you speak to wish they\u2019d done it earlier.\u201d</p> <p>He says he was frustrated at being \u201ca little bit objectified\u201d early on in Bake Off \u2013 \u201cin certain episodes, I felt like I was just a sexual innuendo\u201d \u2013 but admits he loves the attention he has been getting since it aired. \u201cIn general, I enjoy the buns innuendos. A lot of it is really funny. I mean, I did wear tight trousers every week. It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t also playing up to this.\u201d</p> <p>He would have liked to wear tight shorts and a vest, but it wasn\u2019t allowed. \u201cApparently armpit hair doesn\u2019t look nice on TV. I think it\u2019s more health and safety, because I said I\u2019d shave my armpits.\u201d</p> <p>His admirers have certainly been upfront. There are lots of fans in the US, where the show has also aired. \u201cThe gay Brits are definitely more dirty. The Americans are: \u2018You\u2019re awesome.\u2019 The Brits are: \u2018I want to fill you with my buttercream.\u2019 I\u2019ve not just had dick pics, I\u2019ve had videos of people masturbating.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the Bake Off innuendo, there were real friendships on show. Atherton, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3QBwlclQgw/\" title=\"\">Henry Bird</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mschakraverty/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Michael Chakraverty</a> formed a \u201cleast laddy lads\u2019 club\u201d (with Fevronia an honorary member) that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3QBwlclQgw/\" title=\"\">lives on through Instagram</a>. \u201cWe would ring each other during the week as things went wrong. I\u2019m not embarrassed to say that Henry practised one of my bakes for me \u2013 the Aperol domed tart. It was my recipe, but I didn\u2019t have time. He\u2019d gone out the week before and had time to do everything. He sent exhaustive notes. Every two or three minutes were accounted for.\u201d</p> <p>Atherton thinks this \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MUAeIxiYDmA\" title=\"\">camaraderie between the bakers</a>\u201d brought a warmth to the show. \u201cYou could see that we were helping each other and people weren\u2019t really very competitive. I think that helped, especially in the climate of division and Brexit. I think the public have really liked that.\u201d</p>",

What about the comments that he looked arrogant? \u201cI was never smug. You\u2019re so nervous that whatever your face is, it\u2019s probably just you trying to be composed. I didn\u2019t know I pouted, but I do. Get over it.\u201d One of five children, Atherton was brought up by strict evangelical parents in Whitby, North Yorkshire. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to watch TV. There was a period where we were allowed to watch one programme a day and you had to circle it in the Radio Times. We had breakfast every morning as a family of seven and my dad did a bible study and everyone had to pray at the end. Some of the things were so nice. We\u2019d play board games and do crafts and cooking together. It was a very loving family and we spent a lot of time together.\u201d His mother was health-conscious and cooked from scratch. As a result, Atherton grew up vegetarian, without a potato waffle in sight. \u201cIn our lunchbox we never had crisps or chocolate biscuits, it would be nuts and seeds. Figs and prunes would be our sweet things. Carrot sticks. We never had butter or margarine. We never had icing on our cakes. \u201cFor my mum, making bread was a way of keeping us busy. She would make the dough and we would play with it like Play-Doh. She would make rolls and we would make rabbits, cats and crocodiles.\u201d His grandmother taught him to sew, knit and crochet. In the living room of the small flat he has just moved into with his boyfriend, Nik, he proudly shows me the practical but stylish things he has crafted: a quilt, bowls and platters (\u201cmy Ottolenghi salad plates\u201d), a table and bench (\u201cHonestly, it took about 20 minutes\u201d). He met Nik, a brand manager who helps him with social media, on a dating site. They are both into fitness. \u201cOur second date was a 100km London to Brighton bike ride. When he agreed to that, I was: \u2018Brilliant, this is it.\u2019 We did it not realising it was the big charity one, which was great because all the roads were closed.\u201d Atherton came out seven years ago by writing to his parents. He chose this method, he says, to give them time to process the news. \u201cThe reaction that someone might have from it being sprung on them might not be the reaction they\u2019d want to have if they\u2019d considered it. You\u2019ve been thinking about it for ages, but it\u2019s new for them. I told my parents in a letter and said: \u2018Speak to my twin brother before you speak to me because he wants to be able to answer certain questions first that might seem offensive to me.\u2019 They took it very well.\u201d He loves the fact that LGBT teenagers now contact him for advice, but is aware of the irony. \u201cThey say I\u2019m an inspiration, but I didn\u2019t come out until I was 29. But they\u2019re seeing me after that, where I don\u2019t live with shame any more. I\u2019m really happy. Shame just eats away at you. I encourage people that the soonest time it\u2019s right for them, they should come out, because I didn\u2019t do that and so many people you speak to wish they\u2019d done it earlier.\u201d He says he was frustrated at being \u201ca little bit objectified\u201d early on in Bake Off \u2013 \u201cin certain episodes, I felt like I was just a sexual innuendo\u201d \u2013 but admits he loves the attention he has been getting since it aired. \u201cIn general, I enjoy the buns innuendos. A lot of it is really funny. I mean, I did wear tight trousers every week. It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t also playing up to this.\u201d He would have liked to wear tight shorts and a vest, but it wasn\u2019t allowed. \u201cApparently armpit hair doesn\u2019t look nice on TV. I think it\u2019s more health and safety, because I said I\u2019d shave my armpits.\u201d His admirers have certainly been upfront. There are lots of fans in the US, where the show has also aired. \u201cThe gay Brits are definitely more dirty. The Americans are: \u2018You\u2019re awesome.\u2019 The Brits are: \u2018I want to fill you with my buttercream.\u2019 I\u2019ve not just had dick pics, I\u2019ve had videos of people masturbating.\u201d Aside from the Bake Off innuendo, there were real friendships on show. Atherton, Henry Bird and Michael Chakraverty formed a \u201cleast laddy lads\u2019 club\u201d (with Fevronia an honorary member) that lives on through Instagram. \u201cWe would ring each other during the week as things went wrong. I\u2019m not embarrassed to say that Henry practised one of my bakes for me \u2013 the Aperol domed tart. It was my recipe, but I didn\u2019t have time. He\u2019d gone out the week before and had time to do everything. He sent exhaustive notes. Every two or three minutes were accounted for.\u201d Atherton thinks this \u201ccamaraderie between the bakers\u201d brought a warmth to the show. \u201cYou could see that we were helping each other and people weren\u2019t really very competitive. I think that helped, especially in the climate of division and Brexit. I think the public have really liked that.\u201d",

The music that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/inside-grime-true-history-dan-hancox-dj-target-wiley-dizzee-rascal-stormzy\">fomenting in the housing estates of east London</a> as she was growing up in her working-class home in Ilford gave her access to language and poetry, and a sense of belonging: \u201cThere was something about the rage, something about the honesty, something about the locality.

      "bodyText": "Debris Stevenson\u2019s first public performance, at the age of 15, sounds like an impetuous act of courage. For years she had been bullied, but she found herself at the school disco emboldened enough to \u201cgrab the mic\u201d. The lyrics poured out of her. \u201cIt should have been scary but I was full of adrenaline. Whether it was good or not I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Until then, she kept the grime poetry she\u2019d been writing in the library and \u201cspitting out\u201d on the way home from school secret. She often sat in the library and watched the world go by, struggling with dyslexia and tormented by trying to square her queer sexuality with her parents\u2019 strict Mormonism. It was grime that got her through those desolate days, says Stevenson. The music that was fomenting in the housing estates of east London as she was growing up in her working-class home in Ilford gave her access to language and poetry, and a sense of belonging: \u201cThere was something about the rage, something about the honesty, something about the locality. It was being made by people of not a dissimilar age to me. My home life had been all about my parents\u2019 Mormon church. It wasn\u2019t working for me and I needed a new home.\u201d She documented it all in a semi-autobiographical grime musical, Poet in da Corner, which was staged to great acclaim \u2013 and some astonishment \u2013 at the Royal Court in London last year. Named after Dizzee Rascal\u2019s seminal 2003 album Boy in da Corner, it crackled with the hybrid urban sounds of the genre and incandescent poetry. Such was its impact that the Royal Court permanently installed a bigger, better sound system on Stevenson\u2019s recommendation, and the show is returning in January.

She is currently in rehearsals with her new play, 1st Luv, which again incorporates grime music and poetry into its themes.

As someone who might have been deemed \u201cat risk\u201d when she was younger, Stevenson wanted to stay away from well-worn narratives about troubled teenagers. \u201cI see a lot of stories in which they are entangled with drugs, violence and gangs. I love a lot about Top Boy but I think, \u2018What other stories are we going to tell?\u2019\u201d So she wrote a \u201ccelebration of love and music\u201d. 1st Luv is a play about children experiencing the first sparks of romance, but also dealing with the traumatic inner drama of being in care. \u201cI wanted to capture that age when you are between childhood and adulthood.

      "bodyText": "The director Joanna Hogg has sounded a warning on the future of arthouse cinema in a call to arms that saw her attack a \u201ccertain kind of cinema\u201d for being \u201chomogenised\u201d and lacking passion. Hogg, whose most recent film, The Souvenir, won a Grand Jury prize at the Sundance film festival, was speaking at a screening in London on Tuesday of a freshly restored silent film, and echoed Martin Scorsese\u2019s recent attacked on superhero films. \u201cWhat will happen in a few years, even five years\u2019 time?\u201d she said. \u201cWill I still be able to make films? Will I be able to make films that you can see in a cinema like this? I may have to do something else,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very serious moment. We have to really be awake to do something about it,\u201d she added. Hogg was discussing the preservation and restoration work of the Film Foundation, of which she has recently been made a director. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly timely to keep thinking about this kind of restoration work when the world of cinema is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain kind of cinema, but I\u2019m not sure if you can call it cinema, that\u2019s very homogenised in a way, that\u2019s not created out of a real passion.\u201d Hogg\u2019s remarks echoed those of the Film Foundation\u2019s founder Martin Scorsese, who told Empire last month that he considered Marvel movies \u201cnot cinema\u201d and then restated his argument in the New York Times. At the screening, Hogg suggested that stewardship of our cinematic heritage was somewhere between a moral obligation and a gift to future generations. \u201cIt would be very selfish of us not to be concerned with our culture and think of the future. It just seems incredibly careless of us not to look after an art form that\u2019s still so young.\u201d Ninety per cent of silent films had been lost, she added, saying: \u201cCould we imagine not being able to read War and Peace? That we couldn\u2019t get hold of a copy, it\u2019s unimaginable. Or say there\u2019s a Caravaggio that is falling apart, that\u2019s fading, that needs work, that we would discard it? That we wouldn\u2019t actually work to restore it?\u201d Hogg spoke about how she was inspired to become a film director after watching classic movies on TV as a child (\u201cI was known as square eyes\u201d) and also by seeing arthouse cinema in London as an adult. Commentators defended Scorsese by pointing both to the work of the Film Foundation and his support of younger film-makers to demonstrate that he is actively involved in the cinema beyond his own work. The film shown at the screening, Maurice Tourneur\u2019s 1919 drama The Broken Butterfly, was a prime candidate for a benevolent restoration \u2013 each scene picturesquely framed and delicately lit, with soft tints and illustrated intertitles. It is a poignant romantic melodrama whose plot has some jaw-dropping moments. Its now little-known stars, Pauline Starke and Lew Cody, give intensely serious performances. Hogg told the audience that the film had moved her to tears and that she had \u201cgoosebumps everywhere\u201d while watching it. Scorsese suggested the film as a candidate for restoration \u2013 as a little-known work by a pivotal silent-era director. Tourneur was born in Paris in 1876, and began and ended his film career in France, but for several years in the 1910s and 1920s worked in the US film industry, during which time he made The Broken Butterfly. His most famous Hollywood films include the epic The Last of the Mohicans (1920) and The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), starring Mary Pickford. His cinematic legacy includes not just his own movies, but those of his son, Jacques Tourneur, who who became a Hollywood director, making the film noir Out of the Past (1947) and cult favourites such as Cat People (1942). The Broken Butterfly was restored by the Film Foundation at L\u2019Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory in association with Fondation Je\u0301ro\u0302me Seydoux-Pathe\u0301, and was funded by cognac brand Louis XIII. Accompanied by a live improvised score by silent film pianist and composer John Sweeney, the film tells the story of a young woman, raised by a punitive aunt in a Canadian village, who falls in love with a musician who composes a symphony in her honour. As their affair takes a tragic turn, she learns a horrifying secret about her childhood. The restoration, which has cleaned up the image, reintroduced the title cards, and involved commissioning a new score, has also been screened in the US and France, will be made available online. \u2022 The Broken Butterfly will be available to watch at film-foundation.org on 14 December.",

Eight goals were scored. Two were penalties. Another two were own goals. The penalties were expertly converted, while one of the own goals twanged off someone\u2019s big, startled, confused face in the grand music-hall manner. There was a double sending off for two separate incidents during the same passage of play, one of them a hilariously harsh handball decision. A three-goal comeback was completed in 11 minutes. A late winner got ruled out by VAR, while the side down to nine men were sending their full-backs upfield on the overlap during added time. Also, there was only one set of fans in attendance, so the whole thing was played out in a very surreal, lopsided atmosphere indeed. And they say the group stage is the boring bit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/frank-lampard-hails-chelsea-spirit-comeback-ajax\">Frank Lampard hails Chelsea spirit after three-goal comeback against Ajax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thing is, they used to have a point. We\u2019re only just past the halfway mark in the groups, and already we can file Tuesday night\u2019s 4-4 alongside a 4-3, a 6-2 and <em>that</em> 2-7. Throw in a 6-0 and a 4-3 in Big Vase, plus last week\u2019s preposterous 5-5 draw in the Tin Pot at Anfield, and something very strange is happening in elite football right now. Competent defending hasn\u2019t been this far out of fashion since 1925, when the First Division was producing scorelines such as 11-2, 10-0, 1-7 (twice), 8-3 (twice), 7-3, 6-3 (five times) and 5-3 (four times). That particular carry-on was put down to confusion over the new offside law, although the contemporary half-time diet of cooking brandy, cheroots and industrial-strength speed must also have had some bearing, surely. But there are no such excuses today. We can\u2019t even blame this on VAR, even though we\u2019d like to. What\u2019s going on?</p> <p>Whatever it is, we\u2019re on board.

      "bodyText": "GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS On Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea and Ajax served up an instant Big Cup classic. Eight goals were scored. Two were penalties. Another two were own goals. The penalties were expertly converted, while one of the own goals twanged off someone\u2019s big, startled, confused face in the grand music-hall manner. There was a double sending off for two separate incidents during the same passage of play, one of them a hilariously harsh handball decision. A three-goal comeback was completed in 11 minutes. A late winner got ruled out by VAR, while the side down to nine men were sending their full-backs upfield on the overlap during added time. Also, there was only one set of fans in attendance, so the whole thing was played out in a very surreal, lopsided atmosphere indeed. And they say the group stage is the boring bit. Thing is, they used to have a point. We\u2019re only just past the halfway mark in the groups, and already we can file Tuesday night\u2019s 4-4 alongside a 4-3, a 6-2 and that 2-7. Throw in a 6-0 and a 4-3 in Big Vase, plus last week\u2019s preposterous 5-5 draw in the Tin Pot at Anfield, and something very strange is happening in elite football right now. Competent defending hasn\u2019t been this far out of fashion since 1925, when the First Division was producing scorelines such as 11-2, 10-0, 1-7 (twice), 8-3 (twice), 7-3, 6-3 (five times) and 5-3 (four times). That particular carry-on was put down to confusion over the new offside law, although the contemporary half-time diet of cooking brandy, cheroots and industrial-strength speed must also have had some bearing, surely. But there are no such excuses today. We can\u2019t even blame this on VAR, even though we\u2019d like to. What\u2019s going on? Whatever it is, we\u2019re on board. And it would seem that Frank Lampard is as well, his post-match quotes suggesting he\u2019s buying into the reckless pleasures of freewheeling fun bigstyle. \u201cI had some mad nights over the years, but this is certainly right up there,\u201d he grinned, feeling all warm and fuzzy. \u201cWe need to tighten up for sure, but with that spirit we can go places.\u201d The suggestion implicit that the latter might be more important to him than the former. It\u2019s a brave philosophy which guarantees entertainment, though not necessarily trophies. But then again what\u2019s more important?

But it really is the case that those two old parties are fracturing. We\u2019ve already seen a lot of defections to the Liberal Democrats in recent months.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the scenario that we do make this breakthrough then I wouldn\u2019t assume that everything else remains static.\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent months eight former Labour or Conservative MPs have defected to the Lib Dems, and Swinson said her party had already been in talks with others.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/young-voters-tell-us-your-views-about-the-general-election\">Young voters: tell us your views about the general election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of people we\u2019ve had discussions with who didn\u2019t take the jump,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are considering that move do so on their own journey.\u201d</p> \n<p>A scenario in which defections could result in Swinson becoming prime minister does, however, seem extremely unlikely given the Lib Dems\u2019 starting base of just 20 seats, and expectations that even a good election might do no more than double this.</p> \n<p>The first stop on Swinson\u2019s inaugural bus tour of the campaign \u2013 using what the party believes is the only electric-powered coach in use in the UK \u2013 was in the north London constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, where former Labour MP Luciana Berger is pushing to unseat the incumbent Tory, despite the Lib Dems winning fewer than 3,500 votes in 2017.</p> \n<p>However, polling by Queen Mary University of London released on Tuesday showed that in London, the Lib Dems are attracting twice as much support as in 2017, with Labour down by 10 percentage points.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the 2017 election is a good guide to our politics now,\u201d Swinson said. \u201cAll of that is evidence that the Liberal Democrats are in a very different place. We know that we are genuinely competitive in a huge number of seats now. And that includes seats where we\u2019ve never before really been in serious contention. And that\u2019s a very exciting place to be.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is Swinson\u2019s first election as leader \u2013 she only took over from Vince Cable in July \u2013 and she is very much the face of the party campaign. The bus has an enormous picture of her on it, with the party called, \u201cJo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats\u201d, and the slogan: \u201cStop Brexit, build a brighter future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brexit was the focus of the next stop, where Swinson visited Sigma, a pharmaceuticals supply company in Watford, which supplies a third of all UK pharmacies, and worries that Brexit could affect the supply of drugs from the EU.</p> \n<p>Paras Shah, the company\u2019s executive director, said Brexit could bring stock shortages and affect prices \u2013 even as he conceded he would probably vote Conservative in the adjoining constituency where he lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that just wants Brexit to be done,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>In 2017 Watford was narrowly won by the Conservatives over Labour, with the Lib Dems taking less than 10% of the vote. But Swinson insisted such areas were now winnable.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolitics is very volatile at the moment, and it\u2019s volatile because we\u2019ve got a new fault line that runs right through both the Conservative and Labour parties as they currently are,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are some people who hope, hope, hope it\u2019s going to go back to business as usual, and that they\u2019ll wake up from what they consider a nightmare and it\u2019ll be the same politics. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be what happens.\u201d</p> \n<p>On a day that conformed to election campaign stereotype, Swinson cuddled an activist\u2019s baby in Golders Green, donned hi-vis to visit the pharmaceutical firm\u2019s warehouse and ended in the Surrey town of Esher with a visit to a school.</p> \n<p>The constituency is currently represented by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who enjoys a 23,000 majority, making it a seemingly unlikely Lib Dem prize.</p> \n<p>Swinson has over recent days declined to say what she would do if, as seems the realistic best-case scenario for her party, it holds the balance of power in a hung parliament after the election.</p> \n<p>She has categorically ruled out backing either Johnson or Corbyn in Downing Street. Asked if she could hypothetically support a Labour government under a different leader, Swinson said even this did not seem realistic.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should assume that either of those parties is in any short time frame \u2013 or even ever, who knows \u2013 going to retreat from the more extreme positions that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re built on wishful thinking, about what people would like the Labour party or the Conservative party to return to. It\u2019s not where these parties are.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A number of Conservative and Labour MPs could be tempted to cross over to the Liberal Democrats if the party makes major gains in the general election, Jo Swinson has predicted at the start of her party\u2019s election campaign. Speaking to reporters on a party bus taking her on a tour of three Conservative-held seats that the Lib Dems say they have a chance of winning despite coming third in all of them in 2017, Swinson said a significant number of defections was \u201centirely feasible\u201d. \u201cI have had MPs from both of those parties say to me that I would be a better prime minister than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d the Lib Dem leader said. \u201cObviously, those people are standing under particular party banners. But it really is the case that those two old parties are fracturing. We\u2019ve already seen a lot of defections to the Liberal Democrats in recent months. \u201cIn the scenario that we do make this breakthrough then I wouldn\u2019t assume that everything else remains static.\u201d In recent months eight former Labour or Conservative MPs have defected to the Lib Dems, and Swinson said her party had already been in talks with others. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of people we\u2019ve had discussions with who didn\u2019t take the jump,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are considering that move do so on their own journey.\u201d A scenario in which defections could result in Swinson becoming prime minister does, however, seem extremely unlikely given the Lib Dems\u2019 starting base of just 20 seats, and expectations that even a good election might do no more than double this. The first stop on Swinson\u2019s inaugural bus tour of the campaign \u2013 using what the party believes is the only electric-powered coach in use in the UK \u2013 was in the north London constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, where former Labour MP Luciana Berger is pushing to unseat the incumbent Tory, despite the Lib Dems winning fewer than 3,500 votes in 2017. However, polling by Queen Mary University of London released on Tuesday showed that in London, the Lib Dems are attracting twice as much support as in 2017, with Labour down by 10 percentage points. \u201cI don\u2019t think the 2017 election is a good guide to our politics now,\u201d Swinson said. \u201cAll of that is evidence that the Liberal Democrats are in a very different place. We know that we are genuinely competitive in a huge number of seats now. And that includes seats where we\u2019ve never before really been in serious contention. And that\u2019s a very exciting place to be.\u201d It is Swinson\u2019s first election as leader \u2013 she only took over from Vince Cable in July \u2013 and she is very much the face of the party campaign. The bus has an enormous picture of her on it, with the party called, \u201cJo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats\u201d, and the slogan: \u201cStop Brexit, build a brighter future.\u201d Brexit was the focus of the next stop, where Swinson visited Sigma, a pharmaceuticals supply company in Watford, which supplies a third of all UK pharmacies, and worries that Brexit could affect the supply of drugs from the EU. Paras Shah, the company\u2019s executive director, said Brexit could bring stock shortages and affect prices \u2013 even as he conceded he would probably vote Conservative in the adjoining constituency where he lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that just wants Brexit to be done,\u201d he added. In 2017 Watford was narrowly won by the Conservatives over Labour, with the Lib Dems taking less than 10% of the vote. But Swinson insisted such areas were now winnable. \u201cPolitics is very volatile at the moment, and it\u2019s volatile because we\u2019ve got a new fault line that runs right through both the Conservative and Labour parties as they currently are,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some people who hope, hope, hope it\u2019s going to go back to business as usual, and that they\u2019ll wake up from what they consider a nightmare and it\u2019ll be the same politics. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be what happens.\u201d On a day that conformed to election campaign stereotype, Swinson cuddled an activist\u2019s baby in Golders Green, donned hi-vis to visit the pharmaceutical firm\u2019s warehouse and ended in the Surrey town of Esher with a visit to a school. The constituency is currently represented by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who enjoys a 23,000 majority, making it a seemingly unlikely Lib Dem prize. Swinson has over recent days declined to say what she would do if, as seems the realistic best-case scenario for her party, it holds the balance of power in a hung parliament after the election. She has categorically ruled out backing either Johnson or Corbyn in Downing Street. Asked if she could hypothetically support a Labour government under a different leader, Swinson said even this did not seem realistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should assume that either of those parties is in any short time frame \u2013 or even ever, who knows \u2013 going to retreat from the more extreme positions that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re built on wishful thinking, about what people would like the Labour party or the Conservative party to return to. It\u2019s not where these parties are.\u201d",

Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-revised-testimony-sondland-ties-trump-to-quid-pro-quo/2019/11/05/3059b3b8-ffec-11e9-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html\">had corrected his impeachment testimony</a> and admitted that there had been a quid pro quo involving Ukraine and Hunter Biden.</p> <p>Republican demands that the Democrats release transcripts have given way to Republicans announcing that they now have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kathrynw5/status/1191824848978358274?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">no intention of reading</a> said transcripts. Ignorance is the new bliss.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McConnell who doubles as Senate majority leader, was signaling that while he thought the Senate would acquit Trump in an impeachment trial, bipartisan agreement would be needed for the trial to proceed. \u201cThis is not something the majority can micromanage like it can on almost any other issue,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BresPolitico/status/1191801526592966656\">said McConnell</a>.</p> <p>In Virginia, the Republicans fate was gloomier as they lost the state senate and the house of delegates. For the first time since 1992, the Democrats hold control of both legislative chambers. Adding insult to injury, Juli Briskman, the cyclist who flipped-off the presidential motorcade two years earlier, won her bid for local office in Virginia\u2019s Loudon County.</p> <p>Looking back, the Republicans\u2019 defeat in the 2017 gubernatorial race was a harbinger of what actually came next. Suburban Virginians again made themselves heard and stuck a thumb in the president\u2019s eye. Against this backdrop, Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, freshman congresswomen from swing districts in Virginia must be breathing more easily.</p> <p>The two had publicly announced their support for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/24/seven-freshman-democrats-these-allegations-are-threat-all-we-have-sworn-protect/\">Washington Post op-ed</a> along with five other freshman with national security credentials.

Together, they are a reminder that the House Democrats are not just about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the party\u2019s left wing, and that Democrats have found traction outside the New York and California\u2019s big cities.</p> <p>While Democrats have reason to smile, perspective remains essential. While Tuesday\u2019s results can be spun as a defeat for Trumpism, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sam_baker/status/1191932501465415681\">Kentucky is not a swing state</a> and Bevin was an unpopular governor. A year from now, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1191921072075083776\">it will appear in the president\u2019s column</a> regardless of the national results. The last time Kentucky voted Democratic was in 1996 for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot was on the ballot.</p> <p>Next, Beshear ran as a moderate, something that cannot be said of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The former is a self-described democratic-socialist and the latter wants to remake capitalism in her own image. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html\">By the numbers</a>, Warren appears poised to lose to Trump as suburban voters are turned-off by her plans for redistributive economics.</p> <p>In that sense, the latest contests point the Democrats to a path forward. Whether that road actually leads to the White House remains to be seen.</p>",

Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, had corrected his impeachment testimony and admitted that there had been a quid pro quo involving Ukraine and Hunter Biden. Republican demands that the Democrats release transcripts have given way to Republicans announcing that they now have no intention of reading said transcripts. Ignorance is the new bliss. Meanwhile, McConnell who doubles as Senate majority leader, was signaling that while he thought the Senate would acquit Trump in an impeachment trial, bipartisan agreement would be needed for the trial to proceed. \u201cThis is not something the majority can micromanage like it can on almost any other issue,\u201d said McConnell. In Virginia, the Republicans fate was gloomier as they lost the state senate and the house of delegates. For the first time since 1992, the Democrats hold control of both legislative chambers. Adding insult to injury, Juli Briskman, the cyclist who flipped-off the presidential motorcade two years earlier, won her bid for local office in Virginia\u2019s Loudon County. Looking back, the Republicans\u2019 defeat in the 2017 gubernatorial race was a harbinger of what actually came next. Suburban Virginians again made themselves heard and stuck a thumb in the president\u2019s eye. Against this backdrop, Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, freshman congresswomen from swing districts in Virginia must be breathing more easily. The two had publicly announced their support for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry in a Washington Post op-ed along with five other freshman with national security credentials. They also served as catalysts for Democrats moving forward on the topic. Spanberger is a former CIA operative while Luria is an ex-navy commander. Together, they are a reminder that the House Democrats are not just about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the party\u2019s left wing, and that Democrats have found traction outside the New York and California\u2019s big cities. While Democrats have reason to smile, perspective remains essential. While Tuesday\u2019s results can be spun as a defeat for Trumpism, Kentucky is not a swing state and Bevin was an unpopular governor. A year from now, it will appear in the president\u2019s column regardless of the national results. The last time Kentucky voted Democratic was in 1996 for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot was on the ballot. Next, Beshear ran as a moderate, something that cannot be said of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The former is a self-described democratic-socialist and the latter wants to remake capitalism in her own image. By the numbers, Warren appears poised to lose to Trump as suburban voters are turned-off by her plans for redistributive economics. In that sense, the latest contests point the Democrats to a path forward. Whether that road actually leads to the White House remains to be seen.",

      "bodyText": "The business executive who was abducted and tortured near the Irish border has spoken for the first time about a crime that has shocked and bewildered Ireland. Kevin Lunney said the gang that kidnapped him went through a checklist of sadistic acts which left him in agony. \u201cI think certainly the breaking the leg was on the list, it was, \u2018we have to rough you up, we have to mark you\u2019,\u201d Lunney, a father of six, told BBC Spotlight in a programme aired on Tuesday. Masked men ambushed Lunney, 50, on 17 September outside his home in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland, and tortured him for about two hours before dumping him across the border in County Cavan. It was the latest and most brutal act in an eight-year campaign of intimidation against executives of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), a building materials company that straddles the border. Lunney, the company\u2019s operations director, said a car reversed at high speed into his vehicle as he drove up a lane. Attackers smashed the windows, dragged him out and bundled him into the boot of another car. He tried in vain to escape, prompting whacks to his head. He overheard a captor reporting to someone on the phone addressed as \u201cboss\u201d. The men hooded him, transferred him to a horse box and ordered him and other executives to resign from QIH. Lunney agreed but the violence continued. The gang jabbed a utility knife under his nails and rubbed bleach into the wounds. \u201cIt was excruciating, the pain of the bleach \u2013 I was screaming,\u201d he recalled. They cut off his clothes and doused his face with bleach. \u201cThere was a lot of fumes, I started to cough and almost passed out.\u201d They broke his leg with a baseball bat or part of a fence. \u201cI heard it breaking. I roared. The pain was awful.\u201d One attacker was unsure it had broken, he said. \u201cHe said to the other guy who was holding the torch, \u2018Did that snap?\u2019 And the guy said \u2018No\u2019.\u201d They broke the leg again close to the first break. \u201cIt was a hundred times worse the second time. As soon as he finished that, he said, \u2018Now we have to mark you\u2019.\u201d They scraped his face \u2013 Lunney has grown a beard to hide the marks \u2013 then carved QIH on his chest, saying they had to make him remember. Dumped on a road, freezing, bloodied and in agony, Lunney said he thought he would die. A tractor driver found him and summoned help. QIH is a remnant of a business empire built by Se\u00e1n Quinn, an entrepreneur who became Ireland\u2019s richest man before losing his fortune and companies in a bet on a toxic bank. Quinn, 71, has accused QIH executives of betraying him but vehemently denied any involvement in the intimidation campaign. He condemned the attack on Lunney as barbaric and said he feared being blamed. The chief executive of QIH, Liam McCaffrey, this week told the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na commissioner, Drew Harris, that failure to find those responsible would leave the community in fear and imperil the local economy. Last week garda\u00ed took down a roadside sign that accused executives of having inflated salaries.",

      "body": "<p>Eight people including four foreign tourists were stabbed on Wednesday inside the ancient Roman city of Jerash, one of Jordan\u2019s most popular sites for visitors.</p> <p>Authorities said the victims included tourists from Mexico and Switzerland. Police sources told the Guardian that three of those stabbed were Mexican and one was Swiss. The others included two Jordanian police officers, a tour guide and a driver.</p> <p>A Mexican tourist and a Jordanian tour guide were flown to Amman with serious injuries but their conditions were soon upgraded to stable, the Jordanian health minister, Saad Jaber, told reporters. The rest had injuries \u201cbetween moderate and slight,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The perpetrator, a 22-year old, was arrested at the scene and was believed to have acted alone, sources said.</p> <p>He came from a nearby Palestinian refugee camp housing about 35,000 people and used to wash cars at a station on its borders, said Basheer Abu Serdanah, a resident of the camp who knew the man.</p> <p>\u201cIf he did it, we are all in shock,\u201d Serdanah said. \u201cHe was a shy, normal guy. If you talked to him he\u2019d put his eyes to the ground.\u201d</p> <p>A group representing residents of the camp released a statement on Wednesday saying they \u201cdenounce and condemn the terrorist act carried out of by one of these cowards in Jerash.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie, an American tourist who witnessed the attack, said she and her tour group were close to the Roman city\u2019s hippodrome shortly before 11.16am local time when they saw a large group and heard a commotion.</p> <p>She said that they realised there were people bleeding: \u201cIt looked like there had been a full-on fight. And then I saw this guy\u2019s hand just split open and I knew somebody had stabbed people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/jerash_jordan_locator/giv-3902RzCfz3g8ffCp/\" data-alt=\"Jordan attack map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/jerash_jordan_locator/giv-3902RzCfz3g8ffCp/\">Jordan attack map</a> </figure>  <p>She said local guides told her and her group that the attack had been carried out by \u201ca psycho\u201d who had been arrested and that the rest of the site was now safe.</p> <p>\u201cWe walked a bit farther down towards the columns and there was a machete lying there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were no police lines set up or anything at the site. People were just walking around and you could walk straight through all the blood.\u201d</p> <p>She said she counted at least four victims and said three of them appeared to be severely injured.</p> <p>A video purported to have been shot in the aftermath of the stabbings showed a woman lying face-first on the ground while others pressed a scarf to an apparent wound in her back.</p> <p>An alarmed woman was heard calling for assistance in Spanish, shouting: \u201cThere\u2019s been a stabbing. They\u2019ve got a knife! Please help him here! Please!\u201d</p> <p>Another man sat nearby with a bloodied leg, and bloodstains covered the ground around them.</p> <p>Jerash is home to one of the world\u2019s best-preserved Roman cities and is a major attraction for tourists who are a lifeline for the Jordanian economy.</p> <p>Tourism contributes about 10% of Jordan\u2019s GDP. Visitors significantly declined after the outbreak of the civil war in neighbouring Syria and with the resumption of conflict in Iraq, but has recovered in the past three years.</p> <p>The kingdom is politically stable and has a low crime rate but contributed one of the highest shares per capita of fighters to Isis, with a surge in terrorist incidents recorded since 2015.</p> <p>Among the most deadliest was a shooting spree by Isis militants in the town of Karak in December 2016 that killed a dozen people including a Canadian tourist. The attack ended with a siege inside a Crusader castle in the area.</p> <p><em>Sam Jones in Madrid contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Eight people including four foreign tourists were stabbed on Wednesday inside the ancient Roman city of Jerash, one of Jordan\u2019s most popular sites for visitors. Authorities said the victims included tourists from Mexico and Switzerland. Police sources told the Guardian that three of those stabbed were Mexican and one was Swiss. The others included two Jordanian police officers, a tour guide and a driver. A Mexican tourist and a Jordanian tour guide were flown to Amman with serious injuries but their conditions were soon upgraded to stable, the Jordanian health minister, Saad Jaber, told reporters. The rest had injuries \u201cbetween moderate and slight,\u201d he said. The perpetrator, a 22-year old, was arrested at the scene and was believed to have acted alone, sources said. He came from a nearby Palestinian refugee camp housing about 35,000 people and used to wash cars at a station on its borders, said Basheer Abu Serdanah, a resident of the camp who knew the man. \u201cIf he did it, we are all in shock,\u201d Serdanah said. \u201cHe was a shy, normal guy. If you talked to him he\u2019d put his eyes to the ground.\u201d A group representing residents of the camp released a statement on Wednesday saying they \u201cdenounce and condemn the terrorist act carried out of by one of these cowards in Jerash.\u201d Natalie, an American tourist who witnessed the attack, said she and her tour group were close to the Roman city\u2019s hippodrome shortly before 11.16am local time when they saw a large group and heard a commotion. She said that they realised there were people bleeding: \u201cIt looked like there had been a full-on fight. And then I saw this guy\u2019s hand just split open and I knew somebody had stabbed people.\u201d She said local guides told her and her group that the attack had been carried out by \u201ca psycho\u201d who had been arrested and that the rest of the site was now safe. \u201cWe walked a bit farther down towards the columns and there was a machete lying there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were no police lines set up or anything at the site. People were just walking around and you could walk straight through all the blood.\u201d She said she counted at least four victims and said three of them appeared to be severely injured. A video purported to have been shot in the aftermath of the stabbings showed a woman lying face-first on the ground while others pressed a scarf to an apparent wound in her back. An alarmed woman was heard calling for assistance in Spanish, shouting: \u201cThere\u2019s been a stabbing. They\u2019ve got a knife! Please help him here! Please!\u201d Another man sat nearby with a bloodied leg, and bloodstains covered the ground around them. Jerash is home to one of the world\u2019s best-preserved Roman cities and is a major attraction for tourists who are a lifeline for the Jordanian economy. Tourism contributes about 10% of Jordan\u2019s GDP. Visitors significantly declined after the outbreak of the civil war in neighbouring Syria and with the resumption of conflict in Iraq, but has recovered in the past three years. The kingdom is politically stable and has a low crime rate but contributed one of the highest shares per capita of fighters to Isis, with a surge in terrorist incidents recorded since 2015. Among the most deadliest was a shooting spree by Isis militants in the town of Karak in December 2016 that killed a dozen people including a Canadian tourist. The attack ended with a siege inside a Crusader castle in the area. Sam Jones in Madrid contributed to this report",

      "body": "<p>Europe\u2019s leading doctors are to call for tighter regulation of traditional Chinese medicine, anxious that recent recognition by the World Health Organization will encourage the use of unproven therapies that can sometimes be harmful.</p> <p>The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM) and the European Academies\u2019 Science Advisory Council will issue <a href=\"https://easac.eu/publications/details/traditional-chinese-medicine-a-statement-by-easac-and-feam\">a joint statement</a> on Thursday urging the WHO to clarify how traditional Chinese medicine and other complementary therapies should be used.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the WHO decided to add a chapter on traditional Chinese medicine to the International Classification of Diseases, which lists treatments available globally for medical conditions. The ICD is influential with governments, which look at its recommendations when deciding how to spend health budgets.</p> <p>The WHO says this is not an endorsement, but European scientists fear it will be used by manufacturers to promote their herbal and other remedies \u2013 and that the public will be misled into thinking there is good evidence that they work and are safe. There is a risk, they say, that some people with a serious medical condition may even avoid or delay going to a conventional doctor.</p> <p>Doctors stress the importance of evidence-based medicine, said Prof George Griffin, the president of FEAM. \u201cWe don\u2019t give drugs and surgical treatments unless there is real evidence that they work and do no damage and basically the feeling is that most of the traditional Chinese medicine drugs are unregulated,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not tested properly for toxicity. They probably vary greatly between batches produced, for example seaweed, which is the latest, and they may be harmful.</p> <p>\u201cThe other side of the equation is that they may be deluding patients into thinking they are taking appropriate therapies for serious disease.\u201d</p> <p>Traditional Chinese medicine includes herbal remedies, tai chi, skin cupping and acupuncture. Its practitioners are interested in the entirety of the mind and body and do not diagnose on the basis of isolated symptoms. They believe that vital energy, called qi, circulates through body channels, connected to organs and functions. While many of the therapies have been in use for hundreds of years, there is little evidence of benefit from scientific trials and some evidence of harm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/15/diy-drugs-should-hospitals-make-their-own-medicine\">DIY drugs: should hospitals make their own medicine?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The doctors behind the statement recognise that traditional Chinese medicine has sometimes produced treatments of real value to the world. The most notable recently is artemisinin therapy, which is the mainstay of malaria treatment in Africa. But, they point out, the original artemisia preparations were chemically modified and rigorously tested to produce the drugs used in combination today.</p> <p>They say they agree with the WHO\u2019s good intention to encourage the rigorous testing of remedies used by so many people.

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s leading doctors are to call for tighter regulation of traditional Chinese medicine, anxious that recent recognition by the World Health Organization will encourage the use of unproven therapies that can sometimes be harmful. The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM) and the European Academies\u2019 Science Advisory Council will issue a joint statement on Thursday urging the WHO to clarify how traditional Chinese medicine and other complementary therapies should be used. Earlier this year, the WHO decided to add a chapter on traditional Chinese medicine to the International Classification of Diseases, which lists treatments available globally for medical conditions. The ICD is influential with governments, which look at its recommendations when deciding how to spend health budgets. The WHO says this is not an endorsement, but European scientists fear it will be used by manufacturers to promote their herbal and other remedies \u2013 and that the public will be misled into thinking there is good evidence that they work and are safe. There is a risk, they say, that some people with a serious medical condition may even avoid or delay going to a conventional doctor. Doctors stress the importance of evidence-based medicine, said Prof George Griffin, the president of FEAM. \u201cWe don\u2019t give drugs and surgical treatments unless there is real evidence that they work and do no damage and basically the feeling is that most of the traditional Chinese medicine drugs are unregulated,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not tested properly for toxicity. They probably vary greatly between batches produced, for example seaweed, which is the latest, and they may be harmful. \u201cThe other side of the equation is that they may be deluding patients into thinking they are taking appropriate therapies for serious disease.\u201d Traditional Chinese medicine includes herbal remedies, tai chi, skin cupping and acupuncture. Its practitioners are interested in the entirety of the mind and body and do not diagnose on the basis of isolated symptoms. They believe that vital energy, called qi, circulates through body channels, connected to organs and functions. While many of the therapies have been in use for hundreds of years, there is little evidence of benefit from scientific trials and some evidence of harm. The doctors behind the statement recognise that traditional Chinese medicine has sometimes produced treatments of real value to the world. The most notable recently is artemisinin therapy, which is the mainstay of malaria treatment in Africa. But, they point out, the original artemisia preparations were chemically modified and rigorously tested to produce the drugs used in combination today. They say they agree with the WHO\u2019s good intention to encourage the rigorous testing of remedies used by so many people. But they think the listing of traditional Chinese medicine will be misconstrued. \u201cMultiple risks of harm from herbal ingredients have been documented,\u201d they will warn. Sometimes herbal remedies have been adulterated with chemicals. Interaction with conventional drugs can be a serious threat. And acupuncture, they will say, \u201cis not necessarily harmless\u201d. A review in 2017 found many injuries, infections and adverse reactions. Although those who use complementary medicines think of them as originating from small scale enterprises, globally it is big business. \u201cThe production and delivery of traditional Chinese medicine has become a large industry with estimates of $60bn [\u00a346.5bn] a year and an annual growth rate above 10%,\u201d says the statement. The doctors \u201curge the European commission and member states to do more to ensure that all medical products and procedures are subject to an appropriate level of evaluation for quality, safety and efficacy consistent with standardised testing procedures\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>In every good disaster movie, we get to meet the easily dispensable character: someone who mixes just enough stupidity with just enough mediocrity to be cannon fodder for the impending calamity.</p> <p>In the epic shipwreck of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, that man is Gordon Sondland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/05/impeachment-marie-yovanovitch-ukraine-transcript-reveals-fear-and-chaos-in-the-state-department\">Kafka in Foggy Bottom: impeachment transcript reveals fear of Trump tweets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sondland first entered this feature-length catastrophe as an ironic counterpoint to the doomed buffoon who has alternately dismayed and disgusted us for the last three years.</p> <p>To Trump himself, Sondland was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/gordon-sondland-impeachment.html\">once</a> a Never Trumper who first globbed on to the low-energy Jeb before shifting his undying loyalty to little Marco. When neither of those Republican gods were able to confer any honor upon his wealthy shoulders, Sondland did what any principled conservative would do: he wrote a $1m check to Trump and asked for an ambassadorship.</p> <p>To the rest of the world, the entirely expendable Sondland bears an uncanny resemblance to Trump himself. What kind of genius thinks you can lie to an impeachment inquiry by denying the whole quid pro quo deal with Ukraine? Who could ignore the risk that so many witnesses would spill their guts about your central role in the stitch-up of an American ally in desperate need of national security assistance?</p> <p>Step forward, ambassador. It\u2019s time for your brief moment of infamy before you depart this drama, to return only as the answer to an obscure Jeopardy question.</p> <p>Flanked by several lawyers, Sondland decided to \u201creview\u201d his initial testimony to the impeachment investigation that there was no quidding and quoing going on. Sondland explained, in four painfully humiliating pages of new testimony, that on second thoughts there was about $400m of military aid that was entirely quid to the quo of Trump\u2019s kooky obsession with smearing the Biden family.</p> <p>\u201cBy the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement,\u201d Sondland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/05/trump-impeachment-sondland-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-latest\">confessed</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e37a2d5c04b63bc6a5dfb118e31e08d390f70f5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e37a2d5c04b63bc6a5dfb118e31e08d390f70f5e/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Trump said he wanted nothing.

However, diehard fans of Trump may not be familiar with this masterpiece of 1970s pop music, and have spent most of the last several weeks investing great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Ftcz1fI3k\">authority</a> in Gordon\u2019s texts.</p> <p>This would normally be as humiliating as Sondland\u2019s suddenly perfect recall when faced with possible charges of perjury and/or obstruction of Congress. But these are not normal times or normal characters: the giants of Fox News and the congressional Republican party are immune to shame. Losing credibility is a small price to pay when they lost their minds a long time ago.</p> <p>There were clues that Sondland might not be on the level. The ambassador to the European Union was dabbling in the affairs of a country that is not, in fact, part of the EU. He spent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/disruptive-diplomat-gordon-sondland-a-key-figure-in-trump-impeachment-furor-long-coveted-ambassadorship/2019/10/14/c5afb950-ec3f-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html\">lavishly</a> on upgrading his Brussels residence but found that the locals didn\u2019t enjoy his efforts to berate them.</p> <p>He formed <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/15/770482694/wh-replaced-pro-ukraine-staff-with-three-amigos-congress-reportedly-told\">part</a> of a group called \u201cthe three amigos\u201d who displaced the actual Ukraine experts inside the Trump administration. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw7p7tAdVuE\">original</a> Three Amigos were naturally buffoon-like frauds who strayed into a foreign country while pretending to deliver justice.</p> <p>There is something poignant about Sondland, but somehow his vulnerabilities make him seem less likable. For the ambassador was desperate to win the approval of someone who truly cares for nobody but himself: one Donald Trump.</p> <p>After his \u201ccrystal clear\u201d text, Sondland felt he needed to gain even more crystal clarity about Trump\u2019s intentions by calling up the Great Oz himself. \u201cI know in my few previous conversations with the president, he\u2019s not big on small talk, so I would have one shot to ask him,\u201d Sondland <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-revised-testimony-sondland-ties-trump-to-quid-pro-quo/2019/11/05/3059b3b8-ffec-11e9-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html\">explained</a> in his newly accurate testimony. \u201cI asked him one open-ended question: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The reply was as brief as it was contradictory.

      "bodyText": "In every good disaster movie, we get to meet the easily dispensable character: someone who mixes just enough stupidity with just enough mediocrity to be cannon fodder for the impending calamity. In the epic shipwreck of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, that man is Gordon Sondland. Sondland first entered this feature-length catastrophe as an ironic counterpoint to the doomed buffoon who has alternately dismayed and disgusted us for the last three years. To Trump himself, Sondland was once a Never Trumper who first globbed on to the low-energy Jeb before shifting his undying loyalty to little Marco. When neither of those Republican gods were able to confer any honor upon his wealthy shoulders, Sondland did what any principled conservative would do: he wrote a $1m check to Trump and asked for an ambassadorship. To the rest of the world, the entirely expendable Sondland bears an uncanny resemblance to Trump himself. What kind of genius thinks you can lie to an impeachment inquiry by denying the whole quid pro quo deal with Ukraine? Who could ignore the risk that so many witnesses would spill their guts about your central role in the stitch-up of an American ally in desperate need of national security assistance? Step forward, ambassador. It\u2019s time for your brief moment of infamy before you depart this drama, to return only as the answer to an obscure Jeopardy question. Flanked by several lawyers, Sondland decided to \u201creview\u201d his initial testimony to the impeachment investigation that there was no quidding and quoing going on. Sondland explained, in four painfully humiliating pages of new testimony, that on second thoughts there was about $400m of military aid that was entirely quid to the quo of Trump\u2019s kooky obsession with smearing the Biden family. \u201cBy the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement,\u201d Sondland confessed. This is \u2013 how to put it delicately? \u2013 somewhat at odds with Sondland\u2019s classic text message to his fellow quid-pro-quo gangbangers just a few months ago, when he said: \u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind.\u201d That was shortly before he added, \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d As the fans of Jilted John know all too well, Gordon is a moron. However, diehard fans of Trump may not be familiar with this masterpiece of 1970s pop music, and have spent most of the last several weeks investing great authority in Gordon\u2019s texts. This would normally be as humiliating as Sondland\u2019s suddenly perfect recall when faced with possible charges of perjury and/or obstruction of Congress. But these are not normal times or normal characters: the giants of Fox News and the congressional Republican party are immune to shame. Losing credibility is a small price to pay when they lost their minds a long time ago. There were clues that Sondland might not be on the level. The ambassador to the European Union was dabbling in the affairs of a country that is not, in fact, part of the EU. He spent lavishly on upgrading his Brussels residence but found that the locals didn\u2019t enjoy his efforts to berate them. He formed part of a group called \u201cthe three amigos\u201d who displaced the actual Ukraine experts inside the Trump administration. The original Three Amigos were naturally buffoon-like frauds who strayed into a foreign country while pretending to deliver justice. There is something poignant about Sondland, but somehow his vulnerabilities make him seem less likable. For the ambassador was desperate to win the approval of someone who truly cares for nobody but himself: one Donald Trump. After his \u201ccrystal clear\u201d text, Sondland felt he needed to gain even more crystal clarity about Trump\u2019s intentions by calling up the Great Oz himself. \u201cI know in my few previous conversations with the president, he\u2019s not big on small talk, so I would have one shot to ask him,\u201d Sondland explained in his newly accurate testimony. \u201cI asked him one open-ended question: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine?\u2019\u201d The reply was as brief as it was contradictory. Trump said he wanted nothing. Nothing except getting the new Ukraine president to do what he wanted. \u201cAnd that was the end of the conversation,\u201d Sondland testified. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he hung up on me, but it was almost like he hung up on me.\u201d It sounded almost like Sondland\u2019s heart broke a little. Elsewhere in Europe, the foot-soldiers of anarchy are less soft and more brash. They are simple tourists visiting Salisbury cathedral, admiring the spire and the clock while armed with a little novichok nerve agent. They are quirky tea-drinkers at a central London hotel, sprinkling radioactive polonium all across Europe. Trump\u2019s hitmen are even less professional. There is now an overwhelming body of evidence that the quid pro quo was as real as the cover-up; that Trump corruptly used national security aid for personal gain by forcing a foreign government to interfere in an American election. That there were strings attached to American aid is not new. As soon as those strings were tied to Trump\u2019s election, it morphed into something worth locking up in a secure file where only a whistleblower could alert the world that maintains some sense of law and order. \u201cNo amount of salacious media-biased headlines, which are clearly designed to influence the narrative, change the fact that the president has done nothing wrong,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Tuesday. She is correct, this press secretary who refuses to brief the press. The headlines won\u2019t change the narrative about the president\u2019s guilt. But the testimony surely will. \u2022 Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s journey beyond a potential exit from the EU will be fraught, complicated and full of political potholes. Labour wants Brexit sorted, the Liberal Democrats want Brexit stopped and the Conservatives want Brexit done and a free-trade agreement signed by 31 December 2020, the end of the transition period. Time to negotiate a future trading relationship with the EU has already been reduced from two years to 11 months and few experts believe it is possible to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in that time, raising the possibility of crashing out on 31 December 2020. What happens after the election? After the general election, the first thing on the new PM\u2019s in-tray will be to ratify or, if it is Labour, to renegotiate the Brexit deal. If it is Boris Johnson, he will have until 31 January to do so, or risk asking for a further extension. Even that deadline is a challenge. Approval for the Brexit deal comes with the passing of the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB). Theresa May\u2019s version took 11 months to conclude. Johnson argues that much of his deal is in fact based on May\u2019s and therefore it is possible to get it passed in a number of weeks. Johnson\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, has previously said the WAB could take 37 days to get through parliament: 13 days in the Commons, close to 20 in the Lords and four in the so-called \u201cping pong\u201d stage when final wording is agreed. Who will lead the talks? This will be the first flash point in 2020. Will the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) be mothballed? Will the Department for International Trade lead the talks? Or will Downing Street decide, as it did under May and Johnson, to keep a tight rein on negotiations? \u201cI think there is going to be a turf war. A lot may also hinge on what happens to DExEU but, in particular, what sort of No 10 Boris Johnson, if he is prime minister, wants to run. The Foreign Office will also want to reassert itself after a few bruising years and the Treasury will want to have a say about what is in [the negotiating objectives] and what\u2019s not,\u201d said Adam Terry, the practice lead on financial services at consultancy Global Counsel. When do trade talks with the EU and others start and finish? Talks cannot legally start until the withdrawal agreement is approved. Most are assuming the earliest this could happen is 1 February. Once the withdrawal agreement is ratified, the UK can open talks with the EU and other countries. However, it cannot implement a deal with a non-EU country until after Britain has left the bloc. Under the deal struck by May and followed by Johnson, the UK has until the end of December 2020 to conclude its future relationship negotiations. This leaves the government with just 11 months to conclude not just a free-trade deal, but a deal on security and what are known as \u201ccross-cutting\u201d activities, issues that cross many divides such as science, education and international development. Is this an issue for Johnson? Yes. He says if he wins the election, he will complete a free-trade deal by 31 December next year \u2014 in other words within 11 months. Few experts say this is attainable. \u201cThere is a very strong argument that it will not be possible to complete everything necessary to leave with a deal \u2013 negotiations and sorting the practicalities - in 11 months,\u201d says Joe Owen, the director of the Brexit programme at the Institute for Government. The UK has an option, agreed under May\u2019s deal, to extend the transition period for one or two years. This would be a one-off request and has to be made by 1 July. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has said a Conservative government would not ask for a transition extension. Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, told the Brexit select committee last week that the \u201caverage period of time for negotiating a trade agreement is 48 months\u201d, with the additional complication that \u201cnever before have you had an agreement diverging rather than converging\u201d. What are the alternatives? Crash out without a deal on 31 December 2020 and default to World Trade Organization rules, with tariffs on goods coming into the UK. Eurosceptics favour this. Negotiate a bare bones free-trade deal and outline agreement on the rest. Follow May\u2019s and Philip Hammond\u2019s way of thinking and decide a comprehensive and close alignment with the EU is in the best interests of the country. This would almost certainly involve an extension to the transition period of up to two years. What is the UK\u2019s mandate for negotiations? Trade talks conventionally involve both sides drawing up their wish lists, their must-haves and their red lines. The US has already published its negotiation objectives for a trade deal with the UK after consultation with its trade bodies. The European commission will get its mandate after the next meeting of EU leaders in December. The UK, meanwhile, has not yet agreed on its mandate, never mind published its objectives. What are the issues over the objectives? The closer the EU and the UK are, the greater the demands by the EU for Britain to maintain standards, or a level playing field, on food, workers\u2019 rights and other key issues. This is aimed at ensuring it does not become a \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d, able to undercut the bloc with a low-tax, cheap labour economy. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has already warned that consequences will flow from a WTO-style arrangement, saying the British government would face a \u201cproportional\u201d response if it sought to roll back core social, environmental and consumer standards. What are the new government\u2019s options? The next phase of Brexit is characterised as talks on trade. It is not. It is about the entire relationship covering political, cultural and security arrangements. Owen says one option for the government is to pursue three parallel agreements covering trade and data: security and cross-cutting activities that transect Whitehall and societal divides such as science, education and international development. Barnard echoes this, noting the reference in Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal is to \u201cagreements plural\u201d. This raises questions over whether the negotiations could be staggered over time, with a bare bones trade deal covering tariffs struck by the end of 2020, and other outline agreements to progress in other areas in the months and years to come, she says. The \u201ceasiest\u201d deal would be on goods under article 207 of the EU treaty on free-trade deals, which would cover a tariff arrangement on goods alone. \u201cIt is in the interest of the EU to do a trade deal quickly because it has a surplus with the UK,\u201d said Barnard. If Labour takes power, they will seek a closer alignment with the EU and then put it back to the electorate in a referendum, asking voters to choose between its deal and remain. This guarantees an extension to the transition period as renegotiation and referendum planning would take an estimated six months. Anything else? Yes. Politics is one of three important Brexit threads. The other two being legislation and behind-the-scenes planning in Whitehall. However, as Owen points out, it will be a mammoth task to get just the arrangements for Northern Ireland \u2013 the IT systems, new staff and business readiness \u2013 up and running within 11 months. HMRC will have to start work immediately on putting a new border in the Irish sea with next to no groundwork done in the last three years. Owen points out that businesses were given 14 months to become familiar with a new HMRC system in 2011, yet the Brexit deal calls for a new system to be designed, developed and implemented successfully within 11 months \u2013 a Herculean, if not impossible, task. A huge legislative programme on laws such as immigration will accompany Brexit raising the potential of parliament being gridlocked again over Brexit. Is the UK still planning for a no-deal Brexit? No-deal planning will have to continue until the decision is known on the transition period extension, presenting a challenge for Gove, who may have ambitions for a leading role in negotiations.",

      "bodyText": "Days after bowing out as Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow has described Brexit as the biggest mistake Britain has made since the second world war. Bercow, who was persistently accused of bias by Brexit-backing MPs during his term as Speaker, gave a valedictory speech to the Foreign Press Association, revealing himself to be a remainer. \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps the UK. Brexit is the biggest mistake of this country after the war. I respect [the] prime minister, [Boris] Johnson, but Brexit doesn\u2019t help us. It\u2019s better to be part of the [EU] power bloc,\u201d Bercow said, according to the journalist Antonello Guerrera, of La Repubblica, who attended the event in London. However, Bercow rejected the idea he had blocked Brexit, insisting \u201cit was parliament\u201d that had prevented Britain from leaving before now, \u201cnot me\u201d. The former Speaker is stepping down as an MP after representing the constituency of Buckingham for the Conservatives since 1997. He plans to publish a book about his life next year and is expected to join the lucrative after-dinner speaking circuit. During his decade-long stint in the Speaker\u2019s chair, Bercow championed the rights of backbenchers, making urgent questions a prominent part of the parliamentary day, for example. In recent months, he has been accused of bending the rules to allow rebel backbench MPs such as Dominic Grieve and Hilary Benn to constrain the government\u2019s room for manoeuvre \u2013 including by passing the so-called Benn act, which forced Johnson to request a delay to Brexit. At the event, Bercow said: \u201cI respect the prime minister and he has the right to do what he did also in the House of Commons. But my job was to stand up for the rights of the House of Commons. No apology for championing the rights of parliament.\u201d He rejected recent comments by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who described Westminster as a \u201czombie parliament\u201d. \u201cHe has the material disadvantage of being totally wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament is no disgrace at all and did its job well.\u201d Bercow has been replaced as Speaker by the Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle, from Chorley in Lancashire.",

The government has defended its drought policy, pointing to at least $7bn in funding, which includes a $5bn future drought fund that will begin making payments next year. The government was forced to defend the operation of its drought communities program after one council in regional Victoria rejected a $1m grant because it was not in drought. Grants have also been spent on projects with little connection to the drought, including toilet upgrades and music festivals, while concerns have been raised internally about small councils receiving the same funding as larger councils.",

      "body": "<p>Stories and mathematics have always been woven together in my mind \u2013 two foundational ways of looking at the world, not incompatible but complementary. When I was growing up, my mother told me myths and fairytales at bedtime, while my father recounted stories of famous mathematicians and gave me his favourite maths riddles to try to solve. Which is maybe why in my new novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-tenth-muse-9781408709580.html\">The Tenth Muse</a>, I try to bring the two together, while challenging the many mistaken assumptions people hold about maths. My protagonist is a brilliant and ambitious mathematician who happens to be a woman tackling one of her subject\u2019s most pressing conundrums.</p> <p>I hope her journey provides a history of mathematics and the ways it has changed the world, the challenges women in particular have faced in trying to join its professional ranks, and a glimpse of how exhilarating it can be. My favourite kind of maths reveals the outer reaches of the imagination and how in finding a solution it is possible to illuminate an idea. Maths can shine a light on both the simplest and most complex things; the same is true of my favourite literature.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re in search of a glorious read packed with mathematical thoughts, here is a list of some of the most inventive, mind-bending, wondrous books I know:</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/25/the-guardian-view-on-alice-in-wonderland-a-dauntless-no-nonsense-heroine\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll</a><br></strong>Many assume this book \u2013 with its pills and potions and magic mushrooms \u2013 is about drugs. But scholar Melanie Bayley <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391-600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved/\">suggests it owes its mind-bending quality to maths</a>. Carroll was the pen name for mathematician Charles Dodgson, who disliked the symbolic algebra and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry\">projective geometry</a> that were gaining favour in his day. He satirised them by taking them to their most bizarre extremes: Alice\u2019s height fluctuates rather than staying constant, the multiplication table falls off base 10, and when Alice grows back after an episode of shrinking, she finds herself all out of proportion. Though Carroll may not have been a fan of this kind of maths, his experimental, perception-distorting Wonderland makes an irresistible case for the exhilarating playfulness of maths and the mind\u2019s infinite weirdness.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-phantom-tollbooth-9780007263486.html\">The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster</a></strong><br>Milo comes upon a road sign directing him to Digitopolis, which is five miles, 1,600 Rods, 8,800 yards, 26,400 feet, 316,800 inches and 633,600 half-inches away. \u201cLet\u2019s travel by miles,\u201d advises the Humbug. \u201cIt\u2019s shorter.\u201d Milo responds: \u201cLet\u2019s travel by half-inches, it\u2019s quicker.\u201d Soon after, they are led by a creature called the Dodecahedron to their destination, where they learn about the land of Infinity, and Milo meets one half of a child (or 0.58 of a child, to be precise) who represents the fraction of the average family that has 2.58 children. An enchanting exploration of how to pay attention to the world, full of wisdom, logic puzzles and fun.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-brothers-karamazov-9780140449242.html\">The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky</a></strong><br>Ivan\u2019s love for the sticky leaves in spring, his longing for and subsequent rejection of harmony and forgiveness, since it demands he accept the suffering of children, have stayed with me, along with this passage tying those ideas to maths: \u201cIf God indeed created the Earth,\u201d he says, \u201che created it according to the geometry of Euclid and the human mind \u2026 Yet there have been geometricians and philosophers [who] even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on Earth, may meet somewhere in infinity.\u201d The year I read this was the same year I learned about hyperbolic space, where \u2013 as it turns out \u2013 parallel lines can and do meet.

      "bodyText": "Stories and mathematics have always been woven together in my mind \u2013 two foundational ways of looking at the world, not incompatible but complementary. When I was growing up, my mother told me myths and fairytales at bedtime, while my father recounted stories of famous mathematicians and gave me his favourite maths riddles to try to solve. Which is maybe why in my new novel, The Tenth Muse, I try to bring the two together, while challenging the many mistaken assumptions people hold about maths. My protagonist is a brilliant and ambitious mathematician who happens to be a woman tackling one of her subject\u2019s most pressing conundrums. I hope her journey provides a history of mathematics and the ways it has changed the world, the challenges women in particular have faced in trying to join its professional ranks, and a glimpse of how exhilarating it can be. My favourite kind of maths reveals the outer reaches of the imagination and how in finding a solution it is possible to illuminate an idea. Maths can shine a light on both the simplest and most complex things; the same is true of my favourite literature. So if you\u2019re in search of a glorious read packed with mathematical thoughts, here is a list of some of the most inventive, mind-bending, wondrous books I know: 1. Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll Many assume this book \u2013 with its pills and potions and magic mushrooms \u2013 is about drugs. But scholar Melanie Bayley suggests it owes its mind-bending quality to maths. Carroll was the pen name for mathematician Charles Dodgson, who disliked the symbolic algebra and projective geometry that were gaining favour in his day. He satirised them by taking them to their most bizarre extremes: Alice\u2019s height fluctuates rather than staying constant, the multiplication table falls off base 10, and when Alice grows back after an episode of shrinking, she finds herself all out of proportion. Though Carroll may not have been a fan of this kind of maths, his experimental, perception-distorting Wonderland makes an irresistible case for the exhilarating playfulness of maths and the mind\u2019s infinite weirdness. 2. The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster Milo comes upon a road sign directing him to Digitopolis, which is five miles, 1,600 Rods, 8,800 yards, 26,400 feet, 316,800 inches and 633,600 half-inches away. \u201cLet\u2019s travel by miles,\u201d advises the Humbug. \u201cIt\u2019s shorter.\u201d Milo responds: \u201cLet\u2019s travel by half-inches, it\u2019s quicker.\u201d Soon after, they are led by a creature called the Dodecahedron to their destination, where they learn about the land of Infinity, and Milo meets one half of a child (or 0.58 of a child, to be precise) who represents the fraction of the average family that has 2.58 children. An enchanting exploration of how to pay attention to the world, full of wisdom, logic puzzles and fun. 3. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky Ivan\u2019s love for the sticky leaves in spring, his longing for and subsequent rejection of harmony and forgiveness, since it demands he accept the suffering of children, have stayed with me, along with this passage tying those ideas to maths: \u201cIf God indeed created the Earth,\u201d he says, \u201che created it according to the geometry of Euclid and the human mind \u2026 Yet there have been geometricians and philosophers [who] even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on Earth, may meet somewhere in infinity.\u201d The year I read this was the same year I learned about hyperbolic space, where \u2013 as it turns out \u2013 parallel lines can and do meet. I became a maths major: how could I resist? 4. Too Much Happiness by Alice Munro Sofia Kovalevskaya was a 19th-century mathematician at a time when women were not allowed in most of Europe to attend university. She married a man who promised to take her to Germany to study, and she became a pioneer, making major contributions to the field and becoming the first woman in Europe to obtain a doctorate in mathematics. Still, her life was filled with tragedy and disappointment, and the title story of Alice Munro\u2019s collection is a rich but searing fictional account of her life. 5. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams In this jubilantly madcap novel, we\u2019re asked to consider bistromathematics, where the relationship between the items on the bill, the cost of each and the number of people at the table proves that: \u201cNumbers written on restaurant cheques within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s the very precision of mathematics, its very seriousness, that makes it so delightful to see it used in the service of nonsense. 6. The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa An astoundingly lovely book about a woman who comes to work for a once-great mathematician. Due to a traumatic brain injury, he has only 80 minutes of short-term memory available to him before he forgets everything. Also about kindness and love, loyalty and loss, it is filled with beautiful maths, simply and clearly described alongside finely drawn relationships between the characters. 7. The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin In the ancient world, maths, physics, and philosophy were studied together as \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d.

Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang This collection contains several maths-y stories, my favourite of which is Division By Zero, about a brilliant mathematician. To her great despair, she ends up proving that mathematics is inconsistent (and is able to prove that any two numbers are equal). A beautiful, thought-provoking story (in a beautiful, thought-provoking collection) about belief, understanding, faith and love. 9. The Ore Miner\u2019s Wife by Karl Iagnemma This absolutely gorgeous story from Iagnemma\u2019s collection On the Nature of Human Romantic Interaction is about a miner who thinks he\u2019s discovered the proof to the problem: construct a square, equal in area to a given circle.

      "body": "<p>Pop culture is usually a comfortable distraction, but sometimes it can wake you up. Take the Turkish rap epic Susamam, which translates as I Can\u2019t Stay Silent: a 14-verse manifesto for a generation fed up with complicity, and the largest collaboration in the history of Turkish rap. For a quarter of an hour, 19 artists challenge a litany of social issues, ranging from domestic violence to animal rights and police brutality. It got 20m hits on YouTube in the first week alone.</p> <p>What makes the track even more impressive is the climate in which it was born: Turkey\u2019s record on freedom of expression has taken an abysmal turn in recent years. Turkey is now the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/01/16/turkey-leads-the-world-in-jailed-journalists\">top jailer of journalists worldwide</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44519112\">tens of thousands have been imprisoned</a> in political witch-hunts that followed a failed military coup in 2016. With the nation now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/syria-turkey-conflict-kurds-border-fighting-trump-deaths\">in active conflict in neighbouring Syria</a>, it is common to see daily news reports of people jailed for something as simple as social media posts \u2013 even posting messages opposing war is <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/tr/t%C3%BCrkiyede-sava%C5%9Fa-hay%C4%B1r-demenin-bedeli/a-50848308\">considered support for terrorism</a>.</p> <p>In such a stifled climate, Susamam prompted widespread acclaim and condemnation. Turkey is no less polarised than Brexit Britain or Trump\u2019s America; Susaman has been lauded as a protest anthem by some, and <a href=\"https://www.yenisafak.com/hayat/pkk-feto-ortak-produksiyonu-3505308\">labelled a \u201cterrorist co-production\u201d</a> by one pro-government tabloid.

I did this project to unite people, because these are everybody\u2019s problems. They\u2019re global issues we all face every day.\u201d</p> <p>The video begins with two relatively innocuous verses about human arrogance when it comes to destroying the environment, before going straight for the jugular. Set behind prison bars, \u015eani\u015fer fires back at a cellmate shocked at how citizens watch their every step, fearing the police: \u201cInnocent men rotting in jail without knowing why? It\u2019s all your fault! / This horrifying picture is your creation / Corrupt MPs, getting rich leeching on the backs of the poor / You sat by and called killers \u2018justified\u2019 because they are cops / You didn\u2019t say a word, which means you\u2019re guilty / Now the \u2018justice\u2019 you thought would protect you will come knocking at your door / When they falsely arrest you one night / No journalist will report it \u2013 they\u2019re all imprisoned.\u201d</p> <p>With cultural influencers under heightened scrutiny in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/erdogan-lonely-path-to-ruin-turkey-simon-tisdall\">the authoritarian \u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/erdogan-lonely-path-to-ruin-turkey-simon-tisdall\">new Turkey\u201d</a>, Susamam\u2019s artists had to choose their words wisely. Rappers have been <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ezhel-arrested-turkey-rapper-lyrics-drug-use-promotion-wiz-khalifa-latest-updates-a8369296.html\">jailed for lyrics</a> that \u201cpromote criminality\u201d, so to dodge censors, the MCs shirk partisan politics and instead, like \u015eani\u015fer does, invite the listener to reflect inward: for each time you avoid eye contact with the homeless or, if you\u2019re a man, fail to question if your status at the top of the pyramid is a privilege you really want to have. \u201cIn that jail scene, I\u2019m criticising myself,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018white Turk\u2019, we\u2019re the people who had the chance to think and act, and we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s Susamam\u2019s message.\u201d</p> <p>Its message is subversively crafted to transcend Turkey\u2019s political battlegrounds. \u201cIf someone who doesn\u2019t have the same political views as me listens to one part about the traffic problems, or animal rights, and agrees with it, he\u2019s also listening to something he wouldn\u2019t normally hear,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the first way to change people, by making them listen to another person\u2019s side of the story.\u201d In a divisive time, perhaps it\u2019s the approach that\u2019s needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf0e5766fbc448d7d25e6008f8a6a587817edcd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf0e5766fbc448d7d25e6008f8a6a587817edcd3/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Why are the males at the top of the pyramid?\u2019 ...

Grounded more in the tradition of spoken word and poetry of the Middle East and Asia than western hip-hop culture, Turkish rap has its own rhythmic grammar. The language\u2019s jumbling syllables demand a lyricist chop bars more like a syncopating freestyler, than depend on the beat to carry their verse.</p> <p>With few paths for artists to sign big-break record deals, the genre remains underground, making rap shows one of the few remaining free outlets of Turkish political consciousness. The typical attendees are young men coming after long work shifts, unable to understand the English lyrics of western rap, or relate to the high-flying materialist culture it comes from. Civil war, pogroms and jingoism are all in the Middle East\u2019s recent past \u2013 so empty materialism doesn\u2019t impress crowds. \u201cMusic is an art, but anything that makes money gets corrupted,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cI used to think that rappers were all against the system, against the inequality it creates, but I realised that many of them were just poor.\u201d</p> <p>Turkey has always struggled to have a single identity, despite nationalist politicians pushing the idea. A new generation, fed up with the patrimonial past, want to create something homegrown they can be proud of, and finding it in lyrics such as: \u201cHate is your weapon \u2026 Our weapon is our words!\u201d</p> <p>Full of juxtapositions and familiar references, Susamam goes on (and on), at times veering to the saccharine tone of a We Are the World reboot. One section reflects on traffic accidents, which kill 10,000 people <a href=\"https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_traffic/countrywork/tur/en/\">in Turkey</a> every year; a section on suicide pulls at heartstrings, while another on education sets alight the lie of meritocracy (the chief of Turkey\u2019s Central Bank was condemned for <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkeys-new-central-bank-governor-under-fire-over-plagiarism-allegations\">plagiarising</a> his masters dissertation, but is still in office).</p> <p>Susamam, whose film has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5K3IxINr7A\">the option of English subtitles</a>, also takes aim at issues that are as global as they are specific to Turkey. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our conscience as a species \u2013 we\u2019ve become programmed, obsessed with chasing growth and profit,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cThe root cause of these problems is wild capitalism, and this is a problem not just affecting Turkey.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac1ded5b16a0db0350848a8f68818f8e03aeb3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1ded5b16a0db0350848a8f68818f8e03aeb3bf/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Sardonic ...

      "bodyText": "Pop culture is usually a comfortable distraction, but sometimes it can wake you up. Take the Turkish rap epic Susamam, which translates as I Can\u2019t Stay Silent: a 14-verse manifesto for a generation fed up with complicity, and the largest collaboration in the history of Turkish rap. For a quarter of an hour, 19 artists challenge a litany of social issues, ranging from domestic violence to animal rights and police brutality. It got 20m hits on YouTube in the first week alone. What makes the track even more impressive is the climate in which it was born: Turkey\u2019s record on freedom of expression has taken an abysmal turn in recent years. Turkey is now the top jailer of journalists worldwide, and tens of thousands have been imprisoned in political witch-hunts that followed a failed military coup in 2016. With the nation now in active conflict in neighbouring Syria, it is common to see daily news reports of people jailed for something as simple as social media posts \u2013 even posting messages opposing war is considered support for terrorism. In such a stifled climate, Susamam prompted widespread acclaim and condemnation. Turkey is no less polarised than Brexit Britain or Trump\u2019s America; Susaman has been lauded as a protest anthem by some, and labelled a \u201cterrorist co-production\u201d by one pro-government tabloid. And its creative mastermind doesn\u2019t even have a record deal. Rapper \u015eani\u015fer, who spearheaded the collaboration, says: \u201cMy first reaction was genuine sadness, for the state of my country, of the world. I did this project to unite people, because these are everybody\u2019s problems. They\u2019re global issues we all face every day.\u201d The video begins with two relatively innocuous verses about human arrogance when it comes to destroying the environment, before going straight for the jugular. Set behind prison bars, \u015eani\u015fer fires back at a cellmate shocked at how citizens watch their every step, fearing the police: \u201cInnocent men rotting in jail without knowing why? It\u2019s all your fault! / This horrifying picture is your creation / Corrupt MPs, getting rich leeching on the backs of the poor / You sat by and called killers \u2018justified\u2019 because they are cops / You didn\u2019t say a word, which means you\u2019re guilty / Now the \u2018justice\u2019 you thought would protect you will come knocking at your door / When they falsely arrest you one night / No journalist will report it \u2013 they\u2019re all imprisoned.\u201d With cultural influencers under heightened scrutiny in the authoritarian \u201cnew Turkey\u201d, Susamam\u2019s artists had to choose their words wisely. Rappers have been jailed for lyrics that \u201cpromote criminality\u201d, so to dodge censors, the MCs shirk partisan politics and instead, like \u015eani\u015fer does, invite the listener to reflect inward: for each time you avoid eye contact with the homeless or, if you\u2019re a man, fail to question if your status at the top of the pyramid is a privilege you really want to have. \u201cIn that jail scene, I\u2019m criticising myself,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018white Turk\u2019, we\u2019re the people who had the chance to think and act, and we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s Susamam\u2019s message.\u201d Its message is subversively crafted to transcend Turkey\u2019s political battlegrounds. \u201cIf someone who doesn\u2019t have the same political views as me listens to one part about the traffic problems, or animal rights, and agrees with it, he\u2019s also listening to something he wouldn\u2019t normally hear,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the first way to change people, by making them listen to another person\u2019s side of the story.\u201d In a divisive time, perhaps it\u2019s the approach that\u2019s needed. As a major pop culture and commercial force, rap is relatively young in Turkey, and it is still music many parents would forbid their children to listen to. Grounded more in the tradition of spoken word and poetry of the Middle East and Asia than western hip-hop culture, Turkish rap has its own rhythmic grammar. The language\u2019s jumbling syllables demand a lyricist chop bars more like a syncopating freestyler, than depend on the beat to carry their verse. With few paths for artists to sign big-break record deals, the genre remains underground, making rap shows one of the few remaining free outlets of Turkish political consciousness. The typical attendees are young men coming after long work shifts, unable to understand the English lyrics of western rap, or relate to the high-flying materialist culture it comes from. Civil war, pogroms and jingoism are all in the Middle East\u2019s recent past \u2013 so empty materialism doesn\u2019t impress crowds. \u201cMusic is an art, but anything that makes money gets corrupted,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cI used to think that rappers were all against the system, against the inequality it creates, but I realised that many of them were just poor.\u201d Turkey has always struggled to have a single identity, despite nationalist politicians pushing the idea. A new generation, fed up with the patrimonial past, want to create something homegrown they can be proud of, and finding it in lyrics such as: \u201cHate is your weapon \u2026 Our weapon is our words!\u201d Full of juxtapositions and familiar references, Susamam goes on (and on), at times veering to the saccharine tone of a We Are the World reboot. One section reflects on traffic accidents, which kill 10,000 people in Turkey every year; a section on suicide pulls at heartstrings, while another on education sets alight the lie of meritocracy (the chief of Turkey\u2019s Central Bank was condemned for plagiarising his masters dissertation, but is still in office). Susamam, whose film has the option of English subtitles, also takes aim at issues that are as global as they are specific to Turkey. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our conscience as a species \u2013 we\u2019ve become programmed, obsessed with chasing growth and profit,\u201d \u015eani\u015fer says. \u201cThe root cause of these problems is wild capitalism, and this is a problem not just affecting Turkey.\u201d The chapter on women\u2019s rights stands out for its raw gravity. Taking a break from rap, it features the only female vocalist, Deniz Tekin (although Turkey does have female MCs) singing a sardonic ballad, pretending to be oblivious to the daily curse of being a woman in a violently patriarchal world, cut with real video and audio clips of violence against women. \u201cThis is a huge problem in Turkish culture,\u201d explains Fuat Ergin, the first artist on Susamam, and one of the originators of the Turkish rap scene back in the 80s. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a guy who can\u2019t deal with a divorce, so he kills his wife \u2013 they get a \u2018discount\u2019 on the prison sentence, and these guys get huge respect inside the jail, because he did something to redeem his honour. This is how people see things here.\u201d There\u2019s a Turkish idiom that goes: \u201cYou\u2019re a male, but not a man.\u201d The section\u2019s lyrics challenge that machismo mentality by flipping it to:\u201cYou\u2019re a man but not a human.\u201d Fuat says: \u201cThis is an arrow that we\u2019re shooting through the heart of their honour culture.\u201d The track continues: \u201cWhy are the males at the top of the pyramid, in the nation, at home, or in the metro?\u201d \u2013 a reference to Istanbul\u2019s Metrobus system, notoriously avoided by women for its unchecked sexual harassment. Susamam takes its most abstract philosophical turns just when it comes to the most controversial items on the political agenda. Rapper Ozbi, the only Kurdish artist in the project, ruminates on his existence; in a country where Wikipedia has been banned for years, he asks: \u201cIs understanding banned, too?\u201d Speaking Kurdish was banned for decades, and though Kurds have gained significant cultural rights, they still face discrimination as second-class citizens. Ozbi\u2019s questioning is necessary for political action, and though the video was produced before Donald Trump pulled the US out of the region, reigniting fighting between Turks and Kurds, its message is relevant as ever. Susamam traces a path forward that, disastrously, is not being offered by Turkey\u2019s political climate. \u201cThe point of this song is that it\u2019s possible to live together in peace and walk this way without killing each other, without the vendettas. It\u2019s possible,\u201d Fuat says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very painful process to forget all the blood. Many families lost their sons and daughters, on both sides.

      "body": "<p>My friend Nigel Cross, who has died aged 66, coolly straddled the worlds of literature and international development.</p> <p>Born in Cambridge to Barry Cross, a university academic who became president of Corpus Christi College, and his wife, Audrey (nee Crow), Nigel was educated at Clifton college, Bristol, and Sussex University, where he studied English.</p> <p>In 1974, following graduation, he was working in a bar on Exmoor when he met <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1546039/Victor-Bonham-Carter.html\" title=\"\">Victor Bonham-Carter</a>, the president of <a href=\"https://www.exmoorsociety.com/\" title=\"\">the Exmoor Society</a> and secretary of the <a href=\"https://www.rlf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Literary Fund</a> (RLF). Victor recognised Nigel\u2019s bookish aspirations and found him a job as the fund\u2019s archivist, a post he held until 1984. With access to its papers of struggling authors, he wrote The Common Writer: Life in Nineteenth-Century Grub Street, published in 1985. He also produced combative book reviews for publications including the Spectator and the New Statesman. </p> <p>In 1975, he began a PhD in literary history at University College London, where he met his first wife, Caroline Dakers, now a professor of cultural history at Central Saint Martins in London. The couple married in 1980 and had two daughters, Harriet and Madeline.</p> <p>Restless in the literary world, Nigel began travelling abroad in the late 1970s. I met him during this time, and \u2013 hoping to get involved in international development \u2013 he and I set up the short-lived Arid Lands Research Agency in response to the Sahelian drought of the 70s.</p> <p>In 1983 Nigel became director of <a href=\"https://sahel.org.uk/about/\" title=\"\">SOS Sahel</a> in London, which runs development programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Witty, self-effacing and assured, he used his skills as a communicator to coax money from donors and form a successful alliance of similar organisations in other countries, which now operates as <a href=\"http://sossahel.ngo/\" title=\"\">SOS Sahel International</a>.</p> <p>In 1994 he moved to the Panos Institute (now the <a href=\"https://panosnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">Panos Network)</a>, which promotes media and communication in the developing world. His achievements there led to him being hired in 1999 to head the<a href=\"https://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"> International Institute for Environment and Development</a>.</p> <p>However he had bouts of depression for which, in his own words, he \u201csought no treatment, preferring to drink and read poetry\u201d. His health and relationships suffered as a result of his alcoholism, which contributed to his divorce in 2010 and later to his death.</p> <p>Professionally, he yearned for a return to the field. After a short interlude as a professorial fellow at Soas University of London he joined the Dutch development agency <a href=\"https://snv.org/\" title=\"\">SNV</a> in 2008 as its director in South Sudan \u2013 a challenging period for that country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/10/south-sudan-celebrates-independence\" title=\"\">as it neared independence</a>.</p> <p>There he met a Ugandan colleague, Josephine Namusisi, whom he married in 2014. Latterly he lived between his book-strewn house in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and hers in Kampala.</p> <p>He is survived by Josephine, Harriet and Madeline.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend Nigel Cross, who has died aged 66, coolly straddled the worlds of literature and international development. Born in Cambridge to Barry Cross, a university academic who became president of Corpus Christi College, and his wife, Audrey (nee Crow), Nigel was educated at Clifton college, Bristol, and Sussex University, where he studied English. In 1974, following graduation, he was working in a bar on Exmoor when he met Victor Bonham-Carter, the president of the Exmoor Society and secretary of the Royal Literary Fund (RLF). Victor recognised Nigel\u2019s bookish aspirations and found him a job as the fund\u2019s archivist, a post he held until 1984. With access to its papers of struggling authors, he wrote The Common Writer: Life in Nineteenth-Century Grub Street, published in 1985. He also produced combative book reviews for publications including the Spectator and the New Statesman. In 1975, he began a PhD in literary history at University College London, where he met his first wife, Caroline Dakers, now a professor of cultural history at Central Saint Martins in London. The couple married in 1980 and had two daughters, Harriet and Madeline. Restless in the literary world, Nigel began travelling abroad in the late 1970s. I met him during this time, and \u2013 hoping to get involved in international development \u2013 he and I set up the short-lived Arid Lands Research Agency in response to the Sahelian drought of the 70s. In 1983 Nigel became director of SOS Sahel in London, which runs development programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Witty, self-effacing and assured, he used his skills as a communicator to coax money from donors and form a successful alliance of similar organisations in other countries, which now operates as SOS Sahel International. In 1994 he moved to the Panos Institute (now the Panos Network), which promotes media and communication in the developing world. His achievements there led to him being hired in 1999 to head the International Institute for Environment and Development. However he had bouts of depression for which, in his own words, he \u201csought no treatment, preferring to drink and read poetry\u201d. His health and relationships suffered as a result of his alcoholism, which contributed to his divorce in 2010 and later to his death. Professionally, he yearned for a return to the field. After a short interlude as a professorial fellow at Soas University of London he joined the Dutch development agency SNV in 2008 as its director in South Sudan \u2013 a challenging period for that country as it neared independence. There he met a Ugandan colleague, Josephine Namusisi, whom he married in 2014. Latterly he lived between his book-strewn house in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and hers in Kampala. He is survived by Josephine, Harriet and Madeline.",

      "body": "<p>Isabel Waidner\u2019s Goldsmiths prize-shortlisted second novel is a dizzying 113-page disquisition on working-class culture, queerness, race and vanished empire. Set largely in a \u201cno-star hotel\u201d in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, it crackles with sly subversive wit and rage at the inequities of life in contemporary Britain.</p> <p>In a series of surreal episodes, the unnamed narrator, who we are told is an \u201cEU national\u201d, and Shae, described as \u201ca second-generation economic migrant\u201d, endure minimum-wage work at the hotel, while joyously revelling in their otherness. Shae is \u201cworking class and also queer (there\u2019s no hiding it)\u201d. They (as Shae, the narrator and Waidner all prefer to be identified) are \u201clooking for their parent\u201d, while the narrator is preparing to take the Life in the UK test, an ordeal replete with trick questions (\u201cWho wrote \u2018The Daffodil?\u2019\u201d).</p> <p>Along the way, there are run-ins with gay Ukip activists, and local youths with Staffies \u201cvaping outside Wimpy\u201d. The narrator and Shae also struggle with fantastical, shapeshifting creatures, such as a group of \u201cecological refugees (the polar bears) and African elopers I mean antelopes (the reeboks)\u201d, and a \u201clypard\u201d, an allusion to William Blake\u2019s \u201cThe Tyger\u201d, one of four canonical poems in the Life in the UK test. The hotel\u2019s tyrannical manager, House Mother Normal, has migrated from BS Johnson\u2019s radical eponymous novel of 1971. None of which seems anomalous in a book that deliberately uses intertextuality, the lives of marginalised communities and intersectional discourse as a form of cultural resistance.</p> <p>This might make the novel appear overly earnest, yet its Situationist delight in disrupting normative society is infectious. A sense of free association is everywhere, giving the prose a ludic whimsicality that nevertheless conceals a knuckle-duster. As the narrator comments, on reading a scene of bestiality by BS Johnson: \u201cGhastly, really, but funny. Funny\u2019s important \u2026 (Some BS there, B.S.?)\u201d Or on their resemblance to the character Eleven from the Netflix series <em>Stranger Things</em>: \u201cI\u2019m giving off child with supernatural abilities levels of outsider weirdness.\u201d</p> <p>When the hotel is visited by officers from the Isle of Wight Immigration Enforcement Unit, the narrator uses these powers to lasso them. The novel ends with entries from Sandown Zoo\u2019s Visitors\u2019 Book, a \u201cslum\u201d zoo that comes to stand for the UK itself post EU referendum: \u201cThis is a con\u201d; \u201cDesolate\u201d; \u201cHeartbreaking\u201d.</p> <p>In a recent interview, Waidner said they were \u201cagainst the idea that formally innovative literature now should be this rarefied thing, of interest to an elite readership\u201d. <em>We Are Made of Diamond Stuff</em> might be the most engaging state-of-the-nation fiction since Anthony Cartwright\u2019s Brexit novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/23/the-cut-by-anthony-cartwright-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Cut</em></a>. Daringly experimental, this is the cutting edge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Isabel Waidner\u2019s Goldsmiths prize-shortlisted second novel is a dizzying 113-page disquisition on working-class culture, queerness, race and vanished empire. Set largely in a \u201cno-star hotel\u201d in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, it crackles with sly subversive wit and rage at the inequities of life in contemporary Britain. In a series of surreal episodes, the unnamed narrator, who we are told is an \u201cEU national\u201d, and Shae, described as \u201ca second-generation economic migrant\u201d, endure minimum-wage work at the hotel, while joyously revelling in their otherness. Shae is \u201cworking class and also queer (there\u2019s no hiding it)\u201d. They (as Shae, the narrator and Waidner all prefer to be identified) are \u201clooking for their parent\u201d, while the narrator is preparing to take the Life in the UK test, an ordeal replete with trick questions (\u201cWho wrote \u2018The Daffodil?\u2019\u201d). Along the way, there are run-ins with gay Ukip activists, and local youths with Staffies \u201cvaping outside Wimpy\u201d. The narrator and Shae also struggle with fantastical, shapeshifting creatures, such as a group of \u201cecological refugees (the polar bears) and African elopers I mean antelopes (the reeboks)\u201d, and a \u201clypard\u201d, an allusion to William Blake\u2019s \u201cThe Tyger\u201d, one of four canonical poems in the Life in the UK test. The hotel\u2019s tyrannical manager, House Mother Normal, has migrated from BS Johnson\u2019s radical eponymous novel of 1971. None of which seems anomalous in a book that deliberately uses intertextuality, the lives of marginalised communities and intersectional discourse as a form of cultural resistance. This might make the novel appear overly earnest, yet its Situationist delight in disrupting normative society is infectious. A sense of free association is everywhere, giving the prose a ludic whimsicality that nevertheless conceals a knuckle-duster. As the narrator comments, on reading a scene of bestiality by BS Johnson: \u201cGhastly, really, but funny. Funny\u2019s important \u2026 (Some BS there, B.S.?)\u201d Or on their resemblance to the character Eleven from the Netflix series Stranger Things: \u201cI\u2019m giving off child with supernatural abilities levels of outsider weirdness.\u201d When the hotel is visited by officers from the Isle of Wight Immigration Enforcement Unit, the narrator uses these powers to lasso them. The novel ends with entries from Sandown Zoo\u2019s Visitors\u2019 Book, a \u201cslum\u201d zoo that comes to stand for the UK itself post EU referendum: \u201cThis is a con\u201d; \u201cDesolate\u201d; \u201cHeartbreaking\u201d. In a recent interview, Waidner said they were \u201cagainst the idea that formally innovative literature now should be this rarefied thing, of interest to an elite readership\u201d. We Are Made of Diamond Stuff might be the most engaging state-of-the-nation fiction since Anthony Cartwright\u2019s Brexit novel, The Cut. Daringly experimental, this is the cutting edge.",

The PSOE and their conservative rivals in the People\u2019s party (PP) ruled for decades until their duopoly was challenged by the emergence of the anti-austerity Podemos (We Can) party and the centre-right Citizens party.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The political picture has been further complicated by the advent of Vox, the first far-right party to win more than a single seat in congress since Spain\u2019s return to democracy, and by the appearance of M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, a new leftwing party led by I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos.</p>\n    <p>That means there are now three parties chasing votes on the left, and three chasing votes on the right.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What will happen on Sunday? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The PSOE is once again expected to finish first, but it will almost certainly fall well short of a majority and could lose a few of the 123 seats it won last time. The PP is predicted to rally after April\u2019s abysmal performance, Citizens to plummet, Unidas Podemos to dip slightly, and Vox to surge ahead, possibly becoming the third biggest party in congress.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>And then? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Back to the negotiating table and a familiar sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. With rightwing parties unlikely to win the 176 seats needed for a majority in the 350-seat parliament between them, it will again be up the PSOE to try to cut a deal with Podemos and others to regain office. Past experiences suggest the negotiations will be long, difficult and quite possibly fruitless. Other parties may need to break the impasse by abstaining so that the PSOE can resume power as a minority government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three years after Podemos was widely \u2013 but incorrectly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/spanish-elections-exit-polls-show-deadlock-likely-to-continue\">predicted to leapfrog</a> the Socialists to become Spain\u2019s leading leftwing party, the talk is once again of a <em>sorpasso</em> (overtaking).</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that everything that\u2019s happened in Catalonia in reaction to the sentence has completely captured the public agenda,\u201d said Guillem Vidal, a postdoctoral researcher at the Berlin Social Science Centre. \u201cWhat it\u2019s done, deep down, is polarise the whole national political agenda.

      "bodyText": "Barcelona no longer goes to bed to the smell of smoke, the whoop of sirens or the clattering of helicopters. Three weeks after violent unrest greeted the Spanish supreme court\u2019s decision to jail nine Catalan separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in the failed push for regional independence two years ago, the city is slowly returning to something resembling normality. While sporadic roadblocks set up by protesters have become just another irritation of urban life and rubbish piles up on the streets after most of the bins in central Barcelona were burned on the barricades, the true impact may be more accurately measured on Sunday when Spain holds its fourth general election in as many years. The Catalan question is once again dominating the political debate and could help the far-right Vox party surge into third place, its best-ever result. The socialist government of the caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has sought to cool tensions while also criticising the pro-independence Catalan regional government for taking too long to condemn the violence and for continuing to peddle what it terms secessionist fantasies. But its stance has angered rightwing Spanish parties, who have demanded a much tougher approach and attacked S\u00e1nchez for being too soft in the face of the enduring threat to Spain\u2019s national unity. Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), said in a debate on Monday night that S\u00e1nchez did not believe \u201cin the Spanish nation\u201d, while Santiago Abascal, the Vox leader, referred to events in Catalonia as \u201ca permanent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d. S\u00e1nchez retaliated by laying into Casado and Albert Rivera, the leader of the centre-right Citizens party, reminding them they had both enlisted the support of Vox \u2013 the first avowedly far-right grouping to win more than a single seat in the national parliament since Spain returned to democracy after the death of Gen Francisco Franco in 1975 \u2013 to take power in regional governments, including in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid. \u201cYou two represent the cowardly right in the face of an aggressive far right,\u201d he said. Polls suggest S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialists will win the most votes on Sunday but again fall short of a majority, as it did in April\u2019s election. The PP appears to be bouncing back from its disastrous showing last time when it lost more than half its seats, but things look bleak for Citizens, which has lurched further to the right and which refused to help S\u00e1nchez form a government. Its loss seems to be Vox\u2019s gain: with support for Citizens plummeting, the far-right grouping could move past it and the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos to become the third biggest force in Spanish politics. Three years after Podemos was widely \u2013 but incorrectly \u2013 predicted to leapfrog the Socialists to become Spain\u2019s leading leftwing party, the talk is once again of a sorpasso (overtaking). \u201cIt\u2019s clear that everything that\u2019s happened in Catalonia in reaction to the sentence has completely captured the public agenda,\u201d said Guillem Vidal, a postdoctoral researcher at the Berlin Social Science Centre. \u201cWhat it\u2019s done, deep down, is polarise the whole national political agenda. If you look at the polls, the consequences of this level of polarisation have been the reinforcing of the parties most deeply involved in the issue.\u201d Vidal said both Vox and the Catalan Republican Left, the region\u2019s more moderate pro-independence party, were likely to benefit from the current climate. He said Abascal\u2019s participation in the party\u2019s first debate on public television had helped normalise Vox\u2019s narrative and allowed it to set out its stall. Vidal added that Abascal seemed to be aiming to emulate the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen by adopting \u201ca more chauvinist, European far-right attitude when it comes to economic protectionism\u201d. Earlier on Monday, Roc\u00edo Monasterio, Vox\u2019s leader in the Madrid region, headed to a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors in Seville to argue that such young people made the streets unsafe and posed \u201ca serious problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d. She was met with cries of \u201cFascists out!\u201d.

At a short hearing on Wednesday morning, a magistrates court sent the case to Snaresbrook crown court because the charges were deemed too serious to be dealt with by the lower court. Jones, 35, said he had been celebrating his birthday with friends when he was attacked at about 2am outside the Lexington public house in Islington, north London on 17 August. James Healy, 39, from Portsmouth; Liam Tracey, 34, from Camden, London; and Charlie Ambrose, 29, from Brighton, had been charged with actual bodily harm and affray.

Nothing is guaranteed in life \u2013 it has to be earned. But for most, \u201cbootstrapping\u201d ourselves to success is an illusion. The only way we improve our lot as workers is through collective action. That means knowing who your friends are and who your enemies are. Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s not \u201cboomers\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s that investment banker you went to high school with.

Now I, honestly, am a pickle expert. I have made every pickle mistake in the book, up to and including using balsamic in a piccalilli, which went the colour of diarrhoea. These are only the top five reasons to take up pickling.</p> <h2><strong>It is exceedingly good for you</strong></h2> <p>It is hard to make a vegetable interesting without fat, and once you have swamped a cabbage in pepper and double cream, it is really just a garnish to your main meal of fat. Pickling, however, is one easy way: a pile of sauerkraut underneath a sausage, a jar of pickled beetroot in a moment of boredom, a side of kimchi with crispy chicken \u2013 these are the only indulgences I can think of that are also health hacks. Fermentation is good for your gut environment. Vinegar kills it, though, so you would have to stick with Asian and central European pickling methods. Fine. And they are classier.</p> <h2><strong>Food waste will be a thing of the past</strong></h2> <p>Since I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams/status/1180029701315874816?s=20\" title=\"\">got a pet rabbit</a>, leftover root vegetables have not been a problem for me; for everyone else, pickle them. Don\u2019t wait until they are on the turn before you do, though. Wrinkly pickles are not aesthetically pleasing. Which brings us to \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Pickles are preternaturally beautiful</strong></h2> <p>Kylee Newton, a new-generation pickler and the author of <a href=\"http://www.newtonandpott.co.uk/shop-1/the-modern-preserver-signed-copy\" title=\"\">The Modern Preserver</a>, ribbons mouli and pickles it with thyme or cucumbers in gin, and the result is like a still life painting. You would decorate your house with jars of them. Truthfully, though, even pickled celery will make your shelves look more wholesome, particularly if you have seven jars of the stuff. (And even Branston puts me in a good mood.)</p> <h2><strong>You can give them away</strong></h2> <p>I bought some wrapping paper the other day and got on a train, and the man opposite said: \u201cJust looking at you makes me want to start crying.\u201d If the gift season does this to you at all, consider making gifts of great Kilner jars of pickled anything, which will banish the nausea of mindless consumption and replace it with a nourishing tang.</p> <h2><strong>There is always something new to pickle</strong></h2> <p>Newton, who had just been pickling jalape\u00f1os when I spoke to her, says: \u201cI really love pickling fruit. Pickled plums and cherries, added to baking, are fascinating. The surrounding sponge seems to absorb some of the vinegar, to give you this sour, sweet, soft, creamy taste. It\u2019s so interesting.\u201d</p>",

It is exceedingly good for you It is hard to make a vegetable interesting without fat, and once you have swamped a cabbage in pepper and double cream, it is really just a garnish to your main meal of fat. Pickling, however, is one easy way: a pile of sauerkraut underneath a sausage, a jar of pickled beetroot in a moment of boredom, a side of kimchi with crispy chicken \u2013 these are the only indulgences I can think of that are also health hacks. Fermentation is good for your gut environment. Vinegar kills it, though, so you would have to stick with Asian and central European pickling methods. Fine. And they are classier. Food waste will be a thing of the past Since I got a pet rabbit, leftover root vegetables have not been a problem for me; for everyone else, pickle them. Don\u2019t wait until they are on the turn before you do, though. Wrinkly pickles are not aesthetically pleasing. Which brings us to \u2026 Pickles are preternaturally beautiful Kylee Newton, a new-generation pickler and the author of The Modern Preserver, ribbons mouli and pickles it with thyme or cucumbers in gin, and the result is like a still life painting. You would decorate your house with jars of them. Truthfully, though, even pickled celery will make your shelves look more wholesome, particularly if you have seven jars of the stuff. (And even Branston puts me in a good mood.) You can give them away I bought some wrapping paper the other day and got on a train, and the man opposite said: \u201cJust looking at you makes me want to start crying.\u201d If the gift season does this to you at all, consider making gifts of great Kilner jars of pickled anything, which will banish the nausea of mindless consumption and replace it with a nourishing tang. There is always something new to pickle Newton, who had just been pickling jalape\u00f1os when I spoke to her, says: \u201cI really love pickling fruit. Pickled plums and cherries, added to baking, are fascinating. The surrounding sponge seems to absorb some of the vinegar, to give you this sour, sweet, soft, creamy taste. It\u2019s so interesting.\u201d",

It just seems the common-sense thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cleverly was asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIsn\u2019t the reality that [Rees-Mogg] has no idea how these people live? He has no idea how people who didn\u2019t go to Eton, didn\u2019t go to Oxford, didn\u2019t inherit large sums of money really live their lives?\u201d</p> \n<p>Cleverly said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments were hurtful and it was right for him to have apologised. \u201cJacob recognises that what he said was wrong and caused a huge amount of hurt and distress,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has apologised unreservedly and I do think that is the right thing for him to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>He told Today that no one could \u201ccredibly\u201d know what decisions those trapped in the tower faced that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could think through the circumstances or the decisions we would make,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has also apologised after initially defending Rees-Mogg, suggesting the Commons leader was cleverer than those who died in the fire.<strong> </strong>Asked whether the cabinet minister meant to say he would have left the flats against official advice, Bridgen said: \u201cYes, that\u2019s what he meant to say.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"01db1579-5cec-4519-9dc5-75823e95666b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CT2z-TtgElU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The BBC\u2019s Evan Davis responded: \u201cBut in a way that is exactly what people object to, because he is in effect saying \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Rees-Mogg\u2019s remarks came on a difficult day for the Conservatives on the eve of their election campaign launch.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, has said Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments on Grenfell Tower \u201ccaused a huge amount of hurt and distress\u201d. Rees-Mogg sparked widespread uproar after claiming the Grenfell Tower fire victims did not use \u201ccommon sense\u201d when they followed fire service advice to stay put in the burning building. The leader of the House of Commons issued a \u201cprofound apology\u201d after he told a radio interviewer: \u201cI think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common-sense thing to do.\u201d Cleverly was asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIsn\u2019t the reality that [Rees-Mogg] has no idea how these people live? He has no idea how people who didn\u2019t go to Eton, didn\u2019t go to Oxford, didn\u2019t inherit large sums of money really live their lives?\u201d Cleverly said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments were hurtful and it was right for him to have apologised. \u201cJacob recognises that what he said was wrong and caused a huge amount of hurt and distress,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has apologised unreservedly and I do think that is the right thing for him to do.\u201d He told Today that no one could \u201ccredibly\u201d know what decisions those trapped in the tower faced that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could think through the circumstances or the decisions we would make,\u201d he added. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has also apologised after initially defending Rees-Mogg, suggesting the Commons leader was cleverer than those who died in the fire. Asked whether the cabinet minister meant to say he would have left the flats against official advice, Bridgen said: \u201cYes, that\u2019s what he meant to say.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Evan Davis responded: \u201cBut in a way that is exactly what people object to, because he is in effect saying \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice.\u2019\u201d Rees-Mogg\u2019s remarks came on a difficult day for the Conservatives on the eve of their election campaign launch. Earlier it was revealed that one Tory candidate, Francesca O\u2019Brien, had written on Facebook that people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed \u201cputting down\u201d. When asked about O\u2019Brien\u2019s comments, Cleverly said they were \u201cunacceptable\u201d but suggested she would not be sacked as a Tory candidate. \u201cThis is a comment which the candidate themselves recognises was unacceptable. It\u2019s the nature often on social media that people say things without really thinking through their position,\u201d he said. Boris Johnson formally launched his election campaign with a blistering attack on Jeremy Corbyn, likening the Labour leader to Stalin. The prime minister told the Daily Telegraph that Corbyn would raise taxes so significantly that Labour would end up destroying the basis of the country\u2019s prosperity. The Labour party under Corbyn \u201cpoint their fingers at individuals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks\u201d, Johnson added. Corbyn quickly rubbished the claims on Twitter. In his interview on Radio 4, Cleverly said no deal remained the \u201cdefault setting\u201d in forthcoming trade talks with the EU, as far as the government was concerned. \u201cUltimately, the default setting has always been no deal. That is not what we want,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThe prime minister has demonstrated, as have the EU, that, when you are focused and both trying to get a good outcome, it can be done.\u201d He also defended a Tory campaign video that critics said had been \u201cdoctored\u201d. The film depicts the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, struggling to answer a question on TV about his party\u2019s position on leaving the EU. Cleverly told the BBC that Tory social media feeds had posted the interview in full and then followed it up with a \u201clighthearted satirical\u201d video on Labour\u2019s Brexit position. \u201cWhat we also did, and this is not unique to us, is we did a lighthearted satirical video, obviously so with a comedy soundtrack, highlighting the Labour party\u2019s chaotic position on Brexit,\u201d he said.",

Twenty centimetres is very significant; it is basically as much sea-level rise as we\u2019ve observed over the entire 20th century,\u201d said Climate Analytics\u2019 Alexander Nauels, lead author of the study. \u201cTo cause that with only 15 years of emissions is quite staggering.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/05/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-climate-leadership\">A climate denier-in-chief sits in the White House today.

This scenario, modeled by researchers, assumes that all countries make their promised emissions reductions by 2030 and then abruptly eliminate all planet-warming gases from that point onwards. In reality, only a small number of countries are on track to meet the Paris target of limiting global heating to 2C above the pre-industrial era. \u201cEven with the Paris pledges there will be a large amount of sea level rise,\u201d said Peter Clark, an Oregon State University climate scientist and co-author of the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cSea level rise is going to be an ongoing problem for centuries to come, we will have to keep on adapting over and over again. It\u2019s going to be a whole new expensive lifestyle, costing trillions of dollars. \u201cSea level has a very long memory, so even if we start cooling temperatures the seas will continue to rise. It\u2019s a bit like trying to turn the Titanic around, rather than a speedboat.\u201d Researchers used a computer model that simulates sea level rise in response to various emissions levels, looking both at historical emissions since 1750 and also what the emissions scenario would be from 2015 to 2030 if countries met their Paris agreement obligations. About half of the 20cm sea level rise can be attributed to the world\u2019s top five greenhouse gas polluters \u2013 the US, China, India, Russia and the European Union \u2013 according to the researchers. The US was a key architect of the Paris deal but this week Donald Trump formally triggered its exit from the agreement. \u201cOur results show that what we do today will have a huge effect in 2300. Twenty centimetres is very significant; it is basically as much sea-level rise as we\u2019ve observed over the entire 20th century,\u201d said Climate Analytics\u2019 Alexander Nauels, lead author of the study. \u201cTo cause that with only 15 years of emissions is quite staggering.\u201d The results reveal the daunting prospect of a near-endless advance of the seas, forcing countries to invest huge resources in defending key infrastructure or ceding certain areas to the tides. Many coastal cities around the world are already facing this challenge, with recent research finding that land currently home to 300 million people will flood at least once a year by 2050 unless carbon emissions are drastically slashed. As the world heats up, ocean water is expanding while land-based glaciers and the two great polar ice caps are melting away, causing the oceans to swell. According to the UN\u2019s climate science panel, the global sea level rise could reach as much as 1.1 metres by the end of the century if emissions aren\u2019t curbed. Clark pointed out the real situation could be even worse if the melting of the Antarctic turns out to be on the dire end of the spectrum of uncertainty. \u201cPeople are going to become less inclined to live by the coast and there are going to be sea level rise refugees,\u201d Clark said. \u201cMore severe cuts in emissions are certainly going to be required but the current Paris pledges aren\u2019t enough to prevent the seas from rising for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I don\u2019t want to look retro. I think victory rolls are twee and I would not be seen dead in a nylon petticoat. I will go for a bare leg over a seamed stocking every time. Right now I want a cardigan that I can tuck into a midi skirt, but I want it sleek and neutral like the ones on the Chanel autumn/winter catwalk, not in a fuzzy pastel with embroidered flowers. So today, Mel Wilkinson, the Guardian\u2019s stylist \u2013 a vision of contemporary chic in understated neutrals \u2013 and I have set ourselves a challenge. We are going secondhand shopping, but for this season\u2019s looks. Can we find now clothes, without buying new clothes?</p> <p>Buying clothes secondhand is, after all, very fashionable. This is sustainable retail therapy, a feelgood fashion fix that doesn\u2019t add to the environmental problem of clothing overproduction. In the US, the resale market has grown 21 times faster than the retail market in the past three years, with a <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/resale\" title=\"\">ThredUp report</a> this year predicting that the secondhand market could overtake fast fashion within a decade. In the UK, the younger generation of shoppers are returning to a taste for secondhand that their parents\u2019 generation, raised on a ready-made diet of fast fashion, never cultivated. Eighty per cent of 16-21 year olds are happy to buy secondhand clothes \u2013 second only in their enthusiasm to the over-60s, of whom 90% are comfortable buying used garments \u2013 while less than a third of shoppers in their 30s and 40s are on board, according to a survey by Business Waste, a waste management agency.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you want to find clothes that look current, don\u2019t look at the labels \u2013 zoom in on colours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The new higher profile of secondhand shopping is beginning to be felt on the high street. In Covent Garden in London, a new branch of <a href=\"https://picknweight.de/\" title=\"\">Picknweight</a>, a vintage kilo store that is already a cult destination in Berlin, had customers queueing down the street when it opened. Mel and I start our hunt for now-clothes-not-new-clothes next door, in the Shelton Street branch of <a href=\"https://www.rokit.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rokit</a>, a vintage institution which has resold more than a million tonnes of preworn clothing since the first branch opened in Camden market in 1986. The shopfloor is vast, but Mel is dauntless. \u201cMost vintage shops curate their pieces in a way that reflects current trends,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In minutes she has unearthed a tan leather shirt \u2013 very Loewe, but a fraction of the price at \u00a325.</p> <p>Secondhand hunting requires you to up your game as a shopper. Walk into a high street store and you will see ready-made looks, glossily presented on mannequins and helpfully merchandised with stock in different sizes and coordinating items. In a secondhand store, you have to move slower and look harder. You have to rewire your brain a little bit. It helps to remind yourself that while new clothes look the best they will ever look fluffed and spotlit on the shopfloor, secondhand is the opposite \u2013 these pieces undersell themselves on the shopfloor and come into their own once you get them home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"179dbf5d94fb17dce3376035bb068cdd31ad30fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179dbf5d94fb17dce3376035bb068cdd31ad30fb/0_0_7111_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect for this season \u2026 from left: 80s-style dress, \u00a334, and sequinned top, \u00a328, both at Beyond Retro.

      "bodyText": "I don\u2019t want to look retro. I think victory rolls are twee and I would not be seen dead in a nylon petticoat. I will go for a bare leg over a seamed stocking every time. Right now I want a cardigan that I can tuck into a midi skirt, but I want it sleek and neutral like the ones on the Chanel autumn/winter catwalk, not in a fuzzy pastel with embroidered flowers. So today, Mel Wilkinson, the Guardian\u2019s stylist \u2013 a vision of contemporary chic in understated neutrals \u2013 and I have set ourselves a challenge. We are going secondhand shopping, but for this season\u2019s looks. Can we find now clothes, without buying new clothes? Buying clothes secondhand is, after all, very fashionable. This is sustainable retail therapy, a feelgood fashion fix that doesn\u2019t add to the environmental problem of clothing overproduction. In the US, the resale market has grown 21 times faster than the retail market in the past three years, with a ThredUp report this year predicting that the secondhand market could overtake fast fashion within a decade. In the UK, the younger generation of shoppers are returning to a taste for secondhand that their parents\u2019 generation, raised on a ready-made diet of fast fashion, never cultivated. Eighty per cent of 16-21 year olds are happy to buy secondhand clothes \u2013 second only in their enthusiasm to the over-60s, of whom 90% are comfortable buying used garments \u2013 while less than a third of shoppers in their 30s and 40s are on board, according to a survey by Business Waste, a waste management agency. The new higher profile of secondhand shopping is beginning to be felt on the high street. In Covent Garden in London, a new branch of Picknweight, a vintage kilo store that is already a cult destination in Berlin, had customers queueing down the street when it opened. Mel and I start our hunt for now-clothes-not-new-clothes next door, in the Shelton Street branch of Rokit, a vintage institution which has resold more than a million tonnes of preworn clothing since the first branch opened in Camden market in 1986. The shopfloor is vast, but Mel is dauntless. \u201cMost vintage shops curate their pieces in a way that reflects current trends,\u201d she says. In minutes she has unearthed a tan leather shirt \u2013 very Loewe, but a fraction of the price at \u00a325. Secondhand hunting requires you to up your game as a shopper. Walk into a high street store and you will see ready-made looks, glossily presented on mannequins and helpfully merchandised with stock in different sizes and coordinating items. In a secondhand store, you have to move slower and look harder. You have to rewire your brain a little bit. It helps to remind yourself that while new clothes look the best they will ever look fluffed and spotlit on the shopfloor, secondhand is the opposite \u2013 these pieces undersell themselves on the shopfloor and come into their own once you get them home. Clare Lewis, founder of an online vintage boutique Retold, has a robustly non-retro aesthetic, having spent a decade designing for Topshop. \u201cI started Retold to encourage people to see how vintage could be incorporated into a modern wardrobe and look contemporary, in the hope they would be inspired to shop vintage as an alternative to buying new,\u201d she says. This is a great season to source vintage because \u201cso many trends lean towards the 70s, 80s and 90s\u201d. She tips hunting for trenchcoats, blazers, midi skirts and blouses to channel the bourgeois-lady look, as seen at Chlo\u00e9 and Burberry. Leather, as seen at Bottega Veneta and Isabel Marant this season, should be on your contemporary-vintage hit list, too.

If 90s sportswear is your thing, you are spoilt for choice \u2013 lots of Reebok and Adidas hoodies, for about a tenner each. Holly Watkins is another fashion industry veteran and the founder of the online vintage boutique One Scoop Store. \u201cThe preconception with vintage is that it\u2019s all brown 1970s polyester dresses, massive leather jackets or badly fitting tweed skirt suits, but that\u2019s just not the case these days.\u201d Her online edit features Molly Goddard-esque ruffles, brightly coloured tailoring and 70s-style chiffon and lace. \u201cI recently had in an incredible geometric print kaftan dress cut in a circle, which was very similar in shape to a Margiela one I own.

In August 2016, a sinkhole opened up under a gypsum stack, similar to the one in St James, at Mosaic\u2019s Mulberry phosphate processing plant in Florida. About 215m gallons of polluted process water drained into an underground aquifer. Mosaic informed Florida\u2019s department of environmental protection (DEP) right away about water loss, but didn\u2019t immediately disclose the sinkhole. Almost three weeks passed before either Mosaic or the DEP informed the public, despite the fact that the sinkhole was initially considered a potential threat to the public\u2019s water supply. The company has been under the consent decree with EPA and the Department of Justice since 2015 for violations related to hazardous waste disposal at its six sites in Florida and Louisiana, including the Uncle Sam facility. Some activists have called for a complete closure of the plant in light of January\u2019s news about the wall of the gypsum shifting. Lavigne of Rise St James said any plant should be closed down that is releasing toxic emissions, which have been linked to cancer and other potentially fatal health issues. \u201cIf it\u2019s killing us, shut it down,\u201d she said. Environmental racism The Mosaic issue is one of several facilities that Rise St James and other advocacy groups say have caused a slow-motion environmental and public health disaster erasing the majority-black population here. Rise and affiliated advocacy groups claimed a surprising victory in September when Wanhua Chemical withdrew its approved application to develop a $1.25bn petrochemical facility nearby. The group has turned its attention to stopping a $9.4bn petrochemical complex being developed in the area by Taiwanese company Formosa Plastics Group. If approved, that project alone would effectively double chemical emissions in the area. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our life,\u201d declared Lavigne. She said recent blood tests found aluminum linked to industrial pollutants in her body, and doctors are now monitoring her liver for any health complications. \u201cThey\u2019re killing us off, one by one.\u201d",

According to the Mirror, United are \u201cplotting an \u00a380m raid on Bayer Leverkusen for new German sensation <strong>Kai Havertz</strong>\u201d, who has become their \u201cNo 1 target\u201d, with the club happily \u201cconfident of luring the 20-year-old to Old Trafford in a bumper deal\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/los-angeles-chargers-london-move-uk-tottenham-hotspur-uk\">LA Chargers owner: rumor of ground share with Tottenham Hotspur is 'bullshit'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now might be a good time for United to make their move, given that Europe\u2019s top clubs all seem to be distracted by thoughts of Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s <strong>Erling Haaland</strong>. Marca report that <strong>Barcelona </strong>and <strong>Real Madrid </strong>have joined the race for the 19-year-old goal grabber, whose value has been estimated at somewhere between a laughably low \u20ac12m and a hilariously high \u20ac100m. Juventus, Bayern Munich and United themselves are also in the running, apparently \u2013 though just last week Bild insisted that \u201c<strong>more than 20 clubs</strong>\u201d have targeted the Norwegian ace. <strong>United </strong>have also been linked with Burnley\u2019s <strong>Dwight McNeil</strong>, a 19-year-old who was in their own academy until, when he was 14, they decided he wasn\u2019t going to be very good. \u201cI\u2019m a Man United fan, despite what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a Man United fan. I just wasn\u2019t up to their standards.\u201d Fortunately he has since improved, or their standards have since slipped. One or the other. Perhaps both.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers is planning to strike while the iron is hot \u2013 or while the Foxes are hot, anyway \u2013 by using his club\u2019s enviable league position to attract some top-notch talent in January. The Mirror links <strong>Leicester </strong>with a \u00a320m move for <strong>Emmanuel Dennis</strong>, Club Bruges\u2019 21-year-old Nigerian striker who has previously been linked with both Arsenal and Sheffield United. Rodgers is also keen on Real Sociedad\u2019s <strong>Diego Llorente</strong>, a 26-year-old centre-back with a \u00a345m release clause.

      "bodyText": "Behind the scenes at Old Trafford Manchester United\u2019s massive chequebook is flexing and preening as it continues its own gruelling pre-season training, ahead of a short but perhaps rather busy January campaign. According to the Mirror, United are \u201cplotting an \u00a380m raid on Bayer Leverkusen for new German sensation Kai Havertz\u201d, who has become their \u201cNo 1 target\u201d, with the club happily \u201cconfident of luring the 20-year-old to Old Trafford in a bumper deal\u201d. Now might be a good time for United to make their move, given that Europe\u2019s top clubs all seem to be distracted by thoughts of Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s Erling Haaland. Marca report that Barcelona and Real Madrid have joined the race for the 19-year-old goal grabber, whose value has been estimated at somewhere between a laughably low \u20ac12m and a hilariously high \u20ac100m. Juventus, Bayern Munich and United themselves are also in the running, apparently \u2013 though just last week Bild insisted that \u201cmore than 20 clubs\u201d have targeted the Norwegian ace. United have also been linked with Burnley\u2019s Dwight McNeil, a 19-year-old who was in their own academy until, when he was 14, they decided he wasn\u2019t going to be very good. \u201cI\u2019m a Man United fan, despite what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a Man United fan. I just wasn\u2019t up to their standards.\u201d Fortunately he has since improved, or their standards have since slipped. One or the other. Perhaps both. Brendan Rodgers is planning to strike while the iron is hot \u2013 or while the Foxes are hot, anyway \u2013 by using his club\u2019s enviable league position to attract some top-notch talent in January. The Mirror links Leicester with a \u00a320m move for Emmanuel Dennis, Club Bruges\u2019 21-year-old Nigerian striker who has previously been linked with both Arsenal and Sheffield United. Rodgers is also keen on Real Sociedad\u2019s Diego Llorente, a 26-year-old centre-back with a \u00a345m release clause. Meanwhile at Rodgers\u2019 former club Liverpool, scouts are running the rule over yeat another Bundesliga-based youngster in the shape of Hertha Berlin\u2019s 21-year-old winger Javairo Dilrosun. Bournemouth and Wolves are preparing for a couple of important contests. The first takes place at the Vitality Stadium later this month, with three league points on the line. The second will follow in January, with both clubs planning moves for Huddersfield\u2019s 22-year-old striker Karlan Grant, whose fine form \u2013 and nine league goals so far this season \u2013 look likely to lead to his departure just a year after his \u00a32m arrival from Charlton.

      "bodyText": "As he set off into the wilderness under a punishing midday sun, Jesse Barajas clutched an orange-handled machete and the dream of finding his little brother, Jos\u00e9. \u201cHe\u2019s not alive, no. They don\u2019t leave people alive,\u201d the 62-year-old said as he slalomed through the parched scrubland of tumbleweed and cacti where they had played as kids. \u201cOnce they take someone they don\u2019t let you live.\u201d It has been six months since Jos\u00e9 Barajas was snatched from his home near the US border, for reasons that remain obscure. \u201cI think he was working so hard that he forgot his own safety, you know?\u201d Jesse said as he recounted how his 57-year-old brother was dragged from his ranch and joined the ever-swelling ranks of Mexico\u2019s desaparecidos \u2013 now estimated to number at least 40,000 people. Jesse, the eldest of seven siblings, said US-based relatives had implored Jos\u00e9 to join them north of the border as the cartels tightened their grip on a region notorious for the smuggling of drugs and people. \u201cWe told him how big a monster is organised crime. It is a huge monster that nobody knows where it is hiding,\u201d he said. But Jos\u00e9 \u2013 who had built a successful business making decorative concrete columns for ranches and was in the process of erecting a new house \u2013 was adamant he would abandon neither his workers nor his homeland. \u201cHe was a man that believed in Mexico,\u201d said Jesse, who left Mexico as an undocumented migrant aged 14 and is now a US citizen. \u201cHe chose to stay here because he thought that he could change things, you know?\u201d The disappeared are perhaps the dirtiest secret of Mexico\u2019s drug conflict, which has shown no sign of easing since leftist leader Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power last December promising a new era of peace. In August Mexican authorities, who after years of public pressure are beginning to demonstrate greater interest in investigating such crimes, acknowledged over 3,000 clandestine burial sites. More than 500 had been discovered since L\u00f3pez Obrador took power. One as-yet undiscovered grave is thought to guard the remains of Jos\u00e9 Barajas. And one recent morning his family set off to find it, in the company of a government forensic team and \u2013 a heavily armed federal police escort. \u201cIt just sucks not knowing where he\u2019s at,\u201d said the missing man\u2019s 28-year-old son, who is also called Jos\u00e9 and had travelled from California to join the search. The mission \u2013 one of the first conducted in conjunction with a newly created state search commission \u2013 began shortly before noon as searchers formed a human chain to comb a stony heath east of Jos\u00e9\u2019s ranch. Jesse struck out ahead, pausing occasionally to skewer the ground with his machete. After puncturing the earth, he would raise the blade\u2019s tip to his nose in the hope of detecting the sickly scent that might reveal the whereabouts of his brother\u2019s corpse. Other searchers probed soft patches of soil with T-shaped steel rods. Minutes later, Jesse spotted a black bomber jacket, half buried in the soil. He quickly decided it was not his brother\u2019s but photographed the garment with his smartphone: \u201cMaybe somebody is looking for somebody with this jacket, huh?\u201d As Jesse marched on \u2013 shadowed by a rifle-toting police agent \u2013 the hidden perils that lay behind his brother\u2019s disappearance became clear. Pickup trucks, apparently sent by cartel bosses to monitor the search party, rattled past on the country lane down which Jos\u00e9\u2019s abductors fled. \u201cThese assholes are halcones,\u201d Jesse complained, using the Spanish slang word for lookouts. Unsettled by their presence, Jesse radioed another nearby search team to request a protective roadblock. \u201cThey\u2019re spying on us \u2026 watching our movements to see what we are looking for and what we are doing,\u201d the police officer said. Nerves jangled as the hawks continued to circle. \u201cThe criminals here are very bloody. They are beyond limits,\u201d Jesse murmured as the police agent trained his gun on the road. Twenty tense minutes later, reinforcements arrived. But the drama was not yet over. As Jesse clambered into the open back of a police vehicle two shiny SUVs appeared on the horizon and sped down the sun-cracked asphalt towards the group, before being forced to stop. As the police car\u2019s occupants braced for a gunfight, two men descended from the first SUV and exchanged a few inaudible words with the federal agents before the second car was allowed to pass unmolested. The identity of its occupants remained a mystery. But as the vehicle raced away it left the unshakable impression that a local crime boss had been inside \u2013 and a serious confrontation narrowly avoided. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hostile place \u2013 and it\u2019s not Iraq,\u201d Jesse said as the team regrouped, heaving a collective sigh of relief. After a lunch of energy drinks and granola bars, the hunt for Jos\u00e9 resumed. \u201cAll we want to do is give him a proper burial, like every human,\u201d the missing man\u2019s son as a sniffer dog joined the search. Jos\u00e9\u2019s son said relatives had not told his 92-year-old grandmother, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s, what had happened and had yet to fully comprehend it themselves. \u201cI guess we have to be OK with not being OK,\u201d he said. Once his father was found, Jos\u00e9 said the family would sell up and cut ties with the land his father had so loved. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same any more, you know what I mean?\u201d Three hours later, nothing had been found but coyote bones and clothes ditched by migrants as they trekked towards the US. Back at his brother\u2019s ranch, Jesse busied himself handing out burritos and spicy nachos to the famished searchers. Fernando Ocegueda, the activist who had organized the mission, insisted searchers should keep faith. \u201cOnce we spent 15 days searching and found nothing \u2013 and on the last day we found three bodies.\u201d \u201cThis kind of activism is about patience, not speed,\u201d Ocegueda later added. Two days later, after a second fruitless hunt near the ranch, the Barajas family headed south to join another search, though this time not for Jos\u00e9. Outside a police station in the coastal town of Ensenada they met dozens of mostly female searchers \u2013 members of a local \u201ccollective\u201dhoping to find their loved ones. As the group explored its first location \u2013 a rocky wasteland behind the town\u2019s country club \u2013 terrible stories of violence, fear and grief emerged. \u201cIt was my nephew. They took him 18 days ago,\u201d said one thirtysomething woman, who \u2013 like all of the collective\u2019s members \u2013 asked not to be identified for fear of the cartels. \u201cMy brother,\u201d said a 15-year-old boy as he pummeled the earth with a shovel. \u201cThree weeks.\u201d Another woman said she was seeking her son. \u201cIn December it will be six years since they disappeared him \u2026 and I\u2019ve been in this fight ever since,\u201d she said. As the minutes and hours ticked by and no bodies were found, bloodshot eyes shed tears of sorrow and there were crossed words of frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s like looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d Jos\u00e9\u2019s son complained after a traipse through the wasteland found only swarms of bees and a poisonous snake. But as the group moved from the viper-infested wild to a reeking landfill and, finally, a junkyard police suspected had served as a torture centre and burial ground, there was also camaraderie and warmth. The bleakness of the task was tempered by shared experiences and laughter. Jokes were told. New friendships formed. \u201cWe all have the same goal, which is finding our missing ones,\u201d said Ocegueda who became a campaigner after his own son was taken, in 2007, and has recovered more than 120 bodies since. Ocegueda has yet to locate his son \u2013 but he has found a calling. \u201cThis is where I like to be because it\u2019s here I\u2019ve found my people,\u201d the 62-year-old said. \u201cAlong the way you make friends \u2013 and this is the most important thing.\u201d Also present was a woman still grappling with a more recent loss: Jos\u00e9\u2019s 49-year-old wife, Irma Bonilla Barajas. Visibly drained, Irma threw herself into the search operation, determined to bring others closure, even if she had yet to find it herself. Pausing from her digging, Irma remembered a hardworking family man whose absence was still sinking in. \u201cHe was so, so intelligent,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to calculate all the exact measurements for the concrete and his gazebos in his head.\u201d Six months after Jos\u00e9 vanished, Irma voiced bewilderment at the \u201cevil minds\u201d responsible for snatching so many Mexican lives. \u201cI just can\u2019t make sense of it \u2026 If they\u2019ve already killed them, why don\u2019t they leave them for us?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWhat more harm can they do to them, if they are already dead?\u201d Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija",

For many, crossing the Atlantic to ply their trade in the US requires a leap of faith, with MLS, despite its steady growth in interest and viewership, still vying for recognition among the elite leagues of Europe.</p> <h2><strong>What is the perception of MLS in your home country?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Michael Mancienne (New England Revolution, English)</strong>: \u201cI feel like people think it\u2019s not the best league \u2013 they underestimate it. I\u2019ll be honest, I did as well before I came over. But the standard is really, really good. There are a lot of good players in the league and a lot of good teams.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Nedum Onuoha (Real Salt Lake, English)</strong>: \u201cIt\u2019s quite a tricky thing to actually be able to see because of the time zones. You won\u2019t get to see many games live, especially if they\u2019re on the west coast. You get highlights but you can only really get a feel from that. I think the fact Rooney came over to the east meant there was more coverage of the highlights.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Anton Tinnerholm (New York City FC, Swedish)</strong>: \u201cThe popularity of the league is growing, thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, of course. Now you can see every single game, either with Swedish or American commentators. But it\u2019s hard to see normal people staying up until the middle of the night, watching games and then going to work the next day. That\u2019s the biggest issue for the league, compared to European leagues you can watch in the evenings.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do you think MLS teams would fare in your home country?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mancienne</strong>: \u201cI think some of the better teams could be in the Premier League but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be a top-six team or anything like that. I think mid-to-bottom table. There is a lot of quality here. There are a lot of South American players I\u2019d never even heard of before I came here who are really good players.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Onuoha</strong>: \u201cI think they\u2019d do well. But to exist as a team within England and a lot of other European leagues, you have to be defensive first and attacking second. Over here, the emphasis is put on attacking.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Reto Ziegler (FC Dallas, Swiss):</strong> \u201cThey would fight with Young Boys and Basel for the Championship, for sure. It\u2019s not easy to play here. If you come here thinking you\u2019re going on a vacation, you\u2019re making a big mistake. You have to deserve your spot, week in, week out. There are a lot of young players [in MLS] and, physically, they are on top. Tactically, we can improve. They are doing really well now with the academies. It\u2019s getting really tough to play here.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/argentine-invasion-why-all-of-your-favorite-mls-stars-are-argentinian\">Why all of your favorite MLS stars are Argentinian | Francisco Navas</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Gary Mackay-Steven (New York City FC, Scottish)</strong>: \u201cI think they would do really well. There is such a wide range of styles and tactics different teams play; some are technical and some are physical. There are so many different strengths. Celtic have been playing to such a high standard over the last years, but I\u2019m sure a lot of teams from over here would give Scottish teams a good game and do really well.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tinnerholm</strong>: \u201cThis is a step up from the Swedish league. The best teams here are better than the best teams in Sweden. It\u2019s hard to compare but there are some players in this league who are so much better than the best players in Sweden. In Sweden, you don\u2019t have players like Maxi Morales, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Carlos Vela, Josef Martinez. We have bigger stars here. The gap between the best players and the players 17th, 18th [in the squad] is bigger here than back home in Sweden.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a6f8079c0e09ff20e7af8448a1668a9fbdb064\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a6f8079c0e09ff20e7af8448a1668a9fbdb064/0_130_3516_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nedum Onuoha: \u2018I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I want to go and see things.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nedum Onuoha: \u2018I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I want to go and see things.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Berding/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How has your transition to life in North America been?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Onuoha</strong>: \u201cIt\u2019s a foreign country but they speak the same language, that definitely goes a long way. The little things you have to learn \u2013 like how you file your taxes and other real-world issues \u2013 are made easier because you can look into it and understand it. It\u2019s not really a harsh adjustment. My kids are loving it and it\u2019s a great place to be. I didn\u2019t know much about Salt Lake City, but I\u2019ve been here just over a year now and it has ended up being the perfect place for me and my family. It\u2019s a beautiful place, all geared around being outdoors, and the people are really friendly.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ziegler</strong>: \u201cFor me, the hardest thing is the traveling. We are lucky because Dallas is almost in the middle of the country, so it\u2019s not too bad. There are a few flights that are close to four hours. This is the thing I\u2019ve had to adapt to. You travel a lot and spend a lot of time in airports. An airport isn\u2019t the best place to recover, but you get used to that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mackay-Steven</strong>: \u201cI must admit, it was quite tough to start with. I came over off the back of an offseason in Scotland when the team was in the middle of their season. I was trying to get fit while playing important games. Plus the weather is so warm, and travel to away games might see you go across a few different time zones and different climates. Certainly, it was a little bit tough to start with, before I felt fit and got my bearings. But it\u2019s been enjoyable throughout.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mancienne</strong>: \u201cWhen I was by myself it was tough because I didn\u2019t have any family or friends over here. Now that they\u2019re over here it\u2019s helped me adjust and we love life here. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m not the biggest American sports fan. We\u2019ve always got American football on in the changing room and I haven\u2019t got a clue what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tinnerholm</strong>: \u201cThe away games in Sweden are mostly a three- or four-hour bus ride, then we go home after the game. Here, every away game is like an adventure. I do like it; either you dislike everything or you treat it like an adventure.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s the best thing about playing in MLS?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Onuoha</strong>: \u201cI always enjoy traveling. In the time I spend here, I\u2019ll get to travel to all the different cities in America which have MLS teams, which is a lot of places I wouldn\u2019t usually go if I had a one-week or two-week holiday \u2013 going to Houston or Cincinnati, places like this. Most of the trips for away games will take up two or three days, so there\u2019s a lot of time to go and see the city you\u2019re in. I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I want to go and see things.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ziegler</strong>: \u201cThe best thing, for me, is the stadiums they are building or they have already built. I\u2019m not a big fan of artificial turf, the synthetic grass. But when you can play in Atlanta, in these amazing stadiums full of fans, it\u2019s something special. It reminds me of big games in England or in Italy. They have a few teams building stadiums right now. I think Miami, Austin and St Louis are all building, they want to invest. Maybe I\u2019m in MLS too early, I don\u2019t know, but in the future it\u2019s going to be a great, great league.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/new-york-city-fc-yankee-stadium-mls-playoffs-citi-field\">NYC FC are one of MLS's best teams \u2013 and they're still playing in baseball stadiums</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Mackay-Steven</strong>: \u201cThe best thing, personally, is playing in New York and playing at Yankee Stadium, and living in New York. We\u2019ve got a great team \u2013 we won the Eastern Conference \u2013 so confidence is high. And playing home games in front of our crowds, that are very passionate, it\u2019s great. That\u2019s the highlight for me.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mancienne</strong>: \u201cFor me, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the lifestyle. I\u2019ve been on holiday to America, to places like LA, Miami and Las Vegas, but now I\u2019ve been to places I probably never would have gone to. I\u2019m getting to see the country a little bit more.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tinnerholm</strong>: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the quality of the players you\u2019re facing every day \u2013 it\u2019s top quality, especially with the designated player rule [which allows each MLS franchise to sign up to three players that are considered outside the team\u2019s salary cap]. As a right-back, I mostly face a striker or a winger, and most teams\u2019 DPs are strikers or wingers, so I face a lot of good players.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"442905b6040306a118d40cefaee6ee83a4c608fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/442905b6040306a118d40cefaee6ee83a4c608fd/0_0_3338_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Mackay-Steven: \u2018There\u2019s everything I want on my doorstep, and I\u2019m just embracing it all\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Mackay-Steven: \u2018There\u2019s everything I want on my doorstep, and I\u2019m just embracing it all\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Penner/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Could you see yourself staying in North America when you retire?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Onuoha</strong>: \u201cI have a contract here and I want to finish my career here. But having kids, I want to go back home and share those kids with family. I will go back regardless of how much fun we\u2019re having here; that was always my plan. But I know people who, if they were living the life I\u2019m living here, would have no desire to go back whatsoever. The experience has been absolutely incredible. It has been one of the best years of my life and career so far.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ziegler</strong>: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me now to think about that. Right now, I have one more year left in MLS \u2013 my contract ends December 2020. I have to deserve another contract and I have to talk with my wife, but why not?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mackay-Steven</strong>: \u201cI\u2019d definitely be open to it. I\u2019m loving every minute now. I\u2019m settled and happy here, especially the place I\u2019m at [in New York]. There\u2019s everything I want on my doorstep, and I\u2019m just embracing it all. I certainly could see myself living here, for sure.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mancienne</strong>: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I do love it over here but I feel like my home is back in England. That\u2019s where all my family and friends are. I know my partner misses her family and friends, so we\u2019ll definitely be back in England.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tinnerholm</strong>: \u201cWhen I moved here, my first thought was moving back to Sweden. Now, I\u2019m not too sure what will happen. I recently signed a multi-year extension, so I\u2019m going to be here for a couple of years. And we\u2019re expecting a daughter in November; she\u2019s going to be born and raised here. I don\u2019t have any problem staying here. I miss my family and friends a lot but they come and visit us here. It\u2019s also up to my wife \u2013 she has sacrificed a lot \u2013 but we\u2019re open to staying.\u201d</p>",

In the time I spend here, I\u2019ll get to travel to all the different cities in America which have MLS teams, which is a lot of places I wouldn\u2019t usually go if I had a one-week or two-week holiday \u2013 going to Houston or Cincinnati, places like this. Most of the trips for away games will take up two or three days, so there\u2019s a lot of time to go and see the city you\u2019re in. I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I want to go and see things.\u201d Ziegler: \u201cThe best thing, for me, is the stadiums they are building or they have already built. I\u2019m not a big fan of artificial turf, the synthetic grass. But when you can play in Atlanta, in these amazing stadiums full of fans, it\u2019s something special. It reminds me of big games in England or in Italy. They have a few teams building stadiums right now. I think Miami, Austin and St Louis are all building, they want to invest. Maybe I\u2019m in MLS too early, I don\u2019t know, but in the future it\u2019s going to be a great, great league.\u201d Mackay-Steven: \u201cThe best thing, personally, is playing in New York and playing at Yankee Stadium, and living in New York. We\u2019ve got a great team \u2013 we won the Eastern Conference \u2013 so confidence is high. And playing home games in front of our crowds, that are very passionate, it\u2019s great. That\u2019s the highlight for me.\u201d Mancienne: \u201cFor me, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the lifestyle. I\u2019ve been on holiday to America, to places like LA, Miami and Las Vegas, but now I\u2019ve been to places I probably never would have gone to. I\u2019m getting to see the country a little bit more.\u201d Tinnerholm: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the quality of the players you\u2019re facing every day \u2013 it\u2019s top quality, especially with the designated player rule [which allows each MLS franchise to sign up to three players that are considered outside the team\u2019s salary cap]. As a right-back, I mostly face a striker or a winger, and most teams\u2019 DPs are strikers or wingers, so I face a lot of good players.\u201d Could you see yourself staying in North America when you retire? Onuoha: \u201cI have a contract here and I want to finish my career here. But having kids, I want to go back home and share those kids with family. I will go back regardless of how much fun we\u2019re having here; that was always my plan. But I know people who, if they were living the life I\u2019m living here, would have no desire to go back whatsoever. The experience has been absolutely incredible. It has been one of the best years of my life and career so far.\u201d Ziegler: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me now to think about that. Right now, I have one more year left in MLS \u2013 my contract ends December 2020. I have to deserve another contract and I have to talk with my wife, but why not?\u201d Mackay-Steven: \u201cI\u2019d definitely be open to it. I\u2019m loving every minute now. I\u2019m settled and happy here, especially the place I\u2019m at [in New York]. There\u2019s everything I want on my doorstep, and I\u2019m just embracing it all. I certainly could see myself living here, for sure.\u201d Mancienne: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I do love it over here but I feel like my home is back in England. That\u2019s where all my family and friends are. I know my partner misses her family and friends, so we\u2019ll definitely be back in England.\u201d Tinnerholm: \u201cWhen I moved here, my first thought was moving back to Sweden. Now, I\u2019m not too sure what will happen. I recently signed a multi-year extension, so I\u2019m going to be here for a couple of years. And we\u2019re expecting a daughter in November; she\u2019s going to be born and raised here. I don\u2019t have any problem staying here. I miss my family and friends a lot but they come and visit us here. It\u2019s also up to my wife \u2013 she has sacrificed a lot \u2013 but we\u2019re open to staying.\u201d",

Accusations of links to the flat Earth movement have dogged Bolsonaro\u2019s government.

      "body": "<p>The writer Aleksandar Hemon began his second life as a 28-year-old in 1992, when he was unable to return home after a trip to the United States. He had entered the US on a Yugoslav passport, but in his absence Bosnia became independent following a referendum. Serbian nationalists, backed by the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government in Belgrade, refused to accept the results. They took over towns and villages where Serbs were in the majority and started massacring other ethnic groups. Within a couple of months, Hemon\u2019s native Sarajevo was under siege: his parents caught the last train out of the city. He was then in Chicago, crashing at an acquaintance\u2019s flat.</p> <p>Desperate, and without a country to call his own, he began to live in the world of letters \u2013 much like Joyce 100 years ago. He went quickly from being a Bosnian writer to a shrewd prose stylist in English. By the turn of the millennium he had published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/30/fiction4\" title=\"\"><em>The Question of Bruno</em></a>, his first book of stories. He wrote for Esquire, the Paris Review and the New Yorker. His novels and essays regularly won prizes and fellowships. The success, the spectacular reversal of fortune, was in one sense quintessentially American. But Sarajevo remained a point of departure in all his work, a lost Eden shattered by snipers and tanks. War keeps inevitably cropping up on the sidelines of his vision, most acutely in his shorter fiction. It renders poignant a father\u2019s wish to make a film about his life in \u201cThe Bees, Part I\u201d; it colours the memory of a family reunion in \u201cExchange of Pleasant Words\u201d. Inherent in Hemon\u2019s repeated reimagining of his own odyssey and his desire to recall Sarajevo before the war is the question: what did peace even feel like?</p> <p>In two new memoirs published in one volume, Hemon attempts a nostalgic answer. They are composite portraits of Tito\u2019s lapsed Yugoslavian project, a \u201cframework\u201d into which Hemon\u2019s parents grew, since it provided a way out of poverty and generations of ethnic strife. They could move out of their respective villages thanks to such benevolent postwar policies as mandatory free education and a recognition of women\u2019s rights. They met in Belgrade while still in college, worked in state-owned companies and lived in state-subsidised housing. They saw their own futures as intimately aligned with that of the new nation, and volunteered in youth brigades, taking part in choreographed celebrations of patriotism. Their son, however, despised the collective optimism. At 16, he quoted the Sex Pistols to his parents during arguments, and fancied himself a Bosnian Holden Caulfield.</p> <p>The older Hemon knows better. His feelings about his mother\u2019s socialist lifeline have changed: \u201cNow I envy her; I envy the sense that she was building something larger.\u201d His parents ended up as refugees in Canada in 1993. They moved into the 15th floor of an apartment building in Hamilton, Ontario \u2013 \u201cThere was so much nothing in their new place they could not begin to fill it up.\u201d War had wiped out their faith in reality, their sense of fulfilment in working towards something better for their children. They barely knew anyone in Canada; they scarcely spoke any English. They began afresh in late middle age, working multiple jobs. By 2000, they had saved up enough money to buy a house. Now in their 80s, his parents run an apiary out of their backyard \u2013 \u201cHemon\u2019s Honey\u201d \u2013 and every spring they make a trip to their old apartment in Sarajevo, \u201cwhere they spend most of their time \u2026 getting the news on who has died since last year, who might go before their next visit\u201d. Hemon recognises traces of the broken Yugoslav dream in their belief that food \u201ccan never be a matter of mere leisure\u201d and the contentment they seem to derive from work for work\u2019s sake.</p> <p><em>This Does Not Belong to You</em> is different: Hemon seems responsible here not to his parents, only to his boyhood self. In vignettes rarely more than a page long, he chronicles his earliest memory, his first love, the first time he was beaten up, an entire day spent with his sister breaking dishes in a garbage dump: \u201cNow I realise it was one of the happiest days of my childhood, perhaps of my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>The short, dense passages never feel arbitrary. He is able to recreate the process of recovering memories on the page. War seems like an impossibility, and we inhabit what it was like to grow up in the shadow of a paternalistic regime, where everything seemed fully established \u2013 \u201call the points and objects fixed, all the hierarchies and structures unalterable\u201d. The focus is on lesser acts of damage, a tape recorder he took apart in a fit of adolescent curiosity, the shops that were razed in his Sarajevo neighbourhood to build high-rises and supermarkets. Forgetting is the worst crime, because \u201cwhat could not be recollected never happened and was hence passed over in silence\u201d. In lovely, languorous sentences, Hemon passes over nothing, and records the inner wars of his previous life.</p> <p><em>\u2022 My Parents: An Introduction / This Does Not Belong to You is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "The writer Aleksandar Hemon began his second life as a 28-year-old in 1992, when he was unable to return home after a trip to the United States. He had entered the US on a Yugoslav passport, but in his absence Bosnia became independent following a referendum. Serbian nationalists, backed by the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government in Belgrade, refused to accept the results. They took over towns and villages where Serbs were in the majority and started massacring other ethnic groups. Within a couple of months, Hemon\u2019s native Sarajevo was under siege: his parents caught the last train out of the city. He was then in Chicago, crashing at an acquaintance\u2019s flat. Desperate, and without a country to call his own, he began to live in the world of letters \u2013 much like Joyce 100 years ago. He went quickly from being a Bosnian writer to a shrewd prose stylist in English. By the turn of the millennium he had published The Question of Bruno, his first book of stories. He wrote for Esquire, the Paris Review and the New Yorker. His novels and essays regularly won prizes and fellowships. The success, the spectacular reversal of fortune, was in one sense quintessentially American. But Sarajevo remained a point of departure in all his work, a lost Eden shattered by snipers and tanks. War keeps inevitably cropping up on the sidelines of his vision, most acutely in his shorter fiction. It renders poignant a father\u2019s wish to make a film about his life in \u201cThe Bees, Part I\u201d; it colours the memory of a family reunion in \u201cExchange of Pleasant Words\u201d. Inherent in Hemon\u2019s repeated reimagining of his own odyssey and his desire to recall Sarajevo before the war is the question: what did peace even feel like? In two new memoirs published in one volume, Hemon attempts a nostalgic answer. They are composite portraits of Tito\u2019s lapsed Yugoslavian project, a \u201cframework\u201d into which Hemon\u2019s parents grew, since it provided a way out of poverty and generations of ethnic strife. They could move out of their respective villages thanks to such benevolent postwar policies as mandatory free education and a recognition of women\u2019s rights. They met in Belgrade while still in college, worked in state-owned companies and lived in state-subsidised housing. They saw their own futures as intimately aligned with that of the new nation, and volunteered in youth brigades, taking part in choreographed celebrations of patriotism. Their son, however, despised the collective optimism. At 16, he quoted the Sex Pistols to his parents during arguments, and fancied himself a Bosnian Holden Caulfield. The older Hemon knows better. His feelings about his mother\u2019s socialist lifeline have changed: \u201cNow I envy her; I envy the sense that she was building something larger.\u201d His parents ended up as refugees in Canada in 1993. They moved into the 15th floor of an apartment building in Hamilton, Ontario \u2013 \u201cThere was so much nothing in their new place they could not begin to fill it up.\u201d War had wiped out their faith in reality, their sense of fulfilment in working towards something better for their children. They barely knew anyone in Canada; they scarcely spoke any English. They began afresh in late middle age, working multiple jobs. By 2000, they had saved up enough money to buy a house. Now in their 80s, his parents run an apiary out of their backyard \u2013 \u201cHemon\u2019s Honey\u201d \u2013 and every spring they make a trip to their old apartment in Sarajevo, \u201cwhere they spend most of their time \u2026 getting the news on who has died since last year, who might go before their next visit\u201d. Hemon recognises traces of the broken Yugoslav dream in their belief that food \u201ccan never be a matter of mere leisure\u201d and the contentment they seem to derive from work for work\u2019s sake. This Does Not Belong to You is different: Hemon seems responsible here not to his parents, only to his boyhood self. In vignettes rarely more than a page long, he chronicles his earliest memory, his first love, the first time he was beaten up, an entire day spent with his sister breaking dishes in a garbage dump: \u201cNow I realise it was one of the happiest days of my childhood, perhaps of my entire life.\u201d The short, dense passages never feel arbitrary. He is able to recreate the process of recovering memories on the page. War seems like an impossibility, and we inhabit what it was like to grow up in the shadow of a paternalistic regime, where everything seemed fully established \u2013 \u201call the points and objects fixed, all the hierarchies and structures unalterable\u201d. The focus is on lesser acts of damage, a tape recorder he took apart in a fit of adolescent curiosity, the shops that were razed in his Sarajevo neighbourhood to build high-rises and supermarkets. Forgetting is the worst crime, because \u201cwhat could not be recollected never happened and was hence passed over in silence\u201d. In lovely, languorous sentences, Hemon passes over nothing, and records the inner wars of his previous life. \u2022 My Parents: An Introduction / This Does Not Belong to You is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has reported a fresh slump in clothing sales as poor levels of availability in its stores were compounded by an out-of-date supply chain. The chief executive, Steve Rowe, blamed the 5.5% decline in like-for-like clothing sales on buying errors that meant popular sizes sold out too quickly. A new design team was shedding its womenswear\u2019s reputation for \u201cfrumpiness\u201d, it said, but progress was undermined by the 135-year-old company\u2019s slow and complicated logistics, which meant it could not move products around the country fast enough. This setup contributed to a dire performance from its website, where sales were flat. Rowe conceded the numbers for the first half of its financial year were \u201cnot pretty\u201d. \u201cClothing is not where I wanted it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are about 18 months behind and racing to make up lost time. My No 1 priority is to get under the bonnet of the clothing business.\u201d He pointed to the stronger performance delivered by M&amp;S\u2019s food halls, where the results of its \u201ctransformation\u201d programme were \u201cbeginning to show\u201d. The food business returned to growth over the period, with like-for-like sales up 0.9% in the six months to 28 September, thanks to a programme of price cuts and new ranges. Following almost two decades of attempts to revive the high street giant, Rowe and the retail veteran Archie Norman, who joined as chairman in 2017, are the latest management team to try to reinvent the retailer, which recently lost its place in the prestigious FTSE 100. Like Mothercare, which on Tuesday said it was closing down its loss-making UK chain, M&amp;S is facing an existential crisis as it struggles to compete with cheaper rivals such as Primark and the rise of online shopping. Jill McDonald was ousted as M&amp;S clothing boss in the summer after buying mistakes ahead of a jeans promotion left it with empty rails for a month. While maintaining its crown as the UK\u2019s largest clothing retailer, sales at the high street chain have now been falling for about eight years. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy firm Retail Economics, said M&amp;S\u2019s clothing ranges were \u201cconfused\u201d and had been missing the mark season after season: \u201cThe race is on to fix its broken business model,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sector is evolving at an unprecedented pace and some of the deep-rooted challenges in the business are proving extremely challenging to resolve.\u201d As part of its fightback plan, M&amp;S is closing 120 full-line stores, which sell clothing and food under one roof.

At a doorstop after the regional media symposium on Wednesday, the communications minister said that licence fees are \u201cvery low indeed\u201d and noted media companies were already taking advantage of 2017 changes that watered down cross-media ownership laws. Earlier, Fletcher said the government wanted to see how the current round of media consolidation would \u201cplay through\u201d, resisting pressure from Prime Media to abolish the one-to-a-market rule. The rule prevents regional TV mergers by stipulating that one company must not be able to exercise control of more than one commercial television broadcasting licence in a licence area. Fletcher told reporters in Wagga Wagga that the one-to-a-market rule had been in place for almost 40 years and despite \u201csome advocacy\u201d for its abolition Prime had already submitted a plan to merge with Seven. \u201cThere have been major changes to media regulation, we are seeing media organisations respond; and what we need to do is look at the totality of the policy issues that this raises,\u201d he said. In its digital platforms inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommended the government restructure regional media grants, after criticisms that the first round of \u201cinnovation\u201d grants were too restrictive, and to make donations to not-for-profit organisations engaging in public-interest journalism tax-deductible. Industry participants on Wednesday were told to expect a response \u201cwithin weeks\u201d, as communications department officials confirmed the intention to respond by the end of the year. In the forum, tensions between traditional media and social media evident in submissions to the ACCC played out again. News Corp Australia\u2019s group executive of corporate affairs, policy and government relations, Campbell Reid, accused Google of undermining the revenue model of traditional media, which Google\u2019s representative rejected. Fletcher told reporters in Wagga Wagga it was \u201cimportant to think about the distinctive transition changes and challenges that are faced by regional newspapers in going digital\u201d. Fletcher said that while industry had made \u201csome very constructive suggestions\u201d he believed any program the government introduced should channel philanthropic support \u201cin a consistent fashion to further support any program that government has in place\u201d. The comments suggest government support for media will continue to be targeted at regional areas rather than allow tax deductions to support public interest journalism at large. After negotiating a $60m package to support independent and regional publishers in return for his support, then senator Nick Xenophon accused the Coalition of \u201cblind ideology\u201d for the decision to exclude foreign-owned publishers from grants, even for hiring Australians for local reporting. The regional and small publishers jobs and innovation package delivered just $3.6m in its first round of grants although a further $9m was delivered in October after \u201cinnovation\u201d criteria were relaxed. The forum discussed shifting to a more direct stream of subsidies for regional media, a proposal supported by the Country Press Association. Paul Patrick, the head of content, strategy and development at Prime Media, argued against subsidies in favour of greater deregulation of ownership rules. Labor\u2019s shadow communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said the government needed a \u201ccoherent plan to support regional media in the public interest, rather than an ideologically-motivated scheme that excludes publishers like the Guardian and does favours for Liberal chums\u201d. \u201cThe poorly conceived regional and small publishers jobs and innovation package was foisted on industry by government after Nick Xenophon sold out Australian media diversity for a handful of beans,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cSince then, only a fraction of the fund has been allocated and the ACCC has recommended it be replaced.\u201d Fletcher noted the forum also heard details of the British model to locate journalists in BBC newsrooms around the country and to provide their stories to other local media outlets, a form of government support also being trialled in New Zealand through New Zealand On Air.",

      "bodyText": "The future of the former minister Keith Vaz will be debated by Labour\u2019s ruling body following tensions over whether he should be allowed to stand for Labour in next month\u2019s general election. The national executive committee will consider whether the former MP for Leicester East, who has held the seat for the past 32 years and has a majority of 22,000, will become a distraction to Labour\u2019s general election campaign if he stands again. Last week, the UK\u2019s longest sitting Asian MP, was given an unprecedented six-month ban from parliament for offering to buy cocaine for sex workers and obstructing inquiries by the standards commissioner. The committee will also be asked to consider whether to endorse Chris Williamson, the MP for Derby North, who has been accused of repeatedly downplaying antisemitism in the party, and the Jarrow MP, Stephen Hepburn, who has been suspended over sexual harassment allegations. Diane Abbott is among those NEC members calling for Vaz to stand down. She told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme last week: \u201cI think he should consider his position. I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate.\u201d Other shadow ministers have told the Guardian that Vaz, an NEC member, could become a distraction during what is expected to be a hard-fought and negative campaign by the Conservatives. \u201cRight now, the Tories are seen as the party of sleaze. We don\u2019t need this,\u201d said one. However, the NEC has received letters of support from community groups and fellow MPs calling for Vaz to be endorsed as a candidate, informed sources said. \u201cKeith is like an errant brother. He has not been suspended [by Labour] and therefore it is hard to see on what grounds the party can decide to stop him from standing again,\u201d a senior party source said. Stephen Timms, the former Labour minister, has called for Vaz to be allowed to stand again. \u201cI think Keith has made a great contribution in parliament over a long time,\u201d he told TalkRadio last week. Vaz was chair of the powerful home affairs select committee during his 2016 encounter with the sex workers and oversaw inquiries into drugs and sex work. According to the Mirror, he pretended to be a washing machine salesman called Jim. His punishment was rubber-stamped on Friday by the Commons before the dissolution of parliament so as to assist the Labour party if it decides to prevent him from standing again in the 12 December election. The standards committee said his explanation for what happened during an encounter with male sex workers was \u201cnot believable and, indeed, ludicrous\u201d. Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown MP, said the party accepted the committee\u2019s findings following a three-year investigation into Vaz. If Vaz stands and is re-elected, he will be unable to take up his seat until his suspension ends. He could then still face a recall petition to give voters in Leicester East the chance to oust him. He could face further action from the committee over comments posted to his personal website that appeared to criticise the report, the Commons was told. Vaz claimed that the recording upon which the committee and commissioner relied had been \u201ccompleted discredited\u201d. He said he had been admitted to hospital and would not comment further. In response, the chair of the standards committee, Labour\u2019s Kate Green, told MPs she would be open for the newly constituted committee to hear a complaint about this. Supporters of Williamson have launched a public campaign for him to be readmitted to the party on the grounds that he has been the victim of a witch-hunt. He was suspended in February after he claimed that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to criticism of its handling of antisemitism allegations. He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning following a hearing of an NEC antisemitism panel in June \u2013 prompting an outcry from MPs, peers and Jewish groups. He was suspended again in July after a second panel reviewed the decision to reinstate him and found it \u201ccannot safely stand\u201d. Labour also imposed a separate suspension on 3 September over additional allegations of misconduct. Last month, Williamson lost a high court bid to be reinstated to the party. Unlike 2017, important selections for other seats will be decided in the coming days by panels made up of NEC,constituency parties and regional reps.

      "body": "<p>In October of 2016, Gregory Gelhorn ran the Twin Cities Marathon. Seven months later, he was diagnosed with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes nerve cells to break down, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. The average life expectancy of an ALS patient, once diagnosed, ranges from about two to five years. The cause of ALS is not fully understood, and no cure is known. Gelhorn was in his mid-40s.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a shock,\u201d said Kathy Fessler, Gelhorn\u2019s sister. \u201cHe was always the one who took the best care of himself.\u201d</p> <p>Dying from ALS is a singularly awful experience; the disease causes the body to progressively deteriorate while the mind remains clear and lucid. Gelhorn had loved being active. He had played three sports in high school, coached girls\u2019 basketball and served as a travel director at Lakeville North high school in Lakeville, Minnesota. The disease progressed rapidly; soon, he was using a wheelchair and relied on a BiPAP machine to breathe. Doctors estimated he only had a few months left. Gelhorn and his family \u2013 his two teenage children, wife, parents, and siblings \u2013 began to grieve.</p> <p>In the midst of it all, Fessler happened to see an article in the Star Tribune about Christy Marek, a certified end-of-life doula who lived only a few miles away. Fessler contacted Marek, who soon took on Gelhorn as a patient.</p> <p>A doula, typically, is a professional who helps mothers during pregnancy and childbirth. Unlike midwives, doulas do not serve in a medical capacity; rather, their primary role is to provide emotional, physical and psychological support.</p> <p>The practice originated in the natural childbirth movement in the US in the 1970s, alongside the Lamaze method and the popularity of alternatives to hospital birth, like water birth and home birth. That same generation of Americans who were having children in the 70s are now approaching their twilight years, and the practice of serving as a doula has expanded in scope. End-of-life doulas use the same concept as birth doulas: they provide support for the dying.</p> <p>\u201cOn all sorts of levels, I think the Baby Boomers, that generation has just been here to shake things up,\u201d said Marek. \u201cThe natural birthing movement, they did that. And now it\u2019s the same thing. They\u2019re saying, no, I don\u2019t want the death my parents had. We are rich in possibility, why can\u2019t I make this whatever I want it to be?\u201d</p> <p>End-of-life doulas are sometimes called death doulas, though many have reservations about the term.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, end-of-life is a process,\u201d said Marek. \u201cThe work I do with people isn\u2019t just about that one point in time when somebody dies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F36810e399c58aac5515d647216d9c2ff7fb2cbf1%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2000_3000&amp;left-caption=Shelby%20Kirillin%20poses%20for%20a%20portrait%20at%20her%20house%20in%20Henrico%2C%20Virginia.%20&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd5180fce11e3b74200d68619db7e3b8a7c13678f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2000_3000&amp;right-caption=Kirillin%20shows%20a%20photograph%20of%20one%20of%20her%20patients%20whom%20was%20in%20the%20process%20of%20passing%20away.%20Photograph%20by%20Carlos%20Bernate%2F%20The%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=true\" data-alt=\"shelby\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F36810e399c58aac5515d647216d9c2ff7fb2cbf1%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2000_3000&left-caption=Shelby%20Kirillin%20poses%20for%20a%20portrait%20at%20her%20house%20in%20Henrico%2C%20Virginia.%20&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd5180fce11e3b74200d68619db7e3b8a7c13678f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2000_3000&right-caption=Kirillin%20shows%20a%20photograph%20of%20one%20of%20her%20patients%20whom%20was%20in%20the%20process%20of%20passing%20away.%20Photograph%20by%20Carlos%20Bernate%2F%20The%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=true\">shelby</a> </figure>  <p>Although doulas are not required to have medical training, many come from the healthcare field. Shelby Kirillin, an end-of-life doula based in Richmond, Virginia, has also been a neurointensive trauma nurse for over 20 years. It was her experiences in the neuro-ICU that led her towards becoming a doula. Many of the deaths she had seen there, she explained, struck her as cold, sterile and lonely.</p> <p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t imagine that the person dying had ever envisioned their death to be like that,\u201d she said. \u201cDying isn\u2019t just medical. It\u2019s spiritual.\u201d</p> <p>Fascinated by the idea of a structured approach to end-of-life care that prioritized the individual wishes of the dying, Kirillin enrolled in a doula training course with the <a href=\"https://www.inelda.org/\">International End of Life Doula Association</a> (Inelda), a not-for-profit that promotes the approach. Although there is no centralized regulatory body for doulas, training and certification programs are offered by a number of organizations, including Inelda and the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much fear and anxiety about death,\u201d said Janie Rakow, the president of Inelda. \u201cThe doulas are there to calm everyone down. They work with the dying and their families to educate, to explain what\u2019s happening. That what they\u2019re seeing is part of the dying process.\u201d</p> <p>Rakow and her business partner, hospice social worker Henry Fersko-Weiss, founded Inelda in 2015 to train doulas and promote their use in hospices, hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters. Their training program covers topics like vigil planning, active listening and doula self-care.</p> <p>Part of what doulas do is open the conversation about death and loss, topics that can often be taboo or deeply uncomfortable for the dying or their family.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine if a woman was going through labor and no one around her was talking about it or preparing for it? There\u2019d be an uproar if we treated birth like we treat death,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cYou have to talk about it. You\u2019re dying and you\u2019re no longer going to be here.\u201d</p> <p>Doulas help their patients plan out their deaths: talking with them about their wishes, and how they would like to spend their last day. Some prefer to die in a hospital, others at home. They decide who they want around them, whether it\u2019s with all their family and friends, or a religious figure, or alone. They choose the details of the setting, whether they want to hear music, whether they want to have someone hold their hand, and what rituals \u2013 religious or secular \u2013 they want performed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b413dc26c6c7d9c7815c8f2bb55e34d96f3a7dc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b413dc26c6c7d9c7815c8f2bb55e34d96f3a7dc0/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Christy Marek, is a certified End of Life Doula, and an Anamcara End of Life Practitioner.

Sometimes, it\u2019s a photo album, a collection of recipes, or a video archive. One of Rakow\u2019s patients wrote a series of letters to her pregnant daughter\u2019s unborn child, expressing her hopes and wishes for a granddaughter she knew she would never meet.</p> <p>As death approaches, doulas are tasked with maintaining a sense of calm for the dying and those around them.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my patients this past spring, as he was transitioning, he started to vomit,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cI reminded everyone that when a woman is laboring a birth, sometimes she vomits. It\u2019s the body\u2019s natural way. Let\u2019s just make him comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, the last part of a doula\u2019s work comes a few weeks afterwards, when the doula meets with the deceased\u2019s loved ones to reprocess and discuss everything that has occurred.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s after the casserole brigade has come and gone, and everyone\u2019s gone back to work,\u201d Kirillin said. \u201cWe talk about grief and bereavement. You\u2019re not going crazy. You can be happy and sad in the same moment. There is no timeline.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the practice of guiding the dying on their final journey is not new. Death is not an unknown phenomenon, and the act of tending to the dying has existed as long as human civilization itself. Marek has a theory for why the need for a formalized approach to death has manifested now, in these particular circumstances \u2013 why the dying feel the need to contract a trained professional, rather than being able to rely on a more organic source of support.</p> <p>\u201cIn America, a few generations ago, our communities were doing this work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason the role is showing up in a formalized way now is that we don\u2019t have those community ties any more, not in the same way, and certainly not the same level of responsibility to each other as used to be woven into our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Kirillin agreed: \u201cI would love for our culture to never need me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Much of doula work is the very definition of emotional labor, and though Janie Rakow suspects some doulas feel conflicted about taking money for their services, she sees the profession as no different from that of therapists or hospice workers.</p> <p>\u201cI had one of my patients tell me I wasn\u2019t charging them enough,\u201d she said, though Inelda also encourages pro bono work, and many doulas serve purely on a volunteer basis. She also cautions her doulas not to take on too many cases in a row, and to be cognizant of their own mental health. But, she said, the act of tending to the dying is not as depressing as many assume; rather, it can be very rewarding.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you sit with a dying person and they take their last breath, it is as amazing and awe-inspiring as someone taking their first,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cIt is important, and sad, and needs to be cherished.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory Gelhorn passed away in September 2018. He spent his last day in his home, surrounded by his family. Together, they watched a movie and listened to 90s prog-rock.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 6 November 2019 to correct a description of Janie Rakow and Henry Fersko-Weiss\u2019 partnership.</p></li> </ul>",

There\u2019d be an uproar if we treated birth like we treat death,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cYou have to talk about it. You\u2019re dying and you\u2019re no longer going to be here.\u201d Doulas help their patients plan out their deaths: talking with them about their wishes, and how they would like to spend their last day. Some prefer to die in a hospital, others at home. They decide who they want around them, whether it\u2019s with all their family and friends, or a religious figure, or alone. They choose the details of the setting, whether they want to hear music, whether they want to have someone hold their hand, and what rituals \u2013 religious or secular \u2013 they want performed. Doulas often also perform legacy work, the practice of guiding the dying to create tangible artifacts to leave behind for their loved ones. Sometimes, it\u2019s a photo album, a collection of recipes, or a video archive. One of Rakow\u2019s patients wrote a series of letters to her pregnant daughter\u2019s unborn child, expressing her hopes and wishes for a granddaughter she knew she would never meet. As death approaches, doulas are tasked with maintaining a sense of calm for the dying and those around them. \u201cOne of my patients this past spring, as he was transitioning, he started to vomit,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cI reminded everyone that when a woman is laboring a birth, sometimes she vomits. It\u2019s the body\u2019s natural way. Let\u2019s just make him comfortable.\u201d Finally, the last part of a doula\u2019s work comes a few weeks afterwards, when the doula meets with the deceased\u2019s loved ones to reprocess and discuss everything that has occurred. \u201cIt\u2019s after the casserole brigade has come and gone, and everyone\u2019s gone back to work,\u201d Kirillin said. \u201cWe talk about grief and bereavement. You\u2019re not going crazy. You can be happy and sad in the same moment. There is no timeline.\u201d Of course, the practice of guiding the dying on their final journey is not new. Death is not an unknown phenomenon, and the act of tending to the dying has existed as long as human civilization itself. Marek has a theory for why the need for a formalized approach to death has manifested now, in these particular circumstances \u2013 why the dying feel the need to contract a trained professional, rather than being able to rely on a more organic source of support. \u201cIn America, a few generations ago, our communities were doing this work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason the role is showing up in a formalized way now is that we don\u2019t have those community ties any more, not in the same way, and certainly not the same level of responsibility to each other as used to be woven into our communities.\u201d Kirillin agreed: \u201cI would love for our culture to never need me,\u201d she said. Much of doula work is the very definition of emotional labor, and though Janie Rakow suspects some doulas feel conflicted about taking money for their services, she sees the profession as no different from that of therapists or hospice workers. \u201cI had one of my patients tell me I wasn\u2019t charging them enough,\u201d she said, though Inelda also encourages pro bono work, and many doulas serve purely on a volunteer basis. She also cautions her doulas not to take on too many cases in a row, and to be cognizant of their own mental health. But, she said, the act of tending to the dying is not as depressing as many assume; rather, it can be very rewarding. \u201cWhen you sit with a dying person and they take their last breath, it is as amazing and awe-inspiring as someone taking their first,\u201d said Kirillin. \u201cIt is important, and sad, and needs to be cherished.\u201d Gregory Gelhorn passed away in September 2018. He spent his last day in his home, surrounded by his family. Together, they watched a movie and listened to 90s prog-rock.

Almost 60% of Peru (675,000 square kilometres, or 260,000 square miles) is covered by Amazon forest. Peru\u2019s primary forest, where you find the lofty hardwoods so prized by commercial timber traders, is shrinking at an alarming rate: Global Forest Watch <a href=\"https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/world-lost-belgium-sized-area-of-primary-rainforests-last-year\">reported</a> that Peru lost 140,185 hectares (346,405 acres) of primary forest in 2018<strong>.</strong> Ash\u00e1ninka territory spans a protected area of primary forest across the east of Peru, near the border with Brazil, so their lands are effectively a buffer zone. <br><br>Ram\u00f3n discovered that, besides TVs and other gifts, people in the Cutivireni area were being offered a derisory price for their timber. He persuaded the community not to sell their part of the forest, and insisted they give back the TV sets. The loggers retreated, but it was pretty clear they would not give up. Working in secret, for fear of retaliation from the loggers, Ram\u00f3n tried to come up with a long-term strategy for preserving the rainforest. He spoke to a Welsh anthropologist, Dilwyn Jenkins, who had been living in the region and studying the Ash\u00e1ninka people for decades. Jenkins, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/dilwyn-jenkins\">died in 2014</a>, suggested the community contact Cool Earth<strong>, </strong>a rainforest charity set up in 2007 by MP Frank Field.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91792568a005f19228b56413229fc820bfbaf160\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91792568a005f19228b56413229fc820bfbaf160/0_207_5552_3331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals take a boat along the Ene River in the Peruvian rainforest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Locals take a boat along the Ene river in the Peruvian rainforest.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cool Earth, which also has projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, offers finance and training to indigenous communities to support them in protecting their areas of the forest.

It has worked in Brazil, Colombia and Peru: if you look at maps of the forest in those countries, you will see that the areas under indigenous control are best protected.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/peru_forest/giv-390252oCqyhY2dwq/\" data-alt=\"map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/peru_forest/giv-390252oCqyhY2dwq/\">map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Ash\u00e1ninka know all about external threats. For years they survived a terror onslaught from the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who targeted young men to join their ranks and occupied villages that then came under retaliatory fire from government forces. In the 1990s, after the guerrillas were defeated, narco-traffickers slipped into their place, offering a high price for remote land for cultivating coca. They restored an airstrip that missionaries had built in Cutivireni in the 1970s and used it to transport drugs and weapons.</p> \n<p>After the years of conflict, the Ash\u00e1ninka face a new threat. The greatest driver of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is now subsistence farming, and as the population grows in these more peaceful times, there is an urgent push to grow more food. A study published in May this year, <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/small-scale-farming-is-a-big-threat-to-biodiversity-in-the-western-amazon-study/\">by Princeton University</a>, on biodiversity loss in Peru, showed that in the western Amazon, smallholder \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d agriculture is the \u201cprimary driver of forest destruction\u201d. The main method of farming among the Ash\u00e1ninka involves felling trees to make a clearing, creating space in the sunlight where their food crops can grow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Director Matthew Owen says that while campaigns against industrial-style palm and soya plantations are working, the focus must now switch to smallholders\u2019 agriculture, which is responsible for keeping deforestation emissions stubbornly high.</p> \n<p>\u201cFiguring out how to support better lives while keeping the forest standing deserves some of the innovation billions that go to carbon storage and better batteries,\u201d Owen says.</p> \n<p>This much is clear from observations on the ground.

But the soil only has a useful life of two years. After that, they will move on and clear another patch.\u201d</p> \n<p> The agronomist is helping Ash\u00e1ninka people in this area to boost the productivity of their land for food crops. Cool Earth also pays a coffee technician to visit the villages and advise on how to improve the quality of their coffee and cacao yields \u2013 these could be a useful source of income. Coffee grows better in the shade, so a successful coffee business keeps the forest canopy intact.</p> \n<p>The Cool Earth team convened a meeting in the tiny settlement of Tankoari, before a crowd of about 50, including children, and the chief.

The map showed the area across the Ene river almost entirely stripped of forest after a government-sanctioned land-grab by farmers from the Andes in the 1980s. On the Cutivireni side, the picture was more varied: dark brown patches showed dramatic forest clearance from 2016, mostly caused by fire, and pale patches indicated the areas where crops were growing.</p> \n<p>Analysts at Cool Earth made these maps from data produced from Landsat images by <a href=\"https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/hansen/matthew-c.\">Matthew Hansen at the University of Maryland</a>.

Jaime Pe\u00f1a, a conservationist and forest expert from Cutivireni and adviser to Cool Earth, has been monitoring incursions into pristine forest for more than a decade.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were clearing areas to grow subsistence crops, without planning or oversight,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too heavy handed, but people have to understand that if they continue to clear at the present rate, in 15-20 years, they will have no forest. Mapping is helping villages to plan how they use land. It is creating the groundwork for a new chapter.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the areas where Cool Earth is working with communities, planning and managing cultivation has reduced forest loss by half. The power of community engagement is being taken more seriously: the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Programme (Programa Nacional de Conservaci\u00f3n de Bosques) in 2010, rewarding communities who succeed in curbing deforestation and managing sustainable farming systems in their territory with annual payments and technical support. As reports show an increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2016/may/01/gold-mining-in-peru-forests-razed-millions-lost-virgins-auctioned\">illegal mining in southern Peru</a>, with devastating results, the forests of Cutivireni have a much better prospect of survival.</p> \n<p><em>Cool Earth covered the cost of Clare Longrigg\u2019s travel to Peru</em></p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

A number of families from the Ash\u00e1ninka indigenous group had received them from outsiders, in exchange for land. Loggers were interested in the mahogany, oak and tornillo trees that grow to impressive heights in this part of the rainforest around Cutivireni in central Peru. The loggers had other means of persuasion, besides bribery. They might offer to build a school or a meeting house in exchange for timber. When the work ran over budget, they would demand money \u2013 and since the Ash\u00e1ninka had none, they would take more trees to service the debt, according to Adelaida Bustamante, the community treasurer. And if that failed, they used violence. In 2014, four forest defenders from the Ash\u00e1ninka were murdered for their campaign to keep loggers off their land (Ram\u00f3n asked me not to use his real name). Conflict such as this \u2013 over land, timber and forest \u2013 has taken on huge significance in the global struggle to confront the climate emergency and keep the world from overheating. According to the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report, halting deforestation is essential to prevent climate catastrophe. A study this summer indicated the huge potential of tree planting and retention for stabilising the world\u2019s climate. But in the Amazon, remote communities come under sustained pressure \u2013 financial, physical and, yes, televisual \u2013 to clear their land and surrender their trees. Almost 60% of Peru (675,000 square kilometres, or 260,000 square miles) is covered by Amazon forest. Peru\u2019s primary forest, where you find the lofty hardwoods so prized by commercial timber traders, is shrinking at an alarming rate: Global Forest Watch reported that Peru lost 140,185 hectares (346,405 acres) of primary forest in 2018. Ash\u00e1ninka territory spans a protected area of primary forest across the east of Peru, near the border with Brazil, so their lands are effectively a buffer zone. Ram\u00f3n discovered that, besides TVs and other gifts, people in the Cutivireni area were being offered a derisory price for their timber. He persuaded the community not to sell their part of the forest, and insisted they give back the TV sets. The loggers retreated, but it was pretty clear they would not give up. Working in secret, for fear of retaliation from the loggers, Ram\u00f3n tried to come up with a long-term strategy for preserving the rainforest. He spoke to a Welsh anthropologist, Dilwyn Jenkins, who had been living in the region and studying the Ash\u00e1ninka people for decades. Jenkins, who died in 2014, suggested the community contact Cool Earth, a rainforest charity set up in 2007 by MP Frank Field. Cool Earth, which also has projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, offers finance and training to indigenous communities to support them in protecting their areas of the forest. The charity sets up funding for community associations, on condition that the whole group decides how they will spend it (in this remote region, the money is mostly wanted for emergency healthcare). It also uses satellite maps to show locals the extent of forest clearance in their area, and the speed with which the rainforest is disappearing. \u201cThe most effective strategy to conserve the rainforest, in any part of the world, is to empower indigenous groups who are motivated in the same direction,\u201d says Tony Juniper, former director of Friends of the Earth, Cool Earth ambassador and author of Rainforest. \u201cIt\u2019s a tried-and-tested strategy in South America. It has worked in Brazil, Colombia and Peru: if you look at maps of the forest in those countries, you will see that the areas under indigenous control are best protected.\u201d The Ash\u00e1ninka know all about external threats. For years they survived a terror onslaught from the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who targeted young men to join their ranks and occupied villages that then came under retaliatory fire from government forces. In the 1990s, after the guerrillas were defeated, narco-traffickers slipped into their place, offering a high price for remote land for cultivating coca. They restored an airstrip that missionaries had built in Cutivireni in the 1970s and used it to transport drugs and weapons. After the years of conflict, the Ash\u00e1ninka face a new threat. The greatest driver of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is now subsistence farming, and as the population grows in these more peaceful times, there is an urgent push to grow more food. A study published in May this year, by Princeton University, on biodiversity loss in Peru, showed that in the western Amazon, smallholder \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d agriculture is the \u201cprimary driver of forest destruction\u201d. The main method of farming among the Ash\u00e1ninka involves felling trees to make a clearing, creating space in the sunlight where their food crops can grow. In 2016, wildfires caused a spike in deforestation rates in Cutivireni \u2013 fires that may have been started by burning to prepare the ground for planting. So part of the Cool Earth project involves giving local people the information they need to make their farming practices more efficient and less destructive. Director Matthew Owen says that while campaigns against industrial-style palm and soya plantations are working, the focus must now switch to smallholders\u2019 agriculture, which is responsible for keeping deforestation emissions stubbornly high. \u201cFiguring out how to support better lives while keeping the forest standing deserves some of the innovation billions that go to carbon storage and better batteries,\u201d Owen says. This much is clear from observations on the ground. After a long walk through the cool of the Cutivireni forest, past towering tornillo trees and mashonastes with their great buttressed trunks, dangling orchids and tree ferns \u2013 suddenly, a clearing. It looks like the aftermath of a battle: trees slashed to the ground lying, some half-burned, where they fell. Between the trunks sprouted yuca plants, the staple foodstuff of this region, as well as bananas and sweet potatoes. \u201cPeople in remote areas have an obsession with growing yuca,\u201d says Aurora Lume, an agronomy graduate and member of Cool Earth\u2019s field team who grew up in the region (her family had to flee their village when guerrillas moved in). \u201cA family of three will clear a hectare of forest to plant this crop. But the soil only has a useful life of two years. After that, they will move on and clear another patch.\u201d The agronomist is helping Ash\u00e1ninka people in this area to boost the productivity of their land for food crops. Cool Earth also pays a coffee technician to visit the villages and advise on how to improve the quality of their coffee and cacao yields \u2013 these could be a useful source of income. Coffee grows better in the shade, so a successful coffee business keeps the forest canopy intact. The Cool Earth team convened a meeting in the tiny settlement of Tankoari, before a crowd of about 50, including children, and the chief. As woodsmoke billowed, Bustamante gave the villagers a severe lecture about the new clearings we had walked through. There had to be better planning, she insisted, if they were to continue to receive funding. Lume then unfurled the instrument that will enable this planning: a large satellite map. The map showed the area across the Ene river almost entirely stripped of forest after a government-sanctioned land-grab by farmers from the Andes in the 1980s. On the Cutivireni side, the picture was more varied: dark brown patches showed dramatic forest clearance from 2016, mostly caused by fire, and pale patches indicated the areas where crops were growing. Analysts at Cool Earth made these maps from data produced from Landsat images by Matthew Hansen at the University of Maryland. Campaigners, NGOs and investigators increasingly use Hansen data to compile evidence of large-scale clearance by multinational companies. But satellite mapping is also proving a powerful way to demonstrate to local communities the effect of their farming methods. The villagers at Tankoari were impressed: they had not realised the bald patches were so numerous, or so close together. \u201cThe people were taken aback by what they saw,\u201d Daylar Capaquia, a field officer with Cool Earth, told me later. The Ash\u00e1ninka territory runs eastwards almost to the border of the Otishi national park, more than 3,000 sq km of pristine forest, and they had a sense of the forest rolling on indefinitely. \u201cNow the Ash\u00e1ninka are realising their situation and understanding how precarious their environment is,\u201d says Capaquia. \u201cThe mapping exercise is a new beginning, there\u2019s a transition under way.\u201d The Cool Earth funding agreements are, in theory, conditional on keeping the trees standing. \u201cThere will be a challenge,\u201d says Capaquia. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve agreed where they can cut down trees to grow food, they must stick to that.\u201d The challenge was uncomfortably apparent as the meeting continued against the rhythmic sound of axe against tree trunk, followed by the slow, tearing noise of a 100ft tree crashing to the ground. Before the satellite mapping project, the boundaries between what is protected and what is not were never clear. Jaime Pe\u00f1a, a conservationist and forest expert from Cutivireni and adviser to Cool Earth, has been monitoring incursions into pristine forest for more than a decade. \u201cWe were clearing areas to grow subsistence crops, without planning or oversight,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too heavy handed, but people have to understand that if they continue to clear at the present rate, in 15-20 years, they will have no forest. Mapping is helping villages to plan how they use land. It is creating the groundwork for a new chapter.\u201d In the areas where Cool Earth is working with communities, planning and managing cultivation has reduced forest loss by half. The power of community engagement is being taken more seriously: the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Programme (Programa Nacional de Conservaci\u00f3n de Bosques) in 2010, rewarding communities who succeed in curbing deforestation and managing sustainable farming systems in their territory with annual payments and technical support. As reports show an increase in illegal mining in southern Peru, with devastating results, the forests of Cutivireni have a much better prospect of survival.

Speaking on ABC radio in Alice Springs on Wednesday, Wyatt said he thought the current system, under which dealers voluntarily join the Indigenous Art Code (IAC), was not working. \u201cThe Indigenous art code was put into place [in 2009],\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cWe made assumptions that would work but it hasn\u2019t, and we\u2019re seeing this carpetbagging.\u201d Wyatt was responding to allegations raised this week that a private dealer in Alice Springs had taken at least three elderly Indigenous artists from their communities, and at least one was being forced to pay off tens of thousands of dollars loaned to her son by making new artworks. The ongoing practice, which appears to be re-intensifying as the Indigenous art market grows, has been described as \u201cmodern day slavery\u201d. Under the IAC, sanctions can be imposed on dealer members who have acted unethically but it has no power to regulate private dealers who are not members. \u201cI\u2019d like to see stronger sanctions,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cAnd I am talking with my colleagues about how to do this. \u201cIn my own state, I\u2019ve had experiences where people were \u2026 misled. The state government and commonwealth intervened then; we\u2019re going to do that with this one.\u201d Wyatt said he did not think it was the case that Aboriginal artists were choosing to seek better economic opportunities in working for private dealers. \u201cCarpetbagging is to the advantage of the art dealer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve often seen artists who\u2019ve sold at a much lesser price, and then [their work] has incredible mark-ups overseas.\u201d In its letter to the minister, the APY artists\u2019 collective called for the \u201cunderstaffed and under-resourced\u201d IAC to be housed within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and given more support to regulate the industry, demand dealer transparency and end \u201ccarpetbagger sweatshops\u201d. Vivien Anderson, a Melbourne-based gallerist and director of the IAC, said when the code was established they sought to engage bodies like the ACCC to support its action. \u201cBut it became clear that we were not going to be funded to perform the task,\u201d Anderson told Guardian Australia. Anderson said police should be brought in for such exploitation cases but this was not an isolated incident \u201cand it\u2019s been going on for a while\u201d. \u201cPublic awareness is growing and I think all credit to the IAC,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it still shocks me that these individuals are able to move with such stealth, and their objective is to make money.

He said the code was set up to address such issues and he had met with IAC a number of times to discuss further action. APY artists have been instrumental in fund-raising for the Purple House, an Aboriginal community-controlled health service which provides dialysis in remote communities. The Purple House began in 2000 with an auction of paintings at the Art Gallery of NSW, which raised $1m in one night to set up the first clinic in Alice Springs. Community controlled art centres are a very important part of the Purple House story, said CEO Sarah Brown. \u201cIt is absolutely vital that senior people are able to stay on country, to paint and pass on culture.

      "body": "<p>Among all the divinely swaggering paintings in the John Singer Sargent exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in 2015, one in particular seemed to sing out from the wall. In <em><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/644345\" title=\"\">Dr Pozzi at Home</a></em> a man in his prime, assured and desirable, with a fine intelligent face and trimmed dark beard and moustache, stands at ease in a full length scarlet robe; the robe gives him a Renaissance magnificence but doesn\u2019t look like fancy dress \u2013 he\u2019s a man of the late 19th century to his fingertips. And as Julian Barnes says, the fingers are \u201cthe most expressive part of the portrait\u201d, tapering and sensitive: \u201cwe might think him a virtuoso pianist\u201d. Samuel-Jean Pozzi wasn\u2019t a pianist, though, but a virtuoso gynaecologist, a brilliant and humane innovator in women\u2019s medicine. Judging from contemporary photographs of the doctor, Sargent has purged in painting him a hint of complacency, jolliness, eagerness to please \u2013 he may have been less dreamy than his portrait and more affable.</p> <p>Starting out from the painting, Barnes sets out to discover more about Pozzi, and then builds around him, through a dense web of connections and relations, an involving study of a slice of the French past. The story opens in 1885 when the doctor, aged 38, arrives in London with two improbable travelling companions, for what they call \u201cintellectual and decorative shopping\u201d: meaning they go to Liberty\u2019s (where Pozzi will order 30 rolls of \u201cseaweed-coloured curtain material\u201d), and to the Grosvenor Gallery to see the Edward Burne-Jones (French aesthetes often preferred the faux-medievalism of English painting to impressionist experiments going on at home). Henry James takes them to dinner at the Reform Club. Pozzi\u2019s two friends are the Prince de Polignac and Count de Montesquiou-Fezensac; they are improbable because, however inspired and successful the doctor, and however princely Sargent has made him look, he is by his birth and profession irremediably bourgeois. His grandfather was a patissier, his father a Protestant pastor, and Pozzi has risen through good fortune, along with his own efforts and his wife\u2019s money, into the upper tiers of French society, which, despite several revolutions and much turbulence, is still cut fiercely across by caste distinctions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The doctor\u2019s swagger is unmistak\u00adably sexual \u2013 Barnes says the scarlet gown\u2019s tassel looks like a \u2018bull\u2019s pizzle\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his portrait the doctor\u2019s swagger is unmistakably sexual, too \u2013 Barnes says the scarlet gown\u2019s tassels look like a \u201cbull\u2019s pizzle\u201d. To the lifelong chagrin of his wife Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and his adoring, jealous daughter, Pozzi is incorrigibly a womaniser; another difference between him and his two companions in London, in that they are both homosexual \u2013 Montesquiou is supposed to be the model for Marcel Proust\u2019s Baron de Charlus, as well as for Jean des Esseintes in Joris-Karl Huysmans\u2019s <em>\u00c0 Rebors</em>. Yet they like him, and long after the tetchy and contemptuous Montesquiou has broken off friendships with many others \u2013 including with de Polignac, whose mariage blanc with an American lesbian is much too happy for Montesquiou\u2019s liking \u2013 his fondness for Pozzi seems to endure. So how does Pozzi carry off this social adventure, his success? Because success it is: apart from in his domestic life, there\u2019s no social reckoning, no downfall \u2013 that is, until the last, shocking hours of his existence, the unforeseeable denouement. Pozzi knew everyone and was visible everywhere in French progressive society and politics, a committed Dreyfusard; in his late 60s, stouter and greyer, he is still handsome in his lieutenant-colonel\u2019s uniform in the first world war, capably managing a military hospital \u2013 50 beds for wounded, 25 for syphilitics. No doubt he is genial, \u201can adroit social tactician\u201d, with \u201cthe bourgeois pleasure of pleasing\u201d \u2013 as opposed to Baudelaire\u2019s \u201caristocratic pleasure of displeasing\u201d. But it has to be more than that: even an incorrigible nostalgic such as Montesquiou, scornful of what is contemporary, must be drawn partly to Pozzi\u2019s energy, his indefatigable work ethic and his air of belonging to the future; his cheerful rationality and commitment to science.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d3a79fbea030ee6e22e63bf589f24cf02cdd60c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d3a79fbea030ee6e22e63bf589f24cf02cdd60c/0_0_4202_3232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pozzi in army medical division uniform.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"769\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pozzi in army medical division uniform.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger-Viollet/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women, apart from the ones in his immediate family, have reason to be grateful to him. He translates Joseph Lister\u2019s work on antiseptic surgery into French and introduces new standards of antisepsis, leading the way in making an incision into the abdominal cavity a relatively benign operation. He removes innumerable ovarian cysts: these cysts can weigh more than several babies, and contain litres of fluid: \u201cthe streets had been largely cleared of women tottering painfully along behind grotesquely inflated stomachs\u201d. He visits and learns from the innovative Mayo Clinic in America, and is among the innovators using clamps for compressing blood vessels, and \u201cthin rods of soluble caramel to hold the artery in place while suturing with the finest of embroidery stitches\u201d. Best of all, he is not knife-happy: wisely he warns that surgery should only be used as a last resort \u2013 at a time when other doctors are merrily removing ovaries to cure nervous troubles. Pozzi has frescoes painted on the walls of his clean, airy hospitals, to aid patients\u2019 recovery; and although he has many private patients in high society \u2013 the women he mingled with at parties trust him with their intimate sufferings \u2013 he works primarily in state-run hospitals for the general population.</p> <p>Does Pozzi perform abortions? Barnes does not discuss the possibility, but it\u2019s not unthinkable that this agnostic Darwinist might have helped women needing that particular procedure. He gives his friend Montesquiou a jokey written pledge, in return for a copy of a book, promising to keep Bed No 1 at his hospital at the disposal of any woman Montesquiou sends him; it\u2019s tempting to read this as joshing between one man of the world and another, offering assistance for a lover\u2019s awkward problems with his mistresses \u2013 and conveniently keeping afloat a fiction of Montesquiou\u2019s heterosexuality. Who knows? Barnes insists time and again that there is so much \u201cwe cannot know\u201d; that biography \u201cis a collection of holes tied together with string\u201d. We perceive these days an uneasy contradiction between Pozzi the doctor transforming women\u2019s lives through medicine and Pozzi the womaniser, making his wife miserable with his succession of lovers \u2013 including probably Sarah Bernhardt, Bizet\u2019s widow, the poet Judith Gautier, several actresses and, finally, cultured, music-loving Emma Fischoff, who becomes his life companion after his eventual separation from Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. At a Medical Students\u2019 Ball, senior doctor Pozzi hoists a naked girl up on to the stage, kisses her on the mouth, and then, turning to the rioting crowd, makes \u201ca gesture as if to say, \u2018Do as I do.\u2019\u201d Perhaps there is no contradiction: both careers exuberantly express male energy, male power and achievement, at a time when these could appear unproblematically progressive, and when critique was most likely to come from the forces of social conservatism, and the church.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/26/julian-barnes-europe-deal-interview-man-red-coat\">Julian Barnes: \u2018Do you expect Europe to cut us a good deal?

In Dr Pozzi at Home a man in his prime, assured and desirable, with a fine intelligent face and trimmed dark beard and moustache, stands at ease in a full length scarlet robe; the robe gives him a Renaissance magnificence but doesn\u2019t look like fancy dress \u2013 he\u2019s a man of the late 19th century to his fingertips. And as Julian Barnes says, the fingers are \u201cthe most expressive part of the portrait\u201d, tapering and sensitive: \u201cwe might think him a virtuoso pianist\u201d. Samuel-Jean Pozzi wasn\u2019t a pianist, though, but a virtuoso gynaecologist, a brilliant and humane innovator in women\u2019s medicine. Judging from contemporary photographs of the doctor, Sargent has purged in painting him a hint of complacency, jolliness, eagerness to please \u2013 he may have been less dreamy than his portrait and more affable. Starting out from the painting, Barnes sets out to discover more about Pozzi, and then builds around him, through a dense web of connections and relations, an involving study of a slice of the French past. The story opens in 1885 when the doctor, aged 38, arrives in London with two improbable travelling companions, for what they call \u201cintellectual and decorative shopping\u201d: meaning they go to Liberty\u2019s (where Pozzi will order 30 rolls of \u201cseaweed-coloured curtain material\u201d), and to the Grosvenor Gallery to see the Edward Burne-Jones (French aesthetes often preferred the faux-medievalism of English painting to impressionist experiments going on at home). Henry James takes them to dinner at the Reform Club. Pozzi\u2019s two friends are the Prince de Polignac and Count de Montesquiou-Fezensac; they are improbable because, however inspired and successful the doctor, and however princely Sargent has made him look, he is by his birth and profession irremediably bourgeois. His grandfather was a patissier, his father a Protestant pastor, and Pozzi has risen through good fortune, along with his own efforts and his wife\u2019s money, into the upper tiers of French society, which, despite several revolutions and much turbulence, is still cut fiercely across by caste distinctions. In his portrait the doctor\u2019s swagger is unmistakably sexual, too \u2013 Barnes says the scarlet gown\u2019s tassels look like a \u201cbull\u2019s pizzle\u201d. To the lifelong chagrin of his wife Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and his adoring, jealous daughter, Pozzi is incorrigibly a womaniser; another difference between him and his two companions in London, in that they are both homosexual \u2013 Montesquiou is supposed to be the model for Marcel Proust\u2019s Baron de Charlus, as well as for Jean des Esseintes in Joris-Karl Huysmans\u2019s \u00c0 Rebors. Yet they like him, and long after the tetchy and contemptuous Montesquiou has broken off friendships with many others \u2013 including with de Polignac, whose mariage blanc with an American lesbian is much too happy for Montesquiou\u2019s liking \u2013 his fondness for Pozzi seems to endure. So how does Pozzi carry off this social adventure, his success? Because success it is: apart from in his domestic life, there\u2019s no social reckoning, no downfall \u2013 that is, until the last, shocking hours of his existence, the unforeseeable denouement. Pozzi knew everyone and was visible everywhere in French progressive society and politics, a committed Dreyfusard; in his late 60s, stouter and greyer, he is still handsome in his lieutenant-colonel\u2019s uniform in the first world war, capably managing a military hospital \u2013 50 beds for wounded, 25 for syphilitics. No doubt he is genial, \u201can adroit social tactician\u201d, with \u201cthe bourgeois pleasure of pleasing\u201d \u2013 as opposed to Baudelaire\u2019s \u201caristocratic pleasure of displeasing\u201d. But it has to be more than that: even an incorrigible nostalgic such as Montesquiou, scornful of what is contemporary, must be drawn partly to Pozzi\u2019s energy, his indefatigable work ethic and his air of belonging to the future; his cheerful rationality and commitment to science. Women, apart from the ones in his immediate family, have reason to be grateful to him. He translates Joseph Lister\u2019s work on antiseptic surgery into French and introduces new standards of antisepsis, leading the way in making an incision into the abdominal cavity a relatively benign operation. He removes innumerable ovarian cysts: these cysts can weigh more than several babies, and contain litres of fluid: \u201cthe streets had been largely cleared of women tottering painfully along behind grotesquely inflated stomachs\u201d. He visits and learns from the innovative Mayo Clinic in America, and is among the innovators using clamps for compressing blood vessels, and \u201cthin rods of soluble caramel to hold the artery in place while suturing with the finest of embroidery stitches\u201d. Best of all, he is not knife-happy: wisely he warns that surgery should only be used as a last resort \u2013 at a time when other doctors are merrily removing ovaries to cure nervous troubles. Pozzi has frescoes painted on the walls of his clean, airy hospitals, to aid patients\u2019 recovery; and although he has many private patients in high society \u2013 the women he mingled with at parties trust him with their intimate sufferings \u2013 he works primarily in state-run hospitals for the general population. Does Pozzi perform abortions? Barnes does not discuss the possibility, but it\u2019s not unthinkable that this agnostic Darwinist might have helped women needing that particular procedure. He gives his friend Montesquiou a jokey written pledge, in return for a copy of a book, promising to keep Bed No 1 at his hospital at the disposal of any woman Montesquiou sends him; it\u2019s tempting to read this as joshing between one man of the world and another, offering assistance for a lover\u2019s awkward problems with his mistresses \u2013 and conveniently keeping afloat a fiction of Montesquiou\u2019s heterosexuality. Who knows? Barnes insists time and again that there is so much \u201cwe cannot know\u201d; that biography \u201cis a collection of holes tied together with string\u201d. We perceive these days an uneasy contradiction between Pozzi the doctor transforming women\u2019s lives through medicine and Pozzi the womaniser, making his wife miserable with his succession of lovers \u2013 including probably Sarah Bernhardt, Bizet\u2019s widow, the poet Judith Gautier, several actresses and, finally, cultured, music-loving Emma Fischoff, who becomes his life companion after his eventual separation from Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. At a Medical Students\u2019 Ball, senior doctor Pozzi hoists a naked girl up on to the stage, kisses her on the mouth, and then, turning to the rioting crowd, makes \u201ca gesture as if to say, \u2018Do as I do.\u2019\u201d Perhaps there is no contradiction: both careers exuberantly express male energy, male power and achievement, at a time when these could appear unproblematically progressive, and when critique was most likely to come from the forces of social conservatism, and the church. Barnes tells us that he immersed himself in these past French lives partly as a respite from \u201cBritain\u2019s deluded, masochistic departure from the European Union\u201d, and as a gesture against insularity. And indeed it is salutary to be so thoroughly submerged \u2013 even sometimes to the point of drowning \u2013 in abundant detail from the \u201cdistant, decadent, hectic, violent, narcissistic and neurotic Belle Epoque\u201d, with all its fascination and its difference from us. The past liberates us from the shallowness of our absorption in the present, and reminds us that we always know less than we think about what we\u2019re doing. \u2022 The Man in the Red Coat is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time we were brought up on fairytales. If we were lucky, they said, we would meet a prince or princess and live happily ever after. If not, we would tread a lonely road to the grave, with only cats to comfort us.</p> <p>But an increasing number of \u201csingle-positive\u201d people are rejecting the notion that true love is the only path to happiness. Just this week, the actor Emma Watson told Vogue how a \u201cbloody influx of subliminal messaging\u201d had left her \u201cstressed and anxious\u201d because she was heading into her 30s without a husband and baby. Now, however, she is \u201cvery happy\u201d to be single. \u201cI call it being self-partnered.\u201d</p> <p>The pop star Selena Gomez, meanwhile, whose single-positive songs include Lose You to Love Me and Look at Her Now, has been talking about the fun she has had as a \u201csuper, super single\u201d woman since splitting up with Justin Bieber two years ago. On Twitter, fellow singer Ariana Grande called the time since her split with Pete Davidson \u201cone hell of a productive, emotional, wild and yet ... happy! year\u201d. And as for Lizzo, currently touring the UK, she is proud to say she puts the \u201csing in single\u201d. As she put it in her 2017 hit Truth Hurts: \u201cI will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick \u2026 Ain\u2019t worried \u2019bout a ring on my finger.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is Abi Jackson, 37, who fell in love with the single life in 2015 after the end of a five-year engagement. \u201cFocusing on what you can gain from being single rather than what you\u2019re missing is extremely empowering,\u201d says the London-based writer. \u201cI took up cycling as a hobby and absolutely loved it, which I might not have discovered if I hadn\u2019t been single and pushing myself to try new things.\u201d She has more time to focus on relationships with friends and family, as well as community activities such as volunteering with the Scouts. \u201cWe need to start saying: \u2018You are enough as a single person\u2019, otherwise it can start to define you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7ca1004f401d171a48b05683a601995fb5c78f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7ca1004f401d171a48b05683a601995fb5c78f9/1356_1_3285_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puts the \u2018sing in single\u2019 ...

Lizzo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for MTV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like a growing number of single women, Jackson says she takes herself out on dates. \u201cSome people seem to think going to the cinema or having dinner by yourself is weird, but it\u2019s brilliant. I dress up and really make the most of my night. I won\u2019t hide away in the corner or apologise for being on my own.\u201d Although she hasn\u2019t ruled out being in a relationship, Jackson says dating turned her into a caricature. \u201cIt felt like I was being reduced to funny anecdotes about bad dates and failed flings. It\u2019s easy to become hyperaware of<strong> </strong>that fairytale narrative, especially for women, but I don\u2019t think being single should be framed around looking for love. It\u2019s about developing a positive relationship with yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Having dabbled with dating apps since 2017, it\u2019s a feeling with which I\u2019m familiar. While it\u2019s easy to meet people online, I\u2019ve always found it hard to make a real connection. There are only so many times I can swipe left on men called Zed who pose topless in their nan\u2019s living room. Instead of sitting through another mediocre round of drinks with a teetotal accountant preparing for his next Tough Mudder, I would rather spend time doing the things I love. Whether that\u2019s going to the theatre, visiting the farmers\u2019 market or creating new recipes with my pretentious, overpriced vegetables, it feels more empowering to invest in your own passions. No one wants to end up like Bridget Jones, that vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters.</p> <p>In 2018, the author Catherine Gray published a book about how her search for happiness had led her to take a year off dating. And what did she call it? The Unexpected Joy of Being Single.</p> <p>Danielle Wrate, 43, an editor and publisher, is also happy on her own. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve found a way to enjoy your own company and go out alone, it\u2019s liberating,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stigma of being out alone is dying out. I see lots of people doing things by themselves now. I travel alone and get the best of both worlds, because I can always join day trips when I want some company.\u201d Wrate is part of a local group called Sinkies, which stands for Single Income, No Kids. It was set up by a single woman who wanted to improve her social life; there are regular pub quizzes, hikes and Sunday lunches. \u201cThere are a lot of members and it\u2019s open to both sexes, but only women ever turn up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d913711364a7515f23e80e39b000896a88c6f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d913711364a7515f23e80e39b000896a88c6f98/0_133_3070_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Watson has renamed being single \u2018self-partnered\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Watson has renamed being single \u2018self-partnered\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is indeed a trend that is largely led by women. But Rob Smith, 36, who runs a property development business on the south coast of England, points out that maintaining a happy relationship with yourself is just as important for men. \u201cI\u2019ve been single for five years and I\u2019m very comfortable with it. I had a job that required me to travel frequently and I value my independence, freedom and flexibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to have a lot of the experiences I have had if I was in a relationship.\u201d However, when his family started making jokes about his single status and pressuring him to settle down, he began to internalise their negativity. \u201cI ended up going on a dating spree to try and find someone, which made me really unhappy.\u201d</p> <p>After some soul-searching, he came to the conclusion that he was happier alone than trying to force a romance out of thin air. \u201cI deleted all the apps and decided to go back to enjoying my single life.\u201d He confronted his relatives about the comments they had been making, and asked them to respect his decision to be single. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s as much pressure on men to settle down as there is for women, but it definitely exists. I\u2019m very happy with my life and I needed my family to understand that.\u201d</p> <p>Although he is open to the idea of having his own family in future, he says it will not affect his happiness. \u201cMen are lucky because they have the option of having children much later,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose that might be an added challenge for women.\u201d</p> <p>According to Paul Dolan, a behavioural scientist from the London School of Economics, traditional benchmarks of adulthood such as marriage and children don\u2019t always correlate with increased happiness. In fact, research included in his latest book, Happy Ever After, shows that women who remain single and child-free actually live longer, happier and healthier lives. Yet negative stereotypes about single women in particular can be pernicious. \u201cLook at how Jennifer Aniston was portrayed for years,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cShe was on the cover of every magazine as the woman who couldn\u2019t get a man. The reality is she\u2019s beautiful, successful and has an incredible life. She never needed our pity \u2013 and nor do other single women.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Bolick, 47, author of Spinster: Making a Life of One\u2019s Own, couldn\u2019t agree more. Part memoir, part social history, the book follows the lives of five single women at the turn of the last century, including the social reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman and poet Edna St Vincent Millay. \u201cThroughout history, whenever women have been allowed more educational, vocational and economic opportunities, they have delayed marriage or rejected it altogether,\u201d Bolick says. Marriage rates have certainly been dropping in the UK, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. In 2015 there were 239,020 marriages between opposite-sex couples, down 3.4% on the previous year. \u201cMany single women are fine the way they are,\u201d says Bolick. \u201cIt is important that we show this reality so that singles can be seen accurately.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e585178f24e2157fc5d47b9fc0dc742b6d7fd263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e585178f24e2157fc5d47b9fc0dc742b6d7fd263/0_47_2715_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridget Jones, the vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bridget Jones, the vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Allstar Colle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To reflect that reality, Nicola Slawson, 35, a journalist from Shropshire, set up the <a href=\"https://thesinglesupplement.substack.com/\">Single Supplement</a>, a newsletter for single women. \u201cA lot of the content aimed at women is condescending and negative,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what to do with your partner or how to get a partner if you don\u2019t have one. The assumption that being in a relationship is the norm is really infuriating. So I aim to write about the things that really matter to single women \u2013 everything from self-acceptance to practical issues like money management on a single income.\u201d</p> <p>Like Wrate, Slawson is an advocate of solo travel. \u201cI was advised against going to Morocco by myself as a single woman,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I went anyway and had one of the best experiences of my life. You have to be careful, of course, but don\u2019t let other people\u2019s assumptions and ideals put you off doing something you want to do.\u201d</p> <p>For others, a positive approach to singledom involves more than travelling alone or taking themselves out on dates. In 2015, Sophie Tanner, a digital consultant from Brighton, decided to embrace \u201csologamy\u201d, the act of marrying oneself. \u201cIt was a slightly tongue-in-cheek statement against the stigma of being single. But people were incredibly supportive and took it seriously.\u201d Tanner\u2019s spiritual ceremony, which was presided over by a friend, was followed by a reception with her friends and family. By prioritising her relationship with herself, she says, she has developed as a person and found greater self-acceptance and happiness. \u201cIt was great to celebrate, because unless you marry or have children, there are no opportunities to celebrate your own happiness in adult life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e22cffa08544f9411e4274bfadea9d3d30b8d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e22cffa08544f9411e4274bfadea9d3d30b8d47/0_191_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Tanner embraces \u2018sologamy\u2019, the act of marrying oneself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Tanner embraces \u2018sologamy\u2019, the act of marrying oneself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Sophie Tanner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year Tanner released her novel Reader, I Married Me, loosely based on her experiences of sologamy. \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-romcom, where the character embraces the power of being on her own,\u201d she says. Although she believes romantic love can bring happiness, Tanner maintains that having a positive relationship with yourself is more important. \u201cIt feels like there are more couples who are settling than those who are truly compatible. People could surprise themselves by realising how happy they could be on their own.\u201d</p> <p>In a world geared up for couples, it\u2019s easy to subscribe to the sad-single-female rhetoric that society thrusts in our direction. I was heartbroken when I split up with my last boyfriend after 16 months, but I quickly realised it saved me from the type of mediocre relationship that Tanner describes. Except for the days where I\u2019m waging a one-woman war against a fitted sheet, I\u2019m now much happier on my own.</p> <p>\u201cAs a society we are obsessed with finding the One,\u201d Tanner says. \u201cWe tend to believe we can\u2019t be fully happy unless we have that, which is just not true. It\u2019s not the norm for people to find their soulmate, but because we put so much pressure on the importance of being with someone, people lower their expectations or put up with average or even toxic relationships.\u201d Now 40, Tanner loves having time for her hobbies. \u201cI enjoy solitude; I love reading, writing and walking my dog by the sea.\u201d She doesn\u2019t get lonely. \u201cLoneliness is an emotional response to feeling unloved and unseen, which can happen in or out of a relationship. It\u2019s about feeling misunderstood or lacking connection. Happy solitude means you are comfortable in your own skin.\u201d</p> <p>She says she is not bothered by the thought that she may never have children. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have children to complete you, in the same way that you don\u2019t need a partner.\u201d</p> <p>All you need, in fact, is self-belief. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in apologising for existing as a single woman or sitting around feeling like I am waiting for my life to start,\u201d says Slawson. \u201cI just want to get out there and live it.\u201d</p>",

As she put it in her 2017 hit Truth Hurts: \u201cI will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick \u2026 Ain\u2019t worried \u2019bout a ring on my finger.\u201d Nor is Abi Jackson, 37, who fell in love with the single life in 2015 after the end of a five-year engagement. \u201cFocusing on what you can gain from being single rather than what you\u2019re missing is extremely empowering,\u201d says the London-based writer. \u201cI took up cycling as a hobby and absolutely loved it, which I might not have discovered if I hadn\u2019t been single and pushing myself to try new things.\u201d She has more time to focus on relationships with friends and family, as well as community activities such as volunteering with the Scouts. \u201cWe need to start saying: \u2018You are enough as a single person\u2019, otherwise it can start to define you.\u201d Like a growing number of single women, Jackson says she takes herself out on dates. \u201cSome people seem to think going to the cinema or having dinner by yourself is weird, but it\u2019s brilliant. I dress up and really make the most of my night. I won\u2019t hide away in the corner or apologise for being on my own.\u201d Although she hasn\u2019t ruled out being in a relationship, Jackson says dating turned her into a caricature. \u201cIt felt like I was being reduced to funny anecdotes about bad dates and failed flings. It\u2019s easy to become hyperaware of that fairytale narrative, especially for women, but I don\u2019t think being single should be framed around looking for love. It\u2019s about developing a positive relationship with yourself.\u201d Having dabbled with dating apps since 2017, it\u2019s a feeling with which I\u2019m familiar. While it\u2019s easy to meet people online, I\u2019ve always found it hard to make a real connection. There are only so many times I can swipe left on men called Zed who pose topless in their nan\u2019s living room. Instead of sitting through another mediocre round of drinks with a teetotal accountant preparing for his next Tough Mudder, I would rather spend time doing the things I love. Whether that\u2019s going to the theatre, visiting the farmers\u2019 market or creating new recipes with my pretentious, overpriced vegetables, it feels more empowering to invest in your own passions. No one wants to end up like Bridget Jones, that vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters. In 2018, the author Catherine Gray published a book about how her search for happiness had led her to take a year off dating. And what did she call it? The Unexpected Joy of Being Single. Danielle Wrate, 43, an editor and publisher, is also happy on her own. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve found a way to enjoy your own company and go out alone, it\u2019s liberating,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stigma of being out alone is dying out. I see lots of people doing things by themselves now. I travel alone and get the best of both worlds, because I can always join day trips when I want some company.\u201d Wrate is part of a local group called Sinkies, which stands for Single Income, No Kids. It was set up by a single woman who wanted to improve her social life; there are regular pub quizzes, hikes and Sunday lunches. \u201cThere are a lot of members and it\u2019s open to both sexes, but only women ever turn up.\u201d This is indeed a trend that is largely led by women. But Rob Smith, 36, who runs a property development business on the south coast of England, points out that maintaining a happy relationship with yourself is just as important for men. \u201cI\u2019ve been single for five years and I\u2019m very comfortable with it. I had a job that required me to travel frequently and I value my independence, freedom and flexibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to have a lot of the experiences I have had if I was in a relationship.\u201d However, when his family started making jokes about his single status and pressuring him to settle down, he began to internalise their negativity. \u201cI ended up going on a dating spree to try and find someone, which made me really unhappy.\u201d After some soul-searching, he came to the conclusion that he was happier alone than trying to force a romance out of thin air. \u201cI deleted all the apps and decided to go back to enjoying my single life.\u201d He confronted his relatives about the comments they had been making, and asked them to respect his decision to be single. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s as much pressure on men to settle down as there is for women, but it definitely exists. I\u2019m very happy with my life and I needed my family to understand that.\u201d Although he is open to the idea of having his own family in future, he says it will not affect his happiness. \u201cMen are lucky because they have the option of having children much later,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose that might be an added challenge for women.\u201d According to Paul Dolan, a behavioural scientist from the London School of Economics, traditional benchmarks of adulthood such as marriage and children don\u2019t always correlate with increased happiness. In fact, research included in his latest book, Happy Ever After, shows that women who remain single and child-free actually live longer, happier and healthier lives. Yet negative stereotypes about single women in particular can be pernicious. \u201cLook at how Jennifer Aniston was portrayed for years,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cShe was on the cover of every magazine as the woman who couldn\u2019t get a man. The reality is she\u2019s beautiful, successful and has an incredible life. She never needed our pity \u2013 and nor do other single women.\u201d Kate Bolick, 47, author of Spinster: Making a Life of One\u2019s Own, couldn\u2019t agree more. Part memoir, part social history, the book follows the lives of five single women at the turn of the last century, including the social reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman and poet Edna St Vincent Millay. \u201cThroughout history, whenever women have been allowed more educational, vocational and economic opportunities, they have delayed marriage or rejected it altogether,\u201d Bolick says. Marriage rates have certainly been dropping in the UK, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. In 2015 there were 239,020 marriages between opposite-sex couples, down 3.4% on the previous year. \u201cMany single women are fine the way they are,\u201d says Bolick. \u201cIt is important that we show this reality so that singles can be seen accurately.\u201d To reflect that reality, Nicola Slawson, 35, a journalist from Shropshire, set up the Single Supplement, a newsletter for single women. \u201cA lot of the content aimed at women is condescending and negative,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what to do with your partner or how to get a partner if you don\u2019t have one. The assumption that being in a relationship is the norm is really infuriating. So I aim to write about the things that really matter to single women \u2013 everything from self-acceptance to practical issues like money management on a single income.\u201d Like Wrate, Slawson is an advocate of solo travel. \u201cI was advised against going to Morocco by myself as a single woman,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I went anyway and had one of the best experiences of my life. You have to be careful, of course, but don\u2019t let other people\u2019s assumptions and ideals put you off doing something you want to do.\u201d For others, a positive approach to singledom involves more than travelling alone or taking themselves out on dates. In 2015, Sophie Tanner, a digital consultant from Brighton, decided to embrace \u201csologamy\u201d, the act of marrying oneself. \u201cIt was a slightly tongue-in-cheek statement against the stigma of being single. But people were incredibly supportive and took it seriously.\u201d Tanner\u2019s spiritual ceremony, which was presided over by a friend, was followed by a reception with her friends and family. By prioritising her relationship with herself, she says, she has developed as a person and found greater self-acceptance and happiness. \u201cIt was great to celebrate, because unless you marry or have children, there are no opportunities to celebrate your own happiness in adult life.\u201d This year Tanner released her novel Reader, I Married Me, loosely based on her experiences of sologamy. \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-romcom, where the character embraces the power of being on her own,\u201d she says. Although she believes romantic love can bring happiness, Tanner maintains that having a positive relationship with yourself is more important. \u201cIt feels like there are more couples who are settling than those who are truly compatible. People could surprise themselves by realising how happy they could be on their own.\u201d In a world geared up for couples, it\u2019s easy to subscribe to the sad-single-female rhetoric that society thrusts in our direction. I was heartbroken when I split up with my last boyfriend after 16 months, but I quickly realised it saved me from the type of mediocre relationship that Tanner describes. Except for the days where I\u2019m waging a one-woman war against a fitted sheet, I\u2019m now much happier on my own. \u201cAs a society we are obsessed with finding the One,\u201d Tanner says. \u201cWe tend to believe we can\u2019t be fully happy unless we have that, which is just not true. It\u2019s not the norm for people to find their soulmate, but because we put so much pressure on the importance of being with someone, people lower their expectations or put up with average or even toxic relationships.\u201d Now 40, Tanner loves having time for her hobbies. \u201cI enjoy solitude; I love reading, writing and walking my dog by the sea.\u201d She doesn\u2019t get lonely. \u201cLoneliness is an emotional response to feeling unloved and unseen, which can happen in or out of a relationship. It\u2019s about feeling misunderstood or lacking connection. Happy solitude means you are comfortable in your own skin.\u201d She says she is not bothered by the thought that she may never have children. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have children to complete you, in the same way that you don\u2019t need a partner.\u201d All you need, in fact, is self-belief. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in apologising for existing as a single woman or sitting around feeling like I am waiting for my life to start,\u201d says Slawson. \u201cI just want to get out there and live it.\u201d",

Over the course of four months, he spent several hours a day observing two nearby stars for any signs of intelligent life.</p> <p>He came up empty handed, but this is hardly surprising. Had Drake discovered life around these stars, it would either be a remarkable coincidence or suggest the universe is teeming with intelligent life.</p> <p>Still, Drake recognised the nascent search for extraterrestrial intelligence had a glaring blind spot. If we ever did hear from an extraterrestrial, how would we go about designing a response?</p> <p>Over the course of the next decade, Drake and some of the world\u2019s pre-eminent scientists devoted considerable intellectual energy to solving this problem. In 1971, researchers from the US and the Soviet Union convened at the Byurakan Observatory in Armenia for the first joint conference on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence and to share their research.</p> <p>Although scientists on both sides of the iron curtain had been working on this problem separately for years, cold war tensions had made it prohibitively difficult to collaborate.</p> <p>But as the Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky remarked before the conference, the prospect of communicating with an extraterrestrial intelligence seemed dim if communication between countries was impossible. In this sense, the conference was as much about easing geopolitical tensions on Earth as it was about communicating with ETs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our interstellar messages reflect human biases and conventions, and may never be seen by extraterrestrial intelligence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Presiding over the talks was a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/08/cosmos-carl-sagan-seth-macfarlane-family-guy\">Carl Sagan</a>, who fielded interstellar communication proposals from the attendees that were as plentiful as they were fanciful: for example, the extraterrestrial communication proposal floated by the astronomer James Elliot that involved detonating the world\u2019s nuclear arsenal on the far side of the moon. In his analysis of Starfish Prime, a powerful nuclear detonation conducted by the US in space in 1962, he calculated that the x-rays from this explosion could be detected at up to 400 astronomical units, or about 10 times the distance of Pluto from the sun.</p> <p>While this is not nearly far enough to be detected in another solar system, Elliot suggested that simultaneously detonating all of Earth\u2019s nuclear weapons on the far side of the moon might do the trick.</p> <p>Based on his estimation of the size of the US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles and an assumption that a device could be developed that would focus the detonation\u2019s resulting x-rays toward a desired target, Elliot calculated that a blast of this magnitude could be detected at up to 190 light years from Earth.</p> <p>It would be a remarkable way to introduce ourselves, but extraterrestrials would have to be observing Earth at the time of the blast, which Elliot conceded made it a less than practical proposal.</p> <p>Though a number of other exotic interstellar communication schemes were floated during the Armenia conference, most of the attendees focused on radio waves as a mundane but eminently more practical communication medium.</p> <p>There were plenty of pragmatic concerns to be addressed when it came to radio transmissions, such as the ideal transmission frequency and choice of stellar targets, but one of the more pressing questions concerned the nature of the message\u2019s content.</p> <p>Among the various proposals for interstellar messages raised at Byurakan, one especially stands out: Minsky, widely regarded as the father of AI, suggested it would be best to send a cat as our extraterrestrial delegate.</p> <p>Behind his humour is a serious proposal. During the conference, attendees debated the best way to convey information about life on Earth, such as the existence of cats. A number of attendees argued that images or symbolic messages would probably be the best way to proceed, but Minsky disagreed.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of sending a very difficult-to-decode educational message and instead of sending a picture of a cat, there is one area in which we can send the cat itself,\u201d Minsky said. \u201cBriefly, the idea is that we can transmit computers.\u201d</p> <p>In Minsky\u2019s mind, an ideal interstellar message would teach an extraterrestrial how to run computer software that could then teach it about life on Earth. This would allow for a far more energy efficient and information rich message when compared with trying to capture the same information in pictures of symbolic messages.</p> <p>The future of interstellar messaging will probably be a mixture of state-of-the-art technology and human culture. Just like the golden records attached to the Voyager spacecraft that departed for interstellar space in the 1970s, each interstellar message is a reflection of the culture that created it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d739ca9cffaaa32a78485cff644515cf819ff321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d739ca9cffaaa32a78485cff644515cf819ff321/0_0_3733_4700/794.jpg\" alt=\"A gold record ready to be attached to a Voyager space probe in 1977\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A gold record that was on board the Voyager space probe in 1977.

More recently, the S\u00f3nar messages broadcast from a radar in Norway contained a unique artificial language designed for interstellar communication and short electronic music clips designed by an international collection of musicians.</p> <p>Tomorrow, our messages will be even more sophisticated. The <a href=\"https://www.scientia.global/the-seti-institutes-earthling-project/\">Seti Institute\u2019s Earthling project</a>, for instance, is amassing a database of sounds submitted by users around the world, which will be electronically remixed to create unique songs that try to capture human music as a gestalt before it is broadcast into space.</p> <p>In the nearly 50 years since the Byurakan conference, the art and science of interstellar message design has continued to evolve in ways that reflect advances in transmission technology and our understanding of human cognition.</p> <p>Since we have yet to achieve first contact, humans remain the only animal in the known universe endowed with higher intelligence, which manifests in our ability to wield language, mathematics, and artistic representation.</p> <p>Our interstellar messages inevitably reflect human biases and conventions, and may never be seen by an extraterrestrial intelligence.

But now comes the hard part: what do you say in return \u2013 and, more importantly, how do you say it? For the past 200 years, the problem of interstellar communication with an extraterrestrial intelligence has vexed some of the world\u2019s greatest scientists and mathematicians. Carl Friedrich Gauss, the mathematician and inventor of the heliotrope, suggested using a large array of mirrors; Guglielmo Marconi and Nikola Tesla, pioneers of wireless communication, found a solution in radio waves; and John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, the progenitors of artificial intelligence, wanted to send computers into space as our extraterrestrial envoys. Any solution to the problem of interstellar communication comes laden with assumptions about the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence and inevitably reflects the technological sophistication of the era. The problem, briefly stated, is how to design a message that can be understood by an extraterrestrial intelligence about which you can know nothing with absolute certainty. This turns the design of interstellar messages into an exercise in identifying universals that can be presumed to be recognised by any entity endowed with higher intelligence. It is, in other words, the search for what may be called a language of the universe. As Galileo recognised in The Assayer, his foundational treatise on the scientific method, \u201cthis grand book, the universe, stands continually open to our gaze. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it.\u201d Following Galileo\u2019s lead, most systems designed for interstellar communication have been rooted in mathematics on the grounds that it would be understood by any intelligent extraterrestrials. But how does one discuss maths with an extraterrestrial? By the mid-19th century, scientists and mathematicians in Europe began to seriously consider methods for communicating with extraterrestrials that they believed might inhabit the moon and Mars. The first such system is attributed to Gauss, who developed a scheme \u201cto get in touch with our neighbours on the moon\u201d that involved creating a massive visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem in the Siberian tundra. This visual proof was to consist of a right triangle bordered on each side by squares and would be created by planting rows of trees for the borders and filling the interior of the space with wheat. Gauss\u2019s proposal appears to have influenced the Austrian astronomer Joseph Johann von Littrow, who later advanced his own plan for establishing contact with our lunar neighbours. His design involved digging trenches in the Sahara in various geometric shapes, filling the trenches with water, topping them with kerosene, and then setting them alight to send flaming messages to the moon. For better or worse, neither of these outlandish schemes for extraterrestrial communication came to fruition. But another of Gauss\u2019s proposals did exert a lasting influence on early European ideas for contacting extraterrestrials in our solar system. As the inventor of the heliotrope, a device that reflected light to send messages over long distances, Gauss envisioned an array of large mirrors that could be used to flash messages through interplanetary space. This idea was picked up by the eccentric poet and inventor Charles Cros, who petitioned the French government for funding to build a giant mirror that would use focused sunlight to burn messages into the surface of Mars. Alas, Cros\u2019s request for funding was never granted. It wasn\u2019t until the advent of wireless communication around the turn of the century that plans for communicating with extraterrestrial intelligence began to take on a more practical form. Early experiments in long-distance wireless transmission by Marconi and Tesla \u2013 both of whom were acutely aware of the implications of their inventions for interplanetary communication \u2013 proved that radio communication was a viable method for communicating with intelligent beings on other planets. But by the first decades of the 20th century, there was growing evidence that humans were the only intelligent life in our solar system. So we finally had a way to call ET, but there would be no one on the other end to pick up the phone. In 1932, Karl Jansky serendipitously observed radiation coming from the Milky Way while working at Bell Labs, thereby inaugurating the science of radio astronomy and turning the entire galaxy into fertile hunting grounds for extraterrestrial life. The first scientific attempt to determine whether we are alone in the galaxy was undertaken by the planetary astronomer Frank Drake at the Green Bank radio observatory in 1960. Over the course of four months, he spent several hours a day observing two nearby stars for any signs of intelligent life. He came up empty handed, but this is hardly surprising. Had Drake discovered life around these stars, it would either be a remarkable coincidence or suggest the universe is teeming with intelligent life. Still, Drake recognised the nascent search for extraterrestrial intelligence had a glaring blind spot. If we ever did hear from an extraterrestrial, how would we go about designing a response? Over the course of the next decade, Drake and some of the world\u2019s pre-eminent scientists devoted considerable intellectual energy to solving this problem. In 1971, researchers from the US and the Soviet Union convened at the Byurakan Observatory in Armenia for the first joint conference on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence and to share their research. Although scientists on both sides of the iron curtain had been working on this problem separately for years, cold war tensions had made it prohibitively difficult to collaborate. But as the Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky remarked before the conference, the prospect of communicating with an extraterrestrial intelligence seemed dim if communication between countries was impossible. In this sense, the conference was as much about easing geopolitical tensions on Earth as it was about communicating with ETs. Presiding over the talks was a young Carl Sagan, who fielded interstellar communication proposals from the attendees that were as plentiful as they were fanciful: for example, the extraterrestrial communication proposal floated by the astronomer James Elliot that involved detonating the world\u2019s nuclear arsenal on the far side of the moon. In his analysis of Starfish Prime, a powerful nuclear detonation conducted by the US in space in 1962, he calculated that the x-rays from this explosion could be detected at up to 400 astronomical units, or about 10 times the distance of Pluto from the sun. While this is not nearly far enough to be detected in another solar system, Elliot suggested that simultaneously detonating all of Earth\u2019s nuclear weapons on the far side of the moon might do the trick. Based on his estimation of the size of the US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles and an assumption that a device could be developed that would focus the detonation\u2019s resulting x-rays toward a desired target, Elliot calculated that a blast of this magnitude could be detected at up to 190 light years from Earth. It would be a remarkable way to introduce ourselves, but extraterrestrials would have to be observing Earth at the time of the blast, which Elliot conceded made it a less than practical proposal. Though a number of other exotic interstellar communication schemes were floated during the Armenia conference, most of the attendees focused on radio waves as a mundane but eminently more practical communication medium. There were plenty of pragmatic concerns to be addressed when it came to radio transmissions, such as the ideal transmission frequency and choice of stellar targets, but one of the more pressing questions concerned the nature of the message\u2019s content. Among the various proposals for interstellar messages raised at Byurakan, one especially stands out: Minsky, widely regarded as the father of AI, suggested it would be best to send a cat as our extraterrestrial delegate. Behind his humour is a serious proposal. During the conference, attendees debated the best way to convey information about life on Earth, such as the existence of cats. A number of attendees argued that images or symbolic messages would probably be the best way to proceed, but Minsky disagreed. \u201cInstead of sending a very difficult-to-decode educational message and instead of sending a picture of a cat, there is one area in which we can send the cat itself,\u201d Minsky said. \u201cBriefly, the idea is that we can transmit computers.\u201d In Minsky\u2019s mind, an ideal interstellar message would teach an extraterrestrial how to run computer software that could then teach it about life on Earth. This would allow for a far more energy efficient and information rich message when compared with trying to capture the same information in pictures of symbolic messages. The future of interstellar messaging will probably be a mixture of state-of-the-art technology and human culture. Just like the golden records attached to the Voyager spacecraft that departed for interstellar space in the 1970s, each interstellar message is a reflection of the culture that created it. In the 1970s, it was a phonograph record filled with everything from 50s rock and roll music to traditional music from Papua New Guinea. More recently, the S\u00f3nar messages broadcast from a radar in Norway contained a unique artificial language designed for interstellar communication and short electronic music clips designed by an international collection of musicians. Tomorrow, our messages will be even more sophisticated. The Seti Institute\u2019s Earthling project, for instance, is amassing a database of sounds submitted by users around the world, which will be electronically remixed to create unique songs that try to capture human music as a gestalt before it is broadcast into space. In the nearly 50 years since the Byurakan conference, the art and science of interstellar message design has continued to evolve in ways that reflect advances in transmission technology and our understanding of human cognition. Since we have yet to achieve first contact, humans remain the only animal in the known universe endowed with higher intelligence, which manifests in our ability to wield language, mathematics, and artistic representation. Our interstellar messages inevitably reflect human biases and conventions, and may never be seen by an extraterrestrial intelligence. But by continuing to explore the problem of interstellar communication, we can learn a lot about what it means to be human in preparation for the day that we discover we\u2019re not alone. \u2022 Daniel Oberhaus is the author of Extraterrestrial Languages, published by MIT Press",

We filed our complaint, then had a local plumber come around to fix the leak. We assumed John Lewis would cover the cost of the repair and the damage. That\u2019s why we chose to pay extra and shop with John Lewis: for peace of mind. Instead, a month-long war of attrition has resulted in customer service not accepting any responsibility. It told us to claim through our home insurance and stated that it will not be responding to any further correspondence from us. But here\u2019s where it gets fun. Our home insurance is through \u2026 John Lewis. But when I explained our situation, the rep said it sounded like faulty workmanship which our policy doesn\u2019t cover. So back to the store.

The Lancet recently published a study on facility-based childbirth in four countries \u2013 Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria \u2013 which found that one in three women had experienced mistreatment during childbirth. This is not just a developing world issue, but a global epidemic. Time and again researchers have shown that whatever the woman\u2019s race, class or location, she has a chance of experiencing mistreatment in childbirth. The problem is so prevalent that the recently published findings of the What Women Want report by the White Ribbon Alliance \u2013 which surveyed 1.2 million women in 114 countries \u2013 overwhelmingly showed that women want to be treated with respect and compassion while seeking and receiving healthcare. There has been much debate about the key drivers of disrespect and abuse during childbirth. The factors responsible come as no surprise: under resourced health systems, overworked and underpaid health workers, an inadequately trained health workforce, restrictive hospital policies, fear of litigation and non-evidence-based policies. Women around the world are bearing the brunt of inadequate care and attention during childbirth due to disrespect, and this must change. Woman-centred, compassionate maternal healthcare needs to become the international standard. The woman who I saw screaming for help during labour needed supportive and expert care to bring her ordeal to a safe conclusion.

She needed a health system to provide resources, equipment, medicines and supplies. She needed her family to be with her, to know what was going on, and what the staff could do to help her. And everyone should have been working ethically and without discrimination. Childbearing women need to know that they and their babies will be treated with kindness by competent, compassionate staff working in a system with zero tolerance for disrespect. The International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) is taking a stand against disrespect in childbirth and will be reconfirming its commitment to quality care by midwives for women at a summit in Nairobi next week, which marks the 25th anniversary of the international conference on population and development. The programme of action agreed at the conference pledged appropriate healthcare services for women through pregnancy and childbirth. We are calling on national health ministers to create policies that prioritise respectful maternity care and highlight that the responsibility of care lies with the healthcare provider and individual professionals. Professional organisations, education institutions and medical, midwifery and nursing education providers need to prioritise training on respectful care, informed choice, consent and the human rights of women and newborns. District and hospital managers need to implement policies and systems that are zero tolerance to abuse and disrespect, in consultation with local communities and professional associations. These policies need to cascade through all services and have a clear mechanism for accountability and a system for calling health professionals to account for any breaches. Global professional organisations, NGOs and international organisations are vital in recognising and upholding respectful maternity care as a human right.

      "body": "<p>Google\u2019s latest smart display is larger and can recognise your face for proactively showing you personalised information making it just that little bit smarter than competitors.</p> <p>The \u00a3219 Nest Hub Max is Google\u2019s second own-brand smart display and is essentially a super-sized version of the excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/22/google-home-hub-review-smart-display-buy-google-assistant-digital-photo-frame\">original Home Hub</a> (now renamed Nest Hub). But where the Nest Hub is a veritable bargain at \u00a3119 or frequently much less, the Nest Hub Max is a different proposition at a little under twice the price.</p> <h2>Bigger is better</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"225508609d4f0c1dc9f8f0c26c1dbc4e51c12cfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225508609d4f0c1dc9f8f0c26c1dbc4e51c12cfd/677_532_3637_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google nest hub max review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 10in Nest Hub Max nest to the 7in Nest Hub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A bigger screen is definitely better for viewing from across a room. The 10in 720p HD screen is bright, crisp enough at normal viewing distances and has Google\u2019s ambient EQ colour tone system so that photos on it look very much like printed photos, not displayed on an overly white and clinical LCD screen.</p> <p>If you use Google Photos, the Hub Max is the best digital photoframe you can buy by far, pulling your pictures from your library and looking fantastic doing it. I\u2019m still amazed at just how good it is to have my cherished memories from holidays and good times seamlessly displayed around the house.</p> <p>The larger display also makes seeing text and information retrieved from questions and commands easier from across the room compared with the 7in display on the Hub Max\u2019s smaller sibling. Video is also better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfc63f767d3b0f4618ddd613342a1a1ae30cbb6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfc63f767d3b0f4618ddd613342a1a1ae30cbb6a/305_456_4461_2677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google nest hub max review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBC iPlayer and many others can be cast to the Hub Max as if it was a Chromecast or TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>YouTube is integrated, of course, and All 4, meaning they can be directly commanded via voice. Other services can be Chromecast to the display from your phone, which makes it more versatile than Amazon\u2019s Echo Show devices. That means BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub, but not Amazon Prime Video in the UK, which doesn\u2019t see the Hub Max despite supporting dedicated Chromecasts.</p> <p>Other than on-screen things, the Hub Max does anything a regular Google smart speaker does making it the best question answering machine you can buy. Timers, alarms, reminders, requests for the weather and most other questions are accompanied by visual information, such as a photo of the actor you\u2019ve just asked about.</p> <p>Assistant has a short-term memory too, so you can ask multiple questions on the same topic without repeating the topic. It works well.</p> <p>The Hub Max, however, has a harder time hearing you than other Google smart speakers. I\u2019m not sure why, but you have to speak more directly to it. But as a consequence not once has it activated by accident when I wasn\u2019t talking to it, which is a big plus for privacy as much as being less irritated by the occasional random outbursts frequently experienced with smart speakers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"249e66c01378d08ad53720d8ee8c462d041105ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/249e66c01378d08ad53720d8ee8c462d041105ee/473_336_4142_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google nest hub max review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mute switch and volume buttons are on the back of the screen, while the speakers are hidden behind the fabric of the pedestal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The speakers are hidden in the fabric pedestal that supports the screen. The Hub Max has two 18 mm tweeters aiming forwards and one 75 mm woofer aiming backwards for richer sound than the smaller Hub. It sounds good, able to fill a room without sounding overly shrill or loud, but not much better than a standard Google Home and not quite on par with the Amazon\u2019s larger Echo Show. It is good enough for watching videos while cooking and for a full rendition of Assistant\u2019s voice, but it won\u2019t match a Sonos One, Home Max or similar for audio quality.</p> <h2>Smile for the camera</h2> <p>The big new addition for the Hub Max is a camera, which some will see as a mixed blessing, introducing more worries about privacy. The camera is used for several things. The first is video calling via Google Duo, which I did once for testing and then never thought about again. It worked well enough with a good wide angle to fit you in frame, but video calling just never seems worth the faff on any device for me.</p> <p>More interestingly the Hub Max can use the camera to recognise faces and hand gestures. The Face Match system works on-device, meaning the camera isn\u2019t constantly streaming to the internet and being used to surveil your every move. It\u2019s really rather impressive and, rather than being a gimmick, I found it genuinely useful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcdba981a94a47657ca6d9871e5a26f3e3469286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcdba981a94a47657ca6d9871e5a26f3e3469286/236_331_4527_2717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google nest hub max review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Set up Face Match on your phone through the Home app and when the Hub Max spots a face it recognises it\u2019ll display the owner\u2019s calendar, reminders, media and other bits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it recognises me or a family member it proactively shows information relevant to whomever is standing in front of it on cards on the screen. Perhaps that\u2019s your calendar appointments for the day, your reminders, your commute or other personal bits. A little chime, my photo and a small greeting appears on screen when it sees me. It feels far smarter, more intelligent use of the display and was very much the killer feature for me.</p> <p>Of course it can recognise you or members of your family with Voice Match too. In the morning you simply say \u201cHey, Google, good morning\u201d and it\u2019ll rattle off your customisable routine of weather, commute, news and so on. Assistant can even reply with different voices for different people, which is quite fun.</p> <p>Gestures for controlling media playback or Assistant speech work well. Show it a hand and the video or audio pauses. That\u2019s handy if you don\u2019t want to shout at it or touch the screen.</p> <p>Finally, the camera can also be used as a Nest surveillance camera similar to one of Google\u2019s dedicated Nest cameras.

      "bodyText": "Google\u2019s latest smart display is larger and can recognise your face for proactively showing you personalised information making it just that little bit smarter than competitors. The \u00a3219 Nest Hub Max is Google\u2019s second own-brand smart display and is essentially a super-sized version of the excellent original Home Hub (now renamed Nest Hub). But where the Nest Hub is a veritable bargain at \u00a3119 or frequently much less, the Nest Hub Max is a different proposition at a little under twice the price. Bigger is better A bigger screen is definitely better for viewing from across a room. The 10in 720p HD screen is bright, crisp enough at normal viewing distances and has Google\u2019s ambient EQ colour tone system so that photos on it look very much like printed photos, not displayed on an overly white and clinical LCD screen. If you use Google Photos, the Hub Max is the best digital photoframe you can buy by far, pulling your pictures from your library and looking fantastic doing it. I\u2019m still amazed at just how good it is to have my cherished memories from holidays and good times seamlessly displayed around the house. The larger display also makes seeing text and information retrieved from questions and commands easier from across the room compared with the 7in display on the Hub Max\u2019s smaller sibling. Video is also better. YouTube is integrated, of course, and All 4, meaning they can be directly commanded via voice. Other services can be Chromecast to the display from your phone, which makes it more versatile than Amazon\u2019s Echo Show devices. That means BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub, but not Amazon Prime Video in the UK, which doesn\u2019t see the Hub Max despite supporting dedicated Chromecasts. Other than on-screen things, the Hub Max does anything a regular Google smart speaker does making it the best question answering machine you can buy. Timers, alarms, reminders, requests for the weather and most other questions are accompanied by visual information, such as a photo of the actor you\u2019ve just asked about. Assistant has a short-term memory too, so you can ask multiple questions on the same topic without repeating the topic. It works well. The Hub Max, however, has a harder time hearing you than other Google smart speakers. I\u2019m not sure why, but you have to speak more directly to it. But as a consequence not once has it activated by accident when I wasn\u2019t talking to it, which is a big plus for privacy as much as being less irritated by the occasional random outbursts frequently experienced with smart speakers. The speakers are hidden in the fabric pedestal that supports the screen. The Hub Max has two 18 mm tweeters aiming forwards and one 75 mm woofer aiming backwards for richer sound than the smaller Hub. It sounds good, able to fill a room without sounding overly shrill or loud, but not much better than a standard Google Home and not quite on par with the Amazon\u2019s larger Echo Show. It is good enough for watching videos while cooking and for a full rendition of Assistant\u2019s voice, but it won\u2019t match a Sonos One, Home Max or similar for audio quality. Smile for the camera The big new addition for the Hub Max is a camera, which some will see as a mixed blessing, introducing more worries about privacy. The camera is used for several things. The first is video calling via Google Duo, which I did once for testing and then never thought about again. It worked well enough with a good wide angle to fit you in frame, but video calling just never seems worth the faff on any device for me. More interestingly the Hub Max can use the camera to recognise faces and hand gestures. The Face Match system works on-device, meaning the camera isn\u2019t constantly streaming to the internet and being used to surveil your every move. It\u2019s really rather impressive and, rather than being a gimmick, I found it genuinely useful. When it recognises me or a family member it proactively shows information relevant to whomever is standing in front of it on cards on the screen. Perhaps that\u2019s your calendar appointments for the day, your reminders, your commute or other personal bits. A little chime, my photo and a small greeting appears on screen when it sees me. It feels far smarter, more intelligent use of the display and was very much the killer feature for me. Of course it can recognise you or members of your family with Voice Match too. In the morning you simply say \u201cHey, Google, good morning\u201d and it\u2019ll rattle off your customisable routine of weather, commute, news and so on. Assistant can even reply with different voices for different people, which is quite fun. Gestures for controlling media playback or Assistant speech work well. Show it a hand and the video or audio pauses. That\u2019s handy if you don\u2019t want to shout at it or touch the screen. Finally, the camera can also be used as a Nest surveillance camera similar to one of Google\u2019s dedicated Nest cameras. You can view it any time from the Nest app, automatically turn it off and on when you\u2019re at home or on a schedule, get motion and noise notifications and with a Nest Aware subscription you can record video. It works great, except for two things. If it\u2019s on a shelf the upwards angle of the camera is a bit too high to be useful and there\u2019s no night vision like a dedicated Nest cam so it\u2019s not great in the dark. To be clear it\u2019s not as good as a dedicated Nest Cam IQ, which is \u00a3299 on its own. Smart home command and control centre The Hub Max has the same smart home control system as its smaller sibling. Swipe down from the top to access a collection of your smart home tech including a quick summary of what\u2019s on, what the temperature is and other bits you might have. Panels for lights, routines, media, broadcast, thermostats and cameras allow you to jump straight in and control things, or you can view your devices grouped by rooms as in the Google Home app. If you\u2019re not a fan of commanding things via voice and more want a central control panel this is it. You can view streams from supported smart cameras such as Nest and Arlo, but not Amazon\u2019s Ring cameras, and if you have a Nest Hello, when the doorbell rings a live view of the front door pops up so you can immediately see who it is. Observations You can broadcast a voice message to the rest of your Google smart speakers, handy for announcing when dinner is ready or similar There\u2019s a green light and a message on the screen when the camera is actively streaming to the internet for Nest functions A mute switch on the back disables the mic and camera temporarily, or you can disable the camera permanently in settings (but there\u2019s no physical shutter) Volume buttons are on the back side of the display, or you can request volume levels via voice or sliders on the screen Price The Google Nest Hub Max costs \u00a3219 and is available in white or charcoal. For comparison the Google Nest Hub costs \u00a3119, the Amazon Echo Show 5 costs \u00a380, the Echo Show 8 costs \u00a3120, the Echo Show costs \u00a3220. Verdict The Google Nest Hub Max is the best smart display you can buy because it\u2019s simply smarter than the rest. Most smart displays have to wait for you to invoke something before showing useful, personalised information, or they show the same things to everyone in your home. Face Match allows the large screen to be the central at-a-glance information source for all the family, personalised to the individual, not just whomever set the thing up in the first place. There are privacy implications of having a camera, as there are putting microphones in your home, but Google has negated my webcam fears by making the useful functionality powered by local AI and not constantly streaming a feed of me to the internet. You have to trust the manufacturer to buy a product like this. Having photos displayed on the 10in screen with tonal matching to ambient light is excellent; so is watching Netflix or YouTube on it. Smart home control is excellent, if Assistant supports your devices. The morning routines are quite good, and it sounds good enough.

But if you\u2019re looking for the smartest, most useful smart display, the Nest Hub Max is it.

I lived in Prenzlauer Berg for most of my time there, on different streets \u2013 Kastanienallee, Winsstrasse, Choriner-Strasse. It was one of the most interesting places to be for an artist, because all the activists and dissidents were there, too. We could squat the houses, or at least not pay much rent, because they were all in such bad condition and the landlords were (mostly) happy just to have someone in there who could maintain them. Those in power, including the Stasi, were confused by our scene as they couldn\u2019t access it, or at least not completely. There were lots of small groups rather than one big scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad79d4b63874d23dd6084a0cd9cc8241418a8975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad79d4b63874d23dd6084a0cd9cc8241418a8975/0_1245_3543_3541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white picture of Harald Hauswald, in Berlin, 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harald Hauswald, in Berlin, 1985</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harald Hauswald</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a real community back then but the photography style I used was, of course, challenging.

It was to visit a friend from London who was living on Sonnenallee in West Berlin. Their place was cheap: it had a shared toilet in the hall and was just a couple of blocks from the Wall. Somehow it seemed impolite to go and stare at the Wall; it was something everyone had to deal with but tried to ignore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec859fc7e9e72e292df890a24e6df6b20128819e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec859fc7e9e72e292df890a24e6df6b20128819e/0_5_590_590/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boys playing where the wall was, between Treptow and Neuk\u00f6lln, December 1990, Berlin, Germany\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boys playing where the wall was, between Treptow and Neuk\u00f6lln, December 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Dilworth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I took a couple of trips into the East on a 24-hour visa, crossing at Friedrichstrasse. It mostly reminded me of the London I had grown up in: bomb sites and patched-up buildings, and the way communal space was shared. I visited again in January 1989, as a photojournalist covering the Festival of Political Songs, and met a Hungarian who showed me how to lose my Stasi minder, and I hung out with him and his East German mates for a few days. I actually watched the Wall come down from London. By the time I got back to Berlin for Christmas 1990 it was the middle of a very cold winter and there was just a space where the Wall had been. Instead of taking hours to get through the checkpoints, you could just cross the road and be in a different city, a parallel universe.

There was a sense of belonging to the city. It wasn\u2019t about money. I don\u2019t think that exists in the same way anymore. Anke recommends It\u2019s funny as for many years Mitte was Berlin for us. It was where we lived and worked, and never really went outside the area. But nowadays I enjoy the rest of the city. I especially love big spaces, such as Tempelhofer Feld in Neuk\u00f6lln and also Rummelsburger Bucht, a bay in the Spree. Also, in Mitte, I still like going to the Volkspark am Weinberg and the nearby bookshop, Ocelot. Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

From tomorrow your Guardian Morning Briefing will take on a different look as we expand our coverage of the UK election campaign. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/mar/01/the-morning-briefing-start-the-day-one-step-ahead\">Make sure you are subscribed</a> to have the latest election news hit your inbox bright and early each weekday.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson is due to visit the Queen today and then formally announce that a general election will be held on 12 December. His Conservative party\u2019s campaign has been forced on to the defensive after Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/05/too-late-rees-mogg-faces-furious-backlash-over-grenfell-apology-stormzy\">those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d</a> in following fire service advice to stay put instead of fleeing. Rees-Mogg issued a \u201cprofound apology\u201d but the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compounded the anger of survivors and relatives by suggesting Rees-Mogg was \u201ccleverer\u201d than those who died. Meanwhile the Tories have been criticised for propagating fake news after releasing a misleadingly edited video in which Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance\">made to look like he can not answer a question about Brexit</a>. Meanwhile Conservative plans to rubbish Labour\u2019s spending plans using civil service costings have been scuppered after the head of the civil service decided that publishing the Treasury analysis only weeks before the election would be improper. This is understood to have enraged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/05/tories-prevented-from-using-civil-service-to-rubbish-labour-plans\">blows apart the Conservatives\u2019 plan</a> to open their election campaign by attacking Labour\u2019s economic credibility.</p> \n<p>In a Guardian exclusive, we can reveal that Conservative candidates have been instructed by party HQ not to sign pledges on the NHS, the environment or trade deals. But supporting shooting is allowed \u201cas an important part of rural life\u201d, says an internal document that sets out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/dont-sign-pledges-on-nhs-or-climate-tory-hq-tells-candidates\">boilerplate replies to questions that candidates might face</a>. A row continues to simmer over the report into Russian interference in UK politics: Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the murdered ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, says Boris Johnson\u2019s delay in publishing the report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/johnson-delay-on-russia-dossier-helps-putin-says-litvinenko-widow\">helps the Kremlin and feeds suspicions of a government \u201ccover-up\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The Liberal Democrats\u2019 leader, Jo Swinson, has been accused of not taking sufficient action against party activist Steve Wilson, who had to apologise after claiming the Labour MP Dawn Butler had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/labour-accuses-jo-swinson-of-failings-over-commons-racism-row\">made up her experience of racism in the Commons</a>. The Green party launches its campaign today in what it hopes to frame as \u201cthe climate election\u201d. The party will pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/green-party-pledges-to-spend-100bn-on-tackling-climate-crisis\">spend \u00a3100bn a year on the climate crisis</a>, raising corporation tax and radically overhauling the tax system \u2013 all while stopping Brexit.

From tomorrow your Guardian Morning Briefing will take on a different look as we expand our coverage of the UK election campaign. Make sure you are subscribed to have the latest election news hit your inbox bright and early each weekday. Boris Johnson is due to visit the Queen today and then formally announce that a general election will be held on 12 December. His Conservative party\u2019s campaign has been forced on to the defensive after Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d in following fire service advice to stay put instead of fleeing. Rees-Mogg issued a \u201cprofound apology\u201d but the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compounded the anger of survivors and relatives by suggesting Rees-Mogg was \u201ccleverer\u201d than those who died. Meanwhile the Tories have been criticised for propagating fake news after releasing a misleadingly edited video in which Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is made to look like he can not answer a question about Brexit. Meanwhile Conservative plans to rubbish Labour\u2019s spending plans using civil service costings have been scuppered after the head of the civil service decided that publishing the Treasury analysis only weeks before the election would be improper. This is understood to have enraged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as it blows apart the Conservatives\u2019 plan to open their election campaign by attacking Labour\u2019s economic credibility. In a Guardian exclusive, we can reveal that Conservative candidates have been instructed by party HQ not to sign pledges on the NHS, the environment or trade deals. But supporting shooting is allowed \u201cas an important part of rural life\u201d, says an internal document that sets out boilerplate replies to questions that candidates might face. A row continues to simmer over the report into Russian interference in UK politics: Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the murdered ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, says Boris Johnson\u2019s delay in publishing the report helps the Kremlin and feeds suspicions of a government \u201ccover-up\u201d. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 leader, Jo Swinson, has been accused of not taking sufficient action against party activist Steve Wilson, who had to apologise after claiming the Labour MP Dawn Butler had made up her experience of racism in the Commons. The Green party launches its campaign today in what it hopes to frame as \u201cthe climate election\u201d. The party will pledge to spend \u00a3100bn a year on the climate crisis, raising corporation tax and radically overhauling the tax system \u2013 all while stopping Brexit. Airport expansion would be stopped and HS2 scrapped and replaced with investment in rail electrification and local bus services. And Nigel Farage has visited leave-voting, Labour-held Bolsover \u2013 just the kind of seat he would like to steal for his Brexit party. But at least 20 of Farage\u2019s purported 600 or so candidates have already quit. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the EU, has changed his impeachment inquiry testimony to confirm the president made an \u201cimproper\u201d demand that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son in return for $400m in military aid. &gt; The British backpacker Grace Millane died of strangulation during a Tinder date, a New Zealand jury has been told. The prosecution in the murder trial says the accused, 27, whose name is suppressed, took photographs of Millane\u2019s body, watched pornography, hired a carpet cleaning machine and searched online about fires in the bushland area where her body was later found buried in a suitcase he had bought. The accused man\u2019s defence is that her death was a sex game gone wrong. &gt; The world\u2019s people face \u201cuntold suffering due to the climate crisis\u201d unless there are major transformations to global society, more than 11,000 scientists have warned in a joint statement. They urge an end to population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating. &gt; Government ads praising the Conservatives\u2019 flagship universal credit have been banned as misleading. The advertising watchdog said they made unsubstantiated claims, including that people moved into work faster on universal credit and that jobcentres would pay an advance to people who need it.

It highlighted the role of officials from China-funded Confucius Institutes in confiscating papers that mentioned Taiwan at an academic conference; the use of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association as an instrument of political interference; and evidence that one or more Uighur dissidents studying in the UK had been monitored, with family back in China being harassed. The committee says there is \u201calarming evidence\u201d of meddling, some of which appears to be coordinated by the Chinese embassy in London. * * * Fishing gear litters oceans \u2013 More than 640,000 tonnes of nets, lines, pots and traps used in commercial fishing are dumped, discarded or lost in the sea every year, the same weight as 55,000 double-decker buses. Greenpeace says the gear, which is deadly to marine life, makes up the majority of large plastic pollution in the oceans. About 300 sea turtles were found dead as a result of entanglement in \u201cghost gear\u201d off the coast of Mexico last year, while in October a pregnant whale was found with fishing gear entangled inside its mouth. \u201cThe world\u2019s governments must take action to protect our global oceans and hold the under-regulated fishing industry to account for its dangerous waste,\u201d said Louisa Casson from Greenpeace UK. This should start with a strong global ocean treaty being agreed at the United Nations next year.\u201d * * * Today in Focus podcast: Mexico\u2019s war with the drug cartels Tom Phillips joins the search for some of the thousands of people who have gone missing or been murdered in the country\u2019s bloody drug wars.

Lunchtime read: \u2018It is well known she likes to dance\u2019 In 1962, a year after the building of the Berlin Wall, three men in grey trenchcoats came to a secondary school in Mahlow on the southern outskirts of the East German capital.

Granit Xhaka has been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy following his extraordinary fallout with a large section of the club\u2019s fans, Unai Emery has confirmed. Saracens have blazed a trail across Europe but a salary-cap breach has stamped an asterisk on a great club and the game. Sonny Bill Williams will be unveiled as the highest-paid player in the history of either code of rugby next week after agreeing a two-year deal with Toronto Wolfpack. The Los Angeles Chargers owner, Dean Spanos, has denied reports his team are open to moving the NFL franchise to London. And England cannot play in the Olympic Games but their success at this year\u2019s football Women\u2019s World Cup means Team GB, coached by Phil Neville, will appear in Tokyo \u2013 a concept branded unsatisfactory by three of the four constituent parts.

US stock futures edged lower in Asia after the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.01% on Tuesday, having reached a record high in the previous trading session.

      "bodyText": "Labor will join with One Nation to pressure the government over dairy prices, saying Nationals MPs will be forced to choose whether to cross the floor in support of \u201cdesperate dairy farmers\u201d. The shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, said on Wednesday that Labor would vote with One Nation in the Senate when parliament returned next week to bring on debate of Pauline Hanson\u2019s dairy industry bill. The move comes as the junior coalition partner fractures over the government\u2019s proposed new dairy code of conduct, with the agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, under pressure from colleagues over delays to the new code. One Nationals MP, the member for Lyne, David Gillespie, has said he does not support the government\u2019s proposal, calling it \u201cvague, ambiguous and not protecting farmers from the inadequacies of the current system\u201d. McKenzie faced the prospect of a spill motion last month after Hanson claimed credit for the government\u2019s decision to bring forward the proposed code, which she had told colleagues would not be feasible until next year. Fitzgibbon said the Hanson bill would apply the necessary pressure on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to support struggling dairy farmers and to accelerate the implementation of an effective mandatory code of conduct to address market power imbalance, saying the Coalition will have \u201cnowhere to hide\u201d. Labor said the bill was largely consistent with its election policy to task the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission with assessing and testing the efficacy of a minimum farmgate milk price and to make recommendations on the best design options. \u201cFor too long our dairy farmers have been caught in a cost-price squeeze and their plight has now been compounded by the shocking drought,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cThe retail price of milk remains stubbornly low while farm input costs continue to grow. Tough talk by ministers about the big supermarket chains have proven weak, hollow and ineffective. If the government won\u2019t move to help our farmers, Labor and the crossbench will. \u201cNext week we\u2019ll give National party senators the chance to finally support our desperate dairy farmers.\u201d Hanson\u2019s protecting Australian dairy bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to require the ACCC to determine a base minimum price for milk for each dairy season and require the minister to refer to the Productivity Commission for inquiry the effectiveness of determining a base price for milk. It would also look at the potential effectiveness of a divestiture regime for the dairy industry, and would establish a mandatory industry code for the food and grocery industry, including the dairy industry. The government established an inquiry into the dairy industry by the ACCC in October 2016, with the final report released in April last year. One of the key recommendations of the inquiry was for a mandatory code of conduct, saying it would improve contracting practices between dairy processors and farmers, and address problems arising from \u201cthe large imbalance\u201d in bargaining power that exists between dairy farmers and processors. But the government has rejected key elements of the Hanson bill, with the Nationals MP David Littleproud calling minimum gate prices a \u201ccruel hoax\u201d. Morrison has dismissed Hanson\u2019s push for a new inquiry, saying his focus was on the new code of conduct. On Wednesday, Liberal MP Tony Pasin said the re-regulation of the industry was not what dairy farmers wanted, calling the Hanson move \u201cpopulist politics\u201d.",

I needed extra time to ponder a line delivered by Chip Black (Mark Duplass), the fictional Morning Show\u2019s executive producer, who arrives on his #MeToo-deposed former anchor Mitch Kessler\u2019s (Steve Carell) doorstep to beg him to stand down days after his firing. Kessler \u2013 clearly based on the former Today show host Matt Lauer and, at this point, fired for undisclosed reports of sexual misconduct \u2013 compares the #MeToo movement to McCarthyism, a spineless mob with no regard for his own defense.

They are far from looked after too often. I happen to take the view that for those young people [who have been criminalised], the state has failed.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested the criminal records of looked-after children should be immediately wiped at 18, unless they were continuing to commit crimes.</p> <p>Olivia Pinkney, the Hampshire chief constable and national policing lead for children and young people, said police needed to be \u201csuper alert\u201d to \u201cstop unnecessarily criminalising looked-after children in particular, who are already at higher risk of so many other things\u201d.</p> <p>Last November, the government published <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/765082/The_national_protocol_on_reducing_unnecessary_criminalisation_of_looked-after_children_and_care_.pdf\">a protocol</a> designed to prevent criminalising already highly vulnerable children and young people where possible, which Pinkney said was already proving highly effective in some areas.</p> <p>Gerry Wareham, the Crown Prosecution Service lead on youth crime, insisted that before the CPS pressed the \u201cnuclear button\u201d of prosecution, it would make sure it had \u201ctried everything else first\u201d.</p> <p>But he acknowledged that while it was one thing to \u201ccome up with a wonderful plan\u201d to tackle the thorny issue of criminalising children in care, \u201cit\u2019s easy for these things to slip\u201d.</p> <p>Looked-after children are vastly overrepresented in custody. Three-quarters of the children held at the Keppel Unit at HMP Wetherby in North Yorkshire, which houses some of the most vulnerable and challenging young people in the country, <a href=\"https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/07/Wetherby-and-Keppel-Web-2019.pdf\">have been in local authority care</a>.

By the time they arrive, the child has sworn at staff and probably kicked off too. Then they might get done for resisting arrest or perhaps assaulting a police officer and by the time they are in court they have got five different charges. Magistrates don\u2019t always look at the wider context of the charges and the care home setting.\u201d</p> <p>Caitriona McLaughlin, a criminal lawyer from the Stokoe Partnership in Greater Manchester, said almost all her youth clients were looked after and they were \u201cvery regularly\u201d charged in relation to incidents at care homes.</p> <p>Many of the children had been taken into care because they were victims of abuse, she said: \u201cPolice don\u2019t properly investigate their perpetrators, yet if they do anything wrong they are straight before the courts. I represented one girl who had been abused by her father and taken into care because of it. She then allegedly assaulted a member of care home staff and was immediately arrested and put on trial. Thankfully she was acquitted but her father has still not been charged for abusing her.\u201d</p>",

Government guidelines say police should not be used for low-level behaviour management or matters a \u201creasonable parent\u201d would not call the police about. Prosecutors are not supposed to allow a case to progress unless they have consulted a 10-point checklist, which asks whether the child has apologised and requires the home to explain why it called police. But too many care homes continue to use the police as a \u201crespite service\u201d, with children in residential care 10 times more likely to be criminalised than other children, according to figures compiled by the Howard League for Penal Reform. Yet that is almost certainly an underestimate, as it only counts children who have been in care for the last 12 months consecutively. When the Guardian monitored all 128 children passing through Greater Manchester youth court in August, 22 (17%) were looked after. A number of those were charged with low-level crimes committed within the care setting. John Drew, the chief executive of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales from 2009 to 2013, said there remained too many \u201cnaysayers\u201d in powerful positions, who wrongly insisted the criminalisation of looked-after children was \u201ca diminishing problem\u201d.

Figures from the Department for Education suggest that just 4% of looked-after children were convicted or cautioned last year. Andrew Neilson, the director of campaigns at the Howard League, accused some care homes, particularly those that are privately run, of being too quick to call the police. \u201cQuite a lot of the children\u2019s homes, both registered and unregistered, are privately run and it does seem particularly the very large companies that run these homes aren\u2019t paying their staff very well, there isn\u2019t much training being offered to them, and our contention is that this is driving this police involvement, where police are almost being used as a respite service,\u201d he said.

They are far from looked after too often. I happen to take the view that for those young people [who have been criminalised], the state has failed.\u201d He suggested the criminal records of looked-after children should be immediately wiped at 18, unless they were continuing to commit crimes. Olivia Pinkney, the Hampshire chief constable and national policing lead for children and young people, said police needed to be \u201csuper alert\u201d to \u201cstop unnecessarily criminalising looked-after children in particular, who are already at higher risk of so many other things\u201d. Last November, the government published a protocol designed to prevent criminalising already highly vulnerable children and young people where possible, which Pinkney said was already proving highly effective in some areas. Gerry Wareham, the Crown Prosecution Service lead on youth crime, insisted that before the CPS pressed the \u201cnuclear button\u201d of prosecution, it would make sure it had \u201ctried everything else first\u201d. But he acknowledged that while it was one thing to \u201ccome up with a wonderful plan\u201d to tackle the thorny issue of criminalising children in care, \u201cit\u2019s easy for these things to slip\u201d. Looked-after children are vastly overrepresented in custody. Three-quarters of the children held at the Keppel Unit at HMP Wetherby in North Yorkshire, which houses some of the most vulnerable and challenging young people in the country, have been in local authority care. Inspectors reported that one child there had experienced 46 placements in the four years before custody. Darren Coyne, projects and development worker at the Care Leavers\u2019 Association, runs a programme working with looked-after children in Keppel and other prisons. He said far too many children were still being prosecuted for minor incidents and often ended up in court on multiple charges because an incident escalated: \u201cSo say someone chucks a cup and it breaks and staff call police. By the time they arrive, the child has sworn at staff and probably kicked off too. Then they might get done for resisting arrest or perhaps assaulting a police officer and by the time they are in court they have got five different charges. Magistrates don\u2019t always look at the wider context of the charges and the care home setting.\u201d Caitriona McLaughlin, a criminal lawyer from the Stokoe Partnership in Greater Manchester, said almost all her youth clients were looked after and they were \u201cvery regularly\u201d charged in relation to incidents at care homes. Many of the children had been taken into care because they were victims of abuse, she said: \u201cPolice don\u2019t properly investigate their perpetrators, yet if they do anything wrong they are straight before the courts. I represented one girl who had been abused by her father and taken into care because of it. She then allegedly assaulted a member of care home staff and was immediately arrested and put on trial. Thankfully she was acquitted but her father has still not been charged for abusing her.\u201d",

The announcement comes in the same week that shares in UK gambling firms lost nearly \u00a31.2bn in value, after the Guardian revealed that MPs had recommended curbs on online casino games worth more than \u00a32bn a year to the industry. It also follows years of criticism that betting companies have failed to take seriously the risk their products pose to some customers. Chief executives of 10 of the UK\u2019s best-known gambling groups \u2013 including Bet365, William Hill and the Ladbrokes and Coral owner GVC, said the commitments represented \u201cthe most comprehensive set of measures from a wide group of leaders across the sector to support the UK Gambling Commission\u2019s national strategy to reduce gambling harms\u201d. The five pledges, which will be independently monitored and publicly reported on, are to: Prevent underage gambling and protect young people. Increase support for treatment of gambling harm. Strengthen and expand codes of practice for advertising and marketing. Protect and empower our customers. Promote a culture of safer gambling. The commitments have been devised by the betting firms, with their development being facilitated through the Senet Group, an industry-funded body that says it exists to \u201craise standards in the sector, supporting the Gambling Commission\u2019s work to make services safer and fairer ensuring, in particular, that responsible gambling messages are put to players with frequency and prominence\u201d. However, previous efforts by the group have attracted criticism, with academics at the University of Warwick claiming its responsible gambling slogan, \u201cWhen the fun stops, stop\u201d, did not show any significant effect on gambling behaviour. The group has said it is rethinking the campaign. Peter Jackson, the chief executive of Flutter Entertainment, which owns Paddy Power and Betfair and has signed up to the pledges, said: \u201cThese commitments are an important step forward for the sector in their own right and also signal a genuine desire to ensure that acting responsibly is at the heart of our businesses.\u201d One of the first actions announced is a four-year national programme to educate young people, to be delivered by two charities, GamCare and the Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust, and funded by a \u00a310m grant from the industry.

On Monday, MPs from the cross-party group on gambling-related harm, who joined the successful campaign to cut stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) to \u00a32, recommended the same limit be applied to web-based slot machine games, which triggered the drop in share prices. Labour has already backed much tougher regulation of the gambling industry, indicating that its wings could be clipped regardless of the outcome of the general election.",

It\u2019s both very Nigerian and very relatable for audiences who know nothing about Nigeria. It\u2019s incredible that Nigeria has never had an Oscars submission before, but this is a good choice for its first. Yet Lionheart has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-50300862\" title=\"\">just been disqualified</a> because there is too much English in it.</p> <p>In fact, Lionheart does feature the Igbo language, which millions of people in eastern Nigeria speak. But the film reflects the way many Nigerians \u2013 as former imperial British subjects \u2013 speak in real life. As in most of anglophone west Africa, education, politics and formal economic activity is conducted in English, which people interchange with the dozens \u2013 in Nigeria\u2019s case, hundreds \u2013 of African languages that they also speak. This is the legacy of empire. And this legacy of empire, even though they were once part of it, is what some American institutions don\u2019t seem able to comprehend.</p> <p>So the American Academy expects films competing in its \u201cinternational feature film\u201d category to emphatically not be in English.

The message seems to be that as long as your imperial power spoke what Americans regard as a \u201cforeign\u201d language \u2013 in other words, anything but English \u2013 you can speak it and remain authentic. But if you share an imperial past with the US to the extent that English is your nation\u2019s lingua franca as a result, then it is somehow less authentic to speak it.</p> <p>It\u2019s ironic on so many levels. One of the reasons it\u2019s taken African countries so long to build modern film industries is that Britain \u2013 while also imposing the use of English \u2013 made a concerted effort to suppress them.

Under the logo Universal Credit Uncovered, the features promised readers of the Metro the truth about this most notorious of all benefits. The series began with a giant advert wrapped around the cover of the paper, coupled with a four-page spread right in its centre, and continued week upon week for nine weeks. Launched by the Department for Work and Pensions, it was an unprecedented attempt to salvage the reputation of a policy that had been attacked by MPs on all sides, plunged families into starvation and homelessness, and driven <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/calls-universal-credit-scrapped-next-15643327\" title=\"\">councils dealing with the fallout</a> to call for its abolition.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/14/universal-credit-department-work-pensions-pr\">Coming soon: the great universal credit deception | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That suffering across the country was dismissed by the DWP as \u201cnegativity and scaremongering\u201d in an internal memo I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/14/universal-credit-department-work-pensions-pr\" title=\"\">and reported on</a> here weeks beforehand. Signed by three top officials, it described the campaign to the Metro\u2019s 2.5 million daily readers as \u201cvery different to anything that we\u2019ve done before\u201d. The civil servants crowed over how readers might be deceived into treating the advertorials as independent reporting: \u201cThe features won\u2019t look or feel like DWP or UC [universal credit] \u2013 you won\u2019t see our branding \u2026 We want to grab the readers\u2019 attention and make them wonder who has done this \u2018UC uncovered\u2019 investigation.\u201d</p> \n<p>They almost got away with it too \u2013 but, tipped off by the Guardian\u2019s reporting, others began an extraordinary fightback.

A number were bulk-delivered to Rudd\u2019s offices in Westminster. Other groups, including anti-poverty charities such as Z2K, formally complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/06/dwp-misleading-universal-credit-uncovered-ad-banned\">government was misleading the public</a>. The watchdog was blitzed with 44 complaints (the average for a case is between one and five), and has been investigating the claims since early June.

      "bodyText": "Early this summer, a national newspaper published a string of curious articles. Under the logo Universal Credit Uncovered, the features promised readers of the Metro the truth about this most notorious of all benefits. The series began with a giant advert wrapped around the cover of the paper, coupled with a four-page spread right in its centre, and continued week upon week for nine weeks. Launched by the Department for Work and Pensions, it was an unprecedented attempt to salvage the reputation of a policy that had been attacked by MPs on all sides, plunged families into starvation and homelessness, and driven councils dealing with the fallout to call for its abolition. That suffering across the country was dismissed by the DWP as \u201cnegativity and scaremongering\u201d in an internal memo I saw and reported on here weeks beforehand. Signed by three top officials, it described the campaign to the Metro\u2019s 2.5 million daily readers as \u201cvery different to anything that we\u2019ve done before\u201d. The civil servants crowed over how readers might be deceived into treating the advertorials as independent reporting: \u201cThe features won\u2019t look or feel like DWP or UC [universal credit] \u2013 you won\u2019t see our branding \u2026 We want to grab the readers\u2019 attention and make them wonder who has done this \u2018UC uncovered\u2019 investigation.\u201d They almost got away with it too \u2013 but, tipped off by the Guardian\u2019s reporting, others began an extraordinary fightback. MPs fired questions at Amber Rudd, then the DWP\u2019s secretary of state, while disability activists turned up at train stations, from Swindon to Stoke, and emptied their stands of Metros \u2013 with the support of the RMT union. A number were bulk-delivered to Rudd\u2019s offices in Westminster. Other groups, including anti-poverty charities such as Z2K, formally complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the government was misleading the public. The watchdog was blitzed with 44 complaints (the average for a case is between one and five), and has been investigating the claims since early June. This morning it publishes its findings \u2013 and they make quite the starter pistol for the general election. Throughout its campaign, the DWP would summarise what it called \u201cMyths\u201d about universal credit and then give readers the \u201cFacts\u201d. The ASA looked at three of the claims \u2013 and found they weren\u2019t facts at all. They were lies, told by the government to its own taxpayers. In big letters, the DWP boasted that \u201cpeople move into work faster on Universal Credit than they did on the old system\u201d. After poring over the statistics, the ASA has found this claim \u201cdid not reflect the evidence \u2026 had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading\u201d. \u201cIf you need money,\u201d readers were assured, \u201cyour Jobcentre will urgently pay you an advance.\u201d In its ruling, the ASA takes the government to task for not making it clear that this is only a loan and that the vast majority of claimants will have to wait five weeks for their first UC payment. Finally, the adverts\u2019 claim that \u201cyour Jobcentre can pay rent directly to landlords\u201d was again found to be misleading because it only applies to a small number of claimants. The ASA looks at one other charge, that the ads might not be identifiable as such, and while it worries about the \u201cquite small\u201d font that admits this is DWP marketing, only partially upholds it. In total, that\u2019s three clear rulings against the DWP, plus one partially upheld. It is no small thing for a watchdog to face down the government in such an uncompromising fashion. Yet at the end of its remarkable judgment, there is something even more startling. The DWP is told that in future it must have \u201cadequate evidence to substantiate the claims in their advertising, to include significant conditions [where the claims don\u2019t apply], and to present significant conditions clearly\u201d.

Responding to reports of the payment, Huang said on social media: \u201ctruth is what\u2019s overdue. Calling all investigatory powers to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible\u2026 where did that A$11mn payment in Bakehouse Quarter deal go?\u201d Seph Glew, the founder of Kirela, the property trust that sold Huang the Bakehouse Quarter development in Sydney\u2019s inner west, told the Guardian the payment to Chalabian was an \u201cintroduction fee\u201d, paid as part of a deal that was brought to him by a real estate agent in mid-2017. Glew said Huang\u2019s Yuhu group agreed to pay a non-refundable fee of $38m to Kirela for an option to buy Bakehouse Quarter, of which $11m was to be paid to Chalabian. \u201cWe interacted with Sevag Chalabian and we agreed a fee and paid the fee where directed,\u201d he said. But a spokeswoman for Huang said the businessman \u201cwas not aware of the payment split issue referred to\u201d. \u201cThe lawyer featured was not the purchaser\u2019s solicitor,\u201d she said. The Guardian understands Huang\u2019s position is that he paid $38m to Kirela but had no knowledge of where, or to whom, the money was then directed. The Australian Financial Review has reported that Kirela paid the money into the bank account of a company controlled by Chalabian\u2019s mother, but Glew said he was unaware of this. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Sevag\u2019s mother comes into it, that\u2019s not something I would investigate,\u201d he said. Chalabian, a former property lawyer, held interests for the corrupt Obeid family, and currently faces charges of conspiracy to defraud nearly $25m paid to his former law firm, as part of a blackmail operation connected to a tax office fraud case. Controversy over the purchase by Huang\u2019s property group, Yuhu, of the development, a commercial and retail hub in a former Arnott\u2019s biscuit factory, comes amid continuing uncertainty over the status of what was once his flagship project, the luxury One Circular Quay tower on prime Sydney land overlooking the harbour. The proposed twin-tower apartment and hotel development, housing more than 300 luxury apartments, remains a scar in the ground at present, with no builder appointed, and none likely for months. Huang is exiled from Australia and is understood to be living in Hong Kong after his permanent residency was torn up by the Morrison government, on advice from security agencies over character concerns. His application for citizenship was withdrawn. The Australian Taxation Office obtained a freezing order over his Australian assets in September, after telling the federal court he owed $140m in tax. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Glew told the Guardian he has never met Huang. He said Bakehouse Quarter was not on the market in early 2017, when he was \u201cpersistently\u201d approached by real estate agent Ben Kirby, of Ray White Commercial, to sell the property. \u201cI would have had 20 phone calls from him around early 2017 saying, \u2018Come on mate, we\u2019ve got a real buyer\u2019,\u201d he said. Glew said the agents then brought Chalabian to a meeting with him. \u201cEffectively you might say that the agents introduced us to Sevag and he proposed a fee for introducing a buyer.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like we met Yuhu first and then he came along later. \u201cIt\u2019s a far from unique event\u2026 it\u2019s pretty normal.\u201d However, he said the transaction did have one unusual aspect: the delivery of a cheque for $38m along with an unsigned agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty unusual, an unsigned draft document that nobody\u2019s read plus a cheque arriving on your desk, but that probably says more about our state of mind than theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point we were reluctant sellers so they were showing their bona fides by lobbing up a cheque with no conditions on it.\u201d He said he banked the cheque and paid Chalabian his fee. Chalabian and Kirby have been contacted for comment. Yuhu originally agreed to pay $420m for Bakehouse Quarter, but after a series of option extensions \u2013 for which Yuhu paid Kirela additional millions \u2013 the sale finally settled in April this year for $380m. Huang had been a prominent Sydney property developer and political donor \u2013 regularly photographed with prime ministers and key politicians \u2013 before his permanent residency was rescinded in 2018. In 2015, political parties had been warned not to take money from Huang \u2013 a prolific political donor, giving more than $2.7m since 2012 to both sides of politics \u2013 out of concern he was seeking to influence Australian politics on behalf of the Chinese Communist party. Huang\u2019s links to Labor\u2019s Sam Dastyari \u2013 who took money from Huang for personal expenses and was exposed tipping off Huang that his phone was tapped \u2013 ultimately cost the senator his parliamentary career. Huang has also emerged as a central figure in hearings before Icac. It\u2019s alleged he gave an illegal $100,000 donation in cash \u2013 carried in an Aldi shopping bag \u2013 to the NSW Labor party in 2015, and paid $30,000 to the then party general secretary Jamie Clements to pay legal fees. And Huang remains locked in a dispute with the Australian Taxation Office, which is chasing him for $140m in unpaid tax, interest and penalties. The tax office has successfully won an order freezing all of his assets worldwide, arguing the reclusive billionaire does not have enough assets in Australia to pay the bill, and has been pulling tens of millions in assets out of the country since he was exiled. The ATO may seek to bankrupt Huang in Australia in order to retrieve the unpaid amount, the federal court has heard. Huang is fighting the ATO\u2019s claim, and, in a swingeing but vague attack, called the tax office a \u201cdespicable tool for political persecution\u201d, saying \u201cunknown dark forces\u201d and an Australian \u201cdeep state\u201d were conspiring against him.",

When we discovered stumps covered with grey and black threads that resembled extinguished candlewicks, the children\u2019s instant question was: \u201cCan we come back at night and see these candles burning?\u201d That image that they gifted, of a nocturnal woodland floor flickering with tiny lights, will come to mind now whenever I find this common candlesnuff fungus (Xylaria hypoxylon). In years to come, perhaps they too will become undergraduates, pondering the mystery of how minute white threads, finer than human hair, that we discovered under a rotting log, organise themselves into the elegant architecture of toadstools we found today. For, surely, curiosity begins with the joy of discovery, which triggers the need for an explanation and leads to an endless journey to find better answers. Along the way, it\u2019s good to listen to the innocent imagination of a child, to recall where it all begins.",

The accused man, 27 \u2013 whose name is suppressed by the court \u2013 faces a murder trial due to last at least four weeks. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge. Millane\u2019s parents David and Gillian were among those seated in the packed public gallery for the opening of the trial on Wednesday. The details of her death were disclosed publicly for the first time, when McCoubrey told the jury that the young woman had died from pressure to her neck.

Laurie, who was the land and water commissioner when he was appointed drought co-ordinator, was tasked with leading the second phase of the government\u2019s emergency drought response. This has included working with regional councils to secure their water supplies in the face of a prolonged dry period. The deputy NSW premier, John Barilaro, said on Tuesday the government was establishing a dedicated office of drought response that would enable increased support for regional communities. That was why the position of drought co-ordinator would cease as of Friday, he said. \u201cState drought co-ordinator Jock Laurie played an important role in helping to lead the immediate response to the drought on behalf of farmers,\u201d Barilaro said. The decision comes as Barilaro has threatened to walk away from the Murray-Darling basin plan, and as the water minister, Melinda Pavey, has been highly critical of some towns and their response to the drought, notably Dubbo, which last week announced a relaxation of stringent water restrictions. It is understood Laurie had been warning for some weeks about the dire situation in the northern basin faced by farmers and towns on the Lower Darling River. But the government only introduced a temporary restriction on pumping in the Barwon-Darling on Monday. Without an embargo, irrigators who hold high security water rights can continue to extract water when flows occur.

But relations with the new ministers, Pavey and the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, were not nearly as cordial. Laurie stepped down as National Farmers\u2019 Federation president in 2013 to run for the National party in the state seat of Northern Tablelands in 2013. He was pipped by Marshall in the preselection, who went on to win the seat after it was vacated by independent Richard Torbay. As agriculture minister, Marshall is now one of the ministers responsible for the NSW government\u2019s drought response. Comment has been sought from both Marshall and Pavey.

One of them pointed a finger at 14-year-old Regina Herrmann and beckoned her to leave the classroom.</p> <p>The men informed Herrmann that the ruling Socialist Unity party considered her father an enemy of the state, a \u201ccapitalist exploiter\u201d, because he ran his own business, a hairdressing salon. In the old system, they said, bourgeois offspring like her could have counted on a university education. No more.

      "bodyText": "On a summer\u2019s day in 1962, a year after the building of the Berlin Wall, three men in grey trenchcoats interrupted a German lesson at a secondary school in Mahlow, on the southern outskirts of the East German capital. One of them pointed a finger at 14-year-old Regina Herrmann and beckoned her to leave the classroom. The men informed Herrmann that the ruling Socialist Unity party considered her father an enemy of the state, a \u201ccapitalist exploiter\u201d, because he ran his own business, a hairdressing salon. In the old system, they said, bourgeois offspring like her could have counted on a university education. No more. She would not be allowed to continue attending a school in the socialist one-party state, and could bury her dreams of becoming a doctor right here and now. In the coming months and years, Herrmann often had the feeling she was being followed. Men were always on her heels, she recalls, \u201clike a shadow\u201d. In her town, there were suddenly rumours that she was a Flittchen, an easy girl. Working at her father\u2019s salon, men would make lewd comments or touch her inappropriately; twice, at a funfair and on a night bus, men tried to rape her. It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that Regina Herrmann found in the Stasi archives documents in which the German Democratic Republic\u2019s secret police instructed five unofficial collaborators to target her in bars and nightclubs: \u201cIt is well known,\u201d the file said, that Herrmann \u201clikes to dance and is happy for her dance partners to invite her to the bar afterwards.\u201d As Germany gears up to celebrate 30 years since the end of the Iron Curtain this Saturday, Herrmann is one of thousands of victims of the GDR\u2019s regime who have, until now, been denied access to support schemes because many officials in a reunified Germany are still ignorant of the covert techniques the socialist state employed to intimidate and subjugate its citizens.

      "bodyText": "At least three Ryanair Boeing 737s have been grounded due to cracks between the wing and fuselage but this was not disclosed to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The budget Irish airline is the latest to be affected by faults in the \u201cpickle fork\u201d structure, which has sparked an urgent grounding of 50 planes globally since 3 October. While other airlines, such as Australia\u2019s Qantas and America\u2019s Southwest, have disclosed the number of their planes affected by the cracks, Ryanair \u2013 which operates the largest fleet of 737s in Europe \u2013 has previously refused to confirm how many of its planes have been affected. Last Thursday, the airline told the Irish Times it \u201cdoes not expect\u201d the global pickle fork issue would \u201chave any impact upon our operations or fleet availability\u201d. The Guardian can now reveal three of their planes have been affected by the issue. It is understood that experts do not regard the presence of the cracks as a safety issue as long as appropriate checks are carried out. The grounded planes have the registration numbers EI-DCL, EI-DAL and EI-DCJ. All three are more than 15 years old. Flight tracking site Flight Aware shows that DCL and DAL are both currently in a known plane repair site, the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California. The third plane, DCJ, is in storage at Stansted airport in London. A copy of internal Ryanair engineering logs, seen by the Guardian, lists all three as having \u201cpickle fork cracks\u201d. \u201cAOG [aircraft on ground] \u2013 R/H pickle fork crack \u2013 on repair in VCV [Victorville],\u201d the logs for DAL read. On Monday, Ryanair did not respond to detailed questions about the aircraft. A spokesman said it was continuing to review aircraft in line with the US Federal Aviation Authority, and \u201cdid not expect any impact on its operations or fleet availability\u201d. On Tuesday, after being presented with more evidence, a spokeswoman subsequently added that the airline did not expect \u201cthis tiny number of findings\u201d would \u201chave any impact on our operations or our fleet availability\u201d. She said Ryanair had completed all inspections on planes with over 30,000 lifetime flight cycles, and is currently inspecting those under 30,000, and had not found any further issues. A cycle is one take-off and one landing. The airline owns more than 450 737-NGs, which are the affected model. However, there is no suggestion any other of their planes have been affected. The pickle fork is a large structure that strengthens the connection between the wing and the body of the plane. Cracks were first found on 737s in China, prompting an urgent check. On 3 October, the US Federal Aviation Authority issued an urgent directive that all 737s above 30,000 flight cycles should be checked within a week. Ryanair would not say how many flight cycles the three grounded planes had completed. According to publicly available flight records, DCL suddenly stopped flying after 3 October. DAL and DCJ also stopped flying within a week of 3 October. According to Ryanair, the average age of their existing 737s is six-and-a-half years. According to the US FAA directive of 3 October, all 737s over 30,000 cycles needed to be urgently checked within seven days. Those between 22,600 and 30,000 needed to be checked within 1,000 cycles (approximately seven months, depending on frequency). However, last week Australia\u2019s Qantas discovered cracks in three planes that were below the 30,000 limit. The three planes were at roughly 27,000 cycles. As a result, the Australian airline fast-tracked the checking process, examining all 33 of its 737s above 22,600 cycles within a week, rather than seven months. Ryanair did not respond when asked if it would do the same. The airline would not disclose how many planes were above 30,000 cycles, 27,000 cycles or 22,600. In Australia, Qantas rejected appeals to ground all its 737s, or to conduct checks of those below 22,000 cycles \u2013 of which it had 42. Globally, there are over 7,000 737-NGs in service. So far, Boeing has checked 1,000 aircraft and discovered faults in 50 of them. This includes nine in South Korea, three belonging to Southwest Airlines in the US, and 11 owned by Brazilian airline Gol. The pickle fork issue is separate to issues with the 737 Max, which is a newer model of plane designed to replace the current 737s. Last week, Virgin Australia said it had 19 737s over 22,600 cycles and none had cracks. Qantas said on Friday it had checked all 33 planes above 22,600 cycles, and found no further cracks. Dr Garth Pearce, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of New South Wales, said the presence of cracks was not a threat to safety. He said that as long as airlines followed the regulator\u2019s requirements \u2013 checking older planes within a week, and other planes within seven months \u2013 that would satisfy his safety concerns. \u201cThese parts, in addition, are designed to be very tolerant of small cracks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that this incident occurred is not a scandal, it shows the industry is working as expected. \u201cThis whole process shows that regulation really does work in the aerospace industry \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t recommend that airlines do anything other than what the regulator asked them.\u201d He added that the percentage of cracks would drop, as the inspectors started looking at newer and newer planes. Last month, Boeing designated Victorville as the repair site for pickle fork cracks, as reported by Bloomberg. A spokesman for Boeing said it would \u201cnot provide list of customers impacted\u201d. Ryanair has also been hit by delays to its large order of Boeing 737 Max planes, which are currently grounded worldwide as regulators test Boeing\u2019s solution to software problems. The chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said: \u201cWe have reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft being delivered to us in advance of peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none.\u201d",

What small boxes we place ourselves into when describing something so varied, so vivid, so integral to who we are.</p> <p>The words themselves come preloaded with expectations about the nature of the experience. Take \u201cdivorce\u201d, for instance: a harsh word with a lot of negative baggage. What if your experience is tender, careful, amicable and ultimately liberating?

There are so many ways of experiencing singleness \u2013 and all of them are valid.</p> <p>There\u2019s being single and actively looking for a partner: asking your friends to set you up, joining a load of dating apps. Shall we call it \u201cactively pre-partnered\u201d?</p> <p>There\u2019s being single and always wanting to be single because you love it.

The language we have is wholly inadequate to describe something like this. How about \u201comni-emo-sexual\u201d?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/05/pickup-artists-teaching-men-approach-women-industry-street-harassment\">50 years of pickup artists: why is the toxic skill still so in demand?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then there is what Emma Watson described. \u201cIf you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you\u2019re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you\u2019re still figuring things out ... There\u2019s just this incredible amount of anxiety,\u201d said the Ivy League-educated UN ambassador and Bafta winner, in what some have pointed out is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouiseRidley/status/1191664423062134784\">a telling sign of the times</a>. \u201cIt took me a long time, but I\u2019m very happy [being single].

      "bodyText": "When Emma Watson described herself as \u201cself-partnered\u201d in an interview with British Vogue this week, the term was met with a mixture of ridicule and praise. Predictable masturbation jokes were made. Like Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d to describe her separation from her husband Chris Martin, or Mark Ronson\u2019s recent (albeit accidental) announcement that he was \u201csapiosexual\u201d (attracted to intelligence before appearance), any deviations from the limited language we have around relationships is met with mockery. This is a shame. We need more words, people! Being able to accurately frame our current experiences is part of being human \u2013 and we need more nuanced language to better tell our story. We\u2019re getting better at not labelling sexuality; at accepting that it\u2019s fluid, on a continuum and sometimes hard to categorise. But as the world, its politics and the fear of impending apocalypse change how we relate to ourselves, other people and our futures, we\u2019re still stuck with outdated and limiting language around romantic relationships \u2013 and around the lack of them. On government forms \u2013 and in life \u2013 there are only a handful of categories available: single, married, separated, divorced or widowed. What small boxes we place ourselves into when describing something so varied, so vivid, so integral to who we are. The words themselves come preloaded with expectations about the nature of the experience. Take \u201cdivorce\u201d, for instance: a harsh word with a lot of negative baggage. What if your experience is tender, careful, amicable and ultimately liberating? Isn\u2019t \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d more apt a description? And what if describing yourself as single is technically right, but you don\u2019t really feel single? There are so many ways of experiencing singleness \u2013 and all of them are valid. There\u2019s being single and actively looking for a partner: asking your friends to set you up, joining a load of dating apps. Shall we call it \u201cactively pre-partnered\u201d? There\u2019s being single and always wanting to be single because you love it. Let\u2019s say \u201ccommitted non-committal\u201d. Then there\u2019s being single and open to meeting someone, but not really pushing it. \u201cPassive serendipity-seeker\u201d? Or what if you have a range of intense emotional and/or sexual connections with people; connections that don\u2019t bring you into the \u201ccouple\u201d zone, but are nonetheless real and powerful. The language we have is wholly inadequate to describe something like this. How about \u201comni-emo-sexual\u201d? And then there is what Emma Watson described. \u201cIf you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you\u2019re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you\u2019re still figuring things out ... There\u2019s just this incredible amount of anxiety,\u201d said the Ivy League-educated UN ambassador and Bafta winner, in what some have pointed out is a telling sign of the times. \u201cIt took me a long time, but I\u2019m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.\u201d I see \u201cself-partnership\u201d as just taking some time out from the merry-go-round of relationships and \u201clooking for the one\u201d, and instead getting to know yourself a bit better. It\u2019s a good thing, actively seeking to be more self-aware; it can even prepare you for the next relationship (unless you\u2019re a committed non-committal, of course). But self-partnering is also just great in and of itself. We\u2019re stuck with ourselves 24/7; all of us are self-partnered for life. We may as well get to know and like the person we\u2019ll be with forever.",

(bogus) theories that it was actually Ukraine that tried to tilt the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton, and then framed Russia, and 2. the business activities of Hunter Biden, the son of Trump rival and Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden, in his directorship of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. In the process, $400 million in military aid, already approved by the US Congress for Ukraine, was being held up by the Trump administration, and a coveting meeting at the White House for president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was being dangled.</p> \n  <p>Q. from investigating committee: When did you first get an inkling of what Mr. Giuliani was interested in? </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A. from Sondland: You know, this whole thing was sort of a continuum, starting at the May 23rd meeting, ending up at the end of the line when the transcript of the call came out. And as I said to counsel, it started as talk to Rudy, then others talk to Rudy. Corruption was mentioned. </p> \n   <p>Then, as time went on\u2014and, again, I can\u2019t nail down the dates\u2014then let\u2019s get the Ukrainians to give a statement about corruption.</p> \n   <p> And then, no, corruption isn\u2019t enough, we need to talk about the 2016 election and the <strong>Burisma</strong> investigations. And it was always described to me as ongoing investigations that had been stopped by the previous administration and they wanted them started up again. That\u2019s how it was always described. </p> \n   <p>And then finally at some point I made the <strong>Biden-Burisma</strong> connection, and then the transcript was released. So I can\u2019t tell you on that continuum when, what dates, but that\u2019s kind of what happened.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc1c9078f08be4a102e3931\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-05T19:17:48.084Z\">7.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sondland spoke to Pompeo about Giuliani</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Excerpt from Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony, where he is giving answers to questions from an unnamed figure on the House committees leading the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: In Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear has declared victory over Trump-backed Republican Matt Bevin. Beshear is ahead by about 5,300 votes with 100% of precincts reporting. But Bevin has not conceded. In Virginia, Democrats have taken both the state House and Senate, gaining full control of the state government for the first time since 1994. Democrat Ralph Northam holds the governorship. Watch the home page for more results from those key states and Mississippi, where incumbent governor Tate Reeves, is facing off against Democratic attorney general Jim Hood. Today\u2019s elections could offer insights into Donald Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans as he battles an accelerating impeachment inquiry. There are also referendums and political races on the ballot in Maine, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Colorado. According to testimony made public today, European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland admitted to a quid pro quo between Trump and the president of Ukraine, revising a prior account. Lawmakers also released testimony from Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine. It revealed that Volker sent a Ukrainian official the script that Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to read, announcing an investigation into the energy company Burisma (which employed Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter) and a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election \u2014 all via text message. The federal trial of Roger Stone began in Washington with jury selection. Democrats have taken both houses of the Virginia state legislature, taking full control of the state government for the first time since 1994. This means that governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, can push ahead with gun control measures and other legislation that Republicans had previously blocked. Virginia could also become the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would enshrine the idea of gender equity in the US constitution. The party\u2019s gains occurred in suburban districts that already tended toward Democrats in recent years. Democrats won big in Virginia legislative elections in 2017 and flipped the state\u2019s US House balance in 2018. Now it will control both legislative houses and the governorship. Today, Democrats took some smaller races as well. One of the winners today was Juli Briskman, who in 2017 was famously photographed giving Donald Trump the middle finger while biking past the presidential motorcade. Briskman was fired from her job as a government contractor as a result. Briskman beat Republican Suzanne M Volpe in the race for Loudoun county supervisor. Eking ahead of Republican incumbent Matt Bevin, Andy Beshear declared victory the gubernatorial race. But Bevin has yet to concede. Bevin had the backing of Donald Trump, who carried the state by about 30 percentage points in 2016. Trump urged his supporters to vote for Bevin at a rally last night \u2014 but it appears the president wasn\u2019t able to drum up enough goodwill among voters for Bevin, whose approval ratings have plummeted due to his cutback of government programs. Bevin threatened to cut Medicaid expansion, which could have pushed about 400,000 people off their health insurance. Beshear focused his campaign on local issues, promising teachers raises and vowing to protect Medicaid. Republicans have won other key races, including one over the attorney general position that Beshear is leaving behind. According to NBC, an estimated 1.4 million voters turned up to the polls\u2014 roughly 400,000 more than the number that voted in the last governor\u2019s contest in 2015, The race for governor in Kentucky between the incumbent Republican Matt Bevin and the Democratic challenger Andy Beshear remains too close to call, according to the AP: With 100% of precincts reporting, Beshear has a lead of 4,658 votes out of more than 1.4m counted, or a margin of 0.3 percentage points. There is no mandatory recount law in Kentucky. Bevin may request counties recanvass their results, which is not a recount, but rather a check of the vote count to ensure the results were added correctly. Bevin would need to seek and win a court\u2019s approval for a recount, the process for which would be dictated by the court. Democrats have taken control of the state senate in Virginia, holding the majority for the first time in five years. It\u2019s still unclear whether they\u2019ll manage to take control of the house as well. Prior to this election Republicans held slim majorities in both legislative chambers. All 140 legislative seats were on the ballot today. Trump lost Virginia in 2016 and he remains deeply unpopular in the suburbs, which Democrats are hoping to use to their advantage. It\u2019s neck and neck in the Kentucky gubernatorial race With about 90% of precincts reporting, Democrat Andy Beshear is leading by 2 points. Tt\u2019s still too close to say whether Beshear will flip the seat. According to CNN\u2019s Steve Kornacki, turnout has been higher than anticipated. Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally and congressman from North Carolina who was among the House members who questioned witnesses in the impeachment inquiry is maintaining the president\u2019s innocence. In a selective reading of Sondland\u2019s testimony, Meadows insists that there\u2019s no direct link made by the president between holding up aid to Ukraine and his desire for an investigation. It\u2019s true that Sondland was careful not to incriminate the president directly. Meadows appeared to aid the EU ambassador in efforts to excuse the president. From the testimony released today: Meadows: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying \u2013 this is groundbreaking \u2013 so you\u2019re saying that someone other than \u2026\u201d Sondland: \u201cI walked right into that one,\u201d Meadows: \u201c\u2026 Other than Donald Trump is concerned with corruption, and they might withhold foreign aid based on that. Is that correct, Ambassador? I can tell by your smile it\u2019s a yes, is that correct. Are we correct?\u201d Sondland: \u201cThis is like \u2018My Cousin Vinny,\u2019\u201d [Note: According to IMDB, My Cousin Vinny is about a lawyer, portrayed by Joe Pesci, who \u201cshows that he can make up for his ignorance and inexperience with an aggressive, perceptive questioning style.\u201d Apparently a key piece of evidence in the movie, which this reporter has not watched, has to do with tires, which explains the following... ] Meadows: \u201cYeah, there are two positive track tire marks here, looks like.\u201d Meadows\u2019 argument is unlikely to hold water with Democrats pursuing impeachment. As Guardian reporters noted earlier: Democrats, who have made the quid pro quo offer central to their push for impeachment, seized on the revelations. Chris Murphy, a senator from Connecticut, wrote on Twitter: \u201cNobody can pretend there\u2019s any lingering debate over what happened. It\u2019s over. Open and shut. Today, the one guy who said there wasn\u2019t a corrupt aid-for-interference deal, changed his story to say that in fact, there was an aid-for-interference deal.\u201d Sondland, a hotelier and Trump mega-donor, has been placed by other witnesses at multiple key crossroads in the Ukraine affair, including at White House meetings on 10 July in which he pursued Ukrainian officials through the building to press the demand for an investigation of Biden. He testified for more than 10 hours on 17 October to three House committees running the inquiry, which began releasing transcripts this week. He originally told investigators he took Trump at his word that there was never a quid pro quo attaching aid or a White House visit to investigations. But as additional witnesses testified and more information became public, Sondland appeared to have a change of heart. The week after his deposition, Sondland returned with lawyers to Capitol Hill to \u201creview\u201d his testimony. In Virginia, all 140 seats in the legislature are on the ballot. Republicans currently hold slight majorities in each chamber, but voters today will have decided whether that\u2019s to change. The election is being considered a referendum on Donald Trump. If voters flip enough seats, the Democrats will have full control of the state government for the first time since 1994. Joe Biden wants his progressive opponents to cut it out with the attacks A few days ago, defending her healthcare plan against criticism from Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren said that \u201cif anyone wants to defend keeping those high profits for insurance companies and those high profits for drug companies and not making the top 1% pay a fair share in taxes and not making corporations pay a fair share in taxes, then I think they\u2019re running in the wrong presidential primary\u201d. Joe Biden did not like that response. In a statement posted online, Biden said: \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny.\u201d But laughing he is not. \u201cThese kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,\u201d he said. This kind of attitude is \u201crepresentative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing\u2019. \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.\u2019\u201d For good measure, he added: \u201cI stand with the Democratic party of Barack Obama\u201d. Most polls in Kentucky are now closed We\u2019ll be watching closely as the results are tallied up in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial race between Republican incumbent Matt Bevin (who had Donald Trump stumping for him last night) and the state attorney general Andy Beshear, the Democratic challenger and son of former governor Steve Beshear. Bevin ran for a US Senate seat in 2014, but he lost the GOP primary to Mitch McConnell. The incumbent governor has closely aligned himself with Trump and focused much of his campaign on his opposition to impeachment. But Bevin, who has cut government services and has said that teachers who participated in walkout protests left their students vulnerable to sexual assault, is one of the least popular governors in the country. As attorney general, Beshear has fought against many of Bevin\u2019s policies. If he wins the governor\u2019s race, he\u2019ll have to face off against a legislature that\u2019s dominated by Republicans: the GOP has supermajorities in both chambers. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, is planning to make last-minute changes before public impeachment hearings begin, according to the Washington Post: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and a veteran combatant in highly charged Capitol Hill investigations, has taken the leading role in closed-door depositions of key witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. But he is not a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which Democrats last week voted to give the sole power to conduct public hearings. According to three Republicans familiar with the talks but not authorized to comment publicly, McCarthy (R-Calif.) is considering placing Jordan on the panel, as well as others \u2014 such as Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who have been involved in the depositions but do not sit on the Intelligence Committee. Trump reportedly wants Jordan, especially, to become more involved. The Ohio congressman has repeatedly defended the president, saying in a recent Fox News interview that he wants to \u201chelp the country see the truth here, that President Trump didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d. Sondland: \u2018No one thought the call was remarkable\u2019 The EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland, who repeatedly testified that he didn\u2019t remember or didn\u2019t recall many of the details of the call central to Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry, said he didn\u2019t get a read-out of the conversation. \u201cThe only verbal read-out,\u201d he testified was, \u201c\u2018It was a great call.\u2019 I mean, no one thought the call was remarkable.\u201d Lindsay Graham, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee says he won\u2019t read the transcripts. Volker warned Giuliani that the Biden corruption narrative was not credible, over breakfast More from the transcript of the Ukraine special envoy, Kurt Volker: On 19 July, Volker said he had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani\u2019s associate Lev Parnas, and told them that allegations about Joe Biden were \u201csimply not credible\u201d. \u201cI said to Rudy in that breakfast the first time we sat down to talk that it is simply not credible to me that Joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice-president by money or things for his son or anything like that,\u201d Volker said. \u201cI\u2019ve known him a long time, he\u2019s a person of integrity, and that\u2019s not credible. On the other hand, whether Ukrainians may have sought to influence our elections or sought to buy influence, that\u2019s entirely plausible.\u201d \u201cWhy did you have breakfast at the Trump Hotel?\u201d Volker was asked. \u201cBecause,\u201d he responded, \u201cI was guessing that\u2019s where Rudy was going to be staying, so that would be the easiest thing to do.\u201d My colleague on the west coast, Maanvi Singh, will take you through the next few hours of continued political developments and drama in the US. Today so far: White House hits back over latest impeachment inquiry evidence Senate majority leader and Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell goes right out of bounds in predicting Donald Trump will be acquitted at trial in the Senate - before the articles of impeachment have even been drawn up and voted on in the House. European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland admitted a quid pro quo between Trump and the president of Ukraine, where the Trump administration was holding back military aid while seeking investigations into US political opponents. Key state votes are happening today for the governorships of Kentucky and Mississippi and the state assembly in Virginia. All crucial tests of the popularity of Trump and how much traction Democrats are getting in certain states. The federal trial of Roger Stone began in Washington with jury selection. They didn\u2019t get to opening arguments today. Trial expected to last two weeks. Former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker on Giuliani and Trump The transcript of testimony given last month by Volker in the impeachment inquiry includes a description that on May 23, 2019, Volker, energy secretary Rick Perry and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland recommended that Donald Trump schedule an Oval Office meeting with the newly elected President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but Trump stated that Ukrainians \u201ctried to take me down\u201d and that they should \u201ctalk to Rudy.\u201d (BTW, Perry, Volker and Sondland were known in US foreign service circles relating to Ukraine as \u201cthe three amigos\u201d who were running the insidious parallel US foreign policy in the region, according to other testimony given so far in the inquiry.) Released today: Question from unnamed member of the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry: In fact, in your conversation with the President in May, the stated reasons why he had a deeply rooted distrust or dislike of the Ukrainians was because of what he perceived to be their role in the 2016 election and/or the Paul Manaforte [sic] case. Is that right? Kurt Volker answers: That was mentioned, but it was a long\u2014longer statement that \u201cthey are all corrupt, they are all terrible people,\u201d and, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend any time with that.\u201d That was\u2014it was a broader statement. And he also said, \u201cand they tried to take me down.\u201d \u2026 He continues: So, you know, we strongly encouraged him to engage with this new President because he\u2019s committed to fighting all of those things that President Trump was complaining about. Q: And how did the President react? A: He just didn\u2019t believe it. He was skeptical. And he also said, that\u2019s not what I hear. I hear, you know, he\u2019s got some terrible people around him. And he referenced that he hears from Mr. Giuliani as part of that. Q: Can you explain a little bit more about what the President said about Rudy Giuliani in that meeting? A: He said that\u2019s not what I hear. I hear a whole bunch of other things. And I don\u2019t know how he phrased it with Rudy, but it was\u2014I think he said, not as an instruction but just as a comment, talk to Rudy, you know. He knows all of these things, and they\u2019ve got some bad people around him. And that was the nature of it. Mulvaney asked to testify on Friday By the way, it\u2019s academic, really, because he isn\u2019t going to show, but rather than Mulvaney being deposed to appear before the impeachment inquiry on Saturday, as was released to the public earlier, turns out it\u2019s Friday. The acting chief of staff to Donald Trump will undoubtedly adhere to the gag order, whereby the White House has said it will not cooperate with the inquiry. Roger Stone trial latest Jury in Roger Stone\u2019s federal trial in Washington being slowly but surely assembled. Here\u2019s a profile of Stone from earlier this year, by my colleague Ed Pilkington, complete with a classic pic of Stone in Nixon victory/defeat pose. Stone left the courthouse earlier, complaining of food poisoning. Where most readers see a quid pro quo admitted to, belatedly, by Gordon Sondland, the White House sees a nothing burger. Extract from the appendix to his testimony shows Gordon Sondland \u201cnow recalling\u201d a conversation in which he admits the quid pro quo Here is a section from the declaration submitted to the impeachment inquiry by Gordon Sondland, in which adds to the testimony that he originally gave in his hearing on Capitol Hill last month. It\u2019s accompanied by a letter from Robert Luskin, a lawyer at the huge firm Paul Hastings LLP, which says that, according to House rules, the declaration should be included as an appendix to the sworn testimony given by Sondland to the committees leading the inquiry when he testified on October 17. Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell appears to have bulldozed directly through protocol by forecasting, before the articles of impeachment have even been drafted in the House and Trump put on trial in the Senate, that the president will be acquitted. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I know how it\u2019s going to end.\u201d McConnell \u201cThere were demands, weren\u2019t there?\u201d Sondland was asked, with respect to the \u201cdemands\u201d made by Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani to investigate the 2016 election and Burisma, if \u201cthose conditions would have to be complied with prior to getting a meeting.\u201d Q: There were demands, weren\u2019t there, that an investigation take place of 2016 or Burisma? Ultimately those were demands, were they not? A: Ultimately, yes. Q: And it\u2019s fair to say that you had to navigate those demands, you had to accommodate what the President and his lawyer wanted, if you were going to set up this meeting you thought very important? A: I think that\u2019s fair. And here\u2019s that link to the extra four pages mentioned at the start of this story today, at the end of many pagers of printed testimony. How Sondland got in deeper and deeper In this part of the transcript of Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony in Washington last month, the release summarizes how Rudy Giuliani\u2019s demands \u201ckept getting more insidious\u201d as Ambassador Sondland \u201cbecame aware that there might be a link between the White House visit and aid to the Ukraine that was being held up.\u201d This all revolves around the allegations that Donald Trump\u2019s cipher/conduit/rogue lip, Giuliani was on a mission ultimately to persuade Ukraine that it must conspicuously agree to investigate 1. (bogus) theories that it was actually Ukraine that tried to tilt the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton, and then framed Russia, and 2. the business activities of Hunter Biden, the son of Trump rival and Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden, in his directorship of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. In the process, $400 million in military aid, already approved by the US Congress for Ukraine, was being held up by the Trump administration, and a coveting meeting at the White House for president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was being dangled. Q. from investigating committee: When did you first get an inkling of what Mr. Giuliani was interested in? A. from Sondland: You know, this whole thing was sort of a continuum, starting at the May 23rd meeting, ending up at the end of the line when the transcript of the call came out. And as I said to counsel, it started as talk to Rudy, then others talk to Rudy. Corruption was mentioned. Then, as time went on\u2014and, again, I can\u2019t nail down the dates\u2014then let\u2019s get the Ukrainians to give a statement about corruption. And then, no, corruption isn\u2019t enough, we need to talk about the 2016 election and the Burisma investigations. And it was always described to me as ongoing investigations that had been stopped by the previous administration and they wanted them started up again. That\u2019s how it was always described. And then finally at some point I made the Biden-Burisma connection, and then the transcript was released. So I can\u2019t tell you on that continuum when, what dates, but that\u2019s kind of what happened.\u201d Excerpt from Gordon Sondland\u2019s testimony, where he is giving answers to questions from an unnamed figure on the House committees leading the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. Here, Sondland says he discussed the seemingly nefarious back-channel diplomacy being led by Rudy Giuliani with secretary of state Mike Pompeo. State Department officials were \u201cfully aware of the issues\u201d with Giuliani, but \u201cthere was very little they could do about it if the President decided he wanted his lawyer involved.\u201d Q: Did you ever discuss Rudy Giuliani with Secretary Pompeo? A: Only in general terms. Q: And what did you discuss? A: That he\u2019s involved in affairs. And Pompeo rolled his eyes and said: Yes, it\u2019s something we have to deal with. Q: What about his counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl? You said you had lots of conversations with Mr. Brechbuhl? A: On and off, yes. Q: Did you discuss the linkage between the security assistance, the White House meeting, and the investigations with him? A: I don\u2019t believe I did, but I don\u2019t recall. Q: What about Rudy Giuliani, did you discuss Giuliani with Brechbuhl? A: I may have. Again, people usually smiled when they heard Rudy\u2019s name because he was always swirling around somewhere. Q: Yeah, but, I mean, he was causing serious issues in the U.S. relationship with Ukraine. Did you raise those concerns with\u2014 A: Listen, the State Department was fully aware of the issues, and there was very little they could do about it if the President decided he wanted his lawyer involved. Q: And does that include Secretary Pompeo and his counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl? A: My speculation is yes, that they hit a brick wall when it came to getting rid of Mr. Giuliani. Here\u2019s how Gordon Sondland first got sucked into the Trump-Ukraine swamp (just a reminder that he\u2019s ambassador to the European Union and Ukraine is not in the EU, so he was way out of his playground from the off. During an Oval Office meeting on May 23, 2019, with Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, and energy secretary Rick Perry (aka the \u201cthree amigos\u201d - explanation in a moment, for those who didn\u2019t see the original reference to this colorful description), Donald Trump, according to Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201cjust kept saying: Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy.\u201d That\u2019s the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, not officially a member of the Trump administration, let alone the foreign service personnel. Excerpt from testimony just released: Q: When President Trump told you to\u2014you and the others, I understand, everyone at that meeting, and we\u2019ll get to that meeting in more detail\u2014but when he told you to discuss with Rudy Giuliani concerns about Ukraine, did you know at that point what he was referring to? A: He didn\u2019t even\u2014he wasn\u2019t even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy. Q: Right, I understand that, and I understand he wasn\u2019t specific. But when he said that, did you know what he was talking about? A: I didn\u2019t, other than he said: Ukraine is a problem. The explosive revelations in the extra four pages of testimony from Gordon Sondland are detailed in this story from the New York Times. Crucially, Sondland said that \u201cresumption of the US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks\u201d. The Times writes of these new facts thus: A critical witness in the impeachment inquiry offered Congress substantial new testimony this week, revealing that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country likely would not receive American military aid unless it publicly committed to investigations President Trump wanted. The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in four new pages of sworn testimony released on Tuesday, confirmed his involvement in essentially laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that he had previously not acknowledged. [...] In his updated testimony, Mr. Sondland recounted how he had discussed the linkage with Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, on the sidelines of a Sept. 1 meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw. Mr. Zelensky had discussed the suspension of aid with Mr. Pence, Mr. Sondland said: \u201cI said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\u201d Mr. Sondland said in the document, which was released by the House committees leading the inquiry, along with the transcript of his original testimony from last month. The four new pages of testimony from Sondland referenced in the last post are from an addendum to what\u2019s just been released - the link has crashed it\u2019s so popular, so we\u2019ll bring you that asap! Meanwhile, the main documents of the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former US envoy to Ukraine, have both been released. Sondland here. Volker here. Testimony from European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland to the impeachment inquiry reveals that he told a top Ukrainian official that they wouldn\u2019t get vital US military aid unless the country publicly committed to investigations that Donald Trump had been demanding from Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, into the president\u2019s domestic political rival, Joe Biden. Four new pages of sworn testimony released moments ago, from Sondland\u2019s closed-door testimony last month, confirm he was involved in the quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, and which Sondland hasn\u2019t admitted to before. Some details of the testimony from EU ambassador Gordon Sondland and former Ukraine enjoy Kurt Volker to the impeachment inquiry last month are dribbling out, via CNN journalists so far. There is a clear indication that they detailed a parallel foreign policy being carried out in Ukraine via Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Sondland indicated that secretary of state Mike Pompeo was told about it. Volker spoke of Giuliani as a conduit to Trump. Typically, that would be official US diplomats, it almost goes without saying. Nothing about this is normal! First trickle The latest transcripts from the closed-door testimony in the impeachment inquiry are making their way rather painfully and fitfully into the public domain today. They\u2019re kind of out, apparently, but most reporters don\u2019t have them yet. Here\u2019s a tiny snippet from CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz, about back door diplomacy. More to come, hang in there. Virginians go to the polls today to choose their state legislature. Despite a surge of Democratic success in the 2017 statewide elections, the Republicans hung on by a whisker to their traditionally-solid majority in the general assembly in Richmond. Will it flip today? The so-called blue wave, which also elected a record number of women to the general assembly, was echoed in the 2018 national mid-term elections. Key Republican districts flipped, notably giving the US Congress Virginia freshman Democrats Jennifer Wexton, who ousted moderate(ish) Republican Barbara Comstock on the outskirts of DC, and Abigail Spanberger, who beat glowing red Republican Dave Brat in a district closer to Richmond (with his infamously sexist remarks on the campaign trail). There is a lot of interest to see if, this time also, what happens in Richmond in the election today is a forbearer of how Virginia will vote in 2020. Since this time last year, Trump has been castigated in the Mueller report and engulfed by the impeachment inquiry centering on his conduct in relation to Ukraine. And Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor Ralph Northam narrowly survived a scandal over black-face photographs from the past, while his deputy, Justin Fairfax, was at the center of sexual assault allegations. Local media are talking about the key districts voting today. He won\u2019t turn up willingly, of course, but the impeachment inquiry investigators want to depose him to testify on Capitol Hill. Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff to Donald Trump, will no doubt hove to the gag order imposed by the White House that pledges non-cooperation with the inquiry. Last month Mulvaney suggested that there was a quid pro quo in relations with Ukraine in a rare, official White House press briefing, no less. He embarrassingly tried to walk back that statement later in the day. It was another unforced error from the Trump administration in the impeachment inquiry. At the time he said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine was part of efforts to clean up corruption in the country. He was apparently referring, at least in part, to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about a purported Ukrainian link to Russia\u2019s hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters in the White House briefing room. \u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that,\u201d Mulvaney continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d Asked about mixing politics with foreign policy, Mulvaney replied: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy \u2026 I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s statement contradicted Trump\u2019s repeated denials that his administration had made military aid to Ukraine contingent upon Kyiv\u2019s willingness to open an investigation into the debunked DNC theory and the dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of Trump\u2019s 2020 Democratic election rival Joe Biden, in Ukraine. Mulvaney\u2019s been asked to appear on Capitol Hill on Saturday. Don\u2019t hold your breath. Stone supporter holds up jury selection Roger Stone trial was delayed briefly today by this chap. Jury selection had been slow to get underway anyway. Hoping for opening arguments to begin asap tomorrow - we\u2019ll keep you posted and let you know when the jury has been picked so that this federal trial can get underway. This associate of Donald Trump is accused of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice, chiefly relating to the release to the public on Wikileaks of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s election campaign, hacked by Russian operatives in 2016. Harris on the ballot in New Hampshire - officially Democratic 2020 candidate Kamala Harris is struggling to keep up in the election race, as her outgoing funds exceed the cash coming in from fundraising efforts and her poll numbers stay stubbornly paltry. She\u2019s made the Democratic debate in Atlanta, Georgia, this month (Nov 20) and has qualified for the December debate. It\u2019s 90 days to the Iowa caucuses, the first voting in the decision process to decide the Democratic party nominee for president, and the former California attorney general and now Senator Harris is focussing her efforts there. But in the \u201cLive free or die\u201d granite state, New Hampshire, she is now also formally on the ballot. The NH primary is on February 11, 2020. The impeachment inquiry, which is likely to move to the congressional trial phase in the US Senate early next year, will take 2020 candidates and senators Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Harris off the campaign trail, but it will also give them a potentially useful platform to show off their chops in the questioning process - on TV. Harris on the campaign trail. As we wait for the expected release, hopefully very soon, of transcripts from the testimony behind closed doors last month of Gordon Sondland, EU ambassador, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine, it\u2019s pretty certain that the two new witnesses expected on Capitol Hill today will not show up. This time yesterday, the first two transcripts to be made public were out, with an extraordinary account of the smear and ambush of since-ousted Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. In Yovanovitch\u2019s transcript we see her describing her \u201cshock\u201d at discovering that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal emissary who has also worked for Ukrainian and Russian interests, was attempting to destroy her reputation. Meanwhile, today, Wells Griffith, the US national security council\u2019s international energy and environment director didn\u2019t show this morning and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs in the office of management and budget, had never been expected to show up for his 2PM appointment with the House intelligence committee, so if he turns up out of the blue that would be a huge surprise. Here is a handy recent piece on some of the main players in the impeachment inquiry. Mississippi voter turnout expected to be high It\u2019s a red hot race for the governorship of Mississippi today. The local leading paper, the Clarion Ledger daily newspaper and online site out of Jackson, has live coverage of the election today. Like in Kentucky, the Democratic challenger to the Republican candidate is the state attorney general. AG Jim Hood has a perhaps surprisingly decent chance at the governorship - which would be the first time a Democrat has been in that post for 16 years. The voting system in the state favors the party in power in the state legislature, however, as the winner needs not just a majority of the popular vote statewide but a tallied results in a majority of the state electoral districts backing them. Mississippi Lieutenant Governor, Republican Tate Reeves, is the guy to beat. That\u2019s confirmed, jury selection is taking a bit longer than some estimated, in the Roger Stone trial in Washington today, and what with the incident with a spectator in the courtroom needing medical attention, it\u2019s all behind the pace. Latest forecast is that opening arguments will get underway tomorrow. Whether first thing or later in the day...well, watch this space and we\u2019ll let you know as soon as we know. It should be a lively trial and an unwelcome echo for Trump from the Russia investigation, as the impeachment inquiry ramps up. The Roger Stone trial in federal court in Washington is proceeding a little more haltingly than expected. There\u2019s been a medical incident involving a spectator and the courtroom has been cleared and the trial put in recess while this is dealt with. It looks very much like opening arguments won\u2019t get underway today. Will the Trump factor be enough to carry Republican incumbent Matt Bevin to victory in the Kentucky governor\u2019s race tonight, or will it sink him, even? Potus was effectively stumping for him in the state at his rally last night - where he spoke for 80 minutes straight, sheesh. What\u2019s worse, 80 minutes of Trump or eight minutes of Rand Paul, who was the president\u2019s sidekick last night and, disgracefully, called on the media to unmask the whistleblower who sparked the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. Just wrong. The whistleblower is protected by law and, besides, their words have been overtaken as if by an avalanche by the substance of the testimony given by witnesses in the inquiry so far and the memo issued by the White House itself summarizing the fateful phone call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate a rival in the 2020 US presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden. Bevin is deemed to be unpopular in deeply-Republican Kentucky. His Democratic challenger, state attorney general Andy Beshear, was out stumping with his father, former governor Steve Beshear, yesterday on the last day of the campaign before voting today. Local media say Beshear has been campaigning for 17 months in this hugely-important race. Trump won the state easily in the 2016 presidential election. Bevin attended the Trump\u2019s rally in Louisville last night. There was no escaping the impeachment inquiry. Some supporters wore tee shirts saying \u201cRead The Transcript\u201d. A. the memo is not a transcript. Testimony so far has indicated there are even more damning bits in the full transcript, with more details of Trump asking Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden. B. the memo was damning. Voters fired up But perhaps not in the way Fox sees it. There are important races in some key states today. Here\u2019s the president\u2019s echo-routine as he retweets Fox News. He\u2019s tweeting up a storm this morning, so feel free to take a look yourself, but, if you\u2019re busy, you won\u2019t have missed anything earth-shattering if we don\u2019t reproduce them here - nothing really moves the needle. Climate crisis - allies dismayed but the fight is far from over The European Union has voiced regret at the US government\u2019s confirmation yesterday of its decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. But the body expressed hopes that one of the world\u2019s biggest CO2 emitters will backpedal on its decision and rejoin the accord. That\u2019s probably wishful thinking in terms of a policy U-turn from the Trump administration on the climate crisis. But one year from now who\u2019s knows how the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry and the presidential election will have turned out? European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said earlier today that the global deal signed in 2015 remains \u201cthe most important international agreement on climate change\u201d and insisted that the EU will continue to \u201cfight global climate change under this legal framework.\u201d Despite the US formal notice of departure, Andreeva added that the 28-member bloc will continue working with various US-based entities and stakeholders who remain committed to the deal, the AP writes. \u201cThe Paris agreement has strong foundations and is here to stay. Its doors remain open and we hope that the US will decide to pass (them) again one day,\u201d Andreeva said. Scientists are warning of \u201cuntold suffering\u201d in a new report. Germany said the announcement from Trump\u2019s secretary of state Mike Pompeo yesterday is \u201cregrettable\u201d but no surprise. (For a great commentary on what Pompeo is up to more widely in his career, read this from my colleague Julian Borger.) Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said the US had announced its plan to withdraw from the pact two years ago and \u201cluckily it has remained alone in doing so.\u201d Nearly 200 nations signed the landmark 2015 climate deal to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, with each country providing its own goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, the 2019 UN COP 25 climate conference will now happen in Spain not Chile, prompting more dismay from activists and one stuck on this side of the Atlantic to ask for a ride.... Well. Wells. Griffith. Hasn\u2019t turned up for his scheduled 9AM testimony behind closed doors to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. Here\u2019s our Adam Gabbatt with a short, lively video explainer on how that whole impeachment thing works, anyway. Whoah, sorry about the slow roll there, folks, some of us just had a connectivity issue in Guardian US HQ in the Big Apple, but after a nail-biting few minutes - just enough time to cook up a conspiracy theory about who might be jamming the wifi - we\u2019re back live. Leading 2020 Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren writes for us today on the climate emergency, just a few hours after Donald Trump formalized the process of pulling out of the 2015 landmark Paris climate accord. He promised ages ago that the US would pull out but there is an official process which involves notifying the United Nations and pulling out to a specific timetable, which Trump did yesterday at the first opportunity. So now we\u2019re on a climate countdown. Unless there is a policy earthquake, the US will leave the accord a year from now. Trump is busy dismantling environmental regulation as fast as he can anyway, while the world\u2019s leading climate science experts give humanity very little time to make huge change and reverse the trajectory of the crisis for our planet. And here\u2019s a wise note from my colleague Lauren Gambino. Roger Stone will face a judge and jury in what is expected to be a two-week trial, beginning today in Washington. It\u2019s not known yet exactly when opening arguments will begin, because jury selection begins this morning, but there has been pre-screening of jurists and it could take just a day or less. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith is in the court house, where federal judge Amy Berman Jackson will preside, and he\u2019ll bring us the drama as and when proceedings begin. The case involves charges related to his alleged efforts to exploit the Russian-hacked Hillary Clinton emails for political the political gain of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign. Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, in January of this year pleaded not guilty to charges in the Trump-Russia investigation, then ran a gauntlet of protesters outside the courthouse waving Russian flags and playing the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBack in the USSR\u201d. Supporters had shouted, \u201cWe love Roger!\u201d and held aloft signs such as, \u201cFree Stone, fire Mueller\u201d. Protesters yelled, \u201cLock him up!\u201d and \u201cFucking traitor!\u201d The Republican strategist and self-proclaimed dirty trickster is charged in a seven-count indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller with obstruction, lying to Congress and witness tampering. Stone, briefly served on Trump\u2019s campaign but was pushed out amid infighting with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Though sidelined, he continued to communicate with Trump and stayed plugged into his circle of advisers, the Associated Press adds. The indictment says Stone repeatedly discussed WikiLeaks in 2016 with campaign associates and lays out in detail Stone\u2019s conversations about emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and posted in the weeks before Trump beat Clinton. After WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, released hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, the indictment says, a senior Trump campaign official \u201cwas directed\u201d to contact Stone about additional releases and \u201cwhat other damaging information\u201d WikiLeaks had \u201cregarding the Clinton campaign.\u201d The indictment does not name the official or say who directed the outreach to Stone. Good morning, US politics watchers, it\u2019s a massive day on Capitol Hill, in a courthouse in Washington, and in some key voting states across the country. We\u2019ll be there for all the action \u2013 live, do join us. Today: Wells Griffith, the US national security council\u2019s international energy and environment director, is scheduled to testify behind closed doors in the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill today. It\u2019s now yet known whether he will turn up or prefer to obey what\u2019s effectively a gag order from the White House - a directive for administration figures not to cooperate with the investigation. Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs in the office of management and budget is also due to testify but is definitely not forecast to turn up. But there\u2019s more - the House intelligence committee is expected to release more transcripts today from closed-door testimony in recent weeks. Around about noon, US east coast time, get ready for the transcripts of EU ambassador Gordon Sondland and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker. We can make a good guess that they will cast a poor light on Donald Trump - but also likely on themselves. Roger Stone. Remember the Trump-Russia inquiry, all those lifetimes ago? The substance of all of that is merely dormant, not dead. Today, Trump loyalist, longtime conservative uber-fixer and all around mischief-maker Roger Stone goes on trial in federal court in Washington, DC. He\u2019s chiefly accused of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction. Special counsel Robert Mueller found evidence of communications between Stone and WikiLeaks related to the public release of Democratic party emails hacked by Russian operatives during the 2016 election. Jury selection could be quick today. There are key governor\u2019s races in Kentucky and Mississippi, where Democratic hopefuls are battling Republican incumbents. And important and hopefully illuminating state house elections are taking place in Virginia and New Jersey, which should offer clues about how those electorates are leaning ahead of the 2020 presidential election.",

      "bodyText": "The former acting Victorian state director for the Liberal party has admitted in court that signs written in Chinese at polling booths on election day were designed to look like official Australian Electoral Commission signage. The full federal court is hearing the challenges to the elections of Liberal MP Gladys Liu in Chisholm and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong over three days. The cases have been brought against the two candidates by climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett and unsuccessful independent Kooyong candidate Oliver Yates. On Wednesday, Simon Frost, who authorised the signs, said under questioning from Lisa De Ferrari, the barrister for the applicants, that the two signs \u2013 one in traditional Chinese characters, and one in simplified Chinese characters \u2013 were intended to appear as though they were AEC corflutes. The signs that were used in seven electorates in Victoria said, according to an English translation, that the \u201ccorrect way to vote\u201d was to put 1 next to the Liberal candidate. \u201cYou intended to convey the impression that this was an AEC corflute, didn\u2019t you?\u201d De Ferrari asked. Frost, now an adviser to Frydenberg, took a long pause before replying: \u201cIt was similar to the AEC colours, yes.\u201d \u201cSo the answer to my question is yes?\u201d De Ferrari pressed. \u201cYes,\u201d Frost replied. Frost had already confirmed that the signs were intended to say \u201cto make your vote count\u201d but the meaning was lost in translation to \u201cthe correct way to vote\u201d. He said on Thursday it \u201ccould be\u201d a problem that the signs said different words than he authorised. He also conceded he had not thought at the time about whether the signs were likely to mislead or deceive voters. He told the court that the signs were proof-read the day before the election in May but the mistake was not picked up. He indicated the Liberal candidate for Hotham, George Hua, also proof-read the signs before the election. On the day of the election, Frost said he became aware of concerns about the signs once the AEC tweeted replies to people raising issue with the signs, but decided the Liberal party\u2019s opponents were merely making a political point out of the signs. He said at no point on election day did Frydenberg or Liu contact him about the signs, and there would have been no time to print off and distribute more than 500 of the new signs with the correct wording through seven Victorian electorates on election day. De Ferrari said the ruling being sought is to void the election result in both electorates, causing byelections, which would come at a cost, but the principle was more important. \u201c[It] would put a stop to a developing and illegal practice that is really troubling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe principle is too important to have those considerations of practical inconvenience take over.\u201d The hearing continues. \u2022 This story was amended on 7 November 2019 to correct the name of the petitioner Vanessa Garbett.

      "bodyText": "The pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho has been attacked in an apparent stabbing in Hong Kong. Ho, who is running in the upcoming district council election, was out campaigning in his constituency on Wednesday when he was attacked. In a video of the incident, a man holding a bunch of flowers approaches and speaks to Ho, then reaches into his bag and pulls out an implement, believed to be a knife, which he uses to stab Ho. The man could be heard shouting in Cantonese: \u201cJunius Ho, you scum!\u201d The attacker was arrested by police, according to Hong Kong Free Press. Ho was taken to Tuen Mun hospital with a stab wound to his chest. The alleged attacker and one of Ho\u2019s aides were also taken to hospital with injuries, the South China Morning Post reported. Alongside Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, and its police chief, Stephen Lo, Ho has become one of the most loathed establishment figures among democracy protesters. He has long been one of the most stridently pro-Beijing politicians in the city. He attracted criticism after he was captured on a video that went viral shaking hands with men in white T-shirts. The video followed an attack on protesters and other MTR passengers by a group of men in white T-shirts at Yuen Long MTR station in July, which resulted in 45 people being injured. Ho denied that the people he shook hands with had any connection to the attackers at Yuen Long. The attack on Ho comes amid more than five months of sometimes violent political unrest in the former British colony-turned semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Further protests were planned on Wednesday at some of Hong Kong\u2019s universities, activists said. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters at a Guy Fawkes-themed march on Tuesday. China\u2019s Communist party said on Tuesday it would not tolerate any \u201cseparatist behaviour\u201d in Hong Kong, after some of the protesters called for independence. What started as a protest against a proposed China extradition bill has widened into the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s rule since he came to power in 2012. Protesters are demanding an end to perceived Chinese meddling in the territory\u2019s affairs, as well as universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, among other demands. Beijing denies interfering and blames foreign governments for fuelling the unrest. Xi met Lam on Tuesday in Shanghai, vouching support for her administration. Following the meeting, Lam denied rumours that the government was considering an amnesty for protesters charged with offences.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales police minister, David Elliott, has defended the practice of strip-searching minors, saying he would want police to strip-search his children if they were suspected of breaking the law. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that in the last three years police in NSW have strip-searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds. The shocking figures were obtained by the Redfern Legal Centre under freedom of information laws and come as the state\u2019s police watchdog investigates the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018. The RLC has called for a ban on strip-searching minors unless a court order is obtained, saying the current legal thresholds are inadequate. But Elliott has defended the police\u2019s ability to strip-search minors, telling reporters on Wednesday he \u201cwould want\u201d officers to strip-search his own children. \u201cI\u2019ve got young children and if I thought the police felt they were at risk of doing something wrong I\u2019d want them strip-searched,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cHaving been minister for juvenile justice, we have 10-year-olds involved in terrorism activity.\u201d Figures released during budget estimates in February showed that in the five years to November 2018 nothing was found in 63% of strip-searches, but Elliott said he thought parents would be \u201cpretty happy\u201d if their children were strip-searched and found with drugs. \u201cI think you\u2019d be pretty happy that they got found out,\u201d he said. The minister\u2019s comments come amid increasing focus on the use of the controversial practice. The NSW Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission revealed last week that it is investigating six separate allegations of misuse of strip-search powers by police last year. In NSW, police are permitted to carry out field strip-searches only if the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent, guardian or support person must be present during the search unless it\u2019s necessary for the safety of the person or to prevent evidence being destroyed. The LECC inquiry last month heard that some officers did not know their obligation in relation to minors and, in the case of the 16-year-old, there was no justification for initiating the search. The watchdog is also reviewing whether it is legal for officers to force people to squat during a strip-search, a common practice used by police in NSW. In September, the police published a new personal search manual for the first time which allows officers to instruct people to squat, lift their testicles or breasts, or part their buttock cheeks. Elliott conceded that police had breached their obligations in some cases, but insisted people who felt they had been wrongly searched could file a complaint. \u201cOf course they haven\u2019t always been used according to the standard operating procedures and anybody who feels that has been done erroneously has got some reply to that,\u201d he said. The NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, also defended the use of strip-search powers but said police had to \u201cget the balance right\u201d. \u201cStrip-searches are an important investigative tool but obviously we have to get the balance right, they need to be used only where appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be invasive, they can be stressful, that\u2019s why we have the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission doing a general review of strip-searches and operations in NSW and I look forward to its report.\u201d",

O\u2019Neill stared down a warrant issued in 2014 as part of a long-running inquiry into alleged fraudulent payments of around $30m to a Port Moresby law firm, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/arrest-warrant-for-png-prime-minister-peter-oneill-thrown-out-of-court\">was eventually thrown out by the PNG supreme court in 2017</a>. </p> <p>Those proceedings were initiated by the muscular, multiagency Taskforce Sweep which O\u2019Neill himself established soon after gaining power in 2011, pledging zero tolerance of corruption. He shut down the taskforce days after it tried to arrest him. \u201cWhen they [Sweep investigators] became too political, I did close it down, and I had no hesitation in doing so and I would do it again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That said, he nominates the enduring odour of corruption in PNG as a regret in reflecting on his time in power. \u201cWithout evidence, there is a perception that corruption is rife in every aspect of our society, which is a very poor reflection and poor assessment of our country.\u201d</p> <p>Of the current allegations, he says they relate to a request for funding from a health centre run by the Lutheran church in Madang in the north of the country. </p> <p>\u201cThey put a proposal to my office. I referred that for funding to our Community Development Fund agency, which I was responsible for. They funded it. They made payments direct to the church. So, what is wrong with that? What is corrupt about that? So, we\u2019ll test the evidence in court, but it\u2019s just rubbish. It\u2019s a politically motivated case.\u201d </p> <p>Last Friday, a few days after this interview, police withdrew the original warrant in the face of challenges by O\u2019Neill\u2019s lawyers over its validity, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/png-police-withdraw-warrant-for-former-pm-after-bungled-arrest/11662024\">but reports indicate that the investigation is not over, and that another warrant may be in the works</a>.</p> <h2>Maserati-gate</h2> <p>O\u2019Neill is rather more enthusiastic articulating his take on the legacy of his leadership.</p> <p>On the positive side of the ledger, he boasts of major policy achievements in education and health and \u201cunprecedented economic growth\u201d as well as PNG\u2019s successful hosting of the Apec conference last year, which \u201ccertainly put the country into a good light with the rest of the world\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"563f8308e246590ca83fc999173008e309436f90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/563f8308e246590ca83fc999173008e309436f90/0_183_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the Maseratis brought in for the 2018 Apec summit in Port Moresby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the Maseratis brought in for the 2018 Apec summit in Port Moresby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the summit generated international opprobrium and domestic fury around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/28/papua-new-guineas-pm-given-a-bentley-bought-for-apec-summit\">estimated US$135m spent on the event</a>, including the purchase of a fleet of Maserati and Bentley vehicles on the claim they were necessary to transport world leaders including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I could have bought a pushbike to take the leaders to the meeting,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cIt went to a bidding process.

Might leaders not have been content to forfeit a little luxury within that context?</p> <p>At this, O\u2019Neill pushes back. \u201cI think you should attend a few of these meetings and find out for yourself,\u201d he counsels. \u201cYou go to the next one in Chile and see what sort of vehicles \u2013 Audi or Mercedes or Maseratis.\u201d Since the interview, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-protests/chile-cancels-apec-trade-summit-climate-gathering-as-santiago-burns-idUSKBN1X91QT\">Chile announced it was withdrawing from hosting Apec</a> as street protests raged across the country.</p> <p>Apec delivered substantial infrastructure to PNG, O\u2019Neill argues. \u201cLook at the roads in Port Moresby\u201d and in other major cities: Mt Hagen, Lae and Goroka. Nonetheless, as the daily, infuriated and distressed posts of ordinary citizens on social media attest, roads and infrastructure across most of the country are so poor it is all but impossible to get a bag of coffee to market or an emergency case to hospital.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just nonsense to think that because you live in Australia, to come and think that we\u2019ll have roads like Australia, it has taken 200 years to build that \u2026 You look at the substantial improvement in infrastructure \u2013 in ports, airports, roads, bridges. So don\u2019t give me that nonsense.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018These are hard choices to make\u2019</h2> <p>Returning to education, featuring at the top of his legacy list, O\u2019Neill says that over his time school enrolments went from fewer than 900,000 children to more than 2m after he waived school fees. \u201cWe enabled many young girls who are always the lowest priorities in families to get an education \u2026 to be independent and not subjected to the pressures of family and early marriage and all the other issues we face in a developing country.\u201d</p> <p>But there is a flipside to this narrative. The policy delivered students, but not the resources to support them. The consequences are plain in broken-down, overcrowded classrooms across the country, and in the concerns of parents and employers about student achievement. The Guardian<em> </em>had just visited a schoolhouse in Western Province with 57 children in one multi-age class, a single teacher, few usable desks and a floor so rotten a visitor had just fallen through it.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill acknowledges these issues. \u201cBut do I make a choice about leaving kids on the street, or putting them in an environment where they can do some learning \u2026 is it fair on the girls that they are kept at home? These are hard choices to make.\u201d Investments he initiated in curriculum and teacher training will, over time, yield improvements, he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We enabled many young girls who are always the lowest priorities in families to get an education</p> <footer> <cite>Peter O'Neill</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On health, he claims he delivered increased spending and a program of free basic healthcare throughout the country, particularly to rural and remote populations.</p> <p>But an Australian National University analysis identified a 37% cut in the health budget in real terms from 2014 to 2016. Doctors, health workers and aid agencies have expressed alarm about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/world/asia/papua-new-guinea-apec-polio-health-crisis.html\">the collapse of basic health services and the medical supply chain</a>. Public distress around the lack of health services was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/26/apec-summit-papua-new-guinea-maserati-thousands-strike\">a focus of mass protests ahead of Apec</a>.</p> <p>A national audit in 2017 documented widespread \u201cunavailability of lifesaving and essential drugs\u201d and the National Doctors Association blamed the closure of many rural health facilities for lack of supplies or workers on \u201cendemic and epidemic\u201d corruption.</p> <p>As to how this looks on the ground, the Guardian recounted the case of a family it encountered in Gulf Province scrambling to find 150 kina (A$63) to put fuel in an ambulance to get a teenage boy with snakebite to the nearest hospital, because the aid post was out of antivenom. (At the same aid post, a mother of six had recently died in childbirth because there was no fuel in the ambulance.)</p> <p>\u201cIt is more of a management problem than government not prioritising,\u201d O\u2019Neill responds. \u201cAs far as I know, funding allocations for the health sector during our term in government has been the highest by any government since independence. Those fundings have been made available as a priority every year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"366fe23a06aeb174c3cbcb69939a031d9241b1f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/366fe23a06aeb174c3cbcb69939a031d9241b1f0/34_15_3305_1983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Marape is hugged by a supporter after being sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea in May, 2019 after weeks of political manoeuvring that saw O\u2019Neill resign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Marape is hugged by a supporter after being sworn in as prime minister in May 2019 after weeks of political manoeuvring that saw O\u2019Neill resign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanessa Kerton/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The economy is the other aspect of his legacy O\u2019Neill highlights, claiming to have doubled GDP and maintained sustainable economic growth despite crashes in commodity prices and global challenges.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app5.287\">recently published 2019 PNG Economic Survey</a> by ANU and the University of PNG tells a different story, citing World Bank assessments showing PNG falling into the category of fragile state from 2013 to 2017, with plummeting scores on economic management over O\u2019Neill\u2019s reign.</p> <p>Soon after gaining power in May, the country\u2019s new prime minister, James Marape, described the economy as \u201cstruggling and bleeding\u201d, and when he handed down the budget last month he <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/png-turns-to-australia-for-help-out-of-its-deep-economic-hole/11588686\">said the country was in a \u201cvery deep economic hole\u201d</a>, appealing to Australia for help. O\u2019Neill <a href=\"https://postcourier.com.pg/oneill-takes-a-swipe-at-ling-stuckey/\">has vehemently disputed this reading of the numbers</a>.</p> <h2>\u2018No regrets\u2019</h2> <p>PNG will face a significant test in coming months as a long-awaited independence referendum in Bougainville gets under way later this month. A <a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/bougainville-referendum-and-beyond\">Lowy Institute analysis</a> anticipates an overwhelming vote for independence, but O\u2019Neill warns that this could lead to a fracturing of PNG.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got almost a thousand nations in this country,\u201d he says. \u201cIs the international community going to support them if any one of them decide tomorrow that \u2018we\u2019ve got a goldmine now, we\u2019ve got an oilfield now, so we want to be independent\u2019? That\u2019s the danger that we are facing.\u201d</p> <p>Under the arrangements hammered out under the Bougainville peace agreement, \u201cthe referendum outcome is not the final determination of independence on Bougainville. It has to be endorsed by parliament. And I\u2019m sure the parliament will make the right decisions.\u201d</p> <p>This despite warnings that any refusal by the PNG government to ratify the result could lead to unrest.</p> <p>Of the Manus deal to take asylum seekers trying to reach Australia, O\u2019Neill says he has \u201cno regrets\u201d. It brought jobs, money and infrastructure to the island of Manus, he says.</p> <p>\u201cNobody gives us credit for stopping the boats in Australia. Papua New Guinea proposed the idea to Australia, because we had the refugee centre (from earlier Somare-Howard government arrangements).

      "bodyText": "For a former prime minister with a warrant out for his arrest and allegations of official corruption hanging over his head, Peter O\u2019Neill is quite calm. But his breakfast order of sunny side up eggs goes cold as he responds to questions about those accusations, his leadership legacy \u2013 and those infamous Maseratis. Sitting at a corner table in the slightly frayed white-linen grandeur of Port Moresby\u2019s Crown hotel, where the deposed Papua New Guinea strongman holed up in May during the political showdown that ended his eight-year reign, he says he can\u2019t say much about the allegations investigators are levelling at him. And then says rather a lot. He is composed, but then he has been here before. O\u2019Neill stared down a warrant issued in 2014 as part of a long-running inquiry into alleged fraudulent payments of around $30m to a Port Moresby law firm, which was eventually thrown out by the PNG supreme court in 2017. Those proceedings were initiated by the muscular, multiagency Taskforce Sweep which O\u2019Neill himself established soon after gaining power in 2011, pledging zero tolerance of corruption. He shut down the taskforce days after it tried to arrest him. \u201cWhen they [Sweep investigators] became too political, I did close it down, and I had no hesitation in doing so and I would do it again,\u201d he says. That said, he nominates the enduring odour of corruption in PNG as a regret in reflecting on his time in power. \u201cWithout evidence, there is a perception that corruption is rife in every aspect of our society, which is a very poor reflection and poor assessment of our country.\u201d Of the current allegations, he says they relate to a request for funding from a health centre run by the Lutheran church in Madang in the north of the country. \u201cThey put a proposal to my office. I referred that for funding to our Community Development Fund agency, which I was responsible for. They funded it. They made payments direct to the church. So, what is wrong with that? What is corrupt about that? So, we\u2019ll test the evidence in court, but it\u2019s just rubbish. It\u2019s a politically motivated case.\u201d Last Friday, a few days after this interview, police withdrew the original warrant in the face of challenges by O\u2019Neill\u2019s lawyers over its validity, but reports indicate that the investigation is not over, and that another warrant may be in the works. Maserati-gate O\u2019Neill is rather more enthusiastic articulating his take on the legacy of his leadership. On the positive side of the ledger, he boasts of major policy achievements in education and health and \u201cunprecedented economic growth\u201d as well as PNG\u2019s successful hosting of the Apec conference last year, which \u201ccertainly put the country into a good light with the rest of the world\u201d. But the summit generated international opprobrium and domestic fury around the estimated US$135m spent on the event, including the purchase of a fleet of Maserati and Bentley vehicles on the claim they were necessary to transport world leaders including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. \u201cWell, I could have bought a pushbike to take the leaders to the meeting,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cIt went to a bidding process. It was the cheapest amount of luxury cars that we could buy for the leaders. What do you expect us to pay for to transport the leaders under the secure arrangements that they deserve as global leaders?\u201d But PNG is a country with serious economic constraints, high poverty rates, battling a phalanx of consecutive disease emergencies (polio, tuberculosis, malaria and HIV) and the fallout of a devastating earthquake. Might leaders not have been content to forfeit a little luxury within that context? At this, O\u2019Neill pushes back. \u201cI think you should attend a few of these meetings and find out for yourself,\u201d he counsels. \u201cYou go to the next one in Chile and see what sort of vehicles \u2013 Audi or Mercedes or Maseratis.\u201d Since the interview, Chile announced it was withdrawing from hosting Apec as street protests raged across the country. Apec delivered substantial infrastructure to PNG, O\u2019Neill argues. \u201cLook at the roads in Port Moresby\u201d and in other major cities: Mt Hagen, Lae and Goroka. Nonetheless, as the daily, infuriated and distressed posts of ordinary citizens on social media attest, roads and infrastructure across most of the country are so poor it is all but impossible to get a bag of coffee to market or an emergency case to hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s just nonsense to think that because you live in Australia, to come and think that we\u2019ll have roads like Australia, it has taken 200 years to build that \u2026 You look at the substantial improvement in infrastructure \u2013 in ports, airports, roads, bridges. So don\u2019t give me that nonsense.\u201d \u2018These are hard choices to make\u2019 Returning to education, featuring at the top of his legacy list, O\u2019Neill says that over his time school enrolments went from fewer than 900,000 children to more than 2m after he waived school fees. \u201cWe enabled many young girls who are always the lowest priorities in families to get an education \u2026 to be independent and not subjected to the pressures of family and early marriage and all the other issues we face in a developing country.\u201d But there is a flipside to this narrative. The policy delivered students, but not the resources to support them. The consequences are plain in broken-down, overcrowded classrooms across the country, and in the concerns of parents and employers about student achievement. The Guardian had just visited a schoolhouse in Western Province with 57 children in one multi-age class, a single teacher, few usable desks and a floor so rotten a visitor had just fallen through it. O\u2019Neill acknowledges these issues. \u201cBut do I make a choice about leaving kids on the street, or putting them in an environment where they can do some learning \u2026 is it fair on the girls that they are kept at home? These are hard choices to make.\u201d Investments he initiated in curriculum and teacher training will, over time, yield improvements, he says. On health, he claims he delivered increased spending and a program of free basic healthcare throughout the country, particularly to rural and remote populations. But an Australian National University analysis identified a 37% cut in the health budget in real terms from 2014 to 2016. Doctors, health workers and aid agencies have expressed alarm about the collapse of basic health services and the medical supply chain. Public distress around the lack of health services was a focus of mass protests ahead of Apec. A national audit in 2017 documented widespread \u201cunavailability of lifesaving and essential drugs\u201d and the National Doctors Association blamed the closure of many rural health facilities for lack of supplies or workers on \u201cendemic and epidemic\u201d corruption. As to how this looks on the ground, the Guardian recounted the case of a family it encountered in Gulf Province scrambling to find 150 kina (A$63) to put fuel in an ambulance to get a teenage boy with snakebite to the nearest hospital, because the aid post was out of antivenom. (At the same aid post, a mother of six had recently died in childbirth because there was no fuel in the ambulance.) \u201cIt is more of a management problem than government not prioritising,\u201d O\u2019Neill responds. \u201cAs far as I know, funding allocations for the health sector during our term in government has been the highest by any government since independence. Those fundings have been made available as a priority every year.\u201d The economy is the other aspect of his legacy O\u2019Neill highlights, claiming to have doubled GDP and maintained sustainable economic growth despite crashes in commodity prices and global challenges. A recently published 2019 PNG Economic Survey by ANU and the University of PNG tells a different story, citing World Bank assessments showing PNG falling into the category of fragile state from 2013 to 2017, with plummeting scores on economic management over O\u2019Neill\u2019s reign. Soon after gaining power in May, the country\u2019s new prime minister, James Marape, described the economy as \u201cstruggling and bleeding\u201d, and when he handed down the budget last month he said the country was in a \u201cvery deep economic hole\u201d, appealing to Australia for help. O\u2019Neill has vehemently disputed this reading of the numbers. \u2018No regrets\u2019 PNG will face a significant test in coming months as a long-awaited independence referendum in Bougainville gets under way later this month. A Lowy Institute analysis anticipates an overwhelming vote for independence, but O\u2019Neill warns that this could lead to a fracturing of PNG. \u201cWe\u2019ve got almost a thousand nations in this country,\u201d he says. \u201cIs the international community going to support them if any one of them decide tomorrow that \u2018we\u2019ve got a goldmine now, we\u2019ve got an oilfield now, so we want to be independent\u2019? That\u2019s the danger that we are facing.\u201d Under the arrangements hammered out under the Bougainville peace agreement, \u201cthe referendum outcome is not the final determination of independence on Bougainville. It has to be endorsed by parliament. And I\u2019m sure the parliament will make the right decisions.\u201d This despite warnings that any refusal by the PNG government to ratify the result could lead to unrest. Of the Manus deal to take asylum seekers trying to reach Australia, O\u2019Neill says he has \u201cno regrets\u201d. It brought jobs, money and infrastructure to the island of Manus, he says. \u201cNobody gives us credit for stopping the boats in Australia. Papua New Guinea proposed the idea to Australia, because we had the refugee centre (from earlier Somare-Howard government arrangements). We revived that to stop the drowning at sea and it saved thousands of lives. But people forget all this.\u201d And finally, O\u2019Neill discusses the controversial A$1.24bn 2014 loan arranged by UBS Australia, now the subject of a PNG royal commission investigation. O\u2019Neill used it to buy a 10% stake in resources company Oil Search. When the oil price tanked over the following year, PNG lost an estimated $420m. With his leadership already fracturing, fallout from a damning Ombudsman Commission of PNG report on the \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cspeculative\u201d loan saw him finally deposed. Was it a mistake to take the loan, and to bypass parliamentary approval? \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was a mistake\u201d, he says, adding he had the authority to borrow the money. \u201cThe Oil Search shares were mortgaged to the United Arab Emirates \u2026 One must remember that Oil Search is still one of the biggest taxpayers, employers and investors in PNG, that it has substantial holdings in our resources sector and our people have been calling for more and more ownership, and more and more benefits from these resources, so as a government it is our responsibility to try and secure that.\u201d And that persistent whiff around the deal? \u201cMy assessment is that the Swiss authorities investigated twice. They found nothing wrong with it. Australian officials have investigated once. They found nothing wrong with it. Our people are investigating now. What are we looking for? I\u2019m sure that Swiss and Australian officials are as competent as anyone else. \u201cThey\u2019ve found that these arrangements were in order, except that nobody predicted the collapse of the world prices \u2026 I mean, nobody could predict it. So we were caught in a situation where we needed to sell down these shares to try to repay the loans to UBS.\u201d On Tuesday, it was reported that PNG had indefinitely delayed an inquiry into the loan. The inquiry\u2019s chairman, Salamo Injia, said the commission has yet to line up the funding it needs as well as foreign lawyers to work with the commission. \u201cUntil these and other outstanding administrative arrangements are completed by the government agencies and officers concerned, this Commission is unable to sit today and is unlikely to sit any time soon,\u201d Injia said in a statement.",

You want to assure people, or reassure people, that this actually happened. And yourself as well.\u201d Roach frequently slips into the second person, talking about \u201cyourself\u201d when he\u2019s actually referring to himself, preserving a kind of distance.</p> <p>In his concerts, Roach has taken to introducing Took the Children Away by saying that every time he sings it, he lets a little bit of pain go. One day, he says, that pain will be gone and he will be free.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywDT6yHMmo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aywDT6yHMmo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Similarly, he tells the Guardian that the process of writing Tell Me Why helped heal some of his grief for his estranged, now deceased adoptive parents. \u201cI\u2019d never talked about them before, and I was able to do that, so I was able to let that go.\u201d</p> <p>He also wanted to acknowledge their pain. \u201cPeople need to understand that as well, that some of the families, maybe a lot of the families: what they did [was] out of the goodness of their hearts, and out of love.\u201d</p> <p>Tell Me Why reveals much more of Roach than was previously known. Nearly half the book is taken up with his years of drinking in the parks and pubs and \u201cempties\u201d (vacant buildings) of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, as he reconnected with his surviving family members.</p> <p>Roach\u2019s street years are recalled with fondness. \u201cThere was a real sense of community with those people, and nobody [outside of it] heard that conversation, so I wanted to take people on that journey,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0b610644dfb7d5d2049a2541b56e5c4bcdc3a84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b610644dfb7d5d2049a2541b56e5c4bcdc3a84/0_0_1400_2120/660.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Tell Me Why, Archie Roach\u2019s memoir out November 2019.\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Naturally, those years also took a terrible toll. Roach suffered from epilepsy as a result of his alcoholism, and there\u2019s a shockingly raw description of a suicide attempt at the end of a bender, after an attempt to dry out. There are stints in hospital, and prison too.</p> <p>Roach has also survived a stroke, has had half a lung removed due to cancer, and gave up a kidney to his late brother Lawrence. The transplant wasn\u2019t a success.</p> <p>These days, Roach needs a wheelchair to get around, and has a tendency to speak with his eyes closed. But when he fixes them on you, they\u2019re full of light.</p> <p>Of his attempt on his life, Roach says it\u2019s something he \u201cprobably should have mentioned before\u201d, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/14/unspeakable-how-can-australia-stop-the-indigenous-suicide-epidemic\">suicide rates among Aboriginal people, including children, at epidemic levels</a>. \u201cYou can reach the darkest point in our life and come back, and come good, even better.\u201d</p> <p>But Tell Me Why is also a love story for Roach\u2019s partner Ruby Hunter, who died in 2010. Hunter, too, had been stolen; she and Roach referred to each other as \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cmum\u201d respectively.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a term of endearment,\u201d Roach chuckles. But there was also more to it: \u201cIt\u2019s good to use those words \u2018mum\u2019 and \u2018dad\u2019, they\u2019re very powerful words when you\u2019re a stolen kid.

It was 1990, and Paul Kelly and guitarist Steve Connolly had billed the almost unknown artist on a gig at what is now Melbourne\u2019s Hamer Hall, to a dumbstruck audience.</p> <p>Roach played just two songs, Beautiful Child and Took the Children Away.

      "bodyText": "For the Gunditjmara people of south-west Victoria, the kneeangar \u2013 what white Australians call the wedge-tailed eagle \u2013 is the creator of the landscape. For the Bundjalung of north-east New South Wales, it is the gunggayay, or red-bellied black snake. On the spine of Archie Roach\u2019s memoir, Tell Me Why, the gunggayay encircles the kneeangar, a logo that encapsulates the Indigenous songwriter\u2019s heritage: his Bundjalung father Archie Senior, and his Gunditjmara mother Nellie Austin. But Roach, who first came to national attention in 1990 with his celebrated song Took the Children Away and accompanying debut album Charcoal Lane, is also the foster son of Alex and Dulcie Cox: Dad Alex and Mum Dulcie, as he calls them. The Coxes were told that Archie\u2019s birth parents had died in a house fire. In fact, he had been stolen from them in the late 1950s at Framlingham mission, near Warrnambool. \u201cThey were used,\u201d Roach, now 63, says when we meet, as he rests in a Sydney hotel room. \u201cThey\u2019re blameless, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Alex and Dulcie cherished Archie but, he writes, \u201cthere was always a restlessness in me, like a faultline waiting to rupture\u201d. When he was 15, he received a letter from a hitherto unknown sister, Myrtle \u2013 one of six siblings \u2013 telling him Nellie had died. The faultline ruptured. Roach writes that before leaving to find his brothers and sisters, Dad Alex \u2013 a Glaswegian immigrant who also yearned for his homeland \u2013 told him: \u201cBifay ye leave me and Ma, I jes wanted tae say \u2026 Well, we hope ye fin what ye lookin for, Archie.\u201d He never saw them again. The title of Tell Me Why \u2013 which is being released alongside an album of new songs and re-recorded versions of many of his classics \u2013 is both rhetorical and a plea. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to come to terms with it happening, rather than denying that it happened or just pushing it aside and thinking, \u2018Oh, something happened to me as a kid, but it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u2019 \u201cIt was more than that. You want to assure people, or reassure people, that this actually happened. And yourself as well.\u201d Roach frequently slips into the second person, talking about \u201cyourself\u201d when he\u2019s actually referring to himself, preserving a kind of distance. In his concerts, Roach has taken to introducing Took the Children Away by saying that every time he sings it, he lets a little bit of pain go. One day, he says, that pain will be gone and he will be free. Similarly, he tells the Guardian that the process of writing Tell Me Why helped heal some of his grief for his estranged, now deceased adoptive parents. \u201cI\u2019d never talked about them before, and I was able to do that, so I was able to let that go.\u201d He also wanted to acknowledge their pain. \u201cPeople need to understand that as well, that some of the families, maybe a lot of the families: what they did [was] out of the goodness of their hearts, and out of love.\u201d Tell Me Why reveals much more of Roach than was previously known. Nearly half the book is taken up with his years of drinking in the parks and pubs and \u201cempties\u201d (vacant buildings) of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, as he reconnected with his surviving family members. Roach\u2019s street years are recalled with fondness. \u201cThere was a real sense of community with those people, and nobody [outside of it] heard that conversation, so I wanted to take people on that journey,\u201d he says. Naturally, those years also took a terrible toll. Roach suffered from epilepsy as a result of his alcoholism, and there\u2019s a shockingly raw description of a suicide attempt at the end of a bender, after an attempt to dry out. There are stints in hospital, and prison too. Roach has also survived a stroke, has had half a lung removed due to cancer, and gave up a kidney to his late brother Lawrence. The transplant wasn\u2019t a success. These days, Roach needs a wheelchair to get around, and has a tendency to speak with his eyes closed. But when he fixes them on you, they\u2019re full of light. Of his attempt on his life, Roach says it\u2019s something he \u201cprobably should have mentioned before\u201d, with suicide rates among Aboriginal people, including children, at epidemic levels. \u201cYou can reach the darkest point in our life and come back, and come good, even better.\u201d But Tell Me Why is also a love story for Roach\u2019s partner Ruby Hunter, who died in 2010. Hunter, too, had been stolen; she and Roach referred to each other as \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cmum\u201d respectively. \u201cIt was a term of endearment,\u201d Roach chuckles. But there was also more to it: \u201cIt\u2019s good to use those words \u2018mum\u2019 and \u2018dad\u2019, they\u2019re very powerful words when you\u2019re a stolen kid. I suppose they take on deeper meaning when you\u2019re a bit older, as well.\u201d It was Hunter who kicked Roach up the backside when, on the cusp of his first album and record deal, Roach nearly walked away from music entirely. It was 1990, and Paul Kelly and guitarist Steve Connolly had billed the almost unknown artist on a gig at what is now Melbourne\u2019s Hamer Hall, to a dumbstruck audience. Roach played just two songs, Beautiful Child and Took the Children Away. The latter song, sung in Roach\u2019s pure, earnest voice, starts with the words, \u201cThis story\u2019s right, this story\u2019s true. I would not tell lies to you.\u201d Both songs were met with complete silence. Then, as he left the stage, the applause began: \u201cIt started slowly and then it came down hard. I turned around and held my guitar up in the air, like this\u201d \u2013 he raises his arms \u2013 \u201cyeah!\u201d He had first played Took the Children Away in Sydney in 1988, at a Bicentennial protest. On that occasion, too, the crowd had been left stunned and weeping. When he later played the song on a community radio station in Melbourne, the switchboard lit up. The term \u201cstolen generations\u201d didn\u2019t exist in the popular consciousness back then, and Roach, a shy man, was uncomfortable being a spokesman for them. \u201cI was reluctant, I think, to put myself out there and have that sort of scrutiny,\u201d he confesses. \u201cIt frightened me a bit.\u201d He told Hunter he\u2019d quit. Hunter, Roach writes, drew herself up to her full height \u2013 which admittedly was not very much \u2013 put her hands on her hips and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not all about you, Archie Roach. How many blackfellas you reckon get to record an album?\u201d Other Indigenous singer-songwriters followed. One, Adam Briggs, recorded a sequel to Took the Children Away, and invited Roach to guest on AB Original\u2019s album, on which Roach spoke of bringing Melbourne to a standstill during land rights marches in the 70s and 80s. While his songs are quiet \u2013 he writes that \u201cempathy was my impetus\u201d \u2013 he reserves a place for anger and direct action. \u201cA lot of people are getting upset about young people in the street disrupting traffic, especially these climate protesters,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, well, what\u2019s a day\u2019s disruption compared to the total annihilation of the planet? What\u2019s wrong with you people? You need to make a racket! You need to be in their face.\u201d Before he left the Cox family, Roach worshipped at a Pentecostal church in Melbourne, and even spoke in tongues. He drew comfort from the hymns that informed his own songs, and from Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cSuffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.\u201d Roach eventually reconciled his Christian upbringing with his own heritage. \u201cI found my own culture, which is not so much about religion but it\u2019s about being a spiritual person, in our connection to the earth and the cosmos.\u201d Around his neck hangs a necklace, at the end of which flies a wedge-tailed eagle. \u2022 Tell Me Why by Archie Roach is out now through Simon &amp; Schuster.

Chelsea had taken 22 shots at goal and really should have won. But Ajax were thrillingly reckless too.

The fact is they were taken apart for an hour. Ten minutes before that double sending-off, just before Donny van de Beek\u2019s low shot bulged the Chelsea net to make it 4-1 Frank Lampard could be seen already turning away, a horrible smile on his face.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/frank-lampard-hails-chelsea-spirit-comeback-ajax\">Frank Lampard hails Chelsea spirit after three-goal comeback against Ajax</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lampard had watched as Christian Pulisic gave the ball away high up the pitch, as the Chelsea centre-backs, who had played through a mist of confusion all night, left huge untended green spaces inside their own area. Van de Beek had time to take a breath and admire the mist flooding down over the low white roof lights before clipping the ball into the corner.</p> \n<p>At that stage Chelsea had not just been opened up. They had been shivved and sliced, meat pulled away from the bones. It was a gentle kind of butchery, one that owed quite a lot to the subject on the blood-soaked bench, a Chelsea team intent on helping to lower the knife.</p> \n<p>There seemed an easy narrative, Chelsea\u2019s enforced, ad hoc youth policy schooled in the realities by the European masters of succession. Ajax became a footballing nursery because of something innate to the Dutch sporting culture, an economic necessity, but also a quasi\u2011intellectual rigour. Chelsea have gone down a similar route because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/chelsea-transfer-ban-two-windows-fifa-foreign-players-under-age-18\" title=\"\">they got busted for tapping up other clubs\u2019 young players</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/500/group-h\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> \n  <thead> \n   <tr> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> \n   </tr> \n  </thead> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">1</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">7</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Ajax</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">5</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">7</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Valencia</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">1</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">7</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Lille</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-7</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">1</td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table> \n</figure> \n<p>There are one or two differences there and there were differences on the pitch, too. In the opening 40 minutes Mason Mount and Pulisic completed five passes between them. By half-time the same pair had given the ball to an Ajax shirt 11 times, one fewer then they had managed to their own players.</p> \n<p>Ajax were too compact, too vigorous, too cute in their movements. Meanwhile Chelsea defended with all the resistance of an overly dunked digestive biscuit, three of the four Ajax goals scored from the kind of spaces that speak to some kind of systems failure, a shutdown, a category mistake.</p> \n<p>With five minutes gone it was already 1-1. A Quincy Promes free-kick was deflected in, then equalised by a penalty that owed a pre-assist to Mount\u2019s driving run. At which point Ajax began the orderly process of taking the game away, right up until that 11-minute spell of turnaround.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/05/liverpool-genk-champions-league-match-report\">Liverpool\u2019s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has the class to leave Genk in a spin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What to make of all this? It will be tempting to see in Chelsea\u2019s performance only chaos, weak spots, a loss of control. But this is also to disregard something vital about the way teams work. There has been so much talk this week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/chelsea-20-november-hearing-appeal-fifa-transfer-ban\" title=\"\">Chelsea cranking up the purchasing arm straight away </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/chelsea-20-november-hearing-appeal-fifa-transfer-ban\" title=\"\">if their transfer ban </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/chelsea-20-november-hearing-appeal-fifa-transfer-ban\" title=\"\">is overturned</a>. It seems remarkable that a club that has finally found a little soul should risk all that by rushing back out to the market. Or rather, it would if you haven\u2019t been watching for the past 15 years.</p> \n<p>But there was also something precious on show here. Chelsea gained a point \u2013 keeping them level with Ajax \u2013 on spirit, warmth and the will to seize the game when the opening came. It might yet come to nothing. Even four points from the final two games could still leave them short of second place. But there was life here, too, for all the raggedness and a sense above all of something taking root.</p>",

With nine men on the pitch after Daley Blind and Jo\u00ebl Veltman had been sent off during The Happening \u2013 a blur of fouls, handballs and yellow cards \u2013 they kept on pouring forward in search of a winner. It was majestic, fearless and shot through with a wonderful Cruyffian arrogance. And, yes, here is an obvious takedown to all the goodwill generated by Chelsea\u2019s ragged rearguard. The fact is they were taken apart for an hour. Ten minutes before that double sending-off, just before Donny van de Beek\u2019s low shot bulged the Chelsea net to make it 4-1 Frank Lampard could be seen already turning away, a horrible smile on his face. Lampard had watched as Christian Pulisic gave the ball away high up the pitch, as the Chelsea centre-backs, who had played through a mist of confusion all night, left huge untended green spaces inside their own area. Van de Beek had time to take a breath and admire the mist flooding down over the low white roof lights before clipping the ball into the corner. At that stage Chelsea had not just been opened up. They had been shivved and sliced, meat pulled away from the bones. It was a gentle kind of butchery, one that owed quite a lot to the subject on the blood-soaked bench, a Chelsea team intent on helping to lower the knife. There seemed an easy narrative, Chelsea\u2019s enforced, ad hoc youth policy schooled in the realities by the European masters of succession. Ajax became a footballing nursery because of something innate to the Dutch sporting culture, an economic necessity, but also a quasi\u2011intellectual rigour. Chelsea have gone down a similar route because they got busted for tapping up other clubs\u2019 young players. There are one or two differences there and there were differences on the pitch, too. In the opening 40 minutes Mason Mount and Pulisic completed five passes between them. By half-time the same pair had given the ball to an Ajax shirt 11 times, one fewer then they had managed to their own players. Ajax were too compact, too vigorous, too cute in their movements. Meanwhile Chelsea defended with all the resistance of an overly dunked digestive biscuit, three of the four Ajax goals scored from the kind of spaces that speak to some kind of systems failure, a shutdown, a category mistake. With five minutes gone it was already 1-1. A Quincy Promes free-kick was deflected in, then equalised by a penalty that owed a pre-assist to Mount\u2019s driving run. At which point Ajax began the orderly process of taking the game away, right up until that 11-minute spell of turnaround. What to make of all this? It will be tempting to see in Chelsea\u2019s performance only chaos, weak spots, a loss of control. But this is also to disregard something vital about the way teams work. There has been so much talk this week of Chelsea cranking up the purchasing arm straight away if their transfer ban is overturned. It seems remarkable that a club that has finally found a little soul should risk all that by rushing back out to the market. Or rather, it would if you haven\u2019t been watching for the past 15 years. But there was also something precious on show here. Chelsea gained a point \u2013 keeping them level with Ajax \u2013 on spirit, warmth and the will to seize the game when the opening came. It might yet come to nothing. Even four points from the final two games could still leave them short of second place. But there was life here, too, for all the raggedness and a sense above all of something taking root.",

It has long been known that smoking is more common among people with mental health conditions. However, it has been unclear whether smoking could be a factor in causing such problems or is simply a form of self-medication among those already living with poor mental health. Scientists say they have now unpicked the issue. \u201cWhat we found was that there was evidence of causal effects in both directions,\u201d said Dr Robyn Wootton, the first author of the research, from the University of Bristol. Wootton said that while the serious physical consequences of smoking were already known, the new research underlined the importance of preventing people from starting the habit and helping smokers to quit to protect their mental health \u2013 whether or not they have existing mental health problems. \u201cOf course, if [smoking] is also making the risk of mental illness worse then we should be helping individuals who have existing mental health problems to stop as well,\u201d she said. Writing in the journal Psychological Medicine, Wootton and colleagues report how they compared the risk of developing depression or schizophrenia among people with and without a genetic predisposition to smoking cigarettes. As such genetic variants are randomly distributed across the population \u2013 and are not changed by factors such as alcohol consumption, income, exercise or other health issues \u2013 the approach is a type of natural experiment that reduces the chances of any link being down to other factors. The team focused on 378 genetic variants that have previously been linked to whether people start smoking, as well as 126 genetic variants the team found were linked to a higher score for lifetime smoking \u2013 a measure encompassing how heavily people smoked, for how long, and if they quit. Wootton and colleagues then used two separate genetic databases, one including thousands of individuals with schizophrenia and the other including thousands of individuals with major depression, to explore whether the risk of having such conditions was linked to the genetic variants for smoking. The results reveal that both starting smoking and higher levels of smoking are linked to a greater risk of both depression and schizophrenia. As an example, an individual who smoked 20 cigarettes a day for 15 years but then did not smoke for 17 years had more than twice the odds of developing schizophrenia and almost twice the odds of developing depression than someone who had never smoked. The team also looked to see whether people with a genetic predisposition to depression or schizophrenia smoked more.

The number of NHS mental health beds in England has fallen by 73% from 67,100 in 1987-88 to just 18,400. That was part of a drive to provide more \u201ccare in the community\u201d and treat more mentally ill people in or close to their homes. However, the promised expansion of out-of-hospital mental health care has not occurred on anywhere near the scale originally envisaged. A new report commissioned by the college into the availability of mental health beds found that a much larger number of beds \u2013 1,060 \u2013 need to be created in order to reduce bed occupancy from 90% to the 85% level psychiatrists think is good for care. Vicki Nash, the head of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cThese figures are a stark reminder of the growing crisis in mental health. As demand increases it\u2019s tantamount to negligence that beds are being cut in some areas without a viable alternative.\u201d NHS England declined to comment.",
