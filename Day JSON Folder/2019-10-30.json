I don\u2019t know the last time I had so much fun in a football game. I saw so many really good performances. I was so happy for the kids that they will remember the first night for the rest of their lives. They made it a proper, special football night. Everyone who came tonight saw 19 goals \u2013 pretty special. \u201cAs a manager maybe I should worry more about the goals we conceded but I couldn\u2019t care less to be honest. I could not care less. The mistakes that we made were obvious but it\u2019s not important. The most important thing for development is that you react in the right way. All these boys need to play in difficult football games \u2013 and it was a difficult football game. They worked their socks off and left their souls on the pitch. I really loved it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Facebook\u2019s myriad political controversies overshadowed a strong financial quarter on Wednesday as the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, delivered an impassioned defense of his company on a conference call with investors.</p> <p>The company reported strong revenue and profit growth for the third quarter of 2019, beating analyst expectations and prompting the share price to jump as much as 4% in after-hours trading. Revenues grew 29% year-over-year to $17.7bn, and profits grew 19% to $6.1bn.</p> <p>Facebook also reported continued user growth, with 2.45bn monthly average users of Facebook, and 2.8bn across the company\u2019s full stable of apps, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.</p> <p>The strong business performance appeared almost an afterthought to Zuckerberg, however, as he delivered a lengthy and emotional defense of the company\u2019s \u201cprinciples\u201d, particularly in connection to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/facebook-to-keep-fact-checking-pac-boss-who-tried-to-skirt-rules\">ongoing controversy</a> over its policies on political advertisements.</p> <p>\u201cOver the next year of the campaign, we\u2019re going to be at the center of the debate any time there\u2019s a policy that people believe may advantage their side,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect that this is going to be a very tough year.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook has been harshly criticized in recent weeks over its decision to exempt posts by politicians from its third-party factchecking program and to exempt ads by politicians from a policy banning false or misleading statements in advertisements.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/facebook-removes-africa-accounts-linked-russian-troll-factory-yevgeny-prigozhin\">Facebook removes Africa accounts linked to Russian troll factory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome people accuse us of allowing this speech because all we care about is making money,\u201d Zuckerberg said. But the controversy far outweighs the profit, he added. \u201cWe estimate that these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our revenue next year \u2026 We believe deeply that political speech is important and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s diatribe included rebuttals to several critical arguments that he attributed to \u201csome people\u201d or \u201ccritics\u201d. He referenced critiques of the company\u2019s algorithmic news feed, which amplifies certain content according to opaque calculations. Facebook has made \u201chuge sacrifices\u201d in order to weight the algorithm toward \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d, he asserted, including one change that reduced the amount of viral video that users were watching by 50m hours every day.</p> <p>\u201cSome people say this is all a cynical political calculation, that we\u2019re just trying to appease conservatives \u2013 that\u2019s wrong too,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, if our goal were to make either side happy, we\u2019re not doing a very good job, because we\u2019re making everyone frustrated with us.\u201d</p> <p>One group of critics that Zuckerberg did not address was his own employees, hundreds of whom have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/28/facebook-employees-strongly-object-to-policy-allowing-false-claims-in-political-ads\">signed a letter</a> objecting to the political ads policy.</p> <p>The earnings call took place less than an hour after the Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">announced</a> that his company will ban all political advertising, in a tweeted statement that included multiple veiled critiques of Zuckerberg\u2019s position.</p> <p>Zuckerberg did not directly reference Twitter\u2019s decision, but did say that he will continue to consider his position.</p> <p>\u201cWould we really want to block ads for important political issues like climate ads or women\u2019s political empowerment?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The day also saw the disclosure of another major foreign influence campaign using Facebook\u2019s, and a shakeup to the company\u2019s board of directors.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, the company announced that it was taking down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/facebook-removes-africa-accounts-linked-russian-troll-factory-yevgeny-prigozhin\">three networks of inauthentic pages and accounts</a> targeting eight African nations. The networks were linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian businessman who has been indicted by the US government for his alleged role in backing the Russian troll farm that interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.</p> <p>Zuckerberg argued the takedowns were a victory because they demonstrated the efficacy of the systems the company has built to detect inauthentic behavior. Some of the inauthentic accounts purchased ads from Facebook as early as May 2014.</p> <p>Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Facebook\u2019s lead independent director, announced her resignation from the company\u2019s board on Wednesday. Desmond-Hellman is the CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, and she cited \u201cincreasing demands from my CEO role, my extended family, and my own health\u201d in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/desmond-hellmann-departs-board/\">statement</a> announcing her departure.</p> <p>The company said the next lead independent director will be announced in the coming months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Facebook\u2019s myriad political controversies overshadowed a strong financial quarter on Wednesday as the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, delivered an impassioned defense of his company on a conference call with investors. The company reported strong revenue and profit growth for the third quarter of 2019, beating analyst expectations and prompting the share price to jump as much as 4% in after-hours trading. Revenues grew 29% year-over-year to $17.7bn, and profits grew 19% to $6.1bn. Facebook also reported continued user growth, with 2.45bn monthly average users of Facebook, and 2.8bn across the company\u2019s full stable of apps, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. The strong business performance appeared almost an afterthought to Zuckerberg, however, as he delivered a lengthy and emotional defense of the company\u2019s \u201cprinciples\u201d, particularly in connection to the ongoing controversy over its policies on political advertisements. \u201cOver the next year of the campaign, we\u2019re going to be at the center of the debate any time there\u2019s a policy that people believe may advantage their side,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect that this is going to be a very tough year.\u201d Facebook has been harshly criticized in recent weeks over its decision to exempt posts by politicians from its third-party factchecking program and to exempt ads by politicians from a policy banning false or misleading statements in advertisements. \u201cSome people accuse us of allowing this speech because all we care about is making money,\u201d Zuckerberg said. But the controversy far outweighs the profit, he added. \u201cWe estimate that these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our revenue next year \u2026 We believe deeply that political speech is important and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us.\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s diatribe included rebuttals to several critical arguments that he attributed to \u201csome people\u201d or \u201ccritics\u201d. He referenced critiques of the company\u2019s algorithmic news feed, which amplifies certain content according to opaque calculations. Facebook has made \u201chuge sacrifices\u201d in order to weight the algorithm toward \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d, he asserted, including one change that reduced the amount of viral video that users were watching by 50m hours every day. \u201cSome people say this is all a cynical political calculation, that we\u2019re just trying to appease conservatives \u2013 that\u2019s wrong too,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, if our goal were to make either side happy, we\u2019re not doing a very good job, because we\u2019re making everyone frustrated with us.\u201d One group of critics that Zuckerberg did not address was his own employees, hundreds of whom have signed a letter objecting to the political ads policy. The earnings call took place less than an hour after the Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, announced that his company will ban all political advertising, in a tweeted statement that included multiple veiled critiques of Zuckerberg\u2019s position. Zuckerberg did not directly reference Twitter\u2019s decision, but did say that he will continue to consider his position. \u201cWould we really want to block ads for important political issues like climate ads or women\u2019s political empowerment?\u201d he asked. The day also saw the disclosure of another major foreign influence campaign using Facebook\u2019s, and a shakeup to the company\u2019s board of directors. On Wednesday morning, the company announced that it was taking down three networks of inauthentic pages and accounts targeting eight African nations. The networks were linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian businessman who has been indicted by the US government for his alleged role in backing the Russian troll farm that interfered in the 2016 US presidential election. Zuckerberg argued the takedowns were a victory because they demonstrated the efficacy of the systems the company has built to detect inauthentic behavior. Some of the inauthentic accounts purchased ads from Facebook as early as May 2014. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Facebook\u2019s lead independent director, announced her resignation from the company\u2019s board on Wednesday. Desmond-Hellman is the CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, and she cited \u201cincreasing demands from my CEO role, my extended family, and my own health\u201d in a statement announcing her departure. The company said the next lead independent director will be announced in the coming months.",

Noticed how few cats have crossed your path recently? Now you know why.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-world-according-to-putin/episode-guide\" title=\"\">The World According to Putin</a> (Channel 4), a beguiling compilation of foreigner-bashing, fiercely nationalistic Russian state telly, we were told that Theresa May is a virtuoso at dead cat politics. It was she who ordered the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year, to misdirect the British people from her Brexit debacle. Or so Dmitry Kiselev, whom Vladimir Putin appointed in 2013 to head the new Russian government-owned international news agency, told viewers of his popular evening news show.</p> <p>You can see why Vlad gave him the job. Untruth did not begin with us; nor will it end with us, wrote Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in 1971. Quite so: in 2019, Kiselev, like Trump, is a post-truth virtuoso, and his values dominate Russian TV as Trump\u2019s have set the tone on Twitter and Johnson\u2019s have made British democracy an oxymoron. \u201cThe time for detailed, unbiased journalism is over,\u201d Kiselev told a staff meeting. \u201cIt is time to use it to create values. Editorial policy will be based on love of Russia.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say there would be nightly broadcasts from the former Soviet republic of Arslikhan eulogising the leader\u2019s achievements.

They were wide-eyed Russian tourists drawn to the city out of love for English gothic architecture. Cut to the hilarious Russia Today interview with the two men, in which they detailed their fondness for Salisbury, citing its cathedral\u2019s 123m spire and other attractions definitely not cribbed from Wikipedia. Did you have a bottle of Nina Ricci perfume, which the UK presents as evidence of your crime, asked the interviewer. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it would be kind of stupid for two straight men to be carrying perfume for ladies?\u201d replied Boshirov, smiling as if his rhetorical question was knock-down defence. I don\u2019t know how you roll in heteronormative Russia, Ruslan, but as a straight man in the Sodom and Gomorrah that is north London, I have often carried perfume for ladies. Hell, I have even worn it.</p> <p>More to the point, unlike the 72% of Russians who get their news from TV and nightly fixes of their leader being butch and outdoorsy in his scanties, I\u2019ve never seen the attraction of Putin\u2019s nipples. Surely only deep personal inadequacy can explain his need to get his kit off so readily for the cameras. (You had to be Russian, too, to find the footage of Putin\u2019s karaoke interpretation of Blueberry Hill anything but chilling.)</p> <p>Only five minutes into this documentary, the president of the Russian Federation was photographed with his top off as he fished. Did his media lackey Kiselev question this ludicrous sexual display? No. Instead, Kiselev \u2013 like much of the state-run Russian media \u2013 focused on May\u2019s breasts.</p> <p>I have never thought about May\u2019s breasts until this programme, but now I can think of nothing else. Kiselev compared May to berserker warriors and Femen protesters, both of whom went into battle topless. Cut to May arriving to make a speech in an evening dress with sleeveless gauze bodice. Her speech denounced Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, and she adorned it, Kiselev suggested unpleasantly, \u201cwith her tired white flesh\u201d. When May resigned, one Russian presenter lamented her departure: \u201cWe\u2019ll miss her deep cleavage.\u201d Russian television \u2013 not just fluent in dead cat, but also in the international language of misogyny.</p> <p>If this compilation was anything to go by, Russian TV is akin to what would happen if the Daily Mail necked a bottle of Stolichnaya and offered it to all-comers in an after-hours pub car park. In one show, a bravura mashup of Jeremy Kyle and Newsnight, a Ukrainian guest told a Russian that Russians lived in shit and were red fascists. \u201cComrade,\u201d replied the Russian from across the studio, \u201cI say to you as a man of peace, you call my ancestors fascists one more time and I\u2019m gonna come over there and smash your face in.\u201d Various stern yet sexy presenters indicted Britain as a public toilet, bewailed how western primary school kids are forcibly taught to be gay and masturbate, and explained Trump\u2019s fear of carrots.

      "bodyText": "An aircraft worker has been gouged in the eye by a falcon that lives in a Qantas Sydney airport hangar, creating what the union has called an \u201cunsafe work environment\u201d. Multiple peregrine falcons \u2013 including at least one small family \u2013 live, nest and hunt in the hangar. Falcons have been there for at least 20 years and have turned it into a \u201cknown roosting site\u201d. But on Tuesday last week, one of the falcons attacked a worker, causing significant damage to his eyes, neck and face. The worker \u201cmay lose sight in one eye\u201d, the Transport Workers Union said. The birds cannot be easily removed because they are a protected species, and Qantas has allowed them to stay because they keep mice, rats and pigeons away. Guardian Australia has obtained an internal safety warning issued by Qantas that confirmed the attack and told staff to wear safety goggles until the end of breeding season in November. \u201cMaintain clearance from any falcon activity,\u201d the warning said. \u201cIf you are swooped or observe the falcon, please report the location and activity observed.\u201d Staff in the hangar provided images of the falcons to Guardian Australia. Peregrine falcons are the world\u2019s fastest animal and can swoop at speeds of up to 300km/h. According to the safety notice, the falcon \u201cattacked the worker when they were in the vicinity of the falcon\u2019s food source\u201d. The New South Wales secretary of the TWU, Richard Olsen, said the union did not want the birds removed, but rather wanted Qantas to move cleaners away from the falcon-inhabited areas. He said staff were asked to keep cleaning aircraft in the hangar after the attack, and that not all staff were given safety equipment. \u201cWe are not calling for the birds to be removed, rather that Qantas have aircraft cleaned before the aircraft are moved to the particular hangar where these birds of prey roost and hunt,\u201d he said. He said Qantas never warned union members about the falcons. \u201cTWU members are not aware of any communication from Qantas about the possible unsafe work environment that the presence of these birds create,\u201d he said. \u201cMembers now fear for their personal safety if they are required to enter the hangars where these birds reside.\u201d A Qantas spokesman said the falcon attack was the first in the hangar. \u201cAircraft hangars make attractive homes for large birds due to their height and plenty of space to roost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not that well known that peregrine falcons have been living in our engineering hangars at Sydney airport for at least the past 20 years \u2026 They actually help keep smaller birds, rats and mice out of the hangars. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure employees who work in and around the hangar are reminded of the falcons\u2019 presence.\u201d According to the internal safety warning, a second worker was also swooped while walking through the hangar. \u201cFalcons have greater activity during their breeding cycle September through to November,\u201d the warning said. It advised staff to \u201ckeep clear of bird carcasses as they could be a potential food source\u201d. The wildlife rescue group Wires said it was \u201coften called around this time of year\u201d to the Qantas hangar, as the fledglings made their first attempts at flying. Wires noted as long ago as 2010 that the Qantas hangar was \u201ca known roosting site\u201d for the peregrine falcon. Rob Crawford, a Wires volunteer who specialises in raptors (birds of prey), said he had been visiting the airport falcons for years. \u201cEvery year, they generally have one or two chicks that come through,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cOver six or so years we\u2019ve been going there, there would be almost 20 birds \u2026 It\u2019s the same cycle every year. \u201cThere have been incidents. We\u2019ve heard of them swooping, and that is completely normal behaviour for them. We\u2019ve heard stories from the Qantas guys that they have been swooped before, maybe one has been scratched. \u201cBut as far as we are aware, this is the only time that anyone has been unlucky enough to have a serious injury.\u201d He said that with eyeglasses and hats, the chances of more injuries were now \u201cvery, very slim\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s generally not too much of a big deal. The birds don\u2019t care about humans for nine months of the year. For the three months they have chicks and fledglings they tend to be defensive. \u201cThe staff love these birds, they are their friends, their colleagues. They perform quite the service. A pair of peregrines will take at least one pigeon a day \u2013 those peregrines are responsible of clearing out hundreds of feral pigeons from the airport. It\u2019s actually a service to the greater good for the whole facility\u201d. As of Wednesday afternoon the peregrine falcon was coming 25th in the Guardian/Birdlife Australia bird of the year poll.",

      "body": "<p>For nearly 40 years, Australians have been taught to slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen and slap on a hat before they head outside. But that famous public health campaign neglected to give us another vital piece of advice: that we should also slide on some sunglasses.</p> <p>UV rays can be as harmful to our eyes as they are to our skin, which means shielding them is an important part of proper sun protection. Here\u2019s what you need to know about keeping your eyes safe this summer.</p> <h2>But isn\u2019t a bit of sun good for us?</h2> <p>It\u2019s true that sun exposure is an important source of vitamin D, which our bodies need for bone and musculoskeletal health. But by living in Australia, you are probably already getting enough of it: <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/news/media-releases/how-much-sun-is-enough.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Cancer Council has found</a> that more than three-quarters of Australians (77%) have sufficient vitamin D levels.</p> <p>Because everyone\u2019s individual vitamin D needs differ, based on factors such as age and skin colour, it\u2019s hard to give an exact figure for how much time in the sun we need. But generally, the Cancer Council advises that in summer, just a few minutes of sun exposure on most days of the week is enough to maintain adequate vitamin D levels. In winter, heading outdoors in the middle of the day - by going for a walk on your lunch break, for instance - will do the trick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4b64210011bda5aacc17d1dc8a2ffe768fb93f9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b64210011bda5aacc17d1dc8a2ffe768fb93f9d/0_0_3836_2826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cropped Image Of Young Woman EyeProcessed with VSCO with e6 preset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cropped Image Of Young Woman Eye <br>Processed with VSCO with e6 preset</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manana Kvernadze/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Can our eyes be damaged by the sun?</h2> <p>Unfortunately, yes. Peter Murphy, director of eyecare and community at Luxottica/OPSM, says UV rays have a detrimental effect on our eyes and can lead to a number of conditions that damage our vision.</p> <p>One of the main repercussions of too much UV exposure is the incidence of pterygium, a fleshy growth on the surface of the eye that can be unsightly and uncomfortable.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf a pterygium develops, it can affect people\u2019s vision,\u201d Murphy says.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cCumulative UV exposure can also increase the onset of cataracts, and longer term, can [lead to] macular degeneration.\u201d UV rays can also cause skin cancer of the eyelids, particularly because the skin around our eyes is very thin and tends to be neglected when we apply sunscreen.<br><br>To protect your eyes, look for glasses that comply with Australian UV protection standards. The Cancer Council <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/news/media-releases/how-much-sun-is-enough.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">recommends</a> wearing sunglasses any time you\u2019re outdoors for more than a few minutes when UV levels are 3 or above (which, in Australia, is most of the time).</p> <h2>Polarised and UV protection sunglasses \u2013 is there a difference?</h2> <p>Yes there is.

      "bodyText": "For nearly 40 years, Australians have been taught to slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen and slap on a hat before they head outside. But that famous public health campaign neglected to give us another vital piece of advice: that we should also slide on some sunglasses. UV rays can be as harmful to our eyes as they are to our skin, which means shielding them is an important part of proper sun protection. Here\u2019s what you need to know about keeping your eyes safe this summer. But isn\u2019t a bit of sun good for us? It\u2019s true that sun exposure is an important source of vitamin D, which our bodies need for bone and musculoskeletal health. But by living in Australia, you are probably already getting enough of it: the Cancer Council has found that more than three-quarters of Australians (77%) have sufficient vitamin D levels. Because everyone\u2019s individual vitamin D needs differ, based on factors such as age and skin colour, it\u2019s hard to give an exact figure for how much time in the sun we need. But generally, the Cancer Council advises that in summer, just a few minutes of sun exposure on most days of the week is enough to maintain adequate vitamin D levels. In winter, heading outdoors in the middle of the day - by going for a walk on your lunch break, for instance - will do the trick. Can our eyes be damaged by the sun? Unfortunately, yes. Peter Murphy, director of eyecare and community at Luxottica/OPSM, says UV rays have a detrimental effect on our eyes and can lead to a number of conditions that damage our vision. One of the main repercussions of too much UV exposure is the incidence of pterygium, a fleshy growth on the surface of the eye that can be unsightly and uncomfortable. \u201cIf a pterygium develops, it can affect people\u2019s vision,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cCumulative UV exposure can also increase the onset of cataracts, and longer term, can [lead to] macular degeneration.\u201d UV rays can also cause skin cancer of the eyelids, particularly because the skin around our eyes is very thin and tends to be neglected when we apply sunscreen. To protect your eyes, look for glasses that comply with Australian UV protection standards. The Cancer Council recommends wearing sunglasses any time you\u2019re outdoors for more than a few minutes when UV levels are 3 or above (which, in Australia, is most of the time). Polarised and UV protection sunglasses \u2013 is there a difference? Yes there is. You may have noticed a \u2018polarised\u2019 tag hanging proudly off pairs of those $5 sunglasses at the service station. But polarised and UV protected lenses aren\u2019t the same thing. While glasses with UV protection shield you from the harmful rays that damage eyes, polarised lenses also block light reflected off surfaces such as roads. \u201cPolarised lenses provide more comfortable vision to the wearer and eliminate reflective glare, which can be quite an issue, especially if you\u2019re doing a lot of driving or you\u2019re on the water,\u201d Murphy says. While polarised lenses can be helpful in situations where you\u2019re likely to contend with reflective glare, you should always wear sunglasses that block out harmful UV rays. Which sunglasses off the best protection? Wraparound sunglasses are the holy grail, Murphy says, as they guard against UV light from all angles. But failing that you should get glasses that properly fit your face, so that they block rays of sun that hit from the sides as well as front on. Sadly, those trendy tiny sunglasses favoured by celebrities such as Kendall Jenner are unlikely to keep your eyes safe. Are blue eyes more at risk of sun damage than darker eyes? It\u2019s true that blue eyes are more sensitive to the sun than those of a darker hue. But while our fair-eyed friends are more likely to start squinting the moment they step outdoors, that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to more sun damage. Likewise, deep brown eyes aren\u2019t immune to the sun\u2019s harmful rays. \u201cPeople with dark pigmentation sometimes won\u2019t be as sensitive to the sun, but the damaging effects of UV light are there whether you\u2019re blue-eyed or brown-eyed,\u201d Murphy says. Is it true that looking at the sun can make you blind? Yes! The schoolyard legend is true: Murphy says looking directly at the sun for even a short period of time can burn a hole in your retina. \u201cThat is not something that is recoverable,\u201d he warns. Should you wear sunglasses even when it\u2019s cloudy? Just as overcast days don\u2019t protect you from the risk of sunburn, a few clouds aren\u2019t enough to keep your eyes safe. \u201cThe level of UV is still quite high even on overcast days, so sunglasses are still important,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cIt may mean you could wear a lighter coloured lens tint on overcast days. The other option is to consider transition lenses, which are the ones that change colour according to the intensity of light.\u201d You can also opt for transition contact lenses that offer UV protection, while those who require distance correction can get prescription sunglasses with a transition lens. Why are sunglasses so important on the snow? If you\u2019ve ever hit the slopes for the day and returned red as a beet, you\u2019ll know how important sunscreen is when you\u2019re skiing or snowboarding. The same is true for eye protection. The bright white reflective surface of snow, white sand or even the ocean can cause what\u2019s called snow blindness: a painful, temporary loss of vision. It occurs because snow reflects up to 90% of the UV rays that fall on it - what the Cancer Council calls \u201calmost a double dose of UV\u201d. Snow blindness can sometimes take 24 hours to recover from, Murphy says. To prevent it, ensure your goggles or glasses offer 100% UV protection. Protect your eyes this summer at OPSM.",

To help you navigate what\u2019s worth listening to and what\u2019s just a passing trend, we\u2019ve enlisted the help of nutritionist, author and founder of Supercharged Food, Lee Holmes.<br><br>Having published nine cookbooks, released her own range of health products and founded the go-to website <a href=\"https://www.superchargedfood.com/about-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supercharge Your Life</a>, she is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to nourishing the mind and body.

It\u2019s the epicentre to health.\u201d The nutritionist has long been passionate about good gut health. She says when it comes to a healthy gut, it\u2019s important to cleanse, eat the right foods and repopulate it with good bacteria like those found in fermented foods such as kefir.</p> <p>\u201cWe walk around with about two to four kilos of plaque just sitting on the lining of our gut,\u201d Holmes says.

That\u2019s not a bad thing, because so much of modern football is too easy to predict. We can expect two vastly changed teams, with Liverpool perhaps more likely to field the most inexperienced XI, given their commitments in the Premier League and Europe, not to mention the Club World Cup in December. As for Unai Emery, the pressure is on at Arsenal, and even though he will not want to field a full-strength team, he might be minded to name a reasonably strong side to get a win on the board and keep open the prospect of some silverware down the line. With the beef between Granit Xhaka and Arsenal fans dominating headlines in the buildup to this game, Emery is acutely aware that Arsenal\u2019s season is already shaping up to be a turbulent one.</p> <p>Emery needs a response from his Arsenal team after the draw at home against Crystal Palace, even if the XI players who provide it are not regulars.<strong> </strong>As for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, as much as this competition is probably the lowest on his list of priorities this season, it still offers him the chance to give fringe Liverpool players a run out and give him an idea who might be first in line to come in when he has to rotate over the busy festive period. One person we should see this evening, is Mesut \u00d6zil, who is expected to captain Arsenal while Xhaka continues to let off steam. While we wait for team news, see if you can spot him in David Squires\u2019s latest bit of brilliant doodling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/oct/29/david-squires-on-wheres-mesut-ozil-arsenal\">David Squires on \u2026 where's Mesut?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For some reason, the match at Anfield kicks off at <strong>7.30pm GMT</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Bonus J\u00fcrgen Klopp quotes: \u201cI loved it. We could talk about tactics but why on a night like that? What they did tonight, how they played, I loved it. In the end I encouraged them to keep going. With the team we had tonight, having 60% possession is crazy. We made mistakes. It\u2019s not too smart but it can happen. You have to stay brave. It\u2019s like a dream to play the first time at Anfield. You have to stay on track and I really loved it that they wanted it at the end. All the goals they scored were lovely. Arsenal\u2019s goals \u2013 apart from Willock\u2019s \u2013 were a bit scrappy, but who cares? it\u2019s about being a hero on a night like this.\u201d I\u2019m going for a stiff drink now. So I\u2019ll leave you with this match report from Anfield by Any Hunter, who probably needs more than one stiff drinks. Thanks for your emails, tweets and Mizzy Night remembrances. Good night! In the other matches tonight, Aston Villa beat Wolves 2-1. You can read that report here: And Manchester United won 2-1 at Chelsea. Marcus Rashford scored a belter, by all accounts. Rob Smyth is handling the afterparty there: \u201cIs it just me, or does Unai Emery remind anyone of Alan Partridge sporting a Ray Reardon (snooker) haircut?\u201d offers Graham S Timmins. It\u2019s not just you Graham. We\u2019ll have the match report up shortly, by the way. But as you can imagine, it was not an easy game to file on. \u201cHow has Kelleher managed to concede five goals and still come out of the game as a hero?\u201d asks Eoin Jones. Football\u2019s just ridiculous isn\u2019t it? They are just showing a replay of Liverpool\u2019s celebrations after Curtis Jones\u2019s winning penalty. They reacted like they had won the World Cup. And that\u2019s how it should be shouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the best moment in football to date for many of these youngsters and it was lovely to see. Harvey Elliott, who didn\u2019t take a penalty, was down on his knees and fist-pumping, while Jones was involved in a pile-on with his teammates in the corner. We have an answer to more goals in regular time than penalties \u2013 and it\u2019s a match I was at. \u201cIstanbul 2005,\u201d writes Henri du P\u00e9rier. It was 3-2 to Liverpool on penalties, of course. \u201cWe always have special nights at Anfield,\u201d says Divock Origi, whose injury-time volley forced penalties. \u201cWe always keep on going. That\u2019s our mentality. Ox\u2019s goal was amazing but the whole team \u2013 everybody fought. We just maximised.\u201d They certainly did. \u201cWe want to go for every cup. For a lot of guys it was their first game. It\u2019s a game against Arsenal at home. So we want to make a special night.\u201d Yes, they did that. \u201cWhen was the last time there were more goals in the game than in the penalty shootout?\u201d asks Neil Hattersley. I have no idea, Neil, but I feel like Mustafi\u2019s own goal happened three years ago. Even when Arsenal score five goals they don\u2019t win away. Different but same old Arsenal? And even when Liverpool can\u2019t defend, they win games. Same old new Liverpool? Curtis Jones, the scouser, clips his penalty in off the left post and gives Martinez no chance. Liverpool are through to the quarter-finals after a ridiculous match. And what a moment for Jones. Maitland-Niles holds his nerve and scores into the top corner with incredible calm. Origi hammers home into the left corner, sending Martinez the wrong way. Kelleher guesses right and leaps to his right to save Ceballos\u2019s penalty! Brewster holds his nerve and drives it low to Martinez\u2019s right. Martinelli sidefoots to Kelleher\u2019s left. He\u2019s been red-hot tonight. Lallana hammers it into the top corner. Guendouzi sneaks it in the bottom corner. Milner rattles his home low to Martinez\u2019s right. Bellerin finds the top left with ease. Very cool. What a ridiculous game of football, eh? The Kop belts out You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone while the two managers decide who is going to take the spot-kicks. Arsenal will take the first kick and they\u2019ll be down at the Kop end. \u201cYou think this Mizzy Night match is crazy, Gregg, get this: Manchester United have actually scored from the penalty spot in the other game!\u201d Justin Kavanagh brings the giggles. My word! We\u2019re heading to penalties. I need a quick lie down. Wow! Williams lofts a cross in to Origi, who pulls away from his marker and volleys on the turn into the corner of the goal. Oh Arsenal! Oh football! Oh Fizzy Cup, how we love you! 90+3 min: Arsenal look like they might just be able to see this out. 90+1 min: Jones catches Tierney with a forearm after clashing in midfield. The Scottish full-back is made of tough stuff, though, and is soon back up on his feet. \u201cImagine how exciting the Premier League could be if it was under 22\u2019s,\u201d writes David Lwason. Under 22s and rusty old-timers. It\u2019s the future. Or is that what the MLS is? 90 min: There\u2019ll be five minutes of injury time, which is surely enough time for another 12 goals. 88 min: A chance for Liverpool. Brewster mistimes a header after a lovely inswinging cross from Milner from the left. Jones picks up the scraps and lays the ball back to Chirivelli, whose shot is blocked. 87 min: \u201cWhat a strange yet great game. Not strange enough to fully distract from the pitch side ads though,\u201d writes Julian Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see LFC inching back up to that perch, especially as we now have our very own Official Coconut Milk Partner and LFC branded child seats. We envied Man Utd for two decades but isn\u2019t this going a little far?\u201d You don\u2019t win anything without an Official Coconut Milk Partner, Julian. 86 min: Milner hooks the free-kick to the back post but Mutafi clears not once, but twice. Ceballos then has a fine chance to set Willock free but he fails to get any height on his attempted through-ball and Liverpool come back looking for an equaliser that would force penalties. Well, it would if there weren\u2019t any more goals \u2013 and that\u2019s not guaranteed. 84 min: Holding plays a square pass to absolutely no one. Curtis Jones picks it up and springs a Liverpool attack on the left that eventually fizzes out. Then moments later, Saka hauls Brewster down and Liverpool have a free-kick 35 yards out. 82 min: Kolasinac looks to have taken a knock and is replaced by Tierney. Can Arsenal hold on for eight minutes. I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. But I also wouldn\u2019t bet on this Liverpool backline holding out either. What must Virgil van Dijk be thinking watching this? 79 min: Lallana is robbed on the halfway line by Martinelli but Arsenal fail to make the most of a promising situation. Oxlade-Chamberlain has run his course. He\u2019s replaced by Chirivella, who cost Liverpool hard cash by playing in the last round against MK Dons. 78 min: Liverpool are ramping up the pressure here. Elliott finds a load of space on the right (who on earth was marking him?) but his cross is straight at Martinez and a very good chance to find an equaliser goes begging. 76 min: Brewster is cynically taken out by Kolisinac on the halfway line as Liverpool attempted a break. You don\u2019t get all up in Kolasinac\u2019s face though do you? You just don\u2019t. 74 min: Origi finds Oxlade-Chamberlain with a nice dink forwards, but the midfielder\u2019s cross towards Brewster is cleared by Mustafi. Even if Arsenal win here, the backline have done themselves absolutely no favours in trying to force their way bak into the first XI on a regular basis. 73 min: I\u2019ve had a few emails, but they\u2019re already out of date. Meanwhile, Ceballos is on for Torreira. 72 min: There hasn\u2019t been a goal. I\u2019m disappointed. It\u2019s another screamer! Willock picks the ball up just inside the Liverpool half, glides past Lallana and then unleashes a viciously whipped right-footed strike into the top-left corner that Kelleher can get nowhere near. This is ludicrous. Brilliant, but ludicrous. 68 min: \u2026 Milner fizzes it into the near post, but Holding heads clear. Liverpool are cranking up the pressure again, though. 67 min: Kolasinac fails to deal with a cross-field pass to Elliott, who runs on to the botched header and wins a corner. It\u2019s whipped in and cleared behind for another \u2026 66 min: Maitland-Niles races to the byline and cuts a low cross back to Martinelli, who wallops well over. That was a fine chance to complete his hat-trick but he lacked composure. 63 min: Emery has taken Ozil off. That\u2019s odd isn\u2019t it? He needed the minutes and was playing well. He\u2019s replaced by Guendouzi, who will undoubtedly add energy but it feels as though this was a night to get 90 minutes out of Ozil, who would have found more holes in this makeshift Liverpool backline. And here we go again! Jones pops a lovely outside-of-the-foot pass into Origi\u2019s feet on the edge of the box. The striker spins away from Mustafi with a delicious Cruyff turn and hammers a shot at goal that Martinez can only get a few fingers to. The Kop roars behind the goal. Incredible stuff! 60 min: This could be 8-8 by full-time. Every time either side goes forwards they look like scoring. My word! Oxlade-Chamberlain pounces to nick the ball away from Maitland-Niles after some half-hearted attempts at clearances from Arsenal\u2019s defence and absolutely wallops a 25-yarder past Martinelli and into the net. Almost through the net, in fact, it was struck so ferociously. What a match! 57 min: Klopp hooks Keita, who has done very little, for Curtis Jones, a local lad who was man-of-the-match in the last round against MK Dons. Well this is unexpected. The ultra-reliable James Milner is to blame. He plays a short back pass to Kelleher that Maitland-Niles is alert to, getting to the ball ahead of Kelleher and then almost overrunning it past the goal, only for Ozil to keep the ball in play with a delicious flick back to the Arsenal winger who taps home into the open goal. 51 min: Saka blasts over from 25 yards as Arsenal try to get the upper hand early in the second half. Van Den Berg has looked particularly nervy for Liverpool tonight \u2013 and Kelleher has looked a little overawed too. I suppose if Matip were fit Lovren would have played in this. And why Adrian isn\u2019t playing, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s second-choice now isn\u2019t he and surely needs gametime again should Allison pop a hammy? 49 min: Everything about this match is scrappy \u2013 but in a great way way. There are flakes of rust coming off the senior pros and overexuberance from the young whelps. The result is a load of errors which makes it feel like anything could happen. 47 min: Holding makes a hash of dealing with a high ball and flicks a header back towards Mustafi that the Arsenal defender doesn\u2019t expect. Brewster is switched on and runs on to it, shoving off the Gunnrs defender but then getting the ball stuck under his feet. He\u2019s played in again after laying the ball off to Lallana only to sidefoot wide from 12 yards when the angle was never really on. 46 min: It\u2019s not a good start by Liverpool. Kelleher gives Gomez a short pass that he doesn\u2019t really want \u2013 and the Liverpool centre-back hoiks it out of play. 45 min: It\u2019s the second half. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019 as wildly entertaining as the first half was. The players are out for the second half. In the matches elsewhere tonight it is: Aston Villa 1-0 Wolves Chelsea 0-1 Manchester United You can look in on that game with rob Smyth here. \u201cLiverpool\u2019s substitutes\u2019 kit numbers add up to 427. Surely that must be a Carabao Cup record,\u201d writes Ted Lee, in one for the Knowledge. \u201cThough the young Liverpool boys have been punished for passing at all costs it would help them if Naby and Lallana can put their forward striding heads on,\u201d reckons Ian Copestake. \u201cI\u2019m sure Klopp will put them right. The score might end up divisible by nine.\u201d Jamie Carragher has just made a point about Liverpool\u2019s senior players needing to step up. Origi has been particularly poor. \u201cKane on the bench? He hung around after VVD removed him from his pocket on Sunday? I jest. In seriousness, I\u2018m not on board with the idea of not taking the League Cup seriously. For all the brilliant football over the last few years, there haven\u2019t really been any domestic Cup runs from Liverpool. Yes, give youth a chance, and take some of the load off the first team, but go out to win,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cGregg, why isn\u2019t the VAR applied?\u201d asks Jukka It\u00e4kyl\u00e4. \u201cNot that I am missing it, being an Arsenal supporter, you see, but just want to know why.\u201d It\u2019s just not in use at this stage of the League Cup. We should be grateful. We may not have seen two goals but no one can say that the scoreline is not a fair reflection of a rollicking game and we have mercifully been free of lengthy, confusing interruption. It\u2019s like 2017 all over again! That was a crap year but at least VAR didn\u2019t exist in England then. \u201cIn parts of the ol\u2019 US of A we do have \u2018mischief night\u2019,\u201d whoops Matt Turner. \u201cIt\u2019s called Devil\u2019s Night and the people of Detroit especially embrace it. By trying to burn down their own city every year!\u201d I\u2019m making a half-time cuppa. I\u2019ll be back with your emails shortly but in the meantime read this lovely piece about a man who Liverpool could do with tonight, or any night. \u2026 because Origi almost levels the game with a header from eight yards out after Elliott stood up a lovely ball to the forwards after a burst down the left. Peep! And breathe \u2026 45+1 min: \u2026 from which Torreira slams a shot at goal that is blocked. It falls to Martinelli, but he shoulders the ball straight at Kelleher after failing to make contact with his noggin from eight yards out. And we\u2019re not done yet \u2026 45 min: Lallana is caught dawdling on the ball and Arsenal break with Ozil. He slips Martinelli in down the inside-right channel, but the forward\u2019 cross is blocked by Van Den Berg for a corner \u2026 44 min: Arsenal win a free-kick on the edge of the box after Saka, I think, is fouled. Ozil and Torreira stand over it \u2026 and Torreira hammers it over the bar. Ozil should have been on that, surely. The captain hammers it low into the left corner. What a mad game this is shaping up to be. Who needs Mizzy Night for thrills and spills? Martinelli appears to catch Elliott\u2019s toe in the box and Marriner points to the spot. It was minimal contact but it\u2019s been given. 37 min: Liverpool are on the ropes now. Maitland-Niles bangs in a low cross that Van Den Berg scrambles clear. And then moments later, Ozil nutmegs Elliott with an insouciant flick to set Maitland-Niles free down the right again. This time, his cross is cleared with no alarms and no surprises. Oh dear! Liverpool\u2019s inexperienced right-hand side costs them. Williams plays a short pass up to Elliott, who doesn\u2019t look inside as he lays the ball off. Saka nicks it before Gomez can rescue the situation, then races away down the left and squares the ball for an unmarked Martinelli to crash home from 10 yards. 34 min: Milner slips a lovely disguised pass behind the Arsenal defence for Keita, who takes a heavy touch but forces a corner out of Arsenal. Oxlade-Chamberlain is subjected to an earbashing from the away fans as he hooks in a corner to the near post that Arsenal clear. 31 min: Both defences look likely to be breached a few more times before the night is out. They look far from assured. Elliott crosses to Brewster, who does well to flick a header at goal having sneaked between Mustafi and Holding. 29 min: There is no VAR tonight. Had there been, Torreira\u2019s first goal would have been chalked off. A replay shows that Torreira\u2019s heel was offside when Saka shot at goal. Not that anyone should be complaining. It\u2019s a blessed relief not to have the VAR breaking up the lovely ebb and flow of this game. The Gunners are in front! And it\u2019s Martinelli\u2019s sixth goal of the season! Torreira sends a short free-kick out to Maitland-Niles on the right, who sees his first cross blocked by Milner but then picks up possession again and ghosts past Origi far too easily to drill a low cross at the near post. Van Den Berg makes a block and then Martinelli smashes the ball high into the roof of the net from a yard out. 23 min: \u201cGiven it\u2019s Mizzy Night with all that egg and flour around, let\u2019s \u2018ope Arsenal don\u2019t get battered,\u201d honks Chris Brock. It\u2019s not happening at the moment, Chris. This is shaping up to be a ding-dong battle between reserves. 21 min: \u2026 but Liverpool win back possession after Ozil\u2019s attempt to split the Liverpool defence with a reverse pass is cut out. The German playmaker is finding a few more pockets of space now and dragging Liverpool out of shape. 20 min: In a surefire sign that this game is going to be a lot of fun, Liverpool race straight back up the other end, where Origi pops a clever pass inside Maitland-Niles towards Brewster who just needs to stick his toe out a few more inches to get a free shot on goal from wight yards. Arsenal break \u2026 Arsenal are level! It came after Martinelli battled gamely down the left and squared to Saka, who forced a smart save out of Kelleher, but from the rebound Torreira tapped home. Liverpool\u2019s defenders appeal for offside but he was just level. Game on! 15 min: It appears I\u2019ve been up to mischief with my Mizzy Night missive. \u201cOh Gregg... you trample on Yorkshire culture,\u201d sighs Rebecca Smith. \u201cMischief night is the 4 November! Celebrated for when Guy Fawkes (one of Yorkshire\u2019s own) and crew were plotting their mischief for parliament. I have fond memories of putting black treacle on doorknobs in Leeds in the late \u201870s. I have never commented on the live blog before, but couldn\u2019t let this pass.\u201d Fair enough Rebecca. So Yorkshire is right and everywhere else is wrong or just importing American culture? Maitland-Niles has just zipped a cross into the near-post that cause mild panic in the Liverpool ranks but Van Den Berg cleared eventually. 13 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain pings a lovely cross-field pass to Origi, on the left. The forward takes a touch, and lofts a neat ball to the back post, that Arsenal defend well. 12 min: Bellerin has had a few decent bursts down the right hand-side for Arsenal, where Maitland-Niles also looks determined to make a point but Milner will be a tough opponent to get past on that side, assisted by Keita. It may be on the left, where Saka is up against Williams, where Arsenal might find some joy. 9 min: Liverpool are enjoying the better of the possession and continue to look the sharper side. Lallana scoops a lovely ball over the Arsenal defence that Oxlade-Chamberlain fails to control when he had only the keeper to beat. 7 min: If you\u2019re looking for mitigating circumstances, I suppose you could say that Brewster was lurking behind Mustafi, but it was a clumsy attempt to clear with his right foot, a kick and a miss that meant the ball clattered his left knee and went in at Martinez\u2019s near post. Oh Arsenal! Williams plays a simple ball down the line to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who plays a low cross to the near-post that Mustafi puts into his own net. He slid in and lost all control when he could have stayed on his feet. 4 min: Keita does a double-stepover and pops the ball off to Origi inside him. The striker finds Elliott outside him. Elliott cuts inside and spots the top corner, but his curled effort is well over. Youthful exuberance? Worth a pop though. 3min: Origi stretches his legs down the left but Maitland-Niles sticks gamely to his task and does well to nick the ball off the Liverpool forward and clear up field. Maitland-Niles had a nightmare in the Europa League recently and was hauled off at half-time against Vitoria. Howe he could do with a good game to get it out of his system. 1 min: We\u2019re under way. Liverpool haven\u2019t won a home League Cup tie since Ben Woodburn became Liverpool\u2019s youngest ever scorer in the 2-0 win over Leeds in November 2016. Harvey Elliott will be hoping to break that record tonight. Is that You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone I can hear? I think it is, which means that the teams are out on the Anfield turf on a chilly evening on Merseyside. Meanwhile, Ian Copestake isn\u2019t at the match tonight \u2013 and he should be. Blame the trains! \u201cThere may be some gaps at Anfield (in the crowd, I mean) as most trains to Liverpool (including the one I was meant to be on) were cancelled. Like the two teams I should have taken a coach!\u201d Ah well, stick with me Ian. I\u2019ll do my best. or go the pub. Yeah, go the pub. And there\u2019s more pre-match chat: \u201cThere are some really unsavory (or, if you insist, unsavoury) elements associated with big time professional football, from greed to racism to corruption, it\u2019s enough to make me feel quite depressed on occasion,\u201d writes JR in Illinois. \u201cI can\u2019t stop following football of course because if I did that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get all the references in David Squires\u2019 cartoons.\u201d Spare a thought for me JR \u2013 I\u2019m often the sorry fella who has to try to explain his references to the Guardian\u2019s lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s Mizzy Night in Liverpool? Granit Xhaka must be kicking himself,\u201d honks Peter Oh. Ian Copestake responds to Brand Dwonch: \u201cLiverpool conquered England a long time ago. They got their very own perch out of it.\u201d Unai Emery has just spoken on Sky. He didn\u2019t say much of note because he never really does. He swerved a question about Granit Xhaka and just said his team is focused on this game because the League is a good competition. J\u00fcrgen Klopp also spoke and confirmed that he took the decision long ago that he would make wholesale changes for the League Cup to rest his regulars. \u201cWe have to show them our faith,\u201d he said. He also said that 18-year-old Neco Williams has been handed his debut because in the past four weeks he has really impressed him. You may or may not know, but it\u2019s \u201cMizzy Night\u201d (Mischief Night) in Liverpool this evening, which is generally a big excuse for wild kids to cause chaos with eggs, flour, or whatever else they can get their hands on. There\u2019ll be a few fans with stained coats in Anfield tonight. It\u2019s like Halloween, without the innocent fun \u2013 all trick and no treat. I believe Mischief Night is also \u201ccelebrated\u201d in other parts of the north of England under different names and in the United States. If you do get egged or have a close escape tonight, be sure to let me know. I won\u2019t laugh. I promise. \u201cHave to say, I think Liverpool would be wise to sack this cup off,\u201d writes Andrew Tuohy. \u201cEspecially,with the pointless World Club Championship coming up to put further strain on their scheduling. Worked last season losing to Wolves. See no reason not to repeat the same tactic.\u201d I think Wolves was the FA Cup Andrew, but I take your point. I do think that providing Klopp plays a load of youngsters, he\u2019s not adversely affecting his first XI, though it might upset the rhythm in training a little. \u201cAlthough the presence of the likes of Milner gives a seasoned touch to the Liverpool starting XI, thanks to the inclusion of Brewster and mates, it\u2019s definitely a punky selection,\u201d whoops Peter Oh. \u201cEven with Liverpool\u2019s other commitments this season, Klopp has to be focused on silverware,\u201d reasons Brandon Dwonch. \u201cKlopp and Liverpool are in a window to dominate Europe but they first have to conquer England. Klopp will start youngsters but if they go down he will bring in the big guns.\u201d That bench isn\u2019t exactly stacked with \u201cbig guns\u201d Brandon, unless you have a very high opinion of Curtis Jones. Liverpool\u2019s captain for the night, James Milner, was speaking to our very own Donald McRae this week. Turns out, like most football fans everywhere, he\u2019s not a fan of VAR. So, J\u00fcrgen Klopp makes 11 changes from the win over Spurs on Sunday, including four teenagers with 18-year-old Neco Williams making his first-team debut. Among the other young whelps, Harvey Elliott, at 16 years and 209 days, will become the youngest player to appear for the club at Anfield, while Rhian Brewster and Sepp Van Den Berg make their Anfield debuts too. Joe Gomez, James Milner and midfielders Adam Lallana, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain add a bit of experience. For Arsenal, Mesut \u00d6zil makes only his third appearance of the season - and his first since 24 September. He\u2019s not been seen in a matchday squad since his outing in the last round against Nottingham Forest but is one of 11 changes. Unai Emery has selected six players \u2013 excluding \u00d6zil \u2013 who could be considered first-team regulars, including Lucas Torreira, Sead Kolasinac and Ainsley Maitland-Niles. And it\u2019s Hector Bellerin, not \u00d6zil (as had been rumoured), who captains the side. Well, someone\u2019s got to. Liverpool: Kelleher, Williams, Gomez. Van Den Berg, Milner, lallana, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Elliott, Origi, Brewster. Subs: Adrian, Jones, Kane, Larouci, Chirivella, Clarkson, Koumetio. Arsenal: Mart\u00ednez, Bellerin, Holding, Mustafi, Kolasinac, Torreira, Willock, Maitland-Niles, \u00d6zil, Saka, Martinelli. Subs: Macey, Sokratis, Tierney, Guendouzi, Ceballos, Pepe, Lacazette. Referee: Andre Marriner. Evening. It\u2019s cards-on-the-table time \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict what might happen at Anfield this evening. That\u2019s not a bad thing, because so much of modern football is too easy to predict. We can expect two vastly changed teams, with Liverpool perhaps more likely to field the most inexperienced XI, given their commitments in the Premier League and Europe, not to mention the Club World Cup in December. As for Unai Emery, the pressure is on at Arsenal, and even though he will not want to field a full-strength team, he might be minded to name a reasonably strong side to get a win on the board and keep open the prospect of some silverware down the line. With the beef between Granit Xhaka and Arsenal fans dominating headlines in the buildup to this game, Emery is acutely aware that Arsenal\u2019s season is already shaping up to be a turbulent one. Emery needs a response from his Arsenal team after the draw at home against Crystal Palace, even if the XI players who provide it are not regulars. As for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, as much as this competition is probably the lowest on his list of priorities this season, it still offers him the chance to give fringe Liverpool players a run out and give him an idea who might be first in line to come in when he has to rotate over the busy festive period. One person we should see this evening, is Mesut \u00d6zil, who is expected to captain Arsenal while Xhaka continues to let off steam. While we wait for team news, see if you can spot him in David Squires\u2019s latest bit of brilliant doodling. For some reason, the match at Anfield kicks off at 7.30pm GMT. Well, it is a school night and I\u2019m not complaining.",

      "bodyText": "Jacob Steinberg has filed his match report from the Bridge, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. The draw is tomorrow morning, since you asked. Goodnight! Aston Villa complete the quarter-final line up - they beat Wolves 2-1 at Villa Park. There were ten goals in the match between Liverpool and Arsenal, and nine more in the penalty shoot-out. Marcus Rashford scored both goals, the second a booming free-kick from 35 yards that might not be bettered all season. It was a pretty even game, but United picked more of their first-choice players and that was ultimately decisive. Peep peep! Manchester United win their third away game in a week, and move into the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. 90+4 min And they don\u2019t take it. 90+4 min James wins a corner for Chelsea. This is their last chance... 90+3 min Jorginho waves a passing elbow into the face of Young. I don\u2019t think the referee saw it and there\u2019s no VAR. It was nothing really. 90+2 min Abraham fouls Rojo, who takes the opportunity to waste 30 seconds. 90 min An imaginative long-range curler from Martial goes just wide. Then Kovacic is booked for clattering Williams. There will be four minutes of added time. 89 min Chelsea were brilliant for the first 20 minutes of the second half before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made an important change from 3-4-2-1 to 4-2-3-1. Since then, United have been relatively comfortable. 88 min Zouma charges forward with intent before shooting from 40 yards. He falls over and it goes about 40 yards wide. 86 min McTominay, who has made umpteen important tackles and interceptions tonight, makes another from Jorginho\u2019s pass. 84 min Phil Fred is booked for timewasting. 83 min Harry Maguire is moving gingerly. United have used all their subs so they can\u2019t replace him. 82 min Alonso\u2019s shot from a tight angle is shovelled behind by Romero. The corner is headed across goal and wide by Zouma, who was under enough pressure from Maguire that he couldn\u2019t make proper contact with the header. 81 min Ashley Young\u2019s first contribution is to boot Reece James up in the air. We\u2019ll miss him when he retires. 80 min Marcus Rashford limps off to be replaced by Ashley Young. It doesn\u2019t look too serious, although I\u2019m no Doogie Howser MD. 78 min Tammy Abraham replaces Michy Batshuayi, who scored an excellent equaliser for Chelsea. 77 min McTominay, who was booked in the first half, is penalised for pulling down Kovacic. Some referees would have shown him a second yellow card, but Paul Tierney settled for a final warning. 76 min Williams makes a terrific challenge in the area on Reece James. After a difficult start, he has been excellent at times in the second half. That is a stunning goal. Rashford hammered the free-kick over the wall, and the ball wobbled extravagantly before flying past Caballero. That must have been at least 35 yards out. He hit it with the old Juninho Pernambucano technique, striking through the valve, and it roared into the top corner. And by heck did he hit it! 73 min Fred is fouled 35 yards from goal by Pedro. Rashford is going to hit this... 72 min It\u2019s worth repeating that this will go straight to penalties if it\u2019s a draw. No extra-time. Nope. 71 min Batshuayi threatens to repeat his goal, surging at the last man Rojo only to slip over just outside the area. 71 min A double change: Pedro and Mason Mount replace Billy Gilbert and Christian Pulisic. Gilbert was tidy, Pulisic was thoroughly Wan-Bissakaed. 70 min Chelsea look the likelier winners, although there isn\u2019t a huge amount in it. Fred leathers a cross shot that flashes past the far post. Caballero had it covered. 69 min Zouma shanks a clearance behind for a corner. That\u2019s a safe option against Manchester United these days, and the corner is another poor one. 68 min \u201cBack to the good old days before VAR,\u201d says Harry Hutton, \u201cwhen a goal was a goal.\u201d 67 min Another change: Andreas Pereira replaces Jesse Lingard, who again did very little. He has gone to seed since the World Cup. 66 min A Manchester United change: Anthony Martial replaces Victor Lindelof, which suggests a switch from 3-4-2-1 to 4-2-3-1. 65 min Reece James wins a corner for Chelsea. He and Hudson-Odoi are giving Williams a pretty torrid evening, with two-on-one attacks all the time. What a brilliant goal. Batshuayi picked up a loose ball near the halfway line, after a mix-up between Maguire and Lindelof I think, and set off towards goal. There were five United defenders on his tail, with no team-mates within 40 yards. He kept running to the edge of the D, shifted the ball to the right and smacked a low curling shot that flashed past Romero. Michy Batshuayi hits a storming equaliser! 60 min United are struggling to get out. Hudson-Odoi tries to run Williams, who makes a fine tackle with his wrong right foot. 59 min \u201cI\u2019m not being hipsterish clever, honest, but this is a far more fascinating game than the other because of the place the two teams have in the Scheme of Things right now,\u201d says Drew Goldie. \u201cNo-one doubts that Arsenal can do what they\u2019re doing on occasions, but there\u2019s a cluelessness about the club at the moment. Chelsea and the other mob are quite interesting in what the strategy is, because both need one. I\u2019m speaking as someone who supports Hearts and Millwall, by the way, so I\u2019m just diverting my sorrows by trying to sound informed about the Big Pots like a lot of people who stands in pubs do.\u201d 57 min Another chance for Chelsea. Hudson-Odoi runs onto a long pass from the back, waits for it to drop and leathers a shot just over the bar from 20 yards. 56 min United\u2019s back three, who were cruising in the first half, are now defending on the seat of their pants. It\u2019s been a stirring response from Chelsea. 54 min A superb cross from Reece James flashes right across the six-yard box. If only England had some decent young right-backs, eh. 53 min Pulisic drags a speculative cross-shot wide from 15 yards, but this is so much better from Chelsea. It feels like a cup tie now. 52 min Chelsea appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Gilmour\u2019s shot is blocked by Rojo. It may have hit Rojo\u2019s hand as he fell onto the ball, though that isn\u2019t a penalty under the new laws anyway. 52 min Chelsea have upped the tempo since half-time, with and without the ball. They were a little passive in the first half. 50 min Hudson-Odoi misses an excellent chance, screwing Alonso\u2019s low cross wide of the far post after a fine passing move. He mistimed the shot completely, although he might have been unsighted. 49 min Hudson-Odoi is back on the field. 47 min Hudson-Odoi is receiving treatment off the field. He was thrown over the advertising boards by Williams, who might have been booked. 47 min There\u2019s been a ninth goal at Anfield. Nine times! 46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half. No substitutions yet. Peep peep! Manchester United lead through Marcus Rashford\u2019s penalty. It was an uneventful half, with just one shot on target apart from the goal, and you\u2019re still reading the wrong live blog. 43 min Chelsea haven\u2019t had a shot on target yet. They have plenty of attacking options on the bench though, including Mason Mount, Pedro, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud. 41 min Nothing much happening at Stamford Bridge, so here\u2019s some association football porn. 39 min I hope you realise you\u2019re reading the wrong MBM. Mesut Ozil has just done something pretty special in that game. 38 min Hudson-Odoi waves a good pass down the line to James, whose dangerous low cross is cleared decisively by Wan-Bissaka. 37 min Lingard curls straight at Caballero from 20 yards. 35 min Chelsea have had better possession in the last few minutes, although it has mainly been in front of the United defence. Most of their good work has been done down the right. On the other side, Wan-Bissaka has given Pulisic nothing thus far. 32 min Phil Fred is penalised for manhandling Gilmour, who looks very comfortable receiving the ball in tight spaces. He hasn\u2019t done anything spectacular, but you can see what the fuss is about. 30 min United have been dominant in the last 10 minutes, with their back three looking increasingly secure. 27 min It wasn\u2019t a stonewall penalty, but I do think it was a foul. Alonso challenged James from the wrong side and made sufficient contact with his knee to knock him off balance. Alonso was trying to make up for his earlier mistake, when his poor pass allowed United to counter-attack. 26 min That\u2019s Rashford\u2019s third goal against Chelsea this season, two of them from the penalty spot. Marcus Rashford has missed two penalties this season - but he scores this time, crashing the ball low to the left. Caballero went the wrong way. PENALTY TO MANCHESTER UNITED! It was a brainless challenge by Alonso on James. 22 min Hudson-Odoi runs 40 yards down the right before being fouled by Phil Fred. He looks Chelsea\u2019s biggest threat at the moment, especially as United\u2019s left-back Brandon Williams has been a bit jittery in the first 20 minutes. 21 min I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s not a classic. 20 min There\u2019s no extra-time tonight. If this match ends in a draw, it goes straight to penalties. 18 min Batshuayi is booked for a late tackle on McTominay. 16 min United are, in the parlanace of our time, growing into the game. They haven\u2019t been as snappy in possession as Chelsea, but Rashford and James are an obvious threat on the break. 15 min A loose clearance from Zouma falls kindly for James, whose snapshot bobbles miles wide. 13 min McTominay almost gives United the lead. It was a good, training-round corner, with James cutting the ball back for McTominay to run into space and spank a first-time shot just wide of the near post. 13 min Wan-Bissaka finds Lingard in space down the right, and his cross deflects off Guehi for a corner. 11 min McTominay is booked for an inept lunge at Kovacic. 10 min The game is being played at good pace, with Chelsea looking very assured in possession. 7 min Lingard goes down just outside the area after a challenge from Kovacic. I\u2019m not sure whether it was a slip or a foul. The referee Paul Tierney judged that it was the former, and replays show he was right. 5 min After a patient move of at least 20 passes, Pulisic\u2019s snapshot is blocked by Lindelof. Chelsea have started very well. 4 min Chelsea have had most of the ball in the first few minutes. Pulisic looks very lively, as you\u2019d expect of someone who had a day out at the weekend. 2 min Jonathan McKenzie points out that both XIs have the same average age, to be said in a Tony Soprano voice: 24. 1 min Peep peep! Manchester United, in red, kick off from left to right. Chelsea are in blue. \u201cCannot wait to see whether Billy Gilmour can cut it against an (albeit mid-table) Premier League team,\u201d says Matt Baxter. \u201cHe was incredible vs Grimsby. The future\u2019s bright, the future\u2019s Blue!\u201d And he\u2019s Scottish. They are in serious danger of having a decent team in the next few years. This game kicks off at 8.05pm. The match between Liverpool and Arsenal started at 7.30pm; if you don\u2019t want to know the score, don\u2019t click this. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cGregg has the current Big Cup holders on his MBM, and Guest appearances from both Donald McRae and David Squires. I think you need to make your readers an offer they can\u2019t refuse. Cute cat video, perhaps?\u201d I\u2019m offering Phil Fred, mate. I think I know who\u2019s winning. The Sky Sports team graphics suggest an unexpected midfield battle tonight: Marcus Jorginho against Phil Fred. Seriously. Phil Fred! So much for giving old age a chance. Both have picked strong, young sides, with United close to full strength. Chelsea (4-3-3) Caballero; James, Guehi, Zouma, Alonso; Gilmour, Jorginho, Kovacic; Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi, Pulisic. Substitutes: Cumming, Lamptey, Azpilicueta, Mount, Pedro, Giroud, Abraham. Manchester United (3-4-1-2) Romero; Lindelof, Maguire, Rojo; Wan-Bissaka, Fred, McTominay, Williams; Lingard; James, Rashford. Substitutes: Grant, Jones, Young, Pereira, Garner, Mata, Martial. Referee Paul Tierney. Ambassador... department We have two MBMs tonight, such is our commitment to the Carabao Cup. If you\u2019d rather follow Liverpool v Arsenal, Gregg Bakowski is your man.

This wasn\u2019t a show trial\u2019</h2> <p>When I saw the video of people chanting \u201clock him up\u201d at the World Series I thought: ha. And then I moved on with my life. Sadly, others did not. Despite the fact America is supposed to be a democracy where free speech is sacrosanct, the incident sparked pearl-clutching among pundits and politicians who seem to think chanting represents a dire threat to the very soul of America. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBerman/status/1188790689645109250?s=20\">The Democratic </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBerman/status/1188790689645109250?s=20\">senator Chris Coons</a>, for example, said it reminded him \u201cof things that happen in countries where rule of law is unknown or unestablished\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/30/unravelling-rudolph-giulianis-labyrinthine-ties-to-ukraine\">Unravelling Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s labyrinthine ties to Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s get a grip, shall we? This wasn\u2019t a show trial. It wasn\u2019t an AR-15-wielding mob. It wasn\u2019t a threat to due process. It was a group of people spontaneously expressing frustration that the president of America hasn\u2019t been held properly accountable for any of the many crimes he has been accused of \u2013 from sexual assault to election-meddling \u2013 and openly boasts about being above the law. Only a few days earlier one of Trump\u2019s lawyers argued he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/donald-trump-immune-shoot-fifth-avenue-murder\">could not be investigated by local authorities</a> in office even if he murdered someone on Fifth Avenue. You know what reminds me of countries where the rule of law is unknown? A head of state who thinks he has carte blanche. Not a few chants.</p> <p>But what about all the \u201clock her up\u201d chants? some people have argued. You hypocritical libs were outraged about that. On Monday, for example, NBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/1188817084500926465?s=20\">snarkily tweeted</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this straight. When crowds chant \u2018Lock her up\u2019 toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American. (I agree). But when crowds chant the same toward Trump, it is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred first amendment rights.\u201d</p> <p>No, Joe, you haven\u2019t got it straight. There is a big difference between people in a baseball stadium spontaneously chanting and politicians stirring crowds at rallies up into a frenzy of rage over unfounded accusations. Had Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton been encouraging the stadium to protest you might have a point. But unless there\u2019s some secret Clinton plot I don\u2019t know about that wasn\u2019t the case.</p> <p>As for all the people complaining about how this is yet another example of the erosion of civility in America: please get your effing priorities right.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lloyd-green\">Lloyd Green</a>: \u2018Lock him up\u2019 is a demand for mob justice</h2> <p>On Sunday night, Donald Trump received a dose of his own medicine. After being introduced at game three of baseball\u2019s World Series, the crowd booed the president, and then launched into a chant of \u201clock him up\u201d.</p> <p>With Melania by his side, Trump finally heard first-hand what much of blue America thought of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/how-donald-trump-became-the-short-fingered-vulgarian\">vulgarian-in-chief</a>. Make no mistake, Trump had definitely earned the fans\u2019 disgust and ire. Turnabout is fair play, to a point.</p> <p>During Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump had fanned the flames of birtherism.

      "bodyText": "Arwa Mahdawi: \u2018Let\u2019s get a grip, shall we? This wasn\u2019t a show trial\u2019 When I saw the video of people chanting \u201clock him up\u201d at the World Series I thought: ha. And then I moved on with my life. Sadly, others did not. Despite the fact America is supposed to be a democracy where free speech is sacrosanct, the incident sparked pearl-clutching among pundits and politicians who seem to think chanting represents a dire threat to the very soul of America. The Democratic senator Chris Coons, for example, said it reminded him \u201cof things that happen in countries where rule of law is unknown or unestablished\u201d. Let\u2019s get a grip, shall we? This wasn\u2019t a show trial. It wasn\u2019t an AR-15-wielding mob. It wasn\u2019t a threat to due process. It was a group of people spontaneously expressing frustration that the president of America hasn\u2019t been held properly accountable for any of the many crimes he has been accused of \u2013 from sexual assault to election-meddling \u2013 and openly boasts about being above the law. Only a few days earlier one of Trump\u2019s lawyers argued he could not be investigated by local authorities in office even if he murdered someone on Fifth Avenue. You know what reminds me of countries where the rule of law is unknown? A head of state who thinks he has carte blanche. Not a few chants. But what about all the \u201clock her up\u201d chants? some people have argued. You hypocritical libs were outraged about that. On Monday, for example, NBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough snarkily tweeted: \u201cLet\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this straight. When crowds chant \u2018Lock her up\u2019 toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American. (I agree). But when crowds chant the same toward Trump, it is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred first amendment rights.\u201d No, Joe, you haven\u2019t got it straight. There is a big difference between people in a baseball stadium spontaneously chanting and politicians stirring crowds at rallies up into a frenzy of rage over unfounded accusations. Had Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton been encouraging the stadium to protest you might have a point. But unless there\u2019s some secret Clinton plot I don\u2019t know about that wasn\u2019t the case. As for all the people complaining about how this is yet another example of the erosion of civility in America: please get your effing priorities right. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Lloyd Green: \u2018Lock him up\u2019 is a demand for mob justice On Sunday night, Donald Trump received a dose of his own medicine. After being introduced at game three of baseball\u2019s World Series, the crowd booed the president, and then launched into a chant of \u201clock him up\u201d. With Melania by his side, Trump finally heard first-hand what much of blue America thought of the vulgarian-in-chief. Make no mistake, Trump had definitely earned the fans\u2019 disgust and ire. Turnabout is fair play, to a point. During Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump had fanned the flames of birtherism. On the 2016 campaign trail, Trump had mocked a reporter for being disabled, trashed a federal judge for being Latino, and repeatedly delivered a verbal beatdown to the now late senator John McCain for having been a prisoner of war. Grace was never part of Trump\u2019s vocabulary or mien. But most memorably, it was Trump who would lead his minions in the cry of \u201clock her up\u201d \u2013 even after he was ensconced in the Oval Office. The past was never past. Due process was for his supporters, not his political opponents. Indeed, Trump saw them as his enemies. The bile that Trump vented on stage was no act but rather the core of his DNA. And yet that can only be part of the story. Although Trump has debased the presidency as he conflated the office with himself, his opponents \u2013 of which there are many and whose disdain in more than justified \u2013 need to think long and hard about echoing the very line that had rendered Trump unfit to hold and keep his current job. \u201cLock him up\u201d is more than a sentiment. Rather, it is a demand for mob justice, one at odds with the rule of law, qualitatively different from simply voicing disapproval. To be sure, politicians get booed at ballgames. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Harry Truman were on the receiving end in their day. By contrast, a demand for instant imprisonment of our government officials is not what democracies are about. We remain defined by our processes despite their seeming inconvenience. This coming Thursday, the House of Representatives will take up a resolution to guide its impeachment investigation, a process a federal judge last Friday found to be constitutionally valid and legally compliant. \u201cLock him up\u201d got Trump\u2019s attention. But it\u2019s no substitute for the work that remains to be done.

Often people will get something off their chest if they are thinking about the game and then he says his bit and without fail you could hear a pin drop. \u201cAs a leader I can\u2019t speak highly enough of him. He is the sort of person you want to follow. He leads from the front but at the same time you know for a fact the messages he is giving you he has been thinking over and over again. He is very good at delivering a theme and messages that build up nicely throughout the week. \u201cOwen talks a lot about how the buildup starts through the week but it also starts from the minute you wake up on the Saturday \u2013 the image you give off to the people around you, even in the way you walk to breakfast. You are always constantly giving off a message to other people about your mindset and how you are feeling.\u201d",

With no back-up any malfunction could trigger the plane into a dive \u2013 as investigators believe happened with both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes, killing 346.</p> <p>The release of the document, in addition to warnings from Boeing\u2019s chief test pilot that the MCAS system could engage without warning, adds to belief that Boeing overlooked safety in a rush to put the Max 737, its most profitable model, into production.</p> <p>The new email is among others unearthed during withering transportation committee hearings during which lawmakers have repeatedly assailed Boeing\u2019s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, over a failure to prioritize safety.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a systemic problem in your company.

You\u2019re not driving quality, and you\u2019re sure as heck not driving safety,\u201d the California Democrat John Garamendi told the chief executive.</p> <p>In another memo, a veteran Boeing production manager warned the company was placing the workforce under too much strain in its rush to speed up production of the jet.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly right now, my internal warning bells are going off,\u201d the manager wrote in the email, which was sent four months before the Indonesia crash. \u201cAnd for the first time in my life, I\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019m hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane.\u201d</p> <p>The email, which was sent to the general manager of the Max program, warned that workers on the Max assembly line were exhausted by the schedule and there should be a temporary halt.</p> <p>\u201cI know this would take a lot of planning, but the alternative of rushing the build is far riskier,\u201d the manager wrote.</p> <p>At the hearing, Muilenburg confirmed the note\u2019s author had copied the warning to him, and he had answered them. However, Boeing did not slow its rate of production.</p> <p>Peter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the committee, told the hearing the manager had resigned his job at Boeing \u201cbecause his concerns weren\u2019t being addressed\u201d.</p> <p>He accused Boeing of a \u201clack of candor\u201d over the crashes, after John Hamilton, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer, testified that the company had identified MCAS as the probable cause within days of the first crash and begun to work on a fix.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a second day of congressional hearings into Boeing\u2019s handling of its ill-fated 737 Max plane, lawmakers were shown internal records revealing that three years before two fatal crashes one employee had expressed concern that an anti-stall flight system at the center of crash investigations could be triggered by a single sensor. \u201cAre we vulnerable to single [angle-of-attack] failures with [the system\u2019s] implementation or is there some checking that occurs?\u201d a Boeing employee asked in an email from December 2015, nearly three years before the first Max 737 crash in Indonesia almost exactly a year ago. The employee, who has not been identified, was referring to a sensor on the outside of the plane that measured its angle in flight and could trigger a system, known as MCAS, to push it down if it thought the aircraft was at risk of stalling. Relying on a single sensor, aviation experts say, is fundamentally dangerous. With no back-up any malfunction could trigger the plane into a dive \u2013 as investigators believe happened with both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes, killing 346. The release of the document, in addition to warnings from Boeing\u2019s chief test pilot that the MCAS system could engage without warning, adds to belief that Boeing overlooked safety in a rush to put the Max 737, its most profitable model, into production. The new email is among others unearthed during withering transportation committee hearings during which lawmakers have repeatedly assailed Boeing\u2019s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, over a failure to prioritize safety. \u201cYou have a systemic problem in your company. You\u2019re driving profit. You\u2019re not driving quality, and you\u2019re sure as heck not driving safety,\u201d the California Democrat John Garamendi told the chief executive. In another memo, a veteran Boeing production manager warned the company was placing the workforce under too much strain in its rush to speed up production of the jet. \u201cFrankly right now, my internal warning bells are going off,\u201d the manager wrote in the email, which was sent four months before the Indonesia crash. \u201cAnd for the first time in my life, I\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019m hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane.\u201d The email, which was sent to the general manager of the Max program, warned that workers on the Max assembly line were exhausted by the schedule and there should be a temporary halt. \u201cI know this would take a lot of planning, but the alternative of rushing the build is far riskier,\u201d the manager wrote. At the hearing, Muilenburg confirmed the note\u2019s author had copied the warning to him, and he had answered them. However, Boeing did not slow its rate of production. Peter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the committee, told the hearing the manager had resigned his job at Boeing \u201cbecause his concerns weren\u2019t being addressed\u201d. He accused Boeing of a \u201clack of candor\u201d over the crashes, after John Hamilton, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer, testified that the company had identified MCAS as the probable cause within days of the first crash and begun to work on a fix.",

Instead, the call triggered a fresh onslaught in the northern city of Culiac\u00e1n as the Sinaloa cartel mounted a terrifying show of strength that eventually prompted the outnumbered soldiers to free the capo\u2019s son in exchange for their lives. The video of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\u2019s call was released on Wednesday as part of an extraordinary government report revealing just how badly things went wrong in the failed operation on 17 October. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador insisted the report would rebut the arguments of critics who say the disastrous operation has made his government appear weak and have called on him to reconsider his commitment to a non-confrontational \u201chugs not bullets\u201d security strategy. \u201cWe want everything to be known. That\u2019s how we demonstrate the responsibility of the actions taken in a complex, difficult and very serious situation,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we demonstrate that the most important thing is to protect citizens, to protect life.\u201d The defence secretary, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, described Ovidio, 29, as \u201cone of the main traffickers\u201d of methamphetamines and fentanyl into the United States, and said the aborted operation stemmed from an arrest warrant with a view to extradition issued on 13 September. The general said a special unit within the security forces was dispatched to Culiac\u00e1n on 9 October with an arrest plan that involved the establishment of an inner and outer security cordon as soon as intelligence confirmed that Ovidio was at a house in the centre of the city. Things began to fall apart, however, when attacks by gunmen prevented soldiers and members of the national guard from reaching their positions on the outer cordon. Pressure increased, he said, when gunmen attacked blocks of flats occupied by the families of military personnel and took an officer and nine soldiers hostage. Critics have argued that the authorities should have sent a larger force for the operation. But Sandoval emphasized the gunmens\u2019 military-grade arsenal, which included armoured vehicles, .50-calibre machine guns, and rocket launchers that hit a helicopter, and argued that to defeat the cartel force, the army would have had to use even superior firepower \u2013 which would have inevitably put civilians at risk. The government says eight people died during the operation, though local media has put the death toll at 13. As fighting raged across the city, it appears that the younger Guzm\u00e1n never left the house were he was detained. Video shot at the property shows him passing a handgun to an associate before emerging into a garage, fiddling with a black baseball cap before soldiers back him against the wall. With intense gunfire in the background, a soldier shouts at him: \u201cTell your people to stop this!\u201d after which he is seen holding a mobile phone. \u201cCall it off, please, I\u2019ve given myself up,\u201d he is heard saying. \u201cNow stop it, calm down, there\u2019s nothing to be done \u2026 Tell them to pull back, I don\u2019t want this,\u201d he continues. But the attacks continued and four hours after the operation began, officials in Mexico City ordered security forces to withdraw.

Corral and Ludmila \u2013 so direct, so fast, so hard to contain \u2013 set up Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s second. Ellie Roebuck had to save at the near post after Charlyn Corral\u2019s sprint up the left. Duggan and Sosa sent Ludmila away, only for her to be dragged down by Megan Campbell. Carmen Menayo hit wide. And then off went Corral again, streaking into the area. Roebuck saved, twice, at the near post but the ball deflected to Sosa, who scored from close range. A long looping header that could have been the first of the two goals City now needed thudded back off the bar. When they finally did score, it came from a long throw, turned in by Bremer. Atl\u00e9tico, so comfortable a few minutes before, appeared scared. Another long throw almost led to an equaliser and City\u2019s passage to the quarter-finals but it was the Spanish side who progressed.",

      "bodyText": "The White House blocked the US state department from issuing a statement condemning Russia for seizing Ukrainian military vessels, according to a state department official, in the latest example of the strain the Trump administration is under in pursuing conflicting policies towards the two countries. The revelation on Wednesday came from Christopher Anderson, who was a senior aide to the special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, in November 2018, when Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian vessels in the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula. \u201cWhile my colleagues at the state department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,\u201d Anderson said in his prepared remarks to congressional committees holding impeachment hearings. \u201cAmbassador Volker drafted a tweet condemning Russia\u2019s actions, which I posted to his account.\u201d In the face of silence from the White House, the then US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, condemned Russian behaviour, after which the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, followed suit. Trump voiced concern but did not blame Moscow. The 24 Ukrainian sailors detained in the operation were returned last month as part of a prisoner exchange. Anderson, and his successor in the Ukraine job, Catherine Croft, both testified to House committees on Wednesday about the role played by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in foiling state department efforts to bolster the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in the face of Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. In his testimony, Anderson quoted the former national security adviser, John Bolton, as saying: \u201cGiuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.\u201d On Wednesday, the House committees asked Bolton to testify on 7 November, but it is unclear whether he will attend. Bolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, is currently seeking a court ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena in the face of a White House order not to testify. At the other side of Congress, the nominee to become ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, faced pointed questions on Wednesday at confirmation hearings in the Senate about Giuliani and the split US policy towards Russia and Ukraine. Sullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, said he was aware of Giuliani\u2019s role in a campaign against the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Asked if he knew Trump\u2019s lawyer was \u201cseeking to smear\u201d Yovanovitch, he replied: \u201cI believe he was, yes.\u201d Sullivan confirmed he had been shown a dossier of material attacking Yovanovitch, saying it had provided by the White House to the state department legal adviser, but he was not aware it had been put together by Giuliani. He said the dossier \u201cdidn\u2019t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador\u201d. He said that Pompeo gave Sullivan no explanation for the decision to recall Yovanovitch before the end of her posting, other than she had \u201clost the confidence of the president\u201d. \u201cAs I understand, [Trump] may decide that he doesn\u2019t like my testimony today and he doesn\u2019t want me to go to Russia. The president can decide when he loses confidence in his ambassador \u2013 then that person is not going to continue as ambassador,\u201d Sullivan said. Sullivan sought to avoid taking a position on the testimony by several former and current state department officials that the president, through Giuliani, had made a White House meeting and US military aid dependent on the Ukrainian government investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. \u201cSoliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent \u2013 I don\u2019t think that would be in accord with our values,\u201d Sullivan said. But he would not confirm that was what the president had done. Democratic senators signaled that they were prepared to support Sullivan\u2019s nomination as an experienced and respected diplomat, acknowledging the difficult position he was in. But they expressed concern he had not done more to find out what Trump and Giuliani were trying to achieve in Ukraine. The ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, told Sullivan he had been playing the role of \u201csee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to go to Russia, and you\u2019re going to be saying one set of things based upon your testimony here,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cAnd we have the president who, in his public statements, is totally aligned differently than what you\u2019re going to be saying.\u201d \u201cDo you understand the incredibly difficult job that you\u2019re going to have as a result of that?\u201d Menendez asked Sullivan. \u201cI would say, senator, you\u2019ve cited the president\u2019s statements.

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz is expected to be banned from parliament following concerns he could stand again as an MP without an official punishment for offering to buy drugs for sex workers. The House of Commons will be asked to support recommendations that the MP for Leicester East should receive a six-month ban for bringing parliament in to disrepute and failing to cooperate with an official inquiry. In practice, parliament signs off recommendations from the standards committee which spent three years examining claims that Vaz offered to buy cocaine for male sex workers while posing as an industrial washing machine salesman. Vaz has received support on Twitter from his local constituency association in the event that he decides to stand again. However, Labour\u2019s ruling body is due to discuss his case this week and could decide that he should not stand as a Labour candidate because of the committee\u2019s findings. Kate Green, the chair of the standards committee, said she had asked the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, that Vaz\u2019s case should be heard swiftly so that any election should know the settled view of parliament. \u201cOur thinking is that this is a serious case and we wanted the House to act swiftly. Should he contest the forthcoming election, it is right that the electors in Leicester East are aware of the view that the House, not just the committee, takes of his conduct,\u201d she said. Sources close to the leader\u2019s office said parliamentary time would be found to discuss the committee\u2019s findings. The inquiry examined claims published in the Sunday Mirror in 2016 that he offered to buy cocaine for male sex workers while posing as an industrial washing machine salesman. At the time, Vaz was chair of the home affairs select committee which was examining the issues of drug use and prostitution. Vaz\u2019s explanation, which included that he had amnesia and could not recall key events, was \u201cnot believable and, indeed, ludicrous\u201d, the inquiry found. The inquiry examined claims that Vaz visited a flat he owned and met two men who recorded the events that followed. Vaz told the Romanian male escorts in recorded conversations that his name was Jim and he was a washing machine salesman. He was quoted discussing the possibility of obtaining cocaine for them next time they met, although he reportedly said he would not want to take the drug himself. After claims by Vaz\u2019s friends that the MP may have been drugged during the newspaper sting, the Mirror released details of what it claimed was a second meeting between Vaz and the two men. It included a transcript of him allegedly ordering them to take up sexual positions. Vaz denied that the purpose of his encounter with the two men was to engage in paid-for sex, the inquiry report said. \u201cHe asserts that the purpose was to discuss the redecoration of the flat in which the meeting took place,\u201d it said. The committee, which made its recommendations on Monday, also asked that he should not be given access to a former member\u2019s pass once he has stepped down as an MP. Any ban recommended by this parliament would have to be rubber-stamped again by the next parliament after the election. This, however, is usually a formality, an informed source said. Labour\u2019s national executive committee, on which Vaz continues to hold a seat, will also decide whether to restore the party whip to Stephen Hepburn and Kelvin Hopkins, who have denied allegations of sexual harassment, and Chris Williamson. Williamson was suspended over comments he made about the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism. He has said he regrets the remarks but that he is determined to clear his name.

      "bodyText": "Senior figures in the Brexit party are divided over whether they should contest every seat in the general election \u2013 or give committed Tory Brexit supporters a clear run. The party, led by the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, is hoping to secure its first MPs this December when it stands in a general election for the first time. But splits are emerging between those who want to run in all 650 seats and others who would prefer to focus on a smaller, targeted list. The Brexit party chair, Richard Tice, has said the party has vetted 600 candidates so far and hopes to run in up to 650 seats. Farage is said to be in the middle on the strategy in terms of numbers. Others are urging for caution and suggest working on a much-reduced list of target seats in case they split the Brexit vote and threaten the chance of Britain leaving the EU. Arron Banks, who co-founded the Leave.EU campaign group with Tice, said that there is a \u201csplit view on what to do\u201d within the party, which will go to the electorate with a promise to deliver a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d \u2013 a form of no deal. He said: \u201cWhat I was saying was, be strategic. Where it makes sense to stand, stand. Where it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d Farage is currently away in Washington but decisions on where the party is going to stand will take place over the weekend, it is understood, after their election launch due to take place later this week. Banks added: \u201cHe\u2019s got a big decision to take, whether to be strategic about it.\u201d In dozens of marginals it could be possible that the Brexit party hands victory to pro-remain candidates from Labour or the Liberal Democrats by splitting the vote withthe Tory party candidate who may be an enthusiastic advocate of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. He said that some candidates might decide it is not worth running against committed Brexiters and \u201ctake matters into their own hands\u201d by standing down. Among the candidates apparently already withdrawing from the race, according to Banks, is their representative in Stone, the seat of the long-standing Eurosceptic Bill Cash. A spokesperson for the Brexit party said the idea that they were due to pull out of hundreds of seats so as not to risk scuppering Brexit was \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cspeculation\u201d, but acknowledged that the party wants to focus on Labour heartlands with a significant leave vote. He said: \u201cIt is complete speculation.

A 37% decline in the number of children claimed for is believed to have been prompted by a tightening of eligibility requirements. The number of women on the boards of Australia\u2019s top companies are tumbling, with just 32% of available seats going to female candidates since December last year. Seven top 200 companies still have no women at all on the board. The Liberal senator James McGrath and the former Liberal candidate Jacinta Price have fronted an Institute of Public Affairs advertisement attacking any proposal for an Indigenous voice to parliament, claiming it will divide Australians by race. A Melbourne newspaper ordered to compensate a traumatised journalist more than $180,000 has appealed the payout. The former reporter at the Age was awarded damages for post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. The Australian Signals Directorate has disclosed legal breaches including cases of failing to get ministerial authorisation before producing intelligence on Australians and intercepting communications without a warrant. The world China has closed 32 futuristic glass bridges in the scenic Hebei province \u2013 including the 488m Hongyagu bridge \u2013 after at least two deaths and a series of accidents involving glass slides and flying debris. More than a million people remain without power in California as wildfires fuelled by winds of up to 120km/h continue to buffer the US state, with 130,000 people remaining under evacuation orders. A 310-year-old violin left behind on a London train has been stolen, police report, with the owner of the \u00a3250,000 masterpiece understandably distraught. Electric cars could travel 320km off as little as 10 minutes charge, thanks to new battery technology, according to new research out of the US from Nobel-prize winning scientists. Recommended reads Basically wild, seemingly untameable \u2013 a rebellious adolescent. So great was Miles Franklin-winning author Alexis Wright\u2019s admiration and affection for the sulphur-crested cockatoo, Pirate, rescued through a Tullamarine airport relocation program, that he came to feature in her award-winning novel, Carpentaria. \u201cThe little king spent his days watching me with his beady black eyes while listening to either classical or country and western music,\u201d writes Wright. \u201cWhen we parted I felt as though I had lost my right arm. He still flies free, and loves a girl who cares for him. This is the way I always remember the boss in my heart.\u201d \u201cLife is not just about what you do \u2013 it\u2019s more about how you do it.\u201d That\u2019s the cherished advice grandmother Nai Nai gives her granddaughter Billi, in Lulu Wang\u2019s recent autobiographic film, The Farewell. It\u2019s a film about immigration and identity, and as Jo Tovey writes, it\u2019s also a love story \u2013 about one of the most meaningful relationships some are lucky to experience: the bond between an adult child and a loving grandparent. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, these relationships are rooted in unconditional love, acceptance and family ritual. With grandparents, there aren\u2019t the complex intricacies of the relationship between a parent and \u2018adult child\u2019 \u2026 For some, grandparents might be bridges back to old countries, languages and cultures. For others, they can be a connection to a different time and way of life.\u201d There is still no inflation to speak of in a stagnant Australian economy, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThat, even with the massive rises in tobacco prices, we still are seeing inflation below the 2% floor of the Reserve Bank\u2019s target is a good pointer of just how much the economy is lacking any growth in demand. While the consumer price index rose 1.7%, up from 1.6% in the June quarter, the average of the Reserve Bank\u2019s two core inflation measures was a record low 1.4%. People are not spending.\u201d Look Now a world-renowned coral ecosystem, Ningaloo is famous for tourists flocking to swim with whale shark or humpbacks. But the once obscure community has had to band together to fight overdevelopment. As campaigner and author Tim Winton documents in this series of photos, it\u2019s more than just a location \u2013 it\u2019s a lifestyle: home to eccentrics, alternatives and entrepreneurs. Sport Australia has retained the Ashes, boasts five ODI World Cups and appears to have waded through the scandal of recent years \u2013 is it time now to conquer the Twenty20 format? Well, it\u2019s something firmly on Justin Langer\u2019s to-do list, writes Sam Perry. From Tommy Bishop to Ellery Hanley, NRL fans have always loved a world-class Englishman, and with the news breaking of his sudden retirement the affection for Sam Burgess is apparent, writes Nick Tedeschi, despite his run-ins with the judiciary. Media roundup Mental illness is costing the economy $180bn, with one million Australians allowing health conditions from anxiety or depression to psychosis to go untreated, reports the Australian, with nearly three million more receiving help. More than $17m worth of property owned by Chinese nationals who police allege were laundering money through Australia has been seized by police, writes the Herald Sun, bringing the total to around $50m since Australian and Chinese police started collaborating on the issue. And since taking office five months ago, prime minister Scott Morrison has failed to visit the Northern Territory, rails the NT News, which led with a full page headline \u201cnot one second\u201d. Coming up NSW\u2019s environment department has forecast air quality in parts of Sydney today will be \u201cpoor\u201d due to particles drifting from fires burning near Port Macquarie. Protests are expected to continue at the Imarc mining conference in Melbourne. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 The latest international campaign from Tourism Australia has landed, with an awkward, crow-barred pun (\u2018philausophy\u2019) already dividing audiences in the same way that it inelegantly divides the word \u201cphilosophy\u201d itself.

      "bodyText": "The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and the former home secretary Amber Rudd are among the Conservative moderates who have announced they will not stand in the upcoming election. Morgan announced the news on Twitter, accompanied by a letter in which she cited \u201cthe clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP\u201d as part of the reason for her decision. Rudd has been embroiled in a highly public spat with Downing Street over her departure, with the party banning her from standing again for the Conservatives and Rudd then responding that Boris Johnson had offered her a safe seat only last week. She and Morgan are two of a number of senior Tory moderates who are not standing again at the election on 12 December, including Ken Clarke, Alistair Burt, Claire Perry and the prime minister\u2019s brother, Jo Johnson. They were joined on Wednesday by David Lidington, Theresa May\u2019s former de facto deputy. In a letter to his local newspaper, the Bucks Herald, the Aylesbury MP wrote: \u201cI have come to the conclusion that now is the right time for me to give a higher priority in terms of my time and energy, to \u2026 my family.\u201d Many of the MPs leaving the Conservatives are female. One in six of the women who were elected for the party in 2017 have either quit or stood down. The row between Rudd and No 10 broke out after the former home secretary said she would be stepping down as an MP at the election and not standing again in her marginal seat of Hastings and Rye, where she has a majority of 346. Rudd, once tipped as a future Conservative leader, told the Evening Standard: \u201cI\u2019m not finished with politics, I\u2019m just not standing at this election.\u201d She later tweeted: \u201cMoving on.

Rudd tweeted in response that Johnson had asked her to stand in the election as a Conservative only last week, potentially in the safe seat of Mid Sussex being vacated by Sir Nicholas Soames. When she left the cabinet earlier this autumn in solidarity with Tory MPs who had had the whip removed for opposing a hard Brexit, Rudd condemned Johnson\u2019s use of words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d over Brexit, warning it could incite violence against opponents. Rudd became an MP in 2010 and climbed the junior ministerial ranks before replacing Theresa May as home secretary in 2016, when May entered Downing Street. However, she was forced to resign two years later after failing to properly account for her role in the Windrush scandal about the treatment of Caribbean Britons. She returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary later the same year, but after Johnson replaced May, Rudd appeared increasingly uncomfortable with what she said was his pursuit of a no-deal Brexit. On Tuesday, 10 of the 21 Conservative MPs who had the whip removed for supporting a backbench-instigated bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit were readmitted to the party. But the others remained out in the cold, indicating they would not be able to stand for the party, including the former chancellor Philip Hammond, the former justice secretary David Gauke, Oliver Letwin and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. More than 50 MPs have so far announced they will stand down at the election, already well above the 31 who did not stand again in 2017. Those were both two-year parliaments. They include the Stockport MP, Ann Coffey, who resigned from Labour earlier this year and went on to help form Change UK. She announced her decision in a video to constituents on Twitter. More MPs have stood down before other elections, with 90 not standing again in 2015 and 149 in 2010.",

      "bodyText": "The US central bank has cut interest rates for the third time this year in an attempt to keep the longest running period of growth in the country\u2019s history continuing into the crucial election year of 2020. But the Federal Reserve put itself on a potential collision course with Donald Trump when it signalled to the financial markets that it had no immediate intention of cutting the cost of borrowing further. The president has put intense pressure on the Fed to boost the world\u2019s biggest economy and his own re-election prospects by making aggressive cuts in the cost of borrowing. But the central bank\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, said there was a limit to what the Fed could do and that a more effective way to stimulate activity would be for Congress to loosen fiscal policy through spending increases or tax cuts. Two members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee voted against the quarter-point cut in rates to between 1.5% and 1.75%. The move followed news that the world\u2019s biggest economy grew at an annual rate of just under 2% in the third quarter of 2019. In a statement explaining the decision, the Fed said unemployment had remained low and household spending had been growing strongly, but business investment and exports had remained weak. Inflation was below its 2% target. Although Trump has boasted about the strength of the economy, growth has slowed this year as the impact of tax cuts has faded and manufacturing has been hit by the trade war with China. Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, said the Fed was still likely to cut at its next meeting despite signalling it was adopting a wait-and-see approach. \u201cOn balance, we still anticipate that a further deterioration in the incoming activity data will persuade the Fed to change tack and cut interest rates one final time in December,\u201d he said. Rajan Naik, the director of Financial Markets Online, said: \u201cAnother Fed rate cut, another masterclass in the long game from Jerome Powell. Despite the surprisingly strong GDP data, the Fed chairman remains unwavering in his desire to keep ahead of the economic curve. \u201cEven though he began his press conference with a list of the things that are going right \u2013 American consumer spending is in rude health, GDP is holding up well and US workers are basking in the lowest jobless rate for five decades \u2013 Mr Powell is keen to see off any economic clouds before they darken the horizon.\u201d",

Six other people were wounded in the aftermath, as the attackers fired on an ambulance that arrived at the scene.</p> <p>An initial investigation suggested that the massacre came in response to the capture of three Farc dissidents by local indigenous guardsmen.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, here we have a longstanding threat of drug trafficking groups, and of dissidents, who want to intimidate the population,\u201d Duque told reporters from the nearby town Santander de Quilichao. \u201cI hope to make some important announcements about operational capacity in the region and the capacity we will have to face these threats.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/23/colombian-activists-face-extermination-by-criminal-gangs\">Colombian activists face 'extermination' by criminal gangs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But his words rang hollow with indigenous leaders across the country who say he has done little to combat threats and attacks that have persisted since the Farc demobilised following a peace accord signed in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cThe government says the right things, but doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Eduin Marcelo Capaz, the human rights coordinator of a local indigenous council. \u201cDuque will say whatever he has to to cover up his government\u2019s ineffectiveness and disinterest in protecting us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen will the massacre end?\u201d tweeted the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (or Onic), going on to report that 121 indigenous people have been murdered since Duque took office in August last year.</p> <p>Opposition politicians also lambasted the government\u2019s inaction. \u201cWhat is under way in Colombia is an indigenous genocide, and it will not stop if international justice does not appear,\u201d Senator Gustavo Petro tweeted on Tuesday night, as news of the massacre began to spread.</p> <p>Violence is a daily reality in the Cauca province, where last month mayoral candidate Karina Garc\u00eda was murdered with three others on the campaign trail ahead of elections that took place last Sunday.</p> <p>The violence that marred the election campaign \u2013 six other candidates were murdered nationwide \u2013 reminded Colombians of the political violence of the 1990s and 2000s, when the Farc were at their most powerful.</p> <p>The 2016 peace deal was supposed to usher in a new chapter of tranquility, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/colombia-timeline-farc-civil-war-peace\">formally ending half a century of civil war </a>that killed 260,000 and forced over 7 million from their homes.</p> <p>But while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/farc\">Farc</a> demobilization removed one faction from Colombia\u2019s war, peace never truly arrived: local conflicts over the drug trade, land rights and mineral resources continue to fuel violence, and social and indigenous leaders are often targets.</p> <p>According to Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman, 486 activists and human rights defenders have been murdered since January 2016, alarming watchdogs.</p> <p>\u201cThe region where this massacre took place is a first-tier zone for violence, and the defence sector surely knows this but the response to repeated calls for help from indigenous communities has been far from adequate,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are being left unprotected by their government in an area that is being disputed among several armed and criminal groups,\u201d Isacson added. \u201cColombia must prioritise protecting these communities, working with their leaderships, to prevent another horrible tragedy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Colombia\u2019s government has launched a military offensive to hunt down the gunmen responsible for the massacre of five indigenous leaders in the south-western province of Cauca. The president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, travelled to the region on Wednesday along with his defence and interior ministers to condemn the massacre and oversee operations to root out armed groups that plague the conflict-ridden Cauca province. The government blamed dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc), a now-demobilised leftist rebel group, for the attack on Tuesday, in which assailants threw grenades and opened fire on a convoy of armoured SUVs carrying the indigenous leaders. Among the victims was Cristina Bautista, the leader of the semi-autonomous Tacuey\u00f3 reservation and her unarmed indigenous guardsmen. Six other people were wounded in the aftermath, as the attackers fired on an ambulance that arrived at the scene. An initial investigation suggested that the massacre came in response to the capture of three Farc dissidents by local indigenous guardsmen. \u201cClearly, here we have a longstanding threat of drug trafficking groups, and of dissidents, who want to intimidate the population,\u201d Duque told reporters from the nearby town Santander de Quilichao. \u201cI hope to make some important announcements about operational capacity in the region and the capacity we will have to face these threats.\u201d But his words rang hollow with indigenous leaders across the country who say he has done little to combat threats and attacks that have persisted since the Farc demobilised following a peace accord signed in 2016. \u201cThe government says the right things, but doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Eduin Marcelo Capaz, the human rights coordinator of a local indigenous council. \u201cDuque will say whatever he has to to cover up his government\u2019s ineffectiveness and disinterest in protecting us.\u201d \u201cWhen will the massacre end?\u201d tweeted the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (or Onic), going on to report that 121 indigenous people have been murdered since Duque took office in August last year. Opposition politicians also lambasted the government\u2019s inaction. \u201cWhat is under way in Colombia is an indigenous genocide, and it will not stop if international justice does not appear,\u201d Senator Gustavo Petro tweeted on Tuesday night, as news of the massacre began to spread. Violence is a daily reality in the Cauca province, where last month mayoral candidate Karina Garc\u00eda was murdered with three others on the campaign trail ahead of elections that took place last Sunday. The violence that marred the election campaign \u2013 six other candidates were murdered nationwide \u2013 reminded Colombians of the political violence of the 1990s and 2000s, when the Farc were at their most powerful. The 2016 peace deal was supposed to usher in a new chapter of tranquility, formally ending half a century of civil war that killed 260,000 and forced over 7 million from their homes. But while the Farc demobilization removed one faction from Colombia\u2019s war, peace never truly arrived: local conflicts over the drug trade, land rights and mineral resources continue to fuel violence, and social and indigenous leaders are often targets. According to Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman, 486 activists and human rights defenders have been murdered since January 2016, alarming watchdogs. \u201cThe region where this massacre took place is a first-tier zone for violence, and the defence sector surely knows this but the response to repeated calls for help from indigenous communities has been far from adequate,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank. \u201cPeople are being left unprotected by their government in an area that is being disputed among several armed and criminal groups,\u201d Isacson added. \u201cColombia must prioritise protecting these communities, working with their leaderships, to prevent another horrible tragedy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With Brexit still unresolved, and smaller parties hoping to break through, pollsters and pundits have warned that this general election is the most unpredictable in decades. Here are five factors that could make the difference: 1) Is it all about Brexit? Labour has settled its Brexit policy, and will hope to stand out as the one party offering to \u201clet the people decide\u201d by offering a referendum within six months of taking office. But Jeremy Corbyn knows that will not be enough for many ardent remainers in his own party, and among its voters, who believe, as his deputy Tom Watson put it in a speech earlier this year, \u201cour members are remain, our values are remain, our hearts are remain\u201d. If remain voters feel more motivated by stopping Brexit than any other issue, they may feel tempted to opt for Jo Swinson\u2019s \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d Liberal Democrats. Corbyn will therefore hope to recast the campaign away from Brexit, towards Labour\u2019s \u201ctransformative\u201d domestic agenda, including wholesale renationalisation, radical labour market reforms and a dramatic increase in public investment. 2) Is the big squeeze on, or can smaller parties flourish? In 2017, the Lib Dems had hoped to rally disgruntled remainers to their cause \u2013 and the party\u2019s then leader Tim Farron even suggested they could \u201cdo a Trudeau\u201d, and overhaul the official opposition. But as the gruelling seven-week campaign went on, Farron got tangled up in questions of sin and sexuality; while voters appeared to have decided their choice was about which party would be in government \u2013 and that meant Labour or the Tories. In the event, despite portentous predictions about the end of two-party politics, Labour and the Conservatives scooped up 82.4% of the vote between them \u2013 the highest score for the two main parties since 1970. Swinson is already pressing to be included in TV debates as she attempts to break in on that duopoly, and her supporters hope the electorate will warm to her. And Boris Johnson\u2019s fate will also depend on how successful the Brexit party can be in scooping up disgruntled leavers \u2013 and how aggressive its leader, Nigel Farage, will be in pursuing the PM for failing to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge of leaving on 31 October. 3) How will the leaders perform on the campaign trail? Corbyn\u2019s uplifting rallies and Theresa May\u2019s stilted stump speeches helped turn around voters\u2019 perceptions of the two leaders in 2017. Johnson\u2019s team, many of whom are Vote Leave veterans, are convinced he can recapture the rough-and-tumble of the 2016 referendum campaign, which saw him outshine David Cameron. But he has sometimes appeared chaotic or undisciplined during public appearances since becoming PM \u2013 and campaigns can be unpredictable. For Labour, meanwhile, it may be hard for Corbyn to recapture the freshness of 2017, when he was barely known to many voters, and before he became sucked into the mire of Brexit in parliament. And while his poll ratings as a leader were poor back then \u2013 and improved during the campaign \u2013 they are now even worse. Ipsos Mori says he has the lowest leadership satisfaction rating for any opposition leader since 1977. 4) Can Johnson do better than May at winning over Labour voters? May\u2019s ill-fated manifesto launch in 2017 was held in Halifax \u2013 one of a swath of Labour seats across the Midlands and Northern England they hoped to take. In the event, May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d slogan was much less successful than her boosters hoped at winning over former Labour voters: aside from a handful of seats, including Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Mansfield. However, Labour majorities were squeezed in many Brexit-voting former industrial areas, such as Gloria De Piero\u2019s Ashfield seat, and Paul Farrelly\u2019s in Newcastle-under-Lyme. (Both are standing down). This time around, the Conservatives have discarded the austerity policies that have characterised their last nine years in power \u2013 and will have a manifesto aimed squarely at working-class, former Labour voters. Johnson has been visiting a hospital or a school almost every day in recent weeks; and Tory strategists hope Priti Patel\u2019s tough stance on law and order will help them to exploit what they regard as a weak spot for Labour, and for Corbyn in particular. Patel, the home secretary, said at last month\u2019s Tory conference that her party\u2019s message to criminals was \u201cwe are coming after you\u201d \u2013 and senior party figures were keen to tell stories of the warm welcome they were receiving on the doorsteps in Tory heartlands. Corbyn\u2019s fancy footwork on Brexit is partly about allowing Labour to have an offer to make to voters in seats like these \u2013 and the party also has a list of snappy retail policies, including free prescriptions and funded social care. But Johnson\u2019s allies believe he can cut a swath through the Midlands and the North of England. 5) Where do Tory remainers go? The departure of a string of high-profile moderates from the parliamentary Conservative party has underlined its rapid transformation in just months, during Johnson\u2019s premiership. Some, including Amber Rudd and Oliver Letwin, have had the whip removed, while others, including David Lidington, have announced in recent days that they are quitting parliament. Several have voiced fears that traditional Tory voters in constituencies like theirs will have nowhere to go. Former justice secretary David Gauke, who represents South West Hertfordshire, suggested what he called Johnson\u2019s \u201cFarage-lite\u201d strategy could cost his party millions of votes. Will the fear of a leftwing Corbyn government sting longtime Conservative voters into returning to the fold? Or will they be disillusioned enough to find a home elsewhere \u2013 perhaps most likely with the Lib Dems. Swinson told St Albans MP Anne Main \u2013 a leaver representing a remain seat \u2013 that she had already visited her constituency, and hoped to do so many more times in the weeks ahead. Many of these commuter-belt seats will be high on the Lib Dems\u2019 target list \u2013 and the more of them Johnson loses, the more ground he needs to make up elsewhere. \u2022 This story was amended on 31 October. An earlier version mistakenly said that Halifax is in the north-east.",

Although the official campaign does not begin until parliament is dissolved next week, the near-certain passage through parliament of a bill calling a 12 December poll has prompted party election machines to swing immediately into action. MPs voted on Tuesday night to pass the bill, unblocking a long deadlock. It will now be sent to the Lords and is set to become law within days. While Swinson took to the airwaves to talk up her party\u2019s chances of making a significant breakthrough, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, insisted the Conservatives were the only party that could push through Brexit. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told broadcasters that Labour expected to confound the polls as it did in the 2017 election, and warned that Swinson\u2019s Lib Dems could go into coalition with the Conservatives. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve considered joining the Lib Dems to run as one of their candidates. It is understood the former attorney general and remain campaigner had talks with Lib Dem party officials where it was decided it would be better to run as an independent Conservative instead. A Lib Dem party source said they would have been happy to have him on board but he did not ultimately make the leap. They also believe he will follow a \u201csoft whip\u201d from the Lib Dems if he is re-elected, which means he might choose to vote with the group on Brexit and a number of other policies. The Lib Dems are not fielding a candidate in Grieve\u2019s Beaconsfield seat to give him a clear run at capturing remain voters in this ultra safe Tory stronghold, where he currently has a 24,000 majority. Grieve has blocked a no-deal Brexit in parliament through a range of legislative procedures and also backs a second referendum. He denies he approached the Lib Dems to discuss joining their ranks. Swinson rejected the idea of supporting either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in government and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that her party\u2019s \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message was resonating in \u201cseats with all sorts of permutations\u201d. She said the local elections in May showed that the party could win in areas beyond its current scope of 19 MPs, a total boosted by defections and a byelection win after the Lib Dems won 12 seats in the 2017 election. Challenged on whether she could really move the party into government from such a low base, Swinson said: \u201cThis is a volatile time in politics. Nobody needs to look at received wisdom or what\u2019s happened in the past. \u201cOur polling show that we are within a small swing of winning hundreds of seats, because the political landscape is so totally changed by what has happened in our country post-Brexit.\u201d Speaking on Sky News, Hancock said a vote for the Lib Dems or another party was \u201ca vote to put Corbyn in Downing Street and have more referenda and more blockage and delay\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal senator James McGrath and the former Liberal candidate Jacinta Price have fronted an Institute of Public Affairs advertisement attacking any proposal for an Indigenous voice to parliament, claiming it will divide Australians by race. The inflammatory intervention comes just a day after the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, launched a co-design process with Indigenous people on the voice to parliament. The negative advertising suggests the rightwing thinktank and aligned Coalition conservatives will continue to campaign against a voice despite the government\u2019s repeated efforts to signal that the First Nations representative body will be legislated rather than enshrined in the constitution. In the ad, seen by Guardian Australia ahead of its release on Thursday, McGrath claims that the voice to parliament will \u201cdamage equality\u201d and \u201cdivide Australia \u2026 on the basis of race\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t want Indigenous Queenslanders being separated from non-Indigenous Queenslanders on the basis of their race and who they can vote for and where they can vote on the basis of a special chamber or a special voice,\u201d the Queensland senator said. \u201cWe\u2019re all equal, we\u2019re all the same. This is just nuts.\u201d The incorrect claim that a voice to parliament would amount to \u2013 or be seen as \u2013 a third chamber has been advanced by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, although the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has apologised unreservedly for using the term to campaign against a voice. The original proposal by Indigenous Australians in the Uluru statement from the heart was for a constitutionally enshrined body to provide feedback from Indigenous Australians to parliament and would not constitute a third chamber. Price, an Indigenous Australian who ran for the Liberals in the Northern Territory seat of Lingiari, nevertheless said in the IPA ad that a voice would be \u201ccreating a separate entity\u201d. \u201cWe are not a separate entity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be considered Australian citizens and part of the fabric of this nation.\u201d Price argued the voice amounted to \u201ctelling us that there are those that believe that we are forever going to be disadvantaged\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lorraine Finlay, a non-Indigenous legal academic at Murdoch University, suggested in the ad that a voice to parliament is \u201cpatronising\u201d and \u201ca form of political segregation\u201d because it implied that Indigenous Australians are \u201conly allowed to play a certain prescribed role in the Australian democracy\u201d. Despite the claims in the ads, there is no suggestion that any model of an Indigenous voice to parliament would reduce other democratic rights and full participation in Australian democracy. McGrath argued that the voice will not \u201cfix\u201d issues including suicide, infant mortality and unemployment. Anthony Dillon, an Indigenous mental health academic, said the \u201ctough issues\u201d including education, health and employment are \u201csidelined or hijacked by the virtue signallers, the \u2018blacktivists\u2019, the culture vultures\u201d. Price suggested the \u201cfad\u201d of constitutional recognition could actually reduce focus on those issues, despite the purpose of the voice as an additional mechanism to improve policies affecting Indigenous communities. The Morrison government has ruled out enshrining the voice in the constitution but has asked the Indigenous leaders Marcia Langton and Tom Calma to conduct consultations with Indigenous Australians to co-design a legislated body. Calma on Wednesday urged Indigenous people to get behind the process of co-designing a voice to parliament, and told Guardian Australia it was possible the Morrison government could countenance constitutional recognition after a model is resolved. Langton told the ABC she remained a supporter of enshrining the voice in the constitution despite Wyatt and Morrison ruling that out, but she also urged Indigenous people to engage with the process in order to settle the model. \u201cA constitutional entrenchment is the only way to guarantee that an Aboriginal voice will be heard by the parliament of Australia,\u201d Langton said. She categorised the Uluru statement from the heart as \u201ca highly metaphorical statement that required very large amounts of design work to turn it into a reality that governments can understand and can deal with\u201d and she said the co-design process needed to settle on more precise words to explain the representative body. Like Calma, Langton said it was possible the government could allow a two-step process, first legislation and then enshrinement. \u201cI agree with Tom on that,\u201d she told the ABC. But the IPA advertisement underscores the difficulty Morrison and Wyatt would face convincing government MPs to sign up to a two-stage process. Groups such as the Central Land Council have also flatly rejected the government\u2019s proposal to legislate the voice rather than enshrine it in the constitution. CLC delegates met near Uluru on Tuesday and passed a resolution opposing symbolic recognition. \u201cWe want to be part of designing the voice to parliament,\u201d the resolution said. \u201cWe demand that it be protected in the constitution.\u201d",

Ross England was giving evidence in the trial last year when he made claims about the victim\u2019s sexual history. The trial judge, Stephen Hopkins, told him: \u201cYou have managed, singlehandedly, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial. \u201cMr England, as far as I am concerned, this matter so far as you are concerned isn\u2019t ended. I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.\u201d The issue was raised during prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons on Wednesday where the Labour MP Jo Stevens asked if the prime minister was going to sack England. Johnson replied: \u201cIt would be inappropriate for me to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d However, legal proceedings have concluded in the case. A statement was issued on Wednesday evening in the name of the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Lord Davies of Gower, who said: \u201cRoss England has been suspended pending this matter being presented to the candidates committee.\u201d England had been endorsed for his candidature by his former employer, Alun Cairns, the secretary of state for Wales. Stevens, who is the MP for Cardiff Central, said it was disgraceful that Johnson had refused to answer her question about England. She said: \u201cI made clear the case had finished. The PM could and should have answered me. Both he, and the secretary of state who endorsed this individual as a candidate, have serious questions to answer about why this man is a Tory candidate.\u201d The defendant in the rape trial, James Hackett, who is reportedly a friend of England, was subsequently convicted of rape in a fresh trial. The victim denied the claims made by Ross during the trial in 2018 and has told the BBC that England\u2019s selection by the Welsh Conservatives \u201cshows how little respect they have for me\u201d. Gwendolyn Sterk, a spokesperson for Welsh Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cWe find it significantly worrying that any party should select a candidate that has been deemed by a judge to have deliberately undermined a rape trial and caused further trauma to a survivor.\u201d Cairns was asked by the Guardian if he was aware of the comments made by the judge when he endorsed England. A spokesperson for Cairns said: \u201cMr Cairns received no communication at any point from the court regarding this case.

While Andreescu\u2019s body crumbled again, Wednesday\u2019s opening match was defined by Elina Svitolina\u2019s physical prowess as she overcame Halep 7-5, 6-3 to move into the semi-final. Indoor tennis is historically fast and favours the big hitters but the conditions in China are extremely slow. Svitolina has been happy to hit consistently deep groundstrokes, forcing opponents to hit through both the court and her supreme defence in order to win. After Pliskova failed to put Svitolina away in their opening match, Halep spent this one frantically cycling through every last stroke in her arsenal, but she finished with 38 unforced errors and was unable to consistently dent the Ukrainian\u2019s armour. Svitolina has now qualified for the semi-finals, while the second spot in the Purple Group will be decided by the winner of Halep\u2019s contest with Pliskova on Friday. Andreescu will decide whether to play again after an MRI scan.",

Puigdemont may represent a genuine fight, the cause of independence for Catalonia, and I am pleased that the Guardian is giving him a voice. However, I believe that you should make an effort to represent opposing views as well. The majority of Spaniards holding a different view are voiceless in the English-speaking media, and the government in Spain is well known for its lack of international statements. As a consequence, the conversation in English is dominated by those with funds to pay for a PR campaign. The Catalonian cause is paid for by an affluent class educated in English.</p> <p>Meanwhile the constitutional system in Spain is misrepresented in English. The kingdom of Spain operates according to the rule of law. Millions of its citizens, including those of us advocating for a federal republic, believe that wrongdoing by the government, police or judiciary must be judged, and they are indeed corrected. We are critical of our government and point out its mistakes, but we can see too how citizens\u2019 rights are upheld in courts and are proud of our democracy.</p> <p>Therefore, having been concerned with Puigdemont\u2019s views being presented one-sidedly, I am now deeply worried by the position the Guardian is taking on the Spanish rule of law by adding Otegi\u2019s opinion. I kindly ask you to uphold independent journalism and publish the opinion of the large majority of people who think differently \u2013 an opinion absent from the English-speaking progressive media that the Guardian represents.<br><strong>Le\u00f3n Fernando Del Canto</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Arnaldo Otegi claims that Spain is repressive and undemocratic. Yet, after a career as a terrorist, he is now a free man and the leader of a Basque separatist party in the Spanish parliament, both of which suggest the opposite. His \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d are former members of Eta, the Basque terrorist organisation responsible for murdering more than 800 people in the course of their struggle for independence. They assassinated policemen and military personnel, judges and prosecutors, politicians, journalists, intellectuals and university professors, as well as 340 civilians.</p> <p>The most recent attacks, including the killing of a French policeman, were in 2010-11.

      "bodyText": "I am extremely concerned by your publication of an article by Arnaldo Otegi (Spanish state repression in Catalonia may be shocking \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing new, 23 October), which builds upon previous opinion pieces published by the Guardian \u2013 in particular those by Carles Puigdemont \u2013 portraying Spain\u2019s state repression as a reality. Puigdemont may represent a genuine fight, the cause of independence for Catalonia, and I am pleased that the Guardian is giving him a voice. However, I believe that you should make an effort to represent opposing views as well. The majority of Spaniards holding a different view are voiceless in the English-speaking media, and the government in Spain is well known for its lack of international statements. As a consequence, the conversation in English is dominated by those with funds to pay for a PR campaign. The Catalonian cause is paid for by an affluent class educated in English. Meanwhile the constitutional system in Spain is misrepresented in English. The kingdom of Spain operates according to the rule of law. Millions of its citizens, including those of us advocating for a federal republic, believe that wrongdoing by the government, police or judiciary must be judged, and they are indeed corrected. We are critical of our government and point out its mistakes, but we can see too how citizens\u2019 rights are upheld in courts and are proud of our democracy. Therefore, having been concerned with Puigdemont\u2019s views being presented one-sidedly, I am now deeply worried by the position the Guardian is taking on the Spanish rule of law by adding Otegi\u2019s opinion. I kindly ask you to uphold independent journalism and publish the opinion of the large majority of people who think differently \u2013 an opinion absent from the English-speaking progressive media that the Guardian represents. Le\u00f3n Fernando Del Canto London \u2022 Arnaldo Otegi claims that Spain is repressive and undemocratic. Yet, after a career as a terrorist, he is now a free man and the leader of a Basque separatist party in the Spanish parliament, both of which suggest the opposite. His \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d are former members of Eta, the Basque terrorist organisation responsible for murdering more than 800 people in the course of their struggle for independence. They assassinated policemen and military personnel, judges and prosecutors, politicians, journalists, intellectuals and university professors, as well as 340 civilians. The most recent attacks, including the killing of a French policeman, were in 2010-11. Otegi himself was convicted and imprisoned for the 1979 kidnapping of a prominent Basque businessman, part of Eta\u2019s campaign of extortion and blackmail. If Otegi has reinvented himself as a democrat, it is in large part due to the success of the Spanish government\u2019s anti-terrorism efforts and the increasingly outraged public reaction against Eta\u2019s savage, ethnically driven violence. The real victims in Spain are not Otegi and his Eta collaborators, but the thousands of people who are still living with the scars, psychic and physical, of separatist violence.

It is, on the face of it, a curious decision.</p> <p>After all, Plaid has, like the SNP, an explicit pro-independence policy for Wales and Scotland, and the Greens also support national autonomy for both countries. (Their sister party, the Scottish Greens, are often more gung-ho for a referendum than Sturgeon.)</p> <p>Lib Dem officials at the Scottish parliament say the SNP is excluded from the party\u2019s thinking about possible pacts for one simple reason: the SNP are closer to getting Scottish independence than Plaid is for independence in Wales.</p> <p>Sturgeon made clear as she launched the SNP election campaign in Stirling on Wednesday morning that a second independence referendum will be central to her party\u2019s manifesto. Under Price\u2019s leadership, Plaid is much more explicit about its independence ambitions.</p> <p>The difference, say Lib Dem officials, is that Plaid\u2019s support has fallen by several points to 12% <a href=\"http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/electionsinwales/2019/10/15/the-october-welsh-political-barometer-poll/\">in the few opinion polls carried out in Wales</a>, and so poses no threat, while the SNP dominates the polls in Scotland, and very much does.</p> <p>There is another reason. Top of the Lib Dem target list is the most marginal Westminster seat in the UK, that of North East Fife which was won by the SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins with an extraordinarily slender two vote margin. North East Fife was held by former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell for nearly 30 years and they\u2019d very much like it back.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c93f8f08cb84c60a1969\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:48:53.919Z\">5.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn confirms he would allow second Scottish independence referendum, but not 'any time soon'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>\u2019s main lines of attack against Labour at the moment is the claim that <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> would submit the country to two referendums after the general election. This is how he put it <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-10-30/debates/EE676E39-9A59-47E9-B17A-E7D8FB1A2D11/Engagements\">at PMQs</a>. Johnson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Corbyn] also offers a political disaster, consigning next year, which should be a wonderful year for our country, to two more referendums: another referendum on the EU because he cannot make up his mind what he thinks, flip-flopping this way and that; and another referendum on Scottish independence. Why on earth should the people of this country spend the next year, which should be a glorious year, going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums thanks to the Labour party?</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour is committed to renegotiating Brexit and holding another referendum. As Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said in a briefing for journalists after PMQs, Labour would not agree to a Scottish independence election in 2020. But Corbyn has confirmed that he would be willing to agree to a Scottish independence referendum at some stage later. (For a Scottish independence referendum, Westminster has to allow it.) The Scottish Labour party used to be flatly opposed to a second independence referendum, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/john-mcdonnell-deepens-row-over-second-independence-poll\">Corbyn changed party policy on this during the summer.</a></p> <p>Speaking during a visit to Crawley Hospital in West Sussex this afternoon, Corbyn said he was \u201cnot in favour\u201d of another referendum on Scottish independence \u201cany time soon\u201d. But he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At a later stage, obviously under the terms of devolution, if the Scottish parliament demands it, then there could be, at a much later stage, a referendum. I make it very clear, we are against Scottish independence and we are certainly not in favour of any referendum in Scotland any time soon.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86a16310417e1569910902a5d0fee93687878cef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86a16310417e1569910902a5d0fee93687878cef/118_0_5630_3378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn (centre) during a visit to Crawley Hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn (centre) during a visit to Crawley Hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c8ea8f08d669cdaafcc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:31:41.348Z\">5.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the BBC\u2019s <strong>Mark D\u2019Arcy</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DArcyTiP/status/1189595521884872704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m hearing the election for Speaker will go ahead on Monday - largely because it is seen as impractical to wait until after the election, because it would then take too long to get a Speaker in place, when Parliament May have to move rather quickly</p>&mdash; Mark D&#39;Arcy (@DArcyTiP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DArcyTiP/status/1189595521884872704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c3668f08cb84c60a18fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:11:36.886Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to BuzzFeed\u2019s <strong>Alex Wickham</strong>, who has written<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/boris-johnson-election-nhs-winter-crisis\"> a good insider account of the Conservative election campaign</a>, some senior Tories put their chances of winning at between 50/50 and two thirds.

The potential of Corbyn in Downing Street in coalition with the Scottish Nationalist party is a risk some Tories did not want to take. But there is a growing worry that, even if Johnson has the numbers to stay in Downing Street but the Commons remains at an impasse, the conversation will turn to another long Brexit extension and a second referendum as the only way to find a definitive answer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wickham says some Tories are summing up their mood as one of \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, while its various factions disagreed over when to go for an election, No 10 is united in the belief that it ultimately has the team and message to win.

The Cabinet Office has advice on how to apply<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-vote-by-proxy-if-youre-living-overseas\"> on its website,</a> and says an overseas voter can ask anyone to be their proxy, as long as they\u2019re able to vote. </p> <p>A number of councils began floating this option some weeks ago after the threat of a snap election gained traction: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/18/britons-overseas-urged-to-register-for-proxy-not-postal-votes\">Tower Hamlets and Islington councils in London</a> were amongst a number who began contacting overseas voters by email in September raising this option.</p> <p>Postal ballot packs cannot be sent out until all the candidates have been confirmed. The registration deadline is 14 November while the deadline to register for a vote is 25 November. Only a few printers around the UK are contracted to produce ballot papers and postal ballot forms, adding to the pressure. The Royal Mail will also be over-stretched by Christmas post, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/bad-weather-postal-delays-lack-of-polling-staff-pose-winter-election-risks\">without factoring in any bad winter weather.</a></p> <p>The AEA said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our members have been actively working on provisional polling station bookings, alerting temporary staff and working with printers to agree orders for poll cards and postal vote packs. Election teams will now be working extended hours across seven-day weeks to make sure that the polls on 12 December and subsequent counts go smoothly.</p> <p>As always, we will be working with our partners at the Cabinet Office, Electoral Commission, Royal Mail and more widely to ensure that our members are kept fully supported and up to date.</p> <p>As postal vote packs cannot be printed until candidate nominations close in the middle of November, it may be prudent for UK voters living overseas to consider setting up a proxy vote to have someone they trust vote on their behalf on 12 December.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9a6348f08cb84c60a175b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T15:04:15.322Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong>\u2019s story about the opening of the Grenfell Tower debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/30/grenfell-inquiry-boris-johnson-tells-families-justice-will-be-done\">Grenfell inquiry: Boris Johnson tells families 'justice will be done'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I won\u2019t be covering the rest of the debate, and I will be turning back now to general election developments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9a1648f08c428d8933574\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T14:47:52.533Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning to the \u201cstay put\u201d doctrine, May says this doctrine had been developed for good reasons.</p> <p>The problem was, there was no flexibility in implementing this, she says.</p> <p>She says firefighters should get training to ensure that they know when and when not to enforce \u201cstay put\u201d.

Sometimes PMQs is used as an opportunity for a forensic analysis of a particular issue, but today, more than ever, it was dominated by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn rehearsing their election sloganising. And neither leader seems to have an overwhelming advantage.</p> <p>Corbyn focused on the NHS in all his questions. Traditionally this has been Labour\u2019s strongest electoral territory and Corbyn had Johnson on the defensive throughout. His arguments about NHS underfunding and increasing waiting lists were more persuasive than Johnson\u2019s \u201call is fine\u201d bravado, and Johnson was confounded when Corbyn started talking about an individual case, because Corbyn sounded more emphatic than the PM.</p> <p>Corbyn also made it clear that he is going to spend much of the time claiming that a Johnson Brexit would open the door to the further marketisation and privatisation of the NHS. Whether this is wholly true is contestable, but it is a fear that registers with people, and may work well on the doorstep.</p> <p>Johnson was weak on the actual details of how the NHS works. But his attack lines against Corbyn \u2013 accusing him of sweeping anti-Americanism, and wholesale hostility to the involvement of private firms in the NHS (even though many NHS services are privately provided anyway \u2013 were much more powerful than anything Theresa May threw at Corbyn, and delivered with relish. </p> <p>At the end of the exchanges Corbyn and Johnson both segued into wider themes. Corbyn\u2019s line about the election providing a once in a lifetime opportunity for change resonated. But it wasn\u2019t as catchy as Johnson\u2019s argument about Labour offering two referendums, which was just about true enough to register and stick as a key election message. (Labour are certainly promising a second Brexit referendum, which would fill some of the electorate with dread. Corbyn does not favour a second Scottish independence referendum, but he has not 100% ruled one out, and a minority Labour government dependent on SNP support would probably end up agreeing to one.)</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s most lively attack lines were probably those he delivered against the SNP. It is widely assumed that the Tories will lose most of their seats in Scotland, and Ian Blackford had a good line when he said Johnson would be welcome in the country because he boosted SNP support. But, even if this is true, Johnson seemed to enjoy the chance to bang on about \u201cborders at Berwick\u201d.

That would break up the most successful political partnership in history. The SNP have a crackpot plan for borders at Berwick, he says.

He says Johnson will be welcome in Scotland; every time he comes up, he drives up support for the SNP. The SNP is the only party standing up for Scotland\u2019s interests.

The care her mother got always came after long delays. He says people who have to wait should be sympathised with and supported.</p> <p>Johnson says there are 17,300 more doctors and 17,000 more nurses since 2010. It is time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership. It is all very well to side with Russia and make huge promises and flip-flop on the referendum. Leadership means standing up for the police, for the economy, for wealth creators. And above all, it means getting Brexit done.</p> <p>Corbyn says, coming from a PM who withdrew his own bill, that sounds a bit odd. He says Johnson should have tried to show some empathy. GPs are in short supply. The NHS has suffered its longest spending squeeze ever. </p> <p>He says this election is a once-in-a-generation chance to end underfunding in the NHS. The NHS is up for grabs in a Trump-style trade deal, he says. It is up for grab by US corporations. Isn\u2019t the truth that his government is planning to sell out the NHS?</p> <p>Johnson says he agrees there is a stark choice. It is between economic catastrophe under Labour, which would spend \u00a3196bn on nationalisations. And there would be a political catastrophe under Labour too. There would be two referendums, on Brexit and on Scotland. The UK would suffer \u201ctoxic torpor\u201d. He says his government will invest in schools and education and infrastructure. That is what he is going to deliver. And he will deliver a fantastic future.

Why can\u2019t Johnson put the necessary resources into the NHS. Corbyn asks why NHS privatisation has doubled under this government. Nearly \u00a310bn is spent on the NHS under this government.</p> <p>Johnson says, if Corbyn is saying that he does not want dentists and Macmillan nurses to work with the NHS, he is \u201cout of his mind\u201d. Corbyn should pay tribute to the hard work of NHS staff. He should not talk down their achievements. He says a strong economy supports the NHS. Corbyn would wreck that.</p> <p>Corbyn says we should not have private companies like Virgin Health suing the NHS. NHS money should not go into making people richer.

And since both the Conservatives and Labour have broadly similar numbers of MPs standing down, it is hard to see this factor making a difference. Some of the MPs standing down represent very safe seats. But in places like Putney, which is 35th on <a href=\"http://www.electionpolling.co.uk/battleground/targets/labour\">a list of Labour target seats</a> and where Justine Greening is standing down, and Ashfield, 10th on <a href=\"http://www.electionpolling.co.uk/battleground/targets/conservative\">a list of Tory target seats</a> and where Gloria De Piero is standing down, the departure of an incumbent might arguably make a bit of a difference.</p> <p>Here is an up-to-date list of MPs standing down from the Institute for Government\u2019s <strong>Gavin Freeguard.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1189503055424839680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*CORRECTION*<br><br>We reckon it&#39;s 53, excluding John Mann (h/t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MShepheard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MShepheard</a>)<br><br>Data here, corrections welcome: <a href=\"https://t.co/gXQRdXv3sR\">https://t.co/gXQRdXv3sR</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/T1Glt3Pqnv\">pic.twitter.com/T1Glt3Pqnv</a></p>&mdash; Gavin Freeguard (@GavinFreeguard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1189503055424839680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>What is probably more significant is how these departures will affect the composition of the parliamentary Conservative party and the parliamentary Labour party after the election. There are clearly some people around Boris Johnson who want to purge his party of remainers like Philip Hammond. And, in Labour, replacing centrists with leftwingers who back the Corbyn project has long been an ambition of those in the leader\u2019s circle. It is too early to be know quite to what extent both these parties will be transformed after the election, but in both parties the post-election centre of gravity will probably be in a slightly different place.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db96c548f08c428d89332e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T11:23:06.221Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all of the Guardian\u2019s election 2019 coverage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2019\">here,</a> including my colleague Dan Sabbagh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/can-labour-eat-into-projected-58-seat-tory-majority\">analysis of the latest polling.</a></p> <p>And here are three other articles from today\u2019s papers about the polling situation.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s lead polling expert, says in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/only-the-biggest-general-election-victory-will-do-for-boris-johnson-n6n2njhn0\">an article in the Times (paywall)</a> Boris Johnson cannot afford not to achieve a majority.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the substantial net swing from Labour to Conservative in the present polls were to be realised at the ballot box, there are nearly 50 Labour seats that would fall into the Tory column.

If his invasion of Labour Brexit territory can go as far as Wolverhampton North East, which was last Tory in 1987, or Stoke-on-Trent North, which has never been held by the Conservatives in the postwar era, a wave of other pro-Brexit Labour seats will likely turn blue, from Dudley North to Barrow and Furness, from Ashfield to Bishop Auckland. A strong majority would surely follow.</p> <p>Consolidating the leave vote would be made infinitely easier were the Brexit party to stand down, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/10/29/brexit-party-aims-wipe-labour-heartlands-opens-door-electoral/\">or the two parties to form some kind of pact</a>.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has said the government will fully accept the findings of a report on failings in the Grenfell Tower disaster, promising survivors and relatives that \u201cthe truth will out and justice will be done\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has challenged Johnson to TV debates on what has effectively been the first full day of campaigning since MPs agreed that there should be an election on Thursday 12 December. (See 4.06pm.) The bill approving the election is still being debated by peers, but it is expected to clear the House of Lords without a hitch by the end of today. Amber Rudd and David Lidington, respectively the ex-home secretary and Theresa May\u2019s former de facto deputy, have both announced they are among an increasing number of sitting MPs who will quit at the coming election. The Liberal Democrats are \u201cwithin a small swing of winning hundreds of seats\u201d, Jo Swinson has claimed, as the main parties began pushing out key messages before what is billed as the most volatile general election in living memory. That is all from me for today. A colleague will be picking up the blog later for any breaking news. The disclosure from Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, that his party may agree to form pro-remain pacts with other anti-Brexit parties such as the Lib Dems in certain seats (see 4.52pm) raises the question about the role in Scotland of Westminster\u2019s largest anti-Brexit force: the Scottish National party. The Lib Dems are explicitly ruling out any deals with the SNP, even though Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party has 35 MPs now and could well have nearer 50 after election day. It is, on the face of it, a curious decision. After all, Plaid has, like the SNP, an explicit pro-independence policy for Wales and Scotland, and the Greens also support national autonomy for both countries. (Their sister party, the Scottish Greens, are often more gung-ho for a referendum than Sturgeon.) Lib Dem officials at the Scottish parliament say the SNP is excluded from the party\u2019s thinking about possible pacts for one simple reason: the SNP are closer to getting Scottish independence than Plaid is for independence in Wales. Sturgeon made clear as she launched the SNP election campaign in Stirling on Wednesday morning that a second independence referendum will be central to her party\u2019s manifesto. Under Price\u2019s leadership, Plaid is much more explicit about its independence ambitions. The difference, say Lib Dem officials, is that Plaid\u2019s support has fallen by several points to 12% in the few opinion polls carried out in Wales, and so poses no threat, while the SNP dominates the polls in Scotland, and very much does. There is another reason. Top of the Lib Dem target list is the most marginal Westminster seat in the UK, that of North East Fife which was won by the SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins with an extraordinarily slender two vote margin. North East Fife was held by former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell for nearly 30 years and they\u2019d very much like it back. One of Boris Johnson\u2019s main lines of attack against Labour at the moment is the claim that Jeremy Corbyn would submit the country to two referendums after the general election. This is how he put it at PMQs. Johnson said: [Corbyn] also offers a political disaster, consigning next year, which should be a wonderful year for our country, to two more referendums: another referendum on the EU because he cannot make up his mind what he thinks, flip-flopping this way and that; and another referendum on Scottish independence. Why on earth should the people of this country spend the next year, which should be a glorious year, going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums thanks to the Labour party? Labour is committed to renegotiating Brexit and holding another referendum. As Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said in a briefing for journalists after PMQs, Labour would not agree to a Scottish independence election in 2020. But Corbyn has confirmed that he would be willing to agree to a Scottish independence referendum at some stage later. (For a Scottish independence referendum, Westminster has to allow it.) The Scottish Labour party used to be flatly opposed to a second independence referendum, but Corbyn changed party policy on this during the summer. Speaking during a visit to Crawley Hospital in West Sussex this afternoon, Corbyn said he was \u201cnot in favour\u201d of another referendum on Scottish independence \u201cany time soon\u201d. But he went on: At a later stage, obviously under the terms of devolution, if the Scottish parliament demands it, then there could be, at a much later stage, a referendum. I make it very clear, we are against Scottish independence and we are certainly not in favour of any referendum in Scotland any time soon. From the BBC\u2019s Mark D\u2019Arcy According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, who has written a good insider account of the Conservative election campaign, some senior Tories put their chances of winning at between 50/50 and two thirds. He says: Senior Conservatives put their chances of forming a government on Dec. 13 at between fifty-fifty and two-thirds in favour. The path to a Johnson majority has been made slightly easier after he restored the whip to 10 of the 21 Tory rebels who opposed his Brexit plans last month. But the Tories still go into the election well short of a majority and likely to lose their foothold in Scotland as well as further seats to the Liberal Democrats in areas of England where support for EU membership remains strong. To win a majority healthy enough to comfortably pass his Brexit deal, Johnson would have to gain Labour seats far away from their usual target list \u2014 and with the added unknown factor of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party eating away at their vote in leave areas. The fear among Conservatives throughout the party is that they fall short and that parliament remains hung and deadlocked. The potential of Corbyn in Downing Street in coalition with the Scottish Nationalist party is a risk some Tories did not want to take. But there is a growing worry that, even if Johnson has the numbers to stay in Downing Street but the Commons remains at an impasse, the conversation will turn to another long Brexit extension and a second referendum as the only way to find a definitive answer. Wickham says some Tories are summing up their mood as one of \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d. Overall, while its various factions disagreed over when to go for an election, No 10 is united in the belief that it ultimately has the team and message to win. One Tory who spoke to BuzzFeed News talked about \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d \u2014 the idea that the choice facing the country was clear, an election to break the deadlock in Parliament was inevitable at some point, and that if voters genuinely preferred Corbyn, then so be it. According to CNN\u2019s Luke McGee, Brexit party activists have been told not to say on social media where the party will be standing at the election, amidst rumours it may decide to not most seats, as originally planned, but just a handful. McGee writes: Rumours are now circulating that the Brexit party will switch its focus from standing in every seat to concentrating on a handful of seats that they have a decent chance on winning. On Wednesday morning, party campaigners were sent the following message, which has been seen by CNN. \u201cMessage from HQ ... IMPORTANT. Please go DARK on social media. DO NOT respond to any questions about where we are standing, what the strategy or plan is from now. Things will be made clear to all PPCs very soon. #changepoliticsforgood.\u201d Adam Price, Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader, has confirmed that his party may form a pact with other pro-remain parties to maximise their chances. In August Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood aside in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, which helped the Lib Dems win the seat from the Tories. Price said: The Brexit crisis has shown up Westminster to be totally unfit for purpose. The Conservatives and Labour are divided and are simply not offering the solutions we need. Plaid Cymru is a party of principle and we have consistently said that Wales is best served within the European Union. That is why, as Wales\u2019s leading remain party, we are open to working with others to secure our European future. Tory MPs have been criticised for jeering Jeremy Corbyn over his green tie, which he wore as a sign of respect to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire, the Press Association reports. The Labour leader wore the garment for a House of Commons debate on Wednesday after the report into the disaster that killed 72 people was published. As relatives of those killed looked on from the public gallery, members from the Conservative benches mocked him for the bright tie. Theresa May, who was prime minister when the blaze took hold of the west London building in June 2017, could be seen admonishing them by stressing the tie was to mark the tragedy, PA reports. Asked to comment on the MPs\u2019 behaviour, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said: I think that\u2019s fairly contemptible. He was wearing a green tie as a mark of respect for the victims of the Grenfell disaster. I think those Tory MPs mocking his tie would be better supporting justice for the families and the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and those who died in similar conflagrations and to deliver safety and protection for people living in tower blocks all over the country. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, the Commons standards committee has asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, to schedule a debate tomorrow to allow MPs to pass a motion approving the committee\u2019s recommendation for Labour MP Keith Vaz to be suspended for six months. The full text of Green\u2019s letter to Rees-Mogg is here (pdf). Michelle O\u2019Neill has said Sinn Fein is hoping to unseat \u201can architect of Brexit\u201d - DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds - as it aims to increase its number of MPs from seven to eight. As the Press Association reports, the Sinn Fein vice president said the December 12 general election will be about maximising the return of pro-Remain candidates. Standing alongside the party\u2019s North Belfast candidate John Finucane, O\u2019Neill said: We will stand in our seven constituencies in which we currently hold seats and we will stand in North Belfast to win that seat. We believe there is a real opportunity in North Belfast to oust someone who has been architect of Brexit, someone who has actively worked against the interests of people who live here on this island, and John Finucane can provide local representation but also will reflect Ireland\u2019s interests in all of this mess. Dodds had a majority of 2,081 over Sinn Fein in 2017. But at that election Dodds did not face a challenge from the Ulster Unionist party, which agreed to give the DUP a clear run to maximise the unionist vote. But this time the UUP intends to put up candidates in all 18 of Northern Ireland\u2019s constituency because it does not want to be seen to endorse the DUP\u2019s Brexit stance. Jeremy Corbyn is challenging Boris Johnson to face him in head-to-head televised debates during the election campaign, the Press Association reports. But it was unclear whether the Labour leader was willing to accept a challenge for a three-way discussion from Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson. After PMQs, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman told journalists: As we demanded of Theresa May and she refused to agree, we would challenge Boris Johnson to agree today to head-to-head TV debates in this campaign. But when asked about a three-way discussion with Swinson, the spokesman replied: We are in discussion with the broadcasters. But there are only two people who can be prime minister at the end of this campaign and I think the British public have a clear right to see them debate head-to-head on TV and hear their cases. The number of MPs who have said they are standing down has now reached 57. Sir Alan Duncan, the former Foreign Office minister, is the latest to announce his departure. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about two of the most prominent departures, the former Tory work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd and the former \u201cde facto deputy prime minister\u201d David Lidington. As the Mail\u2019s Jack Doyle revealed, Mark Spencer, the Tory chief whip, sent a letter to Rudd today saying he was not willing to restore the whip to her because he did not trust her not to criticise the prime minister again. He told her: I appreciate that you surrendered the whip in an act of solidarity [with the 21 fellow Tories who had had the whip withdrawn] but I am of the view that the receipt of the whip is an honour, not a right, and as such it cannot be discarded or returned at will if it is to have any meaning. The Scottish Tories will run a \u201cdecisive and determined\u201d election campaign promising voters there will be a \u201creferendum free period ahead\u201d, the party\u2019s interim leader Jackson Carlaw said. Speaking as the Scottish Tories launched its campaign in Perth, Carlaw said his was the only party pledging no more referendums, in contrast to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s support for a fresh EU poll and a second Scottish independence vote next year. He told reporters: We\u2019ve now fought several referendums. I have respected the result of them all, win or lose; Nicola Sturgeon has never respected the result of any referendum, other than the illegal one in Catalonia. [As] we go forward from here Scottish Conservatives are promising a referendum free period ahead. Nicola Sturgeon is promising another two referendums. If we want to end that division, if we want to move on, we have to keep Scotland in the UK, and no more referendums. Sturgeon, who kicked off the Scottish National party\u2019s campaign on Wednesday at an event in Stirling at which newspaper reporters were not invited, would dispute Carlaw\u2019s claims she respected the result of the unofficial Catalan referendum in 2017. She backed the case for staging one in principle, but did not endorse the event itself. Previously deputy Scottish leader, Carlaw replaced Ruth Davidson after she resigned unexpected in August, partly in protest at Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, pending a leadership contest next year, but the party\u2019s campaign literature still promotes Davidson prominently. It sent out election letters to Tory voters signed by Davidson, a keen remain campaigner during the referendum, saying the threat of a second independence vote was a very real one. The A3 election leaflets Tory activists handed out in Perth on Wednesday did not name Carlaw once. Perth and North Perthshire is a key Tory target seat: the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart retained it with a wafer-thin majority of 21 votes, or 0.04%, over the Tories. Carlaw insisted that promoting Davidson prove the Tories had a strong team, which included both his predecessors \u2013 Davidson and Annabel Goldie, while sidestepping questions on whether he personally trusted Boris Johnson. He said: We\u2019re absolutely delighted we have got former leaders that we\u2019re able to use in this campaign. I doubt the SNP will be using Alex Salmond. I doubt the Labour party will be using Kezia Dugdale. Brexit day has now officially been changed, in UK law, from 31 October 2019 to 31 January 2020. Although the Brexit extension was agreed with the EU earlier this week, the government still had to change the date of \u201cexit day\u201d set out in the EU (Withdrawal) Act for EU law to continue to apply until the new exit date. Ministers have now just done this, by approving the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019. James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, was the person who signed it. Under the Act, ministers can change the exit date in the legislation without the need for a vote in parliament. There was a vote the last time it got changed, but that was because Theresa May agreed to hold one in response to a request from Tory Brexiters. Overseas voters have been advised to consider finding a proxy voter for December\u2019s snap general election because of the risks their postal votes may not arrive in time. The Association of Electoral Administrators, the body which represents the UK\u2019s returning officers and other election staff, said there were logistical challenges in getting postal ballots printed and sent out in time. After MPs voted last night to stage the election on 12 December, it has now officially recommended that option. The Cabinet Office has advice on how to apply on its website, and says an overseas voter can ask anyone to be their proxy, as long as they\u2019re able to vote. A number of councils began floating this option some weeks ago after the threat of a snap election gained traction: Tower Hamlets and Islington councils in London were amongst a number who began contacting overseas voters by email in September raising this option. Postal ballot packs cannot be sent out until all the candidates have been confirmed. The registration deadline is 14 November while the deadline to register for a vote is 25 November. Only a few printers around the UK are contracted to produce ballot papers and postal ballot forms, adding to the pressure. The Royal Mail will also be over-stretched by Christmas post, without factoring in any bad winter weather. The AEA said: Our members have been actively working on provisional polling station bookings, alerting temporary staff and working with printers to agree orders for poll cards and postal vote packs. Election teams will now be working extended hours across seven-day weeks to make sure that the polls on 12 December and subsequent counts go smoothly. As always, we will be working with our partners at the Cabinet Office, Electoral Commission, Royal Mail and more widely to ensure that our members are kept fully supported and up to date. As postal vote packs cannot be printed until candidate nominations close in the middle of November, it may be prudent for UK voters living overseas to consider setting up a proxy vote to have someone they trust vote on their behalf on 12 December. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about the opening of the Grenfell Tower debate. I won\u2019t be covering the rest of the debate, and I will be turning back now to general election developments. Turning to the \u201cstay put\u201d doctrine, May says this doctrine had been developed for good reasons. The problem was, there was no flexibility in implementing this, she says. She says firefighters should get training to ensure that they know when and when not to enforce \u201cstay put\u201d. She says one father survived the fire because he ignored advice to stay put. Labour\u2019s Andrew Slaughter asks May if she accepts that Grenfell Tower would have benefitted from sprinklers. Should they be fitted in all new tower blocks, and retrofitted in old ones? May says the Lakanal House report did not say sprinklers should be obligatory. May praises the bravery of the firefighters who attended the fire. But she says it is clear from the report that there are problems with the way the fire service worked that need to addressed. The emergency services must be able to work together, she says. She says, as home secretary, she oversaw the JESIP project that was intended to address this. But the report shows that there were still problems. May says she has been struck by the care that the Grenfell Tower community have shown for each other. She says others have a lot to learn from this. She says people living in the tower were raising concerns about its safety well before the fire. But those concerns were ignored, she says. She says this was one of the most shocking aspects of what happened. She says housing ministers, including Alok Sharma, now international development secretary, worked on a plan to ensure people in social housing have their concerns heard. She was the government has been working on a green paper on this. She urges the government to publish this as soon as possible. Labour\u2019s Karen Lee asks May if it is acceptable that the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have not been properly rehoused. May says, in the early stages, the work to find permanent homes for survivors did not go fast enough. She says she accepts that the survivors think the government has not done enough. But every effort will be made to support these families, she says. She says it is not just housing; mental health support is important too, she says. Theresa May, the former prime minister who set up the Grenfell Tower inquiry, is speaking now. She thanks Boris Johnson for the serious tone of his speech, and pays tribute to the dignity and fortitude shown by the survivors in their fight for justice. He says it cannot have been easy for the survivors to give evidence to the inquiry. And he thanks Sir Martin Moore-Bick for his report. It is detailed, and shocking, she says. Corbyn says, although Boris Johnson spoke about building a beautiful memorial to the victims of the fire, the real memorial will be a properly funded fire service and having people living in safe buildings. Corbyn says the night of 14 June 2017 will never be forgotten. And he pays tribute to the Kensington MP, Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad, who had to respond to the fire only days after being elected to parliament. Corbyn says government cuts have degraded the fire service. And Boris Johnson was involved when he was mayor of London. As mayor of London, the now prime minister was at the forefront of the cuts to our fire service. In the eight years that he was mayor, the London fire brigade was required to make gross savings of over \u00a3100m, cutting of 27 fire appliances, 552 firefighters, 324 support staff, two fire rescue units, three training appliances and closing ten London fire stations. Corbyn says it is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the \u201cstay put\u201d policy has not been reviewed. He says concerns have been raised about this for years, including by the Fire Brigades Union, but the government has dragged its feet. Corbyn says firefighters were not to blame for the fire. While this phase of the report makes criticism of the London fire brigade we should remember; it was not firefighters that deregulated building safety standards. It wasn\u2019t firefighters who ignored the concerns of tenants. It wasn\u2019t firefighters who ignored a coroner\u2019s report and failed to put sprinklers in high rise blocks and it wasn\u2019t firefighters who put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower. Corbyn says we are not seeing urgent action from government. Councils know that if they spend money removing cladding they may not get compensation from government, and other services may suffer. Grenfell Tower would not have happened to wealthy Londoners, he says. Corbyn criticises the government for failing to learn the lessons from previous high-rise fires, particularly the Lakanal House fire and the Shirley Towers fire. He criticises the fact that some Grenfell Tower survivors are still living in temporary accommodation. Labour\u2019s David Lammy says many people believe what happened at Grenfell Tower amounted to corporate manslaughter. Corbyn says he hopes ministers will have heard the point Lammy made. There has be be justice, he says. He says it may be for the courts to find out if people installed cladding that they knew to be dangerous. He says the government should not stand in the way of that. Labour\u2019s Jim Fitzpatrick says many in the media have been targeting the fire brigade. They should be waiting for the big picture to emerge, he says. Corbyn thanks Fitzpatrick for what he said. He says Fitzpatrick is a former fireman. He says the media should be \u201ccautious\u201d about throwing blame around, because there is another report to come. Corbyn says he has been on a number of the walks for Grenfell. He has been on many marches on his life, he says. But he has never been on anything as poignant as this \u2013 people walking silently past what is left of the Grenfell Tower. He says, as the march went passed the fire station, it was clear how much respect people have for the firefighters. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He starts by thanking Johnson for the serious tone of his speech. He says many of the survivors are in the gallery watching. For them, this is another day for horrid memories, he says. He says he remembers visiting the tower himself afterwards. This was a tragedy, he says. But it was an avoidable tragedy, he says. All the survivors deserve a new home in the UK, he says. Johnson says the government will continue to support the affected families \u201clong after the television cameras are gone\u201d. He says it will ensure a beautiful and appropriate memorial is built to the families. The government will also ensure that regulations are tightened up in line with the recommendations. He says he is personally committed to ensuring that the lessons do not get forgotten. The survivors had every reason to hide away. But instead they have fought for the truth, and dedicated their lives to ensuring that those who died will always be remembered. He says the truth will out, justice will be done, and Grenfell Tower, and the people who called it home, will never be forgotten. Johnson says the report will be \u201charrowing\u201d for survivors. But he says he hopes it will show them that Sir Martin Moore-Bick is determined to get at the truth. Johnson says he has never met any firefighter anything less than totally committed to public safety. He says he will ensure the lessons of Grenfell Tower are accepted. Where Moore-Bick says the government should take responsibility for fire safety, the government will legislate. And he says the government will accept all the report\u2019s recommendations for central government. Johnson says it is easy for MPs to have 20/20 hindsight. But they do not have to run into fires like firefighters, he says. Labour\u2019s Rushanara Ali asks if Johnson regrets the cuts the fire services he implemented as London mayor. And does he accept that the regulators have had their powers reduced by the government. Johnson says the fire service arrived on the scene within minutes. He says today\u2019s report does not make any criticism about resources. Johnson says the fire presented an unprecedented challenge for the fire service. He says Moore-Bick does not question the actions of any of the rank and file firefighters at Grenfell Tower. Moore-Bick said they showed courage and \u201cselfless devotion to duty\u201d as they faced choking smoke and temperature up to 1,000 degrees, he says. But the report says the firefighters were faced with a situation for which they had not been properly prepared, he says. He says the report says there was a serious failure of stated policies. The failure to order an evacuation of the fire after it was clear the fire was out of control probably led to the deaths of people who could have been saved, the report says. Johnson says fire procedure in blocks of flats is based on the \u201cstay put\u201d policy. In most circumstances this is the best policy. But at Grenfell Tower that was not the case. By 1.30am it was clear compartmentalisation (the theory that a fire will be contained) had failed. By 1.50am it was not too late to evacuate. But senior officers could not conceive of a situation in which compartmentalisation might not work. By the time an evacuation was ordered, the tower\u2019s single staircase was filled with impenetrable smoke. Johnson says the report is clear that the cladding was responsible for the fire escalating in the way that it did. It was because of the cladding that a routine fire ended up killing so many people. He says Moore-Bick is clear that the cladding that was installed contravened building regulations. Labour\u2019s David Lammy asks what the government is being done to help people who are still living in flats with this cladding. Johnson says the government has allocated money to remove this cladding. He accepts that progress on getting rid of it has not been as fast as he would like. All buildings owned by central or local government have had this removed, or at least have had the removal work scheduled. But in the private sector progress is slower, he says. Matthew Offord, a Conservative, asks what will happen to owners who do not remove the cladding by the June 2020 deadline. Johnson says the government is planning to name them. The people in those blocks are safe, because of 24 hour patrols. But the government needs to go further, he says. He says the government will take action to force owners to remove this cladding. Johnson says this stage of the inquiry looked at what happened. The next stage will look at why it happened. That will consider, among other things, why concerns raised by residents were ignored. Johnson says the government will allow time for MPs to debate the report at a later point, when they have had time to read it. Johnson says for too long those living in Grenfell Tower had their voices ignored \u2013 before the fire, and after. He says when firefighters were first called to Grenfell Tower, after a fire started by a faulty fridge, they thought it was a routine call. But the fire expanded rapidly. Within 45 minutes it was clear that the inferno was out of control. He says there were almost 300 people in the tower, 72 of whom died. Many people who lived together died together, he says. And those who survived saw everything they owned reduced to dust and ash, he says. Johnson says Theresa May ordered an inquiry soon afterwards. She was determined that the survivors would not have to wait years for justice. Today Sir Martin Moore-Bick has published the first report from his inquiry, Johnson says. He says it is almost 1,000 pages long. The full report is available here. And an executive summary is here (pdf). Boris Johnson is now opening a three-hour debate on the first report from the Grenfell Tower. Our main story about the report is here. John Bercow is now thanking his staff, and his wife and children for their support. His voice briefly cracks with emotion, and afterwards there is a brief round of applause. He announces that Tricia Hillas, the canon pastor at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, has been appointed as the next Speaker\u2019s chaplain. He says he is delighted that she will be the second BAME person to take up that role. She will succeed Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who has been appointed bishop of Dover. UPDATE: This is from St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Richard Benyon, a Conservative, says Boris Johnson once said there was more chance of his being decapitated by a frisbee than becoming PM. He urges Johnson to continue the UK\u2019s strong record on ocean conservation. Johnson praises Benyon\u2019s own record on this topic. John Bercow admits he is \u201cstretching time\u201d but he is going to take two more MPs. He calls Labour\u2019s Ronnie Campbell, who starts by saying Bercow is the best Speaker he has seen in his time in parliament. Campbell asks about the Waspi women (women who have lost out by increases in the state pension age for women, which were not well advertised in advance). Johnson says he is looking at what more can be done. But it is a very difficult issue, he says. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg We\u2019ve got six more weeks of this. Sometimes PMQs is used as an opportunity for a forensic analysis of a particular issue, but today, more than ever, it was dominated by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn rehearsing their election sloganising. And neither leader seems to have an overwhelming advantage. Corbyn focused on the NHS in all his questions. Traditionally this has been Labour\u2019s strongest electoral territory and Corbyn had Johnson on the defensive throughout. His arguments about NHS underfunding and increasing waiting lists were more persuasive than Johnson\u2019s \u201call is fine\u201d bravado, and Johnson was confounded when Corbyn started talking about an individual case, because Corbyn sounded more emphatic than the PM. Corbyn also made it clear that he is going to spend much of the time claiming that a Johnson Brexit would open the door to the further marketisation and privatisation of the NHS. Whether this is wholly true is contestable, but it is a fear that registers with people, and may work well on the doorstep. Johnson was weak on the actual details of how the NHS works. But his attack lines against Corbyn \u2013 accusing him of sweeping anti-Americanism, and wholesale hostility to the involvement of private firms in the NHS (even though many NHS services are privately provided anyway \u2013 were much more powerful than anything Theresa May threw at Corbyn, and delivered with relish. At the end of the exchanges Corbyn and Johnson both segued into wider themes. Corbyn\u2019s line about the election providing a once in a lifetime opportunity for change resonated. But it wasn\u2019t as catchy as Johnson\u2019s argument about Labour offering two referendums, which was just about true enough to register and stick as a key election message. (Labour are certainly promising a second Brexit referendum, which would fill some of the electorate with dread. Corbyn does not favour a second Scottish independence referendum, but he has not 100% ruled one out, and a minority Labour government dependent on SNP support would probably end up agreeing to one.) Johnson\u2019s most lively attack lines were probably those he delivered against the SNP. It is widely assumed that the Tories will lose most of their seats in Scotland, and Ian Blackford had a good line when he said Johnson would be welcome in the country because he boosted SNP support. But, even if this is true, Johnson seemed to enjoy the chance to bang on about \u201cborders at Berwick\u201d. (See 12.35pm.) Labour\u2019s Karen Buck asks how Johnson can justify spending \u00a32bn on no-deal Brexit planning. Johnson claims that under Labour\u2019s Brexit plan the UK would have to spend an extra \u00a31bn a month to stay in the EU. (This is misleading. Because of the transition, even if the UK were leaving the EU at the end of the month, it would still be contributing to the EU as it is now.) UPDATE: Rather than \u201cmisleading\u201d, it would be better to say this was just untrue. The Full Fact factchecking website explains why here. Steve Baker, a Conservative, says thousands of his constituents in Wycombe have relatives living near the line of control in Kashmir. Johnson says this is a serious issue. But it is a matter for India and Pakistan, he says. He says it is not for the UK to decide what the solution must be. The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan says fireworks can cause great disturbance to people and livestock. The Scottish government carried out a consultation that showed people favour greater controls. Does Johnson agree? Johnson says the law should strike a balance. He says animal welfare is important. And Brexit will allow the government to introduce more animal welfare measures. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips says it is a delight to see Bercow\u2019s children in the gallery. She knows Bercow takes his responsibilities as a parent seriously. \u201cAnd now to the prime minister,\u201d she goes on, in a clear jibe at Johnson\u2019s own record as a parent. She asks for an assurance that schools will be properly funded, so that they do not have to close early (a problem in Phillips\u2019 constituency). Johnson says his government will fund schools properly. Phillips\u2019 son will have a great future under them, he says. Nigel Evans, the Tory MP, says that as a former deputy Speaker he wants to pay tribute to what John Bercow did for LGBT rights. He says a survey last week showed that the Ribble Valley (Evans\u2019 constituency) is the happiest place in Britain. A Tory election victory will make them happier. And will Johnson deliver the Brexit people want. Johnson says he will, and he promises more police officers too. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, also offers his best wishes to John Bercow. He says he hopes Bercow enjoys his retirement. Bercow will always be welcome in Scotland, he says. And Blackford wishes England all the best for the rugby on Saturday. He says the PM\u2019s Brexit will take a wrecking ball to the economy and cost it up to \u00a370bn. The PM is willing to throw Scotland under his big red bus to deliver Brexit, he says. Johnson says the greatest damage that can be done to the Scottish economy would come from the SNP\u2019s plan for independence. That would break up the most successful political partnership in history. The SNP have a crackpot plan for borders at Berwick, he says. And the SNP would hand back control of Scottish fisheries to Brussels, just at the point where control is coming back to the UK. Blackford says it is PMQs, not the time for a \u201crant\u201d from the PM. He says Johnson will be welcome in Scotland; every time he comes up, he drives up support for the SNP. The SNP is the only party standing up for Scotland\u2019s interests. Only a vote for the SNP will secure an escape route from Brexit, he says. And it will secure Scotland\u2019s right to protect its future. Johnson says Blackford rants himself. And he says the SNP wants to conceal its record. It is not running health or education well. And if good things are happening in Scotland, it is thanks to Scottish Conservatives. He says they can be relied upon to keep the union together. Corbyn says he is surprised Johnson can keep a straight face when his government has cut so much from the Welsh budget. He says anyone who has tried to get a GP appointment will know the problems. He quotes from a letter from Gillian, who says her mother died as a direct result of the GP shortage. The care her mother got always came after long delays. He says people who have to wait should be sympathised with and supported. Johnson says there are 17,300 more doctors and 17,000 more nurses since 2010. It is time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership. It is all very well to side with Russia and make huge promises and flip-flop on the referendum. Leadership means standing up for the police, for the economy, for wealth creators. And above all, it means getting Brexit done. Corbyn says, coming from a PM who withdrew his own bill, that sounds a bit odd. He says Johnson should have tried to show some empathy. GPs are in short supply. The NHS has suffered its longest spending squeeze ever. He says this election is a once-in-a-generation chance to end underfunding in the NHS. The NHS is up for grabs in a Trump-style trade deal, he says. It is up for grab by US corporations. Isn\u2019t the truth that his government is planning to sell out the NHS? Johnson says he agrees there is a stark choice. It is between economic catastrophe under Labour, which would spend \u00a3196bn on nationalisations. And there would be a political catastrophe under Labour too. There would be two referendums, on Brexit and on Scotland. The UK would suffer \u201ctoxic torpor\u201d. He says his government will invest in schools and education and infrastructure. That is what he is going to deliver. And he will deliver a fantastic future. That is the choice: \u201cdrift and dither\u201d under Labour, or a brighter future under the Tories. Corbyn says of course the NHS needs to import medicines. He just wants it to be done openly. He does not approve of secret talks. Patients are waiting longer for cancer treatment, he says. Why can\u2019t Johnson put the necessary resources into the NHS. Corbyn asks why NHS privatisation has doubled under this government. Nearly \u00a310bn is spent on the NHS under this government. Johnson says, if Corbyn is saying that he does not want dentists and Macmillan nurses to work with the NHS, he is \u201cout of his mind\u201d. Corbyn should pay tribute to the hard work of NHS staff. He should not talk down their achievements. He says a strong economy supports the NHS. Corbyn would wreck that. Corbyn says we should not have private companies like Virgin Health suing the NHS. NHS money should not go into making people richer. Why has the number of people waiting for an operation reached a record high? Johnson says the NHS is working harder and achieving more. He says the SNP government negotiated a much higher price for the cystic fibrosis drug than did NHS England. If people want to know what a Labour NHS would look like, look at Wales. Targets there are routinely missed, he says. Corbyn says he welcomes the cystic fibrosis drug decision. But we have not been told what the deal actually was. He says, although Johnson talks of 40 new hospitals, the real figure is just six. He says the US wants full market access to the NHS. While the government is having secret meeting with US corporations, patients here are suffering. Why has the number of patients waiting longer for urgent NHS treatment tripled over the last nine years? Johnson says waiting lists are improving. He says Corbyn should not be claiming credit for the cystic fibrosis drug decision. The drug company involved is American. Is Corbyn really saying the NHS should not be talking to companies like that? Jeremy Corbyn pays his own tribute to John Bercow. He says Bercow has stood up for parliament. He says Labour hopes to form a government and expects to be held to account. Bercow has also done his bit to open up parliament, Corbyn says. He has changed some of the strange customs, and has promoted diversity. And he has tried to change the Commons from being a gentlemen\u2019s club and turn it into a democratic institution. Corbyn says the PM\u2019s sellout deal with Donald Trump will mean more NHS money going into private profit. He says the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation showed the health service has been repeatedly discussed with US officials. Why does Johnson say the NHS is not on the table? Because it is not on the table, says Johnson. He pays tribute to the way the NHS has recently made a cystic fibrosis drug available. The NHS is getting more money because the economy has been growing under the Tories, he says. Johnson confirms that the scheme for giving grants to thalidomide victims, which is due to end soon, will be reviewed with a view to it continuing. Labour\u2019s Alan Whitehead asks about the news that the Tory manifesto will be written by a lobbyist for the fracking industry. Johnson says the government will soon make an announcement about fracking. But this government yields to no one in its enthusiasm to cut carbon emissions, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying that after PMQs he will open the debate on the Grenfell Tower fire report. He goes on to pay tribute to John Bercow, the Speaker, saying this is his last PMQs. He says Bercow has peppered the chamber with comments like some tennis player machine. (Bercow is a huge tennis fan, and an accomplished player himself.) He says he disagrees with some of Bercow\u2019s innovations as Speaker. But Bercow has done more than anyone since Stephen Hawking to \u201cstretch time\u201d in the chamber. (See 12.03pm.) From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From ITV\u2019s Joe Pike PMQs is about to start. It is only Boris Johnson\u2019s third PMQs since he became prime minister in July. Here is an interesting question from below the line. Psephologists will tell you that there is a minor incumbency advantage in election; ie, sitting candidates do better all other factors considered than new candidates, because voters know who they are. However, the impact is marginal. And since both the Conservatives and Labour have broadly similar numbers of MPs standing down, it is hard to see this factor making a difference. Some of the MPs standing down represent very safe seats. But in places like Putney, which is 35th on a list of Labour target seats and where Justine Greening is standing down, and Ashfield, 10th on a list of Tory target seats and where Gloria De Piero is standing down, the departure of an incumbent might arguably make a bit of a difference. Here is an up-to-date list of MPs standing down from the Institute for Government\u2019s Gavin Freeguard. What is probably more significant is how these departures will affect the composition of the parliamentary Conservative party and the parliamentary Labour party after the election. There are clearly some people around Boris Johnson who want to purge his party of remainers like Philip Hammond. And, in Labour, replacing centrists with leftwingers who back the Corbyn project has long been an ambition of those in the leader\u2019s circle. It is too early to be know quite to what extent both these parties will be transformed after the election, but in both parties the post-election centre of gravity will probably be in a slightly different place. You can read all of the Guardian\u2019s election 2019 coverage here, including my colleague Dan Sabbagh\u2019s analysis of the latest polling. And here are three other articles from today\u2019s papers about the polling situation. Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s lead polling expert, says in an article in the Times (paywall) Boris Johnson cannot afford not to achieve a majority. If the substantial net swing from Labour to Conservative in the present polls were to be realised at the ballot box, there are nearly 50 Labour seats that would fall into the Tory column. Winning those would more than compensate for losses elsewhere. Moreover, they are disproportionately located in the north of England and the Midlands, where many a voter backed leave, though, at 55%, the average support for leave in these seats was only somewhat above the 52% vote across the country as a whole. But while Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes rest on taking Labour seats, the principal foundation underpinning his lead over Mr Corbyn\u2019s party is not any marked success in winning over Labour votes. Rather it rests on his success in squeezing support for the Brexit party ... Above all, this is a contest that Mr Johnson cannot afford to emerge from without an overall majority. Biggest party in a hung parliament will not do. In that event, Labour will potentially be able to look to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP for support \u2013 for they all want to stop Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal in its tracks. The academic Matthew Goodwin says in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) that it is possible for Johnson to win a majority. One crucial piece of the puzzle is in Labour leave seats. Two years ago, Theresa May won only six of these seats and so found herself unable to compensate for losses elsewhere. This time around, Johnson will have to do much better. If his invasion of Labour Brexit territory can go as far as Wolverhampton North East, which was last Tory in 1987, or Stoke-on-Trent North, which has never been held by the Conservatives in the postwar era, a wave of other pro-Brexit Labour seats will likely turn blue, from Dudley North to Barrow and Furness, from Ashfield to Bishop Auckland. A strong majority would surely follow. Consolidating the leave vote would be made infinitely easier were the Brexit party to stand down, or the two parties to form some kind of pact. May did manage to squeeze the Ukip vote down to less than 2%. Farage is polling at about 10%. Sebastian Payne and John Burns-Murdoch in the Financial Times (paywall) say Boris Johnson is in much the same position as Theresa May was at the start of the 2017 campaign. An analysis by the Financial Times of the opinion polls suggests Mr Johnson\u2019s party is facing an electoral landscape hardly changed since the 2017 election was called. Labour was polling on 25% on Tuesday, exactly the same level as when Mrs May called her snap vote. Worryingly for Mr Johnson, however, the Conservatives are significantly further behind than at the start of the last campaign. Whereas the Tories were polling 44% on the day the previous election was called, they are currently projected to garner 36% share of the vote. The political circumstances mirror those of Mrs May who was seeking to win a majority to secure a Brexit deal; Mr Johnson is doing so to achieve the same goal. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Here is Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, on tactical voting. (See 10.32am.) Boris Johnson is on course to win a Commons majority unless remain voters work tactically to block a Tory victory and ensure an EU-backing leadership, according to research. As PA Media reports, the Conservatives would achieve a majority of 44 if no tactical voting took place but anti-Brexit voters could scupper this, according to a study by the Best for Britain campaign. If fewer than a third of remain voters (30%) used their vote tactically they could swing the election to deny the prime minister and to secure a remain majority of four. The research by the anti-Brexit campaign was based on seat-by-seat analysis of 46,000 people over September and October and was released this morning, PA reports. The study does not seem to be online yet, but when it goes up, I will post a link. Now we\u2019re up to 51 MPs standing down. (See 10.04am.) Amber Rudd, the former Conservative work and pensions secretary, who sits as an independent, has announced that she won\u2019t stand as a candidate at the election. Rudd had been talking about possibly standing as an independent (see 9.43am.) But, in an interview with the Evening Standard (edited by her Tory ally, the former chancellor George Osborne), she hinted that she might try to return in the future. She said: I\u2019m not finished with politics, I\u2019m just not standing at this election. Rudd also insisted that her relations with Boris Johnson were good. She told the paper: I spoke to the prime minister and had a good meeting with him a few days ago. I\u2019m really confident of my position. I will be leaving the House of Commons on perfectly good terms with the prime minister and I want him to succeed. That is not how it was a few weeks ago. When she resigned from cabinet in early September, Rudd accused Johnson of \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d because he had removed the whip from the 21 Tories who rebelled over Brexit. She also said she did not think Johnson was seriously committed to getting a Brexit deal. That judgment is now looking rash, in the light of the fact that Johnson did manage to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that passed its second reading in the Commons, although it is arguable that Johnson committed properly to a deal only when rebels like Rudd made it clear to him that a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable to parliament. The Labour MP Adrian Bailey, 73, who represents West Bromwich West, has also announced he is standing down, the Express and Star reports. Gavin Freeguard from the Institute for Government, who is keeping a tally, says Bailey\u2019s decision takes the number of MPs leaving parliament to 49 \u2013 although his table does not include Patrick McLoughlin (see 9.59am), and so there are now at least 50 MPs leaving. The Tory MP Sir Patrick McLoughlin, a former chief whip and former transport secretary, has announced that he is standing down. He is the only former miner in the Conservative parliamentary party and got involved in Tory politics after he was one of the miners who carried on working during the 1984-85 strike. Aged 62, the MP for the Derbyshire Dales has been in parliament since 1986. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Last night, as my colleague Peter Walker reports, the Tories announced that 10 of the MPs who had the whip withdrawn after rebelling on Brexit were being readmitted to the parliamentary party. But the list did not include Amber Rudd, who voluntarily resigned the whip when she resigned as work and pensions secretary, also in protest over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy. This morning on the Today programme, Nick Robinson said he had heard Rudd was coming back to the party. But it seems the situation is not straightforward. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg and the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. One problem might be that Rudd has already told her constituents that she does not want to stand again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of only 346 at the last election. In recent interviews, she said she might stand as an independent somewhere else, but she has not committed herself to a particular constituency. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, will ask the UK government for a section 30 order to proceed with planning a second independence referendum before the end of this year, despite the general election. Speaking to the National newspaper, her spokesman insisted she would make the request this \u201ccalendar year\u201d, saying: As the first minister has made clear, we will be demanding the transfer of power for a referendum before the end of this calendar year. Independence will be at the very heart of this election campaign, and another win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland\u2019s right to choose its own future. This assurance comes despite practical concerns about when exactly Boris Johnson\u2019s government would be able to respond to the request, given that the Commons will shortly be dissolved and no policy announcements are made during the campaign period. Meanwhile, the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has left open the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: \u201c31 January is the next threat if you like for a no-deal Brexit, that\u2019s the next deadline.\u201d Jack added: \u201cWe have a deal which we\u2019re going to put in our manifesto and we\u2019re asking people to give us a mandate to put that deal through and that will bring the matter to a conclusion\u201d. In his Today interview, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked if drug pricing would be on the agenda in trade talks with the US after Brexit. The question was prompted by the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation saying drug pricing has been discussed at meetings between UK and US officials. Hancock said drug prices would be \u201coff the table\u201d in a future trade deal. Asked why it had come up in talks, as Dispatches revealed, he replied: It is off the table. There has been no agreement and no formal meetings. There is no mandate for how these trade talks will happen. He also said it was \u201cagainst the government\u2019s policy to make any changes to drug pricing\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. It may feel like the first full day of the 2019 election campaign, but the legislation for the December poll has not cleared parliament yet and the Commons is still sitting. Here are the items on the agenda for the day. 10am: The first report from the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire is published. 10am: The anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign publishes research intended to assist anti-Brexit tactical voting at the election. 11am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, launches the SNP\u2019s general election campaign at an event in Stirling. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: Johnson is expected to make a statement to MPs about the Grenfell Tower fire report. There will then be a three-hour debate on the report. After 3.30pm: Peers begin their debate on the early parliamentary general election bill. It is due to clear all its Lords stages today. In theory, peers could amend the bill but in reality, given that the House of Commons has agreed to an early election with the backing of all the main parties, it is very hard to imagine circumstances in which unelected peers would want to tamper with this legislation. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was asked if he would like to apologise on behalf of the Conservative party for breaking their \u201cdo or die\u201d promise that Brexit would take place on 31 October. He told the Today programme: No. Because it\u2019s parliament that\u2019s blocked delivering Brexit. Asked if he could clear up whether Amber Rudd would be a Tory candidate in the election, Hancock said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not in the whips office.\u201d He said he considers Rudd a good friend, adding: \u201cAmber chose to resign from the Conservative party,\u201d, before adding: \u201cWhat I\u2019d say is the Conservative party is at its best when we\u2019re a broad church.\u201d He was questioned over his previous statements regarding a general election, after he said that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t want to do it\u201d and it was \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d. \u201cWell I\u2019m certainly not yearning for a general election and haven\u2019t been, but its the only way to move the country forward,\u201d the MP, who has a 17,000 majority in West Suffolk, said, adding: \u201cWe have to respect the result of the referendum because we\u2019re democrats.\u201d Asked if he thought the public could punish the Tories for not delivering Brexit this year: I don\u2019t think anyone in this country thinks that that Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t been doing everything he possibly can to deliver on Brexit. He was the architect of the campaign to leave and he\u2019s now succeeded in getting a new deal with the EU, which many people said was impossible. It\u2019s parliament that has blocked delivering Brexit and that\u2019s why we need a general election. Parliament was given the vote and chose to delay. He said the Tory party had an \u201coptimistic, positive one nation agenda rooted in the centre ground of British politics\u201d, and that this was not the case in 2017. On what the party is offering voters, Hancock said: What we\u2019re proposing is to be able to deliver Brexit on a deal, and then to be able to get on to the NHS, to having 20,000 more police, to the increases in spending on schools and strengthening school standards, on to strengthening the environment, and all the other things on the domestic agenda that only we can deliver, because it\u2019s only by having a majority in parliament we\u2019ll be able to move beyond all the things that have blocked this from all happening in the last few years. Asked if he had doubts about a general election, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Lib Dems \u201cwent into coalition with the Tories basically and the SNP jumped ship\u201d. Meanwhile, no deal was taken off the agenda. Bring it on, let\u2019s have a go, despite it being December and cold and dark .. we\u2019re going to have a real go at this and I think we\u2019ll win. I think we\u2019ll have a majority government by Christmas, so I can\u2019t think of a better Christmas present. Asked on the Today programme about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal popularity, McDonnell pointed towards Boris Johnson\u2019s own ratings and said the Labour leader was \u201cone of the best campaigners I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He said Labour in government would make sure there is a \u201csensible, Brexit option\u201d in contrast to the \u201cdisaster\u201d deal being offered by the Conservatives, but also give people the option to remain. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, let the people decide.\u201d On the possibility of deciding to go forward as an overtly pro-remain party, McDonnell said: \u201cWe\u2019re a much more democratic party than that.\u201d He added there would be \u201ca range of views\u201d in Labour, \u201clike every political party\u201d, confirming the party would seek to convey a nuanced message on doorsteps. The basic principle for us, not like the Lib Dems who are just saying \u2018we\u2019re just going to revoke, that\u2019s it\u2019, not like the Tories who are saying \u2018we\u2019re going to foist upon you virtually a no deal to damage the economy\u2019, we\u2019re saying \u2013 democracy, let the people decide. On the possible ending of EU freedom of movement laws, McDonnell said the UK needed immigration into the country. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an immigration policy which has as much freedom of movement as possible.\u201d McDonnell turned his fire on to the government at the end of the interview. People aren\u2019t mugs out there. They\u2019ve listened to these Tories, they\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done over this near decade to our public services, they\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done to their living standards and quite honestly, most of them will never forgive them for what they have done. Upon the reinstatement of 10 Tory rebels who had the whip removed after backing legislation criticised as delaying Brexit, the Today programme has been speaking to former minister Ed Vaizey \u2013 who has returned \u2013 and Dominic Grieve, who has not. Asked what he had to be welcomed back to the fold, Vaizey said: I had an argument with the prime minister about no deal, and I voted against him to try and get no deal off the table but I have voted with the government ever since. Not because I was sucking up to the prime minister to try to get the whip back but because I wasn\u2019t having arguments with him about his deal or the programme motion and timetable for his deal. So I suspect that is why I\u2019ve got the whip back and others haven\u2019t. Dominic has been a heroic figure in parliament. I\u2019m perhaps, you can either take it, weak or vacillating or pragmatic, depending on your glass half-full, glass half-empty perspective. Asked whether the Conservatives would be fighting the election as a narrow, ideological, factional party, he said: \u201cYes.\u201d Grieve, the former attorney general, said he had fundamental disagreements with Boris Johnson over his leadership and Brexit, and that he assumed the Tories would put a candidate up against him in his constituency of Beaconsfield. This deal is extraordinarily dangerous for the future of our country. It carries with it the implication for the breakup of the United Kingdom and I think also that the likely outcome particularly because of the role of the [European Research Group] in the party that we are going to end up at the end of transition, which is only a few months away now, in fact at risk of crashing out. The very thing Ed doesn\u2019t want. If the prime minister wins a working majority .. in six months we will be in very difficult and dangerous waters for our country. I will run as an independent. I\u2019ve made that decision. I have no idea what the outcome will be. Logically, I probably ought to lose. It\u2019s a very safe Conservative seat. And if normal loyalties prevail then a Conservative candidate will be elected against me. But I think my constituents are entitled to a choice. The Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, has said her party\u2019s \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message is resonating with remainers as she positioned herself as a future prime minister. She told the Today programme: People recognise our consistency and standing up for what we believe in. I don\u2019t think that the choice that we are being offered between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn is anywhere near good enough. Neither of those men are fit to lead our country and be prime minister. And I know there are millions of people out there who are longing for a positive alternative that is looking to the future. She said polling shows they are \u201cwithin a small swing\u201d of winning \u201chundreds of seats\u201d, citing the massive increase in seats for the SNP in 2015 as evidence of sudden swings. Asked if she was ruling out supporting either Johnson or Corbyn as prime minister, Swinson said: I can\u2019t be clearer. Neither Boris Johnson nor Corbyn is fit to be prime minister. Our country deserves a better choice, and I am standing as candidate to be prime minister. Asked if she would be prepared to enter into some kind of informal deal with the Tories or Labour without those two men at the helm, she said they are parties that want to \u201cforce through Brexit on our country\u201d. She added: It\u2019s going to be bad for our country. And they both have that shared vision for the future. The Liberal Democrats have a different positive alternative vision for the future. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national co-ordinator, says it would be \u201cmadness to stick with things as they are\u201d and she claims that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Labour MPs, voters and \u201cmost of the public\u201d understand there is now an opportunity for fundamental change. \u201cPeople can no longer tolerate the incompetence and callousness, and I would say dishonesty, of this government,\u201d she told the Today programme. Asked if she will be giving advice on voting tactically, Parker said: We will be advising all of our members to get out there and campaign for Labour, wherever they are in the country. It\u2019s only a Labour government that will both end this Tory Brexit madness and end austerity and help us rebuild Britain. Ben Bradshaw, MP and senior Labour backbencher, said his party will do better in the election than some may think, and said Labour will be \u201ctotally united\u201d as candidates and MPs. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I actually think Labour will do much much better than the pundits and a lot of commentators are predicting. The reason that we thought the referendum was the best way is a democratic reason. In a binary issue like Brexit, the only way of resolving that with democratic legitimacy is to hold another referendum and Labour is the only party offering that now in the general election. That\u2019s why you have to vote Labour if you want to stop Brexit. Conservatives\u2019 manifesto being written by fracking lobbyist The Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto is being written by a lobbyist for the fracking company Cuadrilla and major internet companies such as Amazon and Facebook, raising concerns about whether her paying clients could influence the party\u2019s policies. Rachel Wolf is drawing up the Conservatives\u2019 platform for the general election while continuing to work as a partner at Public First, a business that lobbies ministers on behalf of the shale gas industry. Cuadrilla is facing a battle to keep its fracking projects on track in the UK at a time when public opinion is moving against the extraction of shale gas, with the Labour party threatening to ban the practice altogether. Her company also represents the Internet Association, the trade body for major tech companies including Uber, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Microsoft and Amazon. The organisation is attempting to influence the government\u2019s policies on online harms, the regulation of social media and taxes on digital companies \u2013 all of which are likely to feature in some form in the Conservative manifesto. There is no suggestion Wolf is breaking any rules by writing the Conservative manifesto while running a lobbying company representing major businesses, given her company makes regular declarations of its clients to the public lobbying registrar in line with current legal requirements. However, Francis Ingham, of the Public Relations and Communications Association, which represents many leading PR and lobbying agencies, but not Public First, said: \u201cCommunications professionals have a duty to avoid conflicts of interests. There is never an excuse. The PRCA code \u2013 to which all members are bound \u2013 is explicit in this regard.\u201d Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet minister with responsibility for the lobbying industry, said it was an \u201coutrage to democracy that the frackers, the tax avoiders and the zero-hour exploiters will have the biggest say when it comes to Tory policy\u201d. He pledged that a Labour government would strengthen lobbying regulations if it won the next general election. Full story is here: So, how are the parties selling themselves in these early days of the campaign that hasn\u2019t officially launched yet? Well, the announcement of the general election barely been made before the online campaigns kicked off with videos on social media. The indisputable winner of the first round is Labour, which not only has the best backing track (Invincible by US rapper Jonezen), but has also racked up the most views \u2013 1.2m at the time of writing \u2013 by a very large margin. Though points to the Lib Dems who didn\u2019t launch with a campaign video, but did launch a Bring It On campaign meme. Very late last night Owen Smith, Labour MP for Pontypridd, and the man who made a bid to topple Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2016, announced he would not be standing in the election. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news and won\u2019t there be a lot of it over the next six weeks? So, we\u2019re going to have an election, which means the politicians and party machines will be in overdrive trying to convince you of who to vote for. We\u2019ll bring you the news, the speeches, the campaign events, the pitches, the pictures and the gaffes from the campaign trail over the next six weeks. As for today, the Lords are expected to debate the early parliamentary general election bill at 3:30pm, giving the rubber stamp of approval to the 12 December election. Boris Johnson will face prime minister\u2019s questions at midday before a general debate on the Grenfell Tower inquiry. If the Lords pass Johnson\u2019s legislation, as is expected, parliament will sit for one more week before dissolving next Wednesday for a campaign of five weeks. Speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, Johnson argued that a \u201cnew and revitalised\u201d parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union. \u201cWe are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse,\u201d he told MPs. But he later struck a cautious note, telling a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be \u201ca tough election but we will do the best we can\u201d. He told them he had not wanted an election but was forced to seek one because Labour would have \u201csliced and diced\u201d his Brexit legislation beyond recognition. In a move to unite his party, the prime minister decided to readmit 10 of the 21 MPs he expelled last month for defying his Brexit plan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter and via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com), I\u2019ll be at the helm for the next hour or so before handing over to my colleagues who will steer you through for the rest of the day.",

      "bodyText": "Russia underscored its role in the political future of Syria as the Moscow-backed Syrian constitutional committee met for the first time under UN auspices to chart a political settlement to end the eight-and-a-half-year civil war. The meeting \u2013 a key proposal from Moscow \u2013 in Geneva is being overseen by the UN special envoy for Syria Geir Pederson with expectations low that the Syrian government, in an increasingly strong military position, will see the need to make any major political concessions to secure western recognition. The talks are being held against the backdrop of fresh fighting in north-east Syria between the Syrian army and Turkish-backed troops. The clashes took place near the border town of Ras al-Ayn on Wednesday, Syrian state media reported, as Ankara warned it reserved the right to launch another cross-border offensive against Kurdish forces in the region. Foreign ministers from Russia, Iran and Turkey were in Geneva on Tuesday night to meet negotiators, even though Pedersen had asked all countries to stay away and leave the talks as an exclusively \u201cSyrian owned, Syrian led process\u201d. The three countries put out a joint statement before the opening, welcoming the committee they helped to create and insisting no external timetable should be imposed upon its work. But in a sign of Russia\u2019s influence, the government and some of the opposition delegation arrived in Geneva on a Russian-chartered plane. The aim of the meeting is to agree a new constitution for Syria, but it is unclear if this will mean redrafting the existing constitution, written in 2012, or starting from scratch. No deadline has been set for the end of talks, but Pedersen has said all sides had promised to work expeditiously. Speaking at the opening ceremony in Geneva, the Syrian opposition co-chair, Hadi al-Bahra, said: \u201cThe memory of 1 million victims must guide us out of this dark tunnel.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is time for us to believe that victory in Syria is achieving justice and peace, not winning the war. We must respect the right of families to know the fate of their loved ones.\u201d He pointed out that 65% of Syrian infrastructure had been destroyed since the war started \u2013 compared with the 60% that had been destroyed in Germany in the second world war \u2013 and that half the country\u2019s population had been displaced or had become refugees. The Syrian government co-chair, Ahmad Kuzbari, gave little ground in his speech, pointing out the country already had a modern constitution, but said he was open to considering \u201cany possible amendments or even a new constitution that would improve the reality of our people\u201d. He said the outcome had to ensure the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, alongside the rejection of any direct or indirect interference in Syrian affairs. Pederson, sitting between the two chairs, acknowledged it was hard for the 150 people to be in the same room, but the very fact the meeting was happening could be considered a sign of hope. Previous Syria peace talks in Geneva foundered over a Russian unwillingness to press the negotiating team of President Bashar al-Assad to engage, but the current process is a largely Russian construct, and the most senior Russian diplomat on Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, has been preparing the ground. Donald Trump, by withdrawing US troops from north-east Syria, has reduced the little remaining leverage Washington possessed at the talks. Russia first proposed a 150-strong committee in January 2018 at a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and the idea was implicitly seen as Moscow\u2019s alternative to the UN\u2019s brokerage. The committee has 50 Syrian government delegates loyal to the Syrian president,, 50 members of the Syrian opposition largely supported by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and 50 civilian representatives. Disputes between the regional powers over the composition of the civilian group, some still unresolved, held up the committee being announced until September. The weakened opposition team is a coalition of at least five different platforms and has nominated Hadi Bahra as co-chair for the committee. Bahra said his side had already prepared a draft constitution, adding that he believed the negotiations need not last longer than two to six months. A smaller tripartite 45-strong committee is due to undertake the detailed drafting of the constitution. The talks \u2013 the fourth attempt to end the war through negotiation \u2013 face myriad obstacles and Pedersen has played down the prospect of a breakthrough. One difficulty is that the committee must adopt resolutions either by consensus or with a 75% majority, seen by some as a recipe for paralysis. Although seven Kurds are on the committee, the political wing of the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces in north-east Syria has been excluded. The Kurdish Syrian autonomous administration objected to the exclusion on Monday. Istanbul regards the Kurdish YPG, the primary component of the Syrian Democratic Forces, as the political wing of the \u201cterrorist\u201d PKK, and is driving their forces from the border with Turkey. Deserted by their former allies, the US, the YPG has been forced to start Russian-brokered talks to form a military deal with Assad\u2019s forces. Assad in the past has opposed a federated Syria with an semi-autonomous Kurdish province. Assad\u2019s foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, has already warned that \u201cthe hostile Turkish incursion into north-east Syria seriously threatens the work of the constitutional committee\u201d. There is intense pressure on the Syrian opposition to recognise the weakness of their position and scale back their demands. They have already complained the committee\u2019s remit abandons previous vital commitments in UN resolutions to form a transitional governing body within six months, release detainees and provide information on missing persons.

      "bodyText": "Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil and former secretary of state in the Trump administration, has denied in court that the oil and gas giant committed fraud by concealing from investors the true financial impact of the climate crisis. Tillerson told the New York supreme court that Exxon had acted properly over disclosing its financial exposure to climate-related regulations while he was chief executive. Leticia James, the New York state attorney general, is suing Exxon over claims it misled investors over the costs associated with the climate crisis. Exxon is accused of misleading investors over the business risks caused by regulations to address the climate crisis. The company is accused of covering up the costs it will incur from government rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The case represents just the second time a climate case has gone to trial in the US. Exxon has long been a target for environmentalists, not only for being a major contributor to the climate crisis but also over revelations that it knew for decades that burning oil and gas would dangerously heat the planet. New York\u2019s lawsuit accuses Exxon of using a public \u201cproxy cost\u201d of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions to account for regulations that would limit planet-warming emissions, while internally using figures of $40 a ton, or nothing at all, to allow it to make more environmentally damaging investments. An Exxon spokesman has previously said that it properly applies two different metrics \u2013 a \u201cproxy cost\u201d, intended to reflect the impact of all climate policies on global demand, and a greenhouse gas cost which relates to actual levies placed on fossil fuel projects in a certain jurisdiction. Under questioning, Tillerson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how else to model what future policy impacts might be.

Citing new data, Lamorgese said that organised crime groups \u201chave made extensive transformations\u201d while adopting \u201cincreasingly complex\u201d models of criminal activity. \u201cCriminal organisations are ever more sophisticated as they manage to infiltrate important economic sectors in order to clean up illicitly accumulated money,\u201d said Lamorgese at a hearing with the Italian parliament\u2019s anti-mafia commission. \u201cThe mafia continues to weigh heavily on our institutions and economic system.\u201d Lamorgese, who was appointed interior minister in early September, said \u2019Ndrangheta, which emerged in the southern region of Calabria, continues to be Italy\u2019s most powerful mafia organisation. The crime group is made up of networks of hundreds of family gangs, which, over recent decades, have managed to extend their influence to industries in Italy\u2019s richer north and across the world, raking in billions from drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering. A study by the Demoskopia research institute in 2013 claimed the \u2019Ndrangheta made more money than Deutsche Bank and McDonald\u2019s put together, with a turnover of \u20ac53bn (\u00a344bn). The organisation is even more feared and secretive than Sicily\u2019s Cosa Nostra, which fell into a state of flux in November 2017 when its boss of bosses, Salvatore \u201cTot\u00f2\u201d Riina, died in prison, where he had spent almost a quarter of a century.

Mafia groups have infiltrated almost every area of business, including healthcare, renewable energy, waste management and tourism, while maintaining a hand in their more traditional construction sector. Gangs have also penetrated the food chain, seizing control of farms, controlling distribution and counterfeiting food products, including cheese, wine and olive oil. Their growth beyond Italy also remains strong, especially in Europe and South America. One of Italy\u2019s top cocaine dealers, Nicola Assisi, from \u2019Ndrangheta, was arrested in Brazil earlier this year after five years on the run. Lamorgese reiterated that the fight against the mafia was a government priority as she revealed that almost \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) assets, including businesses, property and furniture, had been either seized or confiscated from the mafia since the beginning of the year. In 2018, mafia assets totalling \u20ac9bn were seized or confiscated, up from \u20ac5.4bn in 2017. In 2018, 59 mafia fugitives were arrested, and 45 since January.

His family described Phil, 53, as a \u201cstrong, brave man\u201d who had been struggling with his mental health after recently disclosing past trauma. He scaled the 88-metre grade II-listed Dixon\u2019s Chimney in Carlisle city centre in the early hours of Monday morning but somehow ended up hanging from one foot at the top of it. A major operation was mounted to try to rescue him, including the help of Cumbria fire and rescue, a coastguard helicopter, police, paramedics, Great North air ambulance, Penrith mountain rescue team, and rope rescue specialists from the Lancashire fire and rescue service.

Microglia are a type of immune cell that play an important part in the building of a baby\u2019s brain. However, if these cells go into overdrive as a result of inflammation \u2013 often because of a bacterial infection of the foetal membranes, a maternal infection or even sepsis after delivery of the baby \u2013 they can cause harm to the child\u2019s brain. In particular, they can damage white matter, reducing the degree to which neurons are insulated and thereby affecting connectivity in the brain. It is thought that of the 15 million infants born before 37 weeks every year, up to 9 million are left with lifelong harm to the brain, sometimes resulting in conditions such as epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Now researchers say they have found a signalling pathway in these immune cells that is behind their transformation. \u201cWe have actually identified the immune switch that turns these immune cells in the developing brain from being helpful in building a brain and taking care of the brain to causing damage,\u201d said Dr Bobbi Fleiss from RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, a co-author of the study. What is more, the researchers say, it might even be possible to intervene and turn rogue microglia back into helpful workhorses. Writing in the journal Brain, Fleiss and colleagues reported how they took mouse pups just after birth and injected them with proteins that mimic an infection in the mother or foetus, inducing the transformation of microglia from helpful to harmful. The team said mice of this age were comparable in their development to a human pregnancy of 22 to 32 weeks. The team then found that if they selectively killed off these microglia, the mice ended up with less of a reduction in the insulation of their neurons. That, they said, backed up the idea that overactive microglia were involved in brain injury. They then looked at which genes were switched on or off when the mouse was exposed to the inflammation-causing proteins, and identified a signalling pathway known as Wnt that appeared to be involved in the microglia going into \u201coverdrive\u201d. The researchers carried out further experiments in a range of animals, finding drugs that specifically dampen down the signalling pathway that activates the microglia. Analysis of human tissue from premature babies also showed that when inflammation was triggered, microglia became activated and lower levels of molecules linked to the Wnt pathway were produced. In other words, the team had found the \u201cswitch\u201d that turned the microglia bad. Further work combining genetical analysis of premature babies with brain imaging data backed up the idea that the Wnt pathway is important. \u201cWe were able to show that in the human even the natural, normal level of variation in this pathway actually has an effect on brain development, so [targeting this Wnt pathway] may actually be a really novel way for us to move forward to develop a treatment to prevent brain damage in those babies,\u201d said Fleiss. If these genetic findings hold up, she added, they might help to predict which babies with brain injury might be at greater risk of poorer long-term outcomes. \u201cAt the moment it is very difficult to predict from one baby to the next what will happen,\u201d said Fleiss. And there could even be treatments.

      "body": "<p>For two and a half years, British politics has been a pantomime played out in the corridors and boardrooms of Westminster and Brussels. The electorate has barely managed to press their noses against the glass and peer in: much of the Brexit debacle has unfolded out of sight and scrutiny. Instead, ever since Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to the premiership, the country has effectively been treated to a one-sided general election campaign; the opposition has been all but squeezed out of media coverage. All of this now changes: the spectators can storm the stage.</p> <p>In the 00s, it was often claimed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/nov/06/socialsciences.polls\" title=\"\">political apathy</a> had replaced political participation. Membership of political parties and electoral turnout were both said to be in irreversible decline. Who can bemoan the lack of political participation now? This is our age of mass politics: the Scottish independence movement, Farageism and Brexitism, a youth-led climate emergency movement, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour, which began as a husk and flowered into western Europe\u2019s biggest political party. And it is this, in large part, that makes the election so unpredictable, so volatile. There is a politicised populace united around a single but fundamental point \u2013 desire for rupture with a status quo that never enjoyed enthusiastic support and now has lost popular acquiescence. If Johnson triumphs, his government will wrench Britain out of the EU with a deal that threatens to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-punches-20755183\" title=\"\">punch a hole</a> the size of Wales in the economy, and use Brexit to remake British society in a hyper-Thatcherite mould. Labour\u2019s mission, on the other hand, is to up-end a generation-long experiment in market fundamentalism and redistribute wealth and power away from its principal beneficiaries. Each represents an abandonment of the old order, even though the Tories\u2019 version will benefit the vested interests who bankroll them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/30/election-mps-cynicism-boris-johnson-hard-brexit\">The only reason we\u2019re having an election is because of MPs\u2019 cynicism | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Tories\u2019 strategy is clear: use Brexit to torture Labour by dividing its electoral coalition and drowning out its domestic agenda. Their secret weapons are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/lib-dems-could-win-hundreds-more-seats-in-election-says-swinson\" title=\"\">Jo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats</a>, who they hope will siphon enough votes from Labour to deliver scores of marginals to the Conservatives \u2013 even though Labour is now the only major party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Most of the British press will act as Johnson\u2019s cheerleaders, and the Tories\u2019 traditional donors \u2013 hedge fund managers, financiers, magnates \u2013 will keep them flush with money.</p> <p>But it is mass politics that presents the party with a challenge. After MPs voted to approve a December election, the grassroots pro-Corbyn Momentum movement launched an appeal to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LabourUK/comments/dp6kcs/dawn_foster_bloody_hell_momentum_aimed_to_raise/\" title=\"\">raise \u00a350,000</a> in 48 hours; instead, it raised \u00a3100,000 in the first 12 hours, twice as much as in the same time period in 2017, and with an average donation of \u00a324.40. It belies claims that enthusiasm for the Labour leadership has collapsed among a demoralised membership. And if that commitment to part with money is matched by a willingness to knock on doors, the party will be able to partly bypass an overwhelmingly hostile press and talk to voters one-on-one.</p> <p>It is mass politics, too, which challenges the Tories\u2019 ability to monomaniacally focus on Brexit at the exclusion of all else. Polling shows that the environment has risen dramatically as a political priority for voters since January: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/30/climate-crisis-affects-how-majority-will-vote-in-uk-election-poll\" title=\"\">a new poll</a> finds that two-thirds of Britons believe the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing humanity, with more than half declaring that it would affect how they voted. This is, in part, down to protests by the Youth Strike 4 Climate and Extinction Rebellion. Labour\u2019s radical policies for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/25/labour-green-new-deal\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a> \u2013 which link tackling the climate emergency to creating jobs, overhauling public transport and improving living standards \u2013 have yet to cut through. But in an election campaign, we can expect there to be an appetite to hear such proposals.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s strategy is to distance his administration from a lost decade of Tory rule. That deception cannot be allowed to pass. And he must now contend with how those nine years have politicised large sections of the electorate. Wages are still lower than they were before the crash.

      "bodyText": "For two and a half years, British politics has been a pantomime played out in the corridors and boardrooms of Westminster and Brussels. The electorate has barely managed to press their noses against the glass and peer in: much of the Brexit debacle has unfolded out of sight and scrutiny. Instead, ever since Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to the premiership, the country has effectively been treated to a one-sided general election campaign; the opposition has been all but squeezed out of media coverage. All of this now changes: the spectators can storm the stage. In the 00s, it was often claimed that political apathy had replaced political participation. Membership of political parties and electoral turnout were both said to be in irreversible decline. Who can bemoan the lack of political participation now? This is our age of mass politics: the Scottish independence movement, Farageism and Brexitism, a youth-led climate emergency movement, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour, which began as a husk and flowered into western Europe\u2019s biggest political party. And it is this, in large part, that makes the election so unpredictable, so volatile. There is a politicised populace united around a single but fundamental point \u2013 desire for rupture with a status quo that never enjoyed enthusiastic support and now has lost popular acquiescence. If Johnson triumphs, his government will wrench Britain out of the EU with a deal that threatens to punch a hole the size of Wales in the economy, and use Brexit to remake British society in a hyper-Thatcherite mould. Labour\u2019s mission, on the other hand, is to up-end a generation-long experiment in market fundamentalism and redistribute wealth and power away from its principal beneficiaries. Each represents an abandonment of the old order, even though the Tories\u2019 version will benefit the vested interests who bankroll them. The Tories\u2019 strategy is clear: use Brexit to torture Labour by dividing its electoral coalition and drowning out its domestic agenda. Their secret weapons are Jo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats, who they hope will siphon enough votes from Labour to deliver scores of marginals to the Conservatives \u2013 even though Labour is now the only major party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Most of the British press will act as Johnson\u2019s cheerleaders, and the Tories\u2019 traditional donors \u2013 hedge fund managers, financiers, magnates \u2013 will keep them flush with money. But it is mass politics that presents the party with a challenge. After MPs voted to approve a December election, the grassroots pro-Corbyn Momentum movement launched an appeal to raise \u00a350,000 in 48 hours; instead, it raised \u00a3100,000 in the first 12 hours, twice as much as in the same time period in 2017, and with an average donation of \u00a324.40. It belies claims that enthusiasm for the Labour leadership has collapsed among a demoralised membership. And if that commitment to part with money is matched by a willingness to knock on doors, the party will be able to partly bypass an overwhelmingly hostile press and talk to voters one-on-one. It is mass politics, too, which challenges the Tories\u2019 ability to monomaniacally focus on Brexit at the exclusion of all else. Polling shows that the environment has risen dramatically as a political priority for voters since January: a new poll finds that two-thirds of Britons believe the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing humanity, with more than half declaring that it would affect how they voted. This is, in part, down to protests by the Youth Strike 4 Climate and Extinction Rebellion. Labour\u2019s radical policies for a Green New Deal \u2013 which link tackling the climate emergency to creating jobs, overhauling public transport and improving living standards \u2013 have yet to cut through. But in an election campaign, we can expect there to be an appetite to hear such proposals. Johnson\u2019s strategy is to distance his administration from a lost decade of Tory rule. That deception cannot be allowed to pass. And he must now contend with how those nine years have politicised large sections of the electorate. Wages are still lower than they were before the crash. Parents have been roused to protest over the slashing of per pupil funding. As homeownership collapses, and council housing stock has been sold off en masse, an entire generation has been driven into a private landlord sector where rents are extortionate and security absent. As cuts to benefits have expanded from disabled people to the low-paid, attitudes towards social security have transformed, with most no longer deeming entitlements as too generous. It is for Labour to pin the blame for these crises on Johnson and his colleagues, and to portray attempts to shift the conversation away from them as arrogant Tory indifference. Brexit itself cannot necessarily serve as the distraction Johnson desires, either: in the last pre-election prime minister\u2019s questions, the Tory leader was left rattled by Corbyn\u2019s focus on the risk of the NHS being flogged off to US multinationals under a Trump trade deal. But focusing on the misery of Tory Britain is a trap. Instead, Labour\u2019s campaign should exude a relentless optimism: a sense that a nation this wealthy has the resources to overcome every injustice and challenge if the willpower is there. The age of mass politics is one that demands radical solutions rather than tinkering. Labour may begin the campaign with dire polling, but Tory despair under Theresa May has given away once again to hubris. The movements and struggles of the last decade have politicised millions to demand a breach with a failing social order.

      "bodyText": "California battled wildfires fueled by fierce winds across the state, including a new blaze that swept dangerously close to the Ronald Reagan presidential library in the Simi Valley near Los Angeles. The fire is one of several that firefighters are battling in the north and south. Meanwhile more than a million people across the state remained in darkness amid widespread power shutoffs. Meteorologists had warned southern California could see extreme winds on Wednesday that would severely complicate the efforts to control several blazes, including a fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles that had prompted evacuations on Monday. Winds gusts topped 50mph (80km/h) in some southern California areas before dawn. The Simi Valley fire spread quickly and prompted the evacuation of the Ronald Reagan presidential library and nearby homes. Gusty winds fueled several other, smaller new fires on Wednesday, including one north of Malibu, and another in Kern county in the Central Valley. Currently more than 5,000 firefighters in California are working the wildfires. Fire agencies in other states have offered backup, Montana sending 20 engines and 72 firefighters to California, while Idaho plans to send five fire engines and 17 personnel. In the wine country north of San Francisco, winds topped out at 70mph (112km/h) and began to ease early on Wednesday, but forecasters said fire danger would remain because of continuing breezes and very dry air. Firefighters said they made progress overnight in tackling the Kincade fire, which had burned 86 homes and charred an area more than twice the size of San Francisco.

More than 130,000 people remained under evacuation orders in northern California as firefighters continued to battle the Kincade fire. Frustration and anger mounted across the region as PG&amp;E began the third round of sweeping blackouts in a week aimed at preventing its electrical equipment from being fouled by wind-whipped branches or toppling and sparking wildfires.

Extreme red flag warning On Tuesday, the National Weather Service (NWS) had issued an \u201cextreme red flag warning\u201d for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, starting late Tuesday and into Thursday evening. Coupled with tinder-dry brush and low humidity, they could blow smoldering fires back to life and spread embers to start new blazes, authorities warned. On Monday, thousands of people had been forced to evacuate because of a fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. About 9,000 people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and LeBron James, remained under evacuation orders on Wednesday.

The power line had been operating safely and the DWP had cut away brush and trees from around the line, officials said. Los Angeles\u2019s mayor, Eric Garcetti, called it an \u201cact of God\u201d. The cause of the Kincade fire has yet to be established, but firefighters battling the blaze over the weekend discovered what appeared to be a broken jumper by a PG&amp;E transmission tower that had lost power. PG&amp;E had shut off power to the area as part of planned shutoff, but the transmission lines remained energized.

      "body": "<p>No one has had much fun with Bake Off this year, have they? For a show lauded as the balm for all our pains the 2019 season has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/great-british-bake-off-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it\" title=\"\">one massive upset</a>. As upsetting as a deflating souffl\u00e9, in fact. Which, coincidentally, is exactly what played the star role in the final\u2019s ultimate technical. Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/29/the-great-british-bake-off-final-review-even-paul-hollywood-couldnt-bear-it\" title=\"\">finalists</a> had to double bake six stilton souffl\u00e9s, with biscuits, in under 70 minutes, and, boy, did they struggle. Alice had never made a roux; Steph didn\u2019t know what a bain-marie was. Instead of impossibly light creamy, cheesy clouds, we got puddles. And underbaked crackers. The general feeling is that the show has got too difficult, too obscure and too cruel. But has it, really? To find out, I went through the final technicals in every year\u2019s Bake Off since it started.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps we\u2019re homing in on the wrong thing: it\u2019s not the challenges but the judges</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first season, in 2010, didn\u2019t come with a final technical. But given that contestants had to make a total of 96 mini bakes, the entire episode qualified as a mountain to climb.</p> <p>The following year, the bakers had to make a sachertorte in two hours and 40 minutes. Cookbook author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/luisa-weiss-kitchen-encounters-instagram\" title=\"\">Luisa Weiss</a> tells me that, as long as you have a recipe, this wouldn\u2019t be beyond the pale. Similarly, 2012\u2019s 25 fondant fancies and 2013\u2019s 12 perfectly shaped pretzels would not have been impossible. In 2014, things heated up. The finalists had to do victoria sandwiches, tartes au citron and scones \u2013 12 of each \u2013 in under two hours with little instruction. Jeremy Lee, the chef-proprietor of Quo Vadis in London, shrieks in horror. \u201cYou do wonder why anyone would enter this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality is most really good baking recipes are quite lengthy.\u201d Having to do this much in that little time seems to him \u201cbrutal and unkind\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in 2015 the contestants were given a Paul Hollywood recipe for raspberry-flavoured mille-feuilles iced, as professional p\u00e2tissiers would do, in fondant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2015/aug/25/my-kitchen-gallery-regula-ysewijn\" title=\"\">Regula Ysewijn</a>, one of the judges on the Belgian version of the show, winces at the thought. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very hard one,\u201d \u2013 the hardest, for her, of all the years\u2019 final technicals. The pastry alone would flummox you, and did for Tamal Ray that year.</p> <p>In 2016, they had to make a victoria sandwich without a recipe in 90 minutes. Lee says you would have to have made a fair few in your time to swing that. As this is the Great British Bake Off, though, you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting contestants to have done that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/great-british-bake-off-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it\">Bake Off is broken \u2013 here's how to fix it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It strikes Ysewijn that the iced ginger biscuits in 2017, last year\u2019s campfire pittas with accompanying dips, and this year\u2019s souffl\u00e9s haven\u2019t been any harder. She says her team, without consulting their British counterparts, considered souffl\u00e9s this year, too, because of their instructive value. As she points out: \u201cYou\u2019re making a programme, not just a competition. You want people at home to learn something from it.\u201d She says the challenges are tested, both by the setters and amateur bakers, to ensure they are not impossible.</p> <p>Perhaps, as fans, we are homing in on the wrong thing to criticise: it\u2019s not the challenges but the judges. As the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/uk/food-news/a29620025/great-british-bake-off-paul-hollywood-hardest-to-pick-winner/\" title=\"\">Delish</a> website put it when Prue Leith suggested it\u2019s not up to them to get it right, but the contestants: \u201cBlimey, Prue.\u201d If the warmth has eluded our favourite heartwarming show, she and Hollywood might have something to answer for.</p>",

As upsetting as a deflating souffl\u00e9, in fact. Which, coincidentally, is exactly what played the star role in the final\u2019s ultimate technical. Our finalists had to double bake six stilton souffl\u00e9s, with biscuits, in under 70 minutes, and, boy, did they struggle. Alice had never made a roux; Steph didn\u2019t know what a bain-marie was. Instead of impossibly light creamy, cheesy clouds, we got puddles. And underbaked crackers. The general feeling is that the show has got too difficult, too obscure and too cruel. But has it, really? To find out, I went through the final technicals in every year\u2019s Bake Off since it started. The first season, in 2010, didn\u2019t come with a final technical. But given that contestants had to make a total of 96 mini bakes, the entire episode qualified as a mountain to climb. The following year, the bakers had to make a sachertorte in two hours and 40 minutes. Cookbook author Luisa Weiss tells me that, as long as you have a recipe, this wouldn\u2019t be beyond the pale. Similarly, 2012\u2019s 25 fondant fancies and 2013\u2019s 12 perfectly shaped pretzels would not have been impossible. In 2014, things heated up. The finalists had to do victoria sandwiches, tartes au citron and scones \u2013 12 of each \u2013 in under two hours with little instruction. Jeremy Lee, the chef-proprietor of Quo Vadis in London, shrieks in horror. \u201cYou do wonder why anyone would enter this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality is most really good baking recipes are quite lengthy.\u201d Having to do this much in that little time seems to him \u201cbrutal and unkind\u201d. Meanwhile, in 2015 the contestants were given a Paul Hollywood recipe for raspberry-flavoured mille-feuilles iced, as professional p\u00e2tissiers would do, in fondant. Regula Ysewijn, one of the judges on the Belgian version of the show, winces at the thought. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very hard one,\u201d \u2013 the hardest, for her, of all the years\u2019 final technicals. The pastry alone would flummox you, and did for Tamal Ray that year. In 2016, they had to make a victoria sandwich without a recipe in 90 minutes. Lee says you would have to have made a fair few in your time to swing that. As this is the Great British Bake Off, though, you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting contestants to have done that. It strikes Ysewijn that the iced ginger biscuits in 2017, last year\u2019s campfire pittas with accompanying dips, and this year\u2019s souffl\u00e9s haven\u2019t been any harder. She says her team, without consulting their British counterparts, considered souffl\u00e9s this year, too, because of their instructive value. As she points out: \u201cYou\u2019re making a programme, not just a competition. You want people at home to learn something from it.\u201d She says the challenges are tested, both by the setters and amateur bakers, to ensure they are not impossible. Perhaps, as fans, we are homing in on the wrong thing to criticise: it\u2019s not the challenges but the judges. As the Delish website put it when Prue Leith suggested it\u2019s not up to them to get it right, but the contestants: \u201cBlimey, Prue.\u201d If the warmth has eluded our favourite heartwarming show, she and Hollywood might have something to answer for.",

      "bodyText": "The silence surrounding the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s treatment by the press has become a roar. More than 70 female MPs signed a letter this week in \u201csolidarity\u201d with Meghan after she spoke about her treatment by sections of the media. The letter outlined attempts \u201cto cast aspersions\u201d on her character. It also attempted to address the nature of these attacks: \u201cWe are calling out what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories,\u201d it read. However, this treatment can be described as only one thing: racist. Not saying so explicitly is part of a growing trend \u2013 the word \u201cracist\u201d is now dodged with more fervour than racial slurs themselves. At one point, there was concern that \u201cracist\u201d was being used willy-nilly; now, it feels as if those in power are thumbing through a thesaurus with kid gloves, searching hastily for synonyms. The phrasing has become almost comically creative: take \u201cracially charged,\u201d \u201cracially loaded,\u201d \u201cracially divisive\u201d and \u201cracially tinged\u201d, as if bigotry is administered in doses with a pipette. \u201cHomophobically tinged\u201d and \u201csexistly charged\u201d sound equally ludicrous, but I am yet to see them used in lieu of the real terms. When Trump tweeted that some of the people of colour in Congress should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary at the time, resolved not to \u201cuse the R-word\u201d (his censoring of it, as if it were akin to the N-word, says it all). But who will resolve to use it? And if Trump\u2019s tweets didn\u2019t call for it, what occasion does? Many journalists are grappling with editorial guidelines that are making their jobs more difficult. Look at the censuring of the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty, after she said, in relation to Trump\u2019s comment, that every time she had been told to \u201cgo back to where [she] came from, that was embedded in racism\u201d. Attempts at impartiality lead to inaccuracy \u2013 when the Republican congressman Steve King asked why the terms \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d were offensive, NBC News originally told its staff to \u201cbe careful to avoid characterising [King\u2019s] remarks as racist.\u201d Almost no behaviour seems to merit the descriptor, bar donning a Ku Klux Klan costume (except at Halloween, of course, when its white supremacist roots are apparently neutralised by \u201cbanter\u201d) and using the N-word (but not in song lyrics, of course, when its white supremacist roots are apparently neutralised by the beat). More and more, it feels as if racism is being defined by those least likely to experience it \u2013 namely when they themselves are targeted. Apparently, calling rightwing, red-faced, middle-aged white men \u201cgammon\u201d is racist, yet golliwogs, according to 63% of Britons in a survey, are not racist. As we tiptoe around the semantics and the word \u201cracism\u201d morphs into hate speech, hate crimes continue to soar. Unless something changes, this cycle will continue until \u201cracially tinged\u201d becomes equally as offensive and we replace it with another useless euphemism to protect the feelings of perpetrators. \u2022Yomi Adegoke is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The hunt for signs of exuberance in the Australian economy will have to continue as the latest inflation figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed that demand in the economy remains utterly stagnant. Whenever I look at the inflation figures I always think the best financial advice anyone can ever get is to quit smoking. That of course is not the main reason why you should do it, but once again in September the biggest contributor to inflation was tobacco. Over the past year tobacco prices \u2013 due to the increases in excise \u2013 grew by 15%, well above the price rise of any alcohol: While the overall rate of inflation in the past year was 1.7%, for non-smokers it was closer to 1.3%. That, even with the massive rises in tobacco prices, we still are seeing inflation below the 2% floor of the Reserve Bank\u2019s target is a good pointer of just how much the economy is lacking any growth in demand. While the consumer price index rose 1.7%, up from 1.6% in the June quarter, the average of the Reserve Bank\u2019s two core inflation measures was a record low 1.4%. People are not spending. In effect there is less pressure for the Reserve Bank to worry about rising prices now than at any time in its history. In the past quarter, average core inflation was just 0.36%, down from 0.41% in June, and well below the 0.5% growth needed to get to the annual 2% target: The CPI did increase by 0.5%, which might have you thinking there is some sense of a return to normal demand, but really, if we look at what has been driving the increase in prices we see little evidence of a strong economy. Aside from tobacco, the big drivers of prices in September were recreation and culture and clothing: Now that might, again, seem like a good thing \u2013 if the prices of recreational and more discretionary items such as clothing are rising, then surely that means people are opening their wallets, going shopping and doing fun things? Well, no. The big increase among recreational and culture items was international travel prices \u2013 up 6.1% in the September quarter alone \u2013 and the increase in clothing and footwear occurred not due to a big jump in people buying such products but for the same reason for the increase in the price of international holidays \u2013 the falling Aussie dollar. The Australian dollar has fallen 7% in value against the US dollar since the start of the year. That makes travelling overseas and imports (which is basically all our clothing and footwear) more expensive. The falling dollar is good for our exporters and also helps local companies compete against imports, so the RBA would be very happy that the dollar is now as low as it has been this decade. It probably wouldn\u2019t even mind it falling even further. The reason for the falling dollar is a combination of factors \u2013 our low interest rates (which makes putting your money in Australian bank accounts less profitable and so big investors seek higher returns elsewhere) and because the US dollar has been particularly strong since the middle of 2016. Usually the value of our currency rises and falls with the prices of our major commodities. But since the end of 2016, while the price of iron ore and coal has risen, the value of our dollar has fallen: The other main contributors to inflation have come via the drought \u2013 with strong rises in the price of meat, cereal and dairy foods: It all suggests no real sign of any great surge in household spending off the back of the tax cuts. After the June quarter GDP figures the prime minister and treasurer were suggesting we would need to wait until the September quarter figures to see any improvement. These figures are not out until the first week of December (coincidentally the final parliamentary sitting week of the year) but so far there is little sense of any good news to come. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Practically, they are an increasingly critical source of <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/money/planning-and-budgeting/grandparents-stepping-up-as-costs-of-childcare-bite-20180531-p4zilh.html\">unpaid childcare for working parents</a>. While caring for small children can be taxing and imposing, studies suggest there can be real benefits for the grandparents too. The ABC\u2019s recent hit series <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/old-people-s-home-for-four-year-olds-is-raw-and-real-but-necessary-tv-20190819-p52ii6.html\">Old People\u2019s Home for 4 Year Olds</a> chronicled the positive impacts infants had on their elderly companion\u2019s lives and physical health.</p> <p>As adults, our relationships with our grandparents shift, and though we may no longer rely on them to look after us in a literal sense \u2013 and the caring dynamic may even reverse \u2013 it can be just as fulfilling.</p> <p>If you\u2019re lucky, these relationships are rooted in unconditional love, acceptance and family ritual. With grandparents, there aren\u2019t the complex intricacies of the relationship between a parent and \u201cadult child\u201d \u2013 the term is an oxymoron of course, but it\u2019s an apt descriptor of who we become among our families. For some, grandparents might be bridges back to old countries, languages and cultures. For others, they can be a connection to a different time and way of life.</p> <p>I had a similar experience to Billi last year when I returned to Australia from New York. After three years, I\u2019d said goodbye to a city, a partner, a journalism job, an apartment and my 20s. Unmoored and uncertain about what would come next, one of the first things I did was make the six-hour drive west, across the mountains and parched plains to spend a week with my 94-year-old grandmother, Gwynne, in her redbrick home in Dubbo.</p> <p>We had nothing and everything in common \u2013 she was raised on a farm to mainly Irish descendants, married at 19, had six children and never held a paying job \u2013 though she worked hard all her life. Family and community were her whole world \u2013 \u201cmy people\u201d, she called them \u2013 and loving, human connection was everything. My late grandpa \u2013 from more stoic stock \u2013 used to joke drily my grandma would hug you goodbye if you went to the toilet.</p> <p>For a week we hung out. I would make her favourite dinners \u2013 sausages burnt black, served with tomato sauce and a glass of white wine with an ice cube \u2013 and we would watch TV together. She would roll her walker out under the shade of the big golden rain tree in her front yard to chat while I turned the hose on the red earth. We would have cups of tea in rooms cluttered with family photos and stacks of letters and old Christmas cards. She would run through the familiar repertoire of family legends with her gnarled hand on mine \u2013 her mother\u2019s buggy accident, her rainy wedding day, the time my mum, then a toddler, handed her a live redback spider.</p> <p>I spent much of the time feeling stressed about my next career move. When I got a call offering me a phone interview for a new job, I reluctantly told her I would need a few hours alone with my laptop to prepare. Less than half an hour later, I could hear the wheels of her walker rolling into the kitchen. \u201cJoey,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb you, but I\u2019ve just got to read you this poem,\u201d she said, holding up a tattered little book. She launched into Banjo Paterson\u2019s A Bush Christening, only pausing to hoot between stanzas. I wanted to be annoyed but how could I be? She had never done a job interview in her life, and of course enjoying a poem together was more important.</p> <p>For people of my generation this is why these relationships can be so powerful. Our lives and identities are so deeply rooted in our work, in our digital lives, in often impermanent relationships and transient homes. Through our grandparents, we can access a different way of being in the world, a pre-neoliberal worldview, a different sense of belonging and identity. They gift us the wide sense of perspective that comes with age and witnessing the sweep of history.</p> <p>The Farewell has beautiful coda (spoiler alert \u2013 though it\u2019s been widely discussed on the press tour). The real Nai Nai survived the cancer, in total ignorance, and is still alive today, years after the events depicted in the film took place. The title turns about to be something of a misnomer.</p> <p>Lulu Wang said in interviews that at every screening, people come up to her in tears to talk about their own grandmothers. \u201cMy goal is to leave people talking about the film, or talking about their own lives and their own family, or calling their grandma,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-farewell-s-lulu-wang-and-awkwafina-want-you-to-call-your-grandma-20190822-p52jnx.html\">she said</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s my gift to the world. We should all call our grandmas more.\u201d</p> <p>My trip was a farewell, of sorts, though I didn\u2019t know it. Four months later, my grandmother had a stroke, which she would never fully recover from. The next time I drove out to Dubbo it was to put her in the red earth, to share stories and songs and poems from her life at her funeral, with my people.</p> <p>The final lesson these adult relationships with our grandparents teach us is the inevitability of loss. But through it we learn how we can become torch-bearers of histories, cultures and memories, if we choose to hold on to them. Even when they\u2019re gone, they are lasting reminder: who we are is so much bigger than what we do.</p>",

It is also a love story, about one of the lesser discussed but most meaningful relationships some of us are lucky enough to experience: the bond between an adult child and a loving grandparent. The importance of grandparents in the lives of young children is widely studied and intuitively understood: they can provide deep attachment bonds and safety. Practically, they are an increasingly critical source of unpaid childcare for working parents. While caring for small children can be taxing and imposing, studies suggest there can be real benefits for the grandparents too. The ABC\u2019s recent hit series Old People\u2019s Home for 4 Year Olds chronicled the positive impacts infants had on their elderly companion\u2019s lives and physical health. As adults, our relationships with our grandparents shift, and though we may no longer rely on them to look after us in a literal sense \u2013 and the caring dynamic may even reverse \u2013 it can be just as fulfilling. If you\u2019re lucky, these relationships are rooted in unconditional love, acceptance and family ritual. With grandparents, there aren\u2019t the complex intricacies of the relationship between a parent and \u201cadult child\u201d \u2013 the term is an oxymoron of course, but it\u2019s an apt descriptor of who we become among our families. For some, grandparents might be bridges back to old countries, languages and cultures. For others, they can be a connection to a different time and way of life. I had a similar experience to Billi last year when I returned to Australia from New York. After three years, I\u2019d said goodbye to a city, a partner, a journalism job, an apartment and my 20s. Unmoored and uncertain about what would come next, one of the first things I did was make the six-hour drive west, across the mountains and parched plains to spend a week with my 94-year-old grandmother, Gwynne, in her redbrick home in Dubbo. We had nothing and everything in common \u2013 she was raised on a farm to mainly Irish descendants, married at 19, had six children and never held a paying job \u2013 though she worked hard all her life. Family and community were her whole world \u2013 \u201cmy people\u201d, she called them \u2013 and loving, human connection was everything. My late grandpa \u2013 from more stoic stock \u2013 used to joke drily my grandma would hug you goodbye if you went to the toilet. For a week we hung out. I would make her favourite dinners \u2013 sausages burnt black, served with tomato sauce and a glass of white wine with an ice cube \u2013 and we would watch TV together. She would roll her walker out under the shade of the big golden rain tree in her front yard to chat while I turned the hose on the red earth. We would have cups of tea in rooms cluttered with family photos and stacks of letters and old Christmas cards. She would run through the familiar repertoire of family legends with her gnarled hand on mine \u2013 her mother\u2019s buggy accident, her rainy wedding day, the time my mum, then a toddler, handed her a live redback spider. I spent much of the time feeling stressed about my next career move. When I got a call offering me a phone interview for a new job, I reluctantly told her I would need a few hours alone with my laptop to prepare. Less than half an hour later, I could hear the wheels of her walker rolling into the kitchen. \u201cJoey,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb you, but I\u2019ve just got to read you this poem,\u201d she said, holding up a tattered little book. She launched into Banjo Paterson\u2019s A Bush Christening, only pausing to hoot between stanzas. I wanted to be annoyed but how could I be? She had never done a job interview in her life, and of course enjoying a poem together was more important. For people of my generation this is why these relationships can be so powerful. Our lives and identities are so deeply rooted in our work, in our digital lives, in often impermanent relationships and transient homes. Through our grandparents, we can access a different way of being in the world, a pre-neoliberal worldview, a different sense of belonging and identity. They gift us the wide sense of perspective that comes with age and witnessing the sweep of history. The Farewell has beautiful coda (spoiler alert \u2013 though it\u2019s been widely discussed on the press tour). The real Nai Nai survived the cancer, in total ignorance, and is still alive today, years after the events depicted in the film took place. The title turns about to be something of a misnomer. Lulu Wang said in interviews that at every screening, people come up to her in tears to talk about their own grandmothers. \u201cMy goal is to leave people talking about the film, or talking about their own lives and their own family, or calling their grandma,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my gift to the world. We should all call our grandmas more.\u201d My trip was a farewell, of sorts, though I didn\u2019t know it. Four months later, my grandmother had a stroke, which she would never fully recover from. The next time I drove out to Dubbo it was to put her in the red earth, to share stories and songs and poems from her life at her funeral, with my people. The final lesson these adult relationships with our grandparents teach us is the inevitability of loss. But through it we learn how we can become torch-bearers of histories, cultures and memories, if we choose to hold on to them. Even when they\u2019re gone, they are lasting reminder: who we are is so much bigger than what we do.",

      "bodyText": "The number of grandparents claiming childcare benefits has dropped dramatically since an overhaul of the system last year, raising concerns that vulnerable children may have dropped out of formal care arrangements or ended up in foster care. Figures from the Parliamentary Library obtained by Labor\u2019s early childhood education spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, shows the number of grandparents receiving the new grandparent childcare subsidy was 3,300 in March 2019, compared with the 4,340 in March 2018 who received the previous grandparent childcare benefit. The research suggests the drop of about 24% may be due to a tightening of eligibility requirements, but the reason for the decline was \u201cunclear\u201d. The number of children for whom the grandparent benefit is claimed has also dropped, from 7,570 in March 2018 to 4,760 in March this year \u2013 a 37% decline. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said that because the payments were different and \u201coperated under different policy settings\u201d it was not possible to compare the figures, but it was unable to say how many grandparents were now accessing childcare benefits compared to the old system. Rishworth said the figures were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d, saying the payment was most often accessed by families of vulnerable children where the grandparent became the primary carer. \u201cIt is concerning that the new changes that came into effect have seen such a drop in grandparents accessing these payments,\u201d Rishworth said. \u201cThe system is overly complex and I think that may have caught out a huge number of grandparents, but I think it is also a change in definition about how much care you are required to take which would have made whole lot of grandparents ineligible.\u201d The new eligibility criteria requires the principal carer to provide at least 65% of ongoing daily care of the child compared with being the \u201cmajor provider\u201d, which allowed for 85 hours of the 168 hours in a week. Prior to the new childcare system coming into effect, the peak body in NSW, Community Early Learning Australia, said the new criteria may affect eligibility for grandparents, saying it was arguably a \u201ctougher test\u201d. Rishworth said her concern was what is happening to the children whose grandparents were not able to access the subsidy. \u201cIt is highly likely that they have dropped out of the system,\u201d Rishworth said. \u201cThe chances are if they were accessing the payment and are no longer doing so, then they are unlikely to now be in formal care. \u201cThese are really vulnerable children and we do want to do everything we can to prevent them from going into the foster care system and if we can do that by properly supporting grandparents then that is a good thing.\u201d A spokesperson for the department said grandparent carers who were not eligible for grandparent subsidy may be eligible for assistance through the child care subsidy \u201cdependent on their circumstance\u201d. \u201cIn certain situations, grandparents may be entitled to other additional childcare subsidy (ACCS) payments, such as \u2018ACCS (child wellbeing)\u2019,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAdditionally, grandparents who are not the principal carers of their grandchildren but provide between 14% and 64% of ongoing daily care may be entitled to childcare subsidy for any childcare they may use, provided they meet the relevant eligibility criteria.\u201d The release of the figures come as a new report from KPMG on Wednesday found the government\u2019s new system created a \u201cworkforce disincentive rate\u201d which left some families financially worse off if they increased their hours.

Since the purchase, there hasn\u2019t been a flood down that system, so no water has become available,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Under questioning, Swirepik said exercising the entitlement would depend on cyclones in Queensland and there could be a gap as long as seven years before the commonwealth would receive any water.</p> <p>However, she said the commonwealth environmental water holder was \u201cvery supportive of the purchase\u201d because it could benefit the <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/water/wetlands/ramsar\">Ramsar-listed</a> Narran Lakes.</p> <p>The drought has meant there has not been any heavy rainfall in south-west Queensland that would cause overland flows.</p> <p>The sale was controversial when it was made public in 2017 because the government purchased the water without a tender through direct negotiations with the company, invoking a clause in the purchasing rules that say the government can accept an unsolicited offer in \u201cexceptionally advantageous conditions\u201d.</p> <p>There have also been questions about value for money and the sale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/23/coalition-refers-water-buybacks-to-auditor-general-in-hope-of-defusing-scandal\">was referred to the auditor general</a> as part of a broader review into water buybacks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/cotton-company-reaped-52m-windfall-in-sale-of-water-rights-to-government\">EAA immediately booked a $52m gain</a> on the water rights it sold. Following the sale, the two properties were sold to new owners and the original investors were paid out.</p> <p>There is no suggestion Taylor or Reid improperly influenced the purchase.</p> <p>The Guardian has subsequently revealed that the main beneficiaries of the sale were a number of foreign investors who held their interest through the Caymans-listed subsidiary. One of these was Pacific Alliance Group, whose chief investment officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/17/angus-taylors-oxford-rowing-mate-one-of-main-beneficiaries-of-80m-water-deal\">Chris Gradel, was at Oxford with Taylor</a>.</p> <p>Taylor has said publicly that he resigned all his directorships in EAA and its Caymans subsidiary before entering parliament and that he neither he nor his family benefited from the sale of the water to the federal government. He has said he was not aware of the sale until it was made public. There is nothing to suggest that is untrue.</p> <p>However, Taylor\u2019s business partner in a number of rural ventures, Tony Reid, was the adviser to Eastern Australia Irrigation, EAA\u2019s Cayman parent company, during the sale process. Reid\u2019s role included providing advice on the volumes of water that the government could expect under the overland flows.</p> <p>The Guardian has now received a number of documents under freedom of information laws which show the office of the former minister for agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/23/barnaby-joyce-requested-updates-on-80m-sale-of-water-by-eastern-australia-agriculture\">took an active interest in the controversial water purchase</a> soon after he took over responsibility for water buybacks from the then environment minister, Greg Hunt.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/22/barnaby-joyce-dodges-questions-about-who-profited-from-water-buyback-in-combative-interview\">interview with the ABC in April</a>, Joyce said the buyback was \u201cnegotiated at arm\u2019s length\u201d and he did not set the price or vendor.</p> <p>The new documents show the minister\u2019s senior policy adviser, Richard Hyett, asked for background information on EAA soon after Joyce became minister and both he and the chief of staff, Matt Coulton, were kept abreast of negotiations with EAA.</p> <p>The documents also show the Queensland government had proposed buying both the EAA properties in September 2015 to Hunt, but this had stalled when there was a reshuffle of federal ministers in September 2015.</p> <p>Joyce had publicly opposed water buybacks in the rural press before he became minister because he was worried about how it would impact on the St George area, where he had lived.</p> <p>Instead the department came up with an alternative plan to buy just a fraction of EAA\u2019s water, consulting with Joyce\u2019s staff about the new approach. The staff worked with the Queensland government over how to sell the idea to their minister, even suggesting new wording for the letter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/06/barnaby-joyce-approved-plan-to-chase-80m-water-buyback-documents-show\">Joyce ultimately supported the $80m deal</a> after he was convinced it would have minimal impact on the region.</p> <p>The documents underscore that the government knew that the water they were about to purchase would only be available intermittently, and that the real object of the purchase was to meet the targets for water recovery under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan on paper only.</p> <p>\u201cThe purchase of these entitlement would marginally constrain production [on the two properties] in higher flow years, but would have virtually no impact under low-flow years when the region is more vulnerable,\u201d the department told the minister.</p> <p>In other words, there would be no water available under the purchased licences when there was lower rainfall and the two properties would continue to be able to take water from the river under its other higher security licences.</p> <p>The department said the purchase would only reduce the percentage of land under irrigation from 34% to 25% in high rainfall years, but this percentage reduction would be lower in normal rainfall years.</p> <p>When the purchase was announced, the then local member, David Littleproud, said: \u201cThis is overland flow. According to the independent study we commissioned NC Economics to do, this will mean 2 to 3 per cent of peak production will be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless the department has insisted that the $80m purchase was good value for the taxpayer and would deliver \u201cvaluable environmental water\u201d. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has received not a drop of water for the $80m it spent on buying water entitlements from Eastern Australia Agriculture in 2017, a company once linked to the energy minister, Angus Taylor. Taylor was a director and co-founder of EAA, an agribusiness in Queensland, which was backed by a group of foreign investors. Taylor founded the Australian company in 2007 and served briefly as a director between 2008 and 2009, well before becoming an MP in 2013. His business partner, Tony Reid, was also a director and acted as a consultant on the controversial sale of overland flow entitlements to the government. The commonwealth environmental water holder, Jody Swirepik, confirmed last week during Senate estimates that the rights bought from EAA have not yielded any water at all. Swirepik explained that the entitlement volume was 71,456 megalitres and the long-term average yield should be about 28,740 megalitres. \u201cJust that indication will tell you that you only expect to get it every couple of years. Since the purchase, there hasn\u2019t been a flood down that system, so no water has become available,\u201d she said. Under questioning, Swirepik said exercising the entitlement would depend on cyclones in Queensland and there could be a gap as long as seven years before the commonwealth would receive any water. However, she said the commonwealth environmental water holder was \u201cvery supportive of the purchase\u201d because it could benefit the Ramsar-listed Narran Lakes. The drought has meant there has not been any heavy rainfall in south-west Queensland that would cause overland flows. The sale was controversial when it was made public in 2017 because the government purchased the water without a tender through direct negotiations with the company, invoking a clause in the purchasing rules that say the government can accept an unsolicited offer in \u201cexceptionally advantageous conditions\u201d. There have also been questions about value for money and the sale was referred to the auditor general as part of a broader review into water buybacks. EAA immediately booked a $52m gain on the water rights it sold. Following the sale, the two properties were sold to new owners and the original investors were paid out. There is no suggestion Taylor or Reid improperly influenced the purchase. The Guardian has subsequently revealed that the main beneficiaries of the sale were a number of foreign investors who held their interest through the Caymans-listed subsidiary. One of these was Pacific Alliance Group, whose chief investment officer, Chris Gradel, was at Oxford with Taylor. Taylor has said publicly that he resigned all his directorships in EAA and its Caymans subsidiary before entering parliament and that he neither he nor his family benefited from the sale of the water to the federal government. He has said he was not aware of the sale until it was made public. There is nothing to suggest that is untrue. However, Taylor\u2019s business partner in a number of rural ventures, Tony Reid, was the adviser to Eastern Australia Irrigation, EAA\u2019s Cayman parent company, during the sale process. Reid\u2019s role included providing advice on the volumes of water that the government could expect under the overland flows. The Guardian has now received a number of documents under freedom of information laws which show the office of the former minister for agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, took an active interest in the controversial water purchase soon after he took over responsibility for water buybacks from the then environment minister, Greg Hunt. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In an interview with the ABC in April, Joyce said the buyback was \u201cnegotiated at arm\u2019s length\u201d and he did not set the price or vendor. The new documents show the minister\u2019s senior policy adviser, Richard Hyett, asked for background information on EAA soon after Joyce became minister and both he and the chief of staff, Matt Coulton, were kept abreast of negotiations with EAA. The documents also show the Queensland government had proposed buying both the EAA properties in September 2015 to Hunt, but this had stalled when there was a reshuffle of federal ministers in September 2015. Joyce had publicly opposed water buybacks in the rural press before he became minister because he was worried about how it would impact on the St George area, where he had lived. Instead the department came up with an alternative plan to buy just a fraction of EAA\u2019s water, consulting with Joyce\u2019s staff about the new approach. The staff worked with the Queensland government over how to sell the idea to their minister, even suggesting new wording for the letter. Joyce ultimately supported the $80m deal after he was convinced it would have minimal impact on the region. The documents underscore that the government knew that the water they were about to purchase would only be available intermittently, and that the real object of the purchase was to meet the targets for water recovery under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan on paper only. \u201cThe purchase of these entitlement would marginally constrain production [on the two properties] in higher flow years, but would have virtually no impact under low-flow years when the region is more vulnerable,\u201d the department told the minister. In other words, there would be no water available under the purchased licences when there was lower rainfall and the two properties would continue to be able to take water from the river under its other higher security licences. The department said the purchase would only reduce the percentage of land under irrigation from 34% to 25% in high rainfall years, but this percentage reduction would be lower in normal rainfall years. When the purchase was announced, the then local member, David Littleproud, said: \u201cThis is overland flow. According to the independent study we commissioned NC Economics to do, this will mean 2 to 3 per cent of peak production will be lost.\u201d Nonetheless the department has insisted that the $80m purchase was good value for the taxpayer and would deliver \u201cvaluable environmental water\u201d.",

Moreover, for every Adelaide flat-track that renders Smith ineffectual, the T20 World Cup will throw up tricky chases on low-slow wickets, with the wile and guile of world class spinners to overcome. Nobody in Australia solves these puzzles better than Smith, and this is where his value will come to the fore.</p> <p>While Warner, Finch and Glenn Maxwell pick themselves at this point, there will be sterner tests for Australia\u2019s middle-lower order. Are Alex Carey and Ashton Agar able to finish an innings with a strike rate of 220, like the way Kieron Pollard or Hardik Pandya can? Will Australia take another look at Dan Christian \u2013 global T20 expert, inveterate closer of games and tournament winner \u2013 or does returning to a veteran risk losing face?</p> <p>On the bowling side, are \u201cbouncy home pitches\u201d enough to sustain a relatively samey, pace-on attack? India regularly commence with two spinners \u2013 would Australia consider Chris Green to defend 12 balls bowling around-the-wicket off-spinners during the powerplay? Or would that be too strange? Kane Richardson is great at the death, and AJ Tye has a knuckle-ball, but there are few other bowling tricks among the quicks. Adam Zampa regularly exceeds expectations with his slide-in spin and occasional wrong\u2019un, and bowls fantastically to good players on flat wickets, but generally speaking Australian cricket is bereft of the sort of quality mystery spin and trickery that can stop an innings in its tracks. Options would be ideal.</p> <p>Given next year\u2019s T20 World Cup is at home, it may be argued that high octane pace is indeed the answer. After all, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson did the business here in 2015. However, while the longer of the short formats can sustain a pace-on approach, the shorter of the two increasingly emphasises pace-off. And besides, Starc has not reached the dizzying heights of 150 for some time (as he did in 2015), while Cummins hovers somewhere closer to 140, too. International batsmen deal with pace regularly now \u2013 would Australia countenance the idea that thunderbolts have lost some lustre?</p> <p>There are 23 T20 games until next year\u2019s World Cup commences, through which time we will form a sense of Australia\u2019s approach. In a format that demands invention and original thinking, Australia\u2019s willingness to emerge from the shackles of its own ideology will be instructive. So will the appointment, and age, of its next selector.</p>",

Moreover, for every Adelaide flat-track that renders Smith ineffectual, the T20 World Cup will throw up tricky chases on low-slow wickets, with the wile and guile of world class spinners to overcome. Nobody in Australia solves these puzzles better than Smith, and this is where his value will come to the fore. While Warner, Finch and Glenn Maxwell pick themselves at this point, there will be sterner tests for Australia\u2019s middle-lower order. Are Alex Carey and Ashton Agar able to finish an innings with a strike rate of 220, like the way Kieron Pollard or Hardik Pandya can? Will Australia take another look at Dan Christian \u2013 global T20 expert, inveterate closer of games and tournament winner \u2013 or does returning to a veteran risk losing face? On the bowling side, are \u201cbouncy home pitches\u201d enough to sustain a relatively samey, pace-on attack? India regularly commence with two spinners \u2013 would Australia consider Chris Green to defend 12 balls bowling around-the-wicket off-spinners during the powerplay? Or would that be too strange? Kane Richardson is great at the death, and AJ Tye has a knuckle-ball, but there are few other bowling tricks among the quicks. Adam Zampa regularly exceeds expectations with his slide-in spin and occasional wrong\u2019un, and bowls fantastically to good players on flat wickets, but generally speaking Australian cricket is bereft of the sort of quality mystery spin and trickery that can stop an innings in its tracks. Options would be ideal. Given next year\u2019s T20 World Cup is at home, it may be argued that high octane pace is indeed the answer. After all, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson did the business here in 2015. However, while the longer of the short formats can sustain a pace-on approach, the shorter of the two increasingly emphasises pace-off. And besides, Starc has not reached the dizzying heights of 150 for some time (as he did in 2015), while Cummins hovers somewhere closer to 140, too. International batsmen deal with pace regularly now \u2013 would Australia countenance the idea that thunderbolts have lost some lustre? There are 23 T20 games until next year\u2019s World Cup commences, through which time we will form a sense of Australia\u2019s approach. In a format that demands invention and original thinking, Australia\u2019s willingness to emerge from the shackles of its own ideology will be instructive. So will the appointment, and age, of its next selector.",

Sweet potatoes \u2013 now at the peak of their season \u2013 are the business.</p> <p>They are also big business. Over the past decade, according to Kantar Worldpanel, <a href=\"https://www.producebusinessuk.com/insight/insight-stories/2019/04/22/american-sweet-potatoes-target-greater-uk-consumption-via-health-and-usage-campaign\" title=\"\">demand for sweet potatoes in the UK has quadrupled</a>. For a while, they mostly came from warmer climes \u2013 North Carolina, Israel \u2013 but in 2015, farmers in Kent pulled out all the stops to put a UK-grown crop in the supermarkets. That same year, the Office for National Statistics included the sweet potato in the illustrative shopping basket it uses to measure inflation. And last year, consumer research showed most people would opt for a sweet potato side dish over a straight-up potato one. Yet most of us have only begun to plumb those tender, sweet, soulful depths.</p> <p>First up, sweet potatoes don\u2019t have to be orange. Those Kentish farmers chose to cultivate the familiar red-skinned, flame-fleshed variety, often known as yams in the southern US. But if you have a Caribbean market stall or an Asian grocer nearby, you can probably get hold of something different. There are purple sweet potatoes, white sweet potatoes, yellow sweet potatoes. With the variations in colour come differences in texture, density, flavour and uses. The food website Saveur has <a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/gallery/16-Shades-of-Sweet/\" title=\"\">a tantalising guide</a> to 16 kinds, from the tan-skinned hannah, which bakes into a soft, dry yellow, perfect for mashing, to korean purple, with its white flesh and magenta exterior yielding a subtle chestnut flavour. If you can, try them all.</p> <p>Sweet potato fries or baked wedges are, it would appear, the thing that has pushed the root veg into the mainstream. And it is hard to argue with them. The food writer Anna Jones recommends coating wedges in polenta before baking \u2013 it crisps them up nicely. She serves hers with a chipotle yoghurt dipping sauce. If you want to deep-fry yours, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/28/felicity-cloakes-perfect-sweet-potato-fries-recipe\">Felicity Cloake cautions that they are best thick-cut</a>, par-boiled (with a little bicarb) and coated in a cornflour paste (she spikes hers with paprika), then rolled in cornmeal.</p> <p>There is, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/20/sweet-potato-recipes-10-best\">more to sweet potatoes than chips</a>.

They are lower in carbohydrates and calories, and higher in fibre and vitamin A. Their sweetness marries with a host of aromatics \u2013 from paprika to cinnamon, thyme to cumin and coriander.

      "bodyText": "Transport for London made Uber promise to verify drivers\u2019 identities and ensure their documents are genuine in exchange for a temporary licence to operate, in a deal that drew an incredulous response from the trade body for black-cab drivers. The ride-hailing firm was granted a two-month extension to its licence in September after TfL refused to issue it with a full permit to operate in the capital amid concerns over the company\u2019s attitude towards the safety of passengers. The temporary extension came with several new conditions attached, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. One condition, headlined \u201cdriver identity\u201d, demands that the company put in place systems to ensure that any drivers using the app are licensed by TfL and registered with Uber. TfL asked for the pledge after a case in which a woman in Leeds was raped by a man using his brother\u2019s login details to drive an Uber, which is not permitted by the app. Among other new conditions is a requirement that Uber ensure that drivers do not use \u201cfraudulent\u201d documents for their licence or insurance. In a letter to TfL, seen by the Guardian, the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association (LTDA), which represents black-cab drivers in London, said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that such conditions needed to be imposed in the first place. \u201cIt should go without saying that London private hire vehicle operators \u2026 should have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure that drivers are who they say they are, and that they have the requisite valid licences and insurances in place,\u201d lawyers for the LTDA wrote. \u201cIt is extraordinary that [Uber] needs to be told to undertake appropriate checks to verify that documentation provided by drivers is legitimate and to notify TfL where potentially fraudulent documentation is submitted.\u201d They said the content of the conditions fuelled concerns that Uber\u2019s enthusiasm for innovation was \u201cnot matched by any corresponding interest in dealing with the public safety pitfalls such innovation causes\u201d. Uber said it had made \u201csignificant changes\u201d to its business over the past two years, amid mounting concern about the risks that its business model poses to passengers. \u201cThis includes launching new safety features for riders, introducing better protections for licensed drivers and we\u2019ve improved our corporate governance and compliance,\u201d said a spokesperson. A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe have granted a licence to Uber London Limited to operate for two months while we request additional material from them and will consider that information as part of any future licensing decision. \u201cAs with other operators, we have attached a number of conditions to Uber London Limited\u2019s licence, which we consider necessary and appropriate to ensure passenger safety and security.\u201d The ride-hailing app is expected to seek a permanent licence or another extension at the end of the two-month period.",

      "bodyText": "The law banning terminally ill people from being helped to end their lives must be reviewed because it may not be working, a cross party group of MPs have said. They say the government should examine whether a total ban on assisted dying should be ended. The call was triggered by police chief Ron Hogg telling the Guardian in September he wanted the right to end his own life to free him from the agony of motor neurone disease. Furthermore, 17 of his fellow police and crime commissioners who oversee forces across England and Wales say a change in the law should be considered. Ron Hogg, 67, the elected police, crime and victims commissioner of Durham, was diagnosed in August with motor neurone disease, an incurable condition that leads to muscle wasting and death. He said he already needs help to breathe and wants the right to end his suffering at a time chosen by him and his family. The MPs who have written a letter to the Guardian calling for a review include Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles, as well as Labour MPs and the former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas. Some of the MPs believe a review is needed but are not convinced the law should change; others believe assisted dying should now be allowed. They write: \u201cMPs from across the House of Commons have repeatedly asked the Ministry of Justice to look at the effects of the current blanket ban on assisted dying and how it is enforced. \u201cThis week we heard from a group of police and crime commissioners who have now also called on the government to examine the consequences of section 2 of the 1961 Suicide Act, which criminally implicates anyone providing assistance to someone to die. \u201cNo matter our views on whether and to what extent assisted dying can be legalised safely, we should all agree that the only way to ensure the law is fit for purpose is to hear from those it affects most.\u201d The law on assisted dying is a hugely emotive issue that keeps coming before the courts and into the criminal justice system. In September, Mavis Eccleston, 80, was cleared by a jury of murdering her terminally ill husband, Dennis, after they formed a pact to end their lives together. Earlier this year, Ann Whaley was investigated for accompanying her husband to Dignitas, the suicide clinic in Switzerland, where he ended his life after suffering from MND. Others who have supported their terminally ill loved ones such as James Howley were also investigated by police. In their letter, 18 police and crime commissioners, elected to oversee police forces, say even officers who end up investigating such cases find it distressing. He said: \u201cMany will have experienced or heard of cases where the blanket ban on assisted dying has caused distress, confusion and pain for dying people, their loved ones, and even the investigating police officers themselves. \u201cWe believe it is time for a renewed look at the functioning of the existing law on assisted dying.

To opt out of future grading on iOS, in the settings app, under the heading privacy, users can tap on \u201cAnalytics &amp; Improvements\u201d then disable the preference to \u201cimprove Siri dictation\u201d. To delete their uploaded clips, they go to Siri &amp; Search in the settings app, tap on Siri &amp; Dictation History, and then hit a red button marked \u201cDelete Siri &amp; Dictation History\u201d. Apple first promised to roll out the new settings in August, a month after the story broke. The company apologised for not living up to its \u201chigh ideals\u201d, and committed to building the ability to opt out, as well as ending the outsourcing programme that it had previously used to grade clips and bringing the work in-house. Under the old system, Apple contractors reported \u201cregularly\u201d hearing accidental activations of up to 30 seconds, which included deeply personal recordings of sexual activity, medical consultations and drug-dealing. Apple initially dismissed the concerns, saying Siri responses were \u201canalysed in secure facilities\u201d, before opening an internal investigation a week later. Alongside the ability to opt out of Siri grading, iOS 13.2 brought a number of other changes to iPhones. A new set of emoji introduced non-binary variants for all previously gendered emoji, allowing users to express themselves as a firefighter, astronaut, or merperson without gender connotations. The new \u201cdeep fusion\u201d feature on the latest iPhones also aims to blend together multiple exposures for an image with higher detail at low light.",

All the young boys in the area take part, racing each other without saddles over 30 kilometres. The race usually takes place in August, when the weather has cooled down.

I found out later that several horses died that day from the heat.</p> <p>Here, this horseman has broken away from the pack, but he wasn\u2019t the frontrunner. The horses were racing on a track alongside a road. I don\u2019t know exactly how many participants there were, but there were cars everywhere. Each family wants to drive next to their horse, everyone is beeping their horns, shouting. It is like a car race too, some slowing down, others speeding up, people overtaking on all sides.

The horses were all beautifully dressed up and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/02/throat-singing\">traditional Tuvan music</a> was playing.

In a row that has gripped the community and prompted wider debate about the contemporary value of single-sex education, the council will vote on 28 November on whether Notre Dame high school should become coeducational for the first time in more than a century. With parents and local residents split on the issue, both sides are pledging to continue lobbying councillors until the final votes are cast in a long-running battle that has led to the formation of two opposing campaign groups: Girls for Notre Dame and Notre Dame High for All. While the majority of single-sex state schools in Scotland closed or were amalgamated in the 1970s and 80s, this Catholic establishment in Glasgow\u2019s affluent West End, founded by nuns in 1897, has continued to educate solely girls, who nowadays come from a diverse mix of ethnic backgrounds across the city. But co-ed campaigners argue that the school should be open to local families \u2013 parents currently have the option of a mixed secondary but on the far side of the catchment area, across busy roads. They point to the fact that the school roll is not at capacity as evidence of the waning popularity of single-sex education. Other parents, including many current and former pupils, firmly resist the proposed change, insisting that girls grow in confidence, both intellectually and socially, in a single-sex setting, also noting that minority ethnic girls are strongly represented in placing requests. Speaking to the Herald newspaper last year, current senior 5 pupils reported that they felt more assured speaking up in the classroom and choosing more science-oriented subjects than they would in a coeducational environment. A consultation on the future of the school, which closed in May, attracted nearly 5,000 responses, with respondents asked to vote on three options: to maintain the status quo, remain single-sex but expand the catchment area, or go mixed. The findings were shared with interested parties, including the campaign groups, which both argue that the results support their position. The council\u2019s minority Scottish National party administration has decided to support coeducation, meaning other parties would have to unite in opposition for the school to remain single-sex. Both Greens and Conservatives have suggested they also favour mixed schooling, while Labour has said it will wait for a key paper that includes an analysis of the consultation responses as well as an equality impact assessment and is expected to be made public next Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "Chile\u2019s embattled president has been forced to cancel two major international summits after government concessions failed to defuse weeks of violent protests that have seen thousands of arrests, left at least 20 dead and sent shock waves across Latin America. Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era made the announcement on Wednesday morning, telling reporters Chile would no longer be able to host November\u2019s Apec trade summit and the COP25 UN climate conference the following month. World leaders including Donald Trump and China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, had been due to attend the first event while climate champions including the teenage activist Greta Thunberg were expected at the second. Pi\u00f1era blamed the \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d Chile was facing for the decision and said his government\u2019s primary concern had to be \u201cfully restoring public order, security and social peace\u201d. \u201cThis has been a very difficult decision \u2013 which has caused us great pain \u2013 because we understand perfectly the importance [of the events] for Chile and for the world,\u201d Chile\u2019s centre-right president said. \u201cWhen a father has problems, he must always put his family before everything else. Similarly, a president must always put his own countrymen ahead of any other consideration,\u201d Pi\u00f1era added. Patricia Espinosa, the UN\u2019s climate change executive secretary, said the UN was \u201cexploring alternative hosting options\u201d for the climate summit after being informed of the decision in a letter from Chile\u2019s environment minister. Pi\u00f1era said he had warned other world leaders of the cancellation. Chile\u2019s protests began in mid-October as a student-led fight against a 3.7% hike in metro fares. But those demonstrations quickly swelled into a much broader mutiny against inequality, the cost of living and police repression. According to Chile\u2019s Human Rights Institute, 3,535 people have been arrested since 17 October while 1,132 people have been taken to hospital \u2013 38 of them with gunshot injuries. On 18 October Pi\u00f1era declared a state of emergency after violence broke out on the streets of the capital, Santiago, later declaring the country \u201cat war\u201d with \u201cevil\u201d delinquents. After such moves failed to quell the unrest, Chile\u2019s president tried to placate protesters with a conciliatory televised address in which he asked forgiveness for the \u201cshortsightedness\u201d of the country\u2019s political leaders. Pi\u00f1era also unveiled a string of progressive economic reforms, a cabinet reshuffle and the decision to end nightly curfews in an effort to calm tensions. But those concessions appear not to have been enough. Daily street marches continue to call for Pi\u00f1era\u2019s resignation. Schools and offices are functioning sporadically. Lines at supermarkets have eased but little remains of the routine that just two weeks ago led Pi\u00f1era to declare Chile an \u201coasis\u201d in an increasingly volatile region. On Saturday an estimated 1 million people poured on to the streets of Santiago for a peaceful protest that was reputedly the country\u2019s largest since the dying days of Gen Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship in the late 1980s. \u201cIt is absolutely logical for no one to come.

      "body": "<p>The vast majority of false information shared on WhatsApp in Brazil during the presidential election favoured the far-right winner, Jair Bolsonaro, a Guardian analysis of data suggests.</p> <p>The analysis sheds light on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/older-people-more-likely-to-share-fake-news-on-facebook\">spread of misinformation</a> on the Facebook-owned app, with fears it could be poisoning political debate in one of the largest democracies in the world.</p> <p>In a sample of 11,957 viral messages shared across 296 group chats on the instant-messaging platform in the campaign period, approximately 42% of rightwing items contained information found to be false by factcheckers. Less than 3% of the leftwing messages analysed in the study contained externally verified falsehoods.</p> <p>The figures suggest the spread of fake news was highly asymmetrical, accounting for much of the content being spread by and to Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp.</p> <p>The instant messaging app is very popular in Brazil, with more than 120 million users in a population of about 210 million people.</p> <p>Much of the fake news shared on WhatsApp reflected the far-right values promoted by Bolsonaro\u2019s team during the two-month campaign. Almost all the major rightwing fake news stories fell into four categories, the analysis reveals:</p> <ul> <li><p>Up to 48% of the rightwing items containing externally verified falsehoods mentioned a fictional plot to fraudulently manipulate the electronic ballot system, echoing conspiracy theories promoted by Bolsonaro\u2019s team and casting suspicion on the democratic process.</p></li> <li><p>Another 19% of the messages promoted misleading information about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-far-right-presidential-candidate-stabbed\">stabbing attack</a> against Bolsonaro in early September 2018.

      "bodyText": "The vast majority of false information shared on WhatsApp in Brazil during the presidential election favoured the far-right winner, Jair Bolsonaro, a Guardian analysis of data suggests. The analysis sheds light on the spread of misinformation on the Facebook-owned app, with fears it could be poisoning political debate in one of the largest democracies in the world. In a sample of 11,957 viral messages shared across 296 group chats on the instant-messaging platform in the campaign period, approximately 42% of rightwing items contained information found to be false by factcheckers. Less than 3% of the leftwing messages analysed in the study contained externally verified falsehoods. The figures suggest the spread of fake news was highly asymmetrical, accounting for much of the content being spread by and to Bolsonaro supporters on WhatsApp. The instant messaging app is very popular in Brazil, with more than 120 million users in a population of about 210 million people. Much of the fake news shared on WhatsApp reflected the far-right values promoted by Bolsonaro\u2019s team during the two-month campaign. Almost all the major rightwing fake news stories fell into four categories, the analysis reveals: Up to 48% of the rightwing items containing externally verified falsehoods mentioned a fictional plot to fraudulently manipulate the electronic ballot system, echoing conspiracy theories promoted by Bolsonaro\u2019s team and casting suspicion on the democratic process. Another 19% of the messages promoted misleading information about a stabbing attack against Bolsonaro in early September 2018. The stabbing, which forced the far-right leader to spend most of the remaining weeks of the campaign in hospital, was a turning point in the election. Sixteen per cent of right-leaning false content tried to dismiss the political system and mainstream media as corrupt, reflecting key elements of Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-establishment rhetoric. A further 14% of the viral falsehoods targeted leftwing politicians and activists, often using homophobic tropes and anti-feminist slurs. Content exchanged on WhatsApp is protected with end-to-end encryption, so the study collected a sample of messages from WhatsApp Monitor, a database of viral content shared in hundreds of groups focused on political debate. Due to these sampling limitations, the research cannot be generalised to explain the behaviour of all WhatsApp users in Brazil. WhatsApp executives recently acknowledged Brazilian accounts were the target of massive spamming operations by digital marketing agencies before the election, in a breach of the app\u2019s terms and conditions. Inquiries in Brazil\u2019s congress and superior electoral court are examining whether Bolsonaro\u2019s team was involved in these manipulative efforts. The investigations could potentially lead to the annulment of the election result. The Bolsonaro administration denies wrongdoing and has repeatedly dismissed media reports on the issue as \u201cfake news\u201d. Facebook, which has been under increasing pressure to do more to tackle misinformation, announced an update of WhatsApp in January that reduced to the number of times users can forward a single message to five. Recent studies suggested the upgrades succeeded in slowing the spread of false content, but failed to stop fake news reaching large audiences. According to Caio Machado, a computational propaganda specialist at the Oxford Internet Institute, social media platforms are struggling to cope with \u201cdemocracy-hacking strategies\u201d. He added: \u201cTech companies have an immense power in their hands, and no one knows whether or not they are actually capable of influencing election results.\u201d A WhatsApp spokeswoman pointed to changes such as labels showing forwarded messages, the limit on forwarding messages, banning spam accounts using machine learning and improved safety and privacy settings. \u201cWhatsApp has made significant product changes and worked with partners across civil society to help address the harmful consequences of misinformation,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>One Friday, after the taping of her Afghan television chatshow, a woman from the studio audience came up to Mozhdah Jamalzadah to hug her. \u201cShe was so emotional and she wouldn\u2019t let go,\u201d says Jamalzadah. The woman said Jamalzadah\u2019s programme, The Mozhdah Show, had stopped her husband beating their children, after it covered corporal punishment. \u201cBut from her face, I could tell that there was more to it,\u201d says the 37-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that maybe he stopped beating her, too. That made me very emotional, and she just kept repeating: \u2018We need you, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/31/female-journalists-defy-taboos-braving-death-threats-afghanistan\" title=\"\">Afghanistan needs you</a>.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jamalzadah was five when her family escaped Afghanistan, eventually settling in Canada. In 2009, in her mid-20s, she returned to Kabul after being invited by a new TV station to host a talent show. She had started singing a few years earlier, posting music videos on YouTube; one song, Afghan Girl, had become a hit in her homeland (she would be invited to perform it in 2010 at the White House to mark International Women\u2019s Day in front of the Obamas).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a woman there, you\u2019re pretty much voiceless. Maybe I can\u2019t do anything in Afghanistan, but I can in Canada</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She and her mother, Nasrin, travelled to Kabul. But unbeknown to Jamalzadah, Nasrin had no intention of letting her daughter present a mere talent show. Instead she had packed several DVDs of The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2013 which they had been watching for years in Nasrin\u2019s hair salon in Vancouver \u2013 and during their first meeting with TV executives, she pitched The Mozhdah Show. Not just a chatshow, either, but a vehicle, modelled on Oprah, to change the lives of Afghan women. The TV station went for it \u2013 and it ran from 2009 to 2011. For a country reeling from years of war, followed by the harsh Taliban rule, Jamalzadah became an image of what a modern Afghan woman could be \u2013 and there were many people in the country of her birth who didn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>Jamalzadah speaks by Skype from Toronto, where she is promoting a film, Red Snow. In it, she plays the educated daughter of an Afghan family who help a First Nations Gwich\u2019in soldier in the Canadian army, who is captured by the Taliban. A biography of Jamalzadah is also just about to be published. In the film, she wears a blue burqa \u2013 it\u2019s the same garment Nasrin wore, hoping to pass as a peasant, when they fled Kabul about 30 years earlier, making a perilous journey to Pakistan. Her father, Bashir, had been a teacher when word got to him that he was about to be arrested because he was suspected of opposing the Soviet-backed government. The Jamalzadahs \u2013 Nasrin and Bashir, Mozhda and her two younger brothers, one of whom was only six months old \u2013 fled. \u201cI was well aware that there was a major possibility we might not make it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy heart would beat every time a soldier would hop up on the bus, and I would think: \u2018I hope they don\u2019t find out we\u2019re city people.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They were granted asylum in Canada and moved to Ontario. Jamalzadah remembers the cold, mostly, and, while she made good friends, she also experienced overt racism. Yet, she says: \u201cAt the same time, I knew we were safe, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether my family were going to be OK. In Afghanistan I had rockets firing over my head and didn\u2019t know where they were going to land. I would be out in the yard playing with my cousin, and you could hear the rockets. The racism and all the other stuff didn\u2019t compare to trying to survive.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21FGYsztV9o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/21FGYsztV9o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mozhdah - Hat Idak feat Absolute (YouTube).</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The family settled in Vancouver, where Bashir opened a pizza restaurant and Nasrin a hair salon. As a teenager, Jamalzadah became obsessed with reports about the war in Afghanistan, searching online and watching the news as soon as she was home from school. \u201cI wanted to know how my family was, because there was no phone, no contact. I would think the worst when the bombings were happening, right after 9/11.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents had urged her not to take opportunities and freedoms for granted, and she didn\u2019t, but it also made her feel guilty that she was living such a different life to the friends she had left in Afghanistan. \u201cMy parents wanted me to use all of it fully so they were constantly reminding me how lucky I was. But, constantly being reminded, I was becoming more and more depressed. While all my other friends were talking about shopping and boys they had crushes on, secretly, this was my torment. I was constantly looking for ways to do something to help and speak up for those people.\u201d</p> <p>She had been writing poetry and realised that while she could never remember the words of political speeches, she always remembered song lyrics. So one day she told her mother she\u2019d like to find someone to turn her poems into songs. Nasrin encouraged her to have singing lessons with the Afghan-Canadian musician Wahid Omid. He uploaded one song to YouTube and it went viral.</p> <p>\u201cI think people were hungry for something new, different. I was a girl and after the war there were hardly any female singers, especially ones who pranced around in the outfits I did.\u201d The online attacks soon started, and Jamalzadah says she almost gave up, but she realised that was what the trolls wanted. Her next song, <em>Dukhtare Afghan</em> (Afghan Girl), written about an acid attack on girls going to school, was played on Afghan radio and became a hit, bringing her to the attention of TV executives.</p> <p>Being in Kabul, she says, \u201cwas magical. I mean, there\u2019s barbed wire, dust everywhere, it\u2019s a war zone, but I was totally OK with that because I was around Afghan people, and they seemed exactly the way that they were before. The love and the hospitality, and everything that Afghans stand for, was still there.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs now too at how naive she was. Once she thought she heard a door slam and someone at her guesthouse told her it was a bomb. Another time, she thought she heard fireworks, only for the CEO of the TV station to shout at her not to leave the building: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get hit by a bullet: do you not hear what\u2019s going on out there?\u201d \u201cSo it was comical, but very dark,\u201d she says. In 2009: \u201cThere were times where everything felt like it was OK, other than the few suicide bombings here and there \u2013 everyone was just out and about, there were restaurants, everything was lively, and I loved it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57466420e31dfc4ba591411a9855bd6cff07d6f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57466420e31dfc4ba591411a9855bd6cff07d6f4/0_1122_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mozhdah Jamalzadah and her mother Nasrin at their backyard near Vancouver, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mozhdah Jamalzadah and her mother Nasrin at their backyard near Vancouver, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kuni Takahashi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She did have to make compromises, for instance, wearing a hijab. \u201cThere were many restrictions from the government, from the culture minister, all the pressure from the outside.

Alongside lighter material such as singers and children\u2019s competitions, the show often included sketches to drive home the issues discussed, and interviews with experts, such as child psychologists.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when we started receiving threats,\u201d she says. Did she feel unsafe? \u201cIf I constantly lived in fear, it would stop me from doing anything, so I stopped myself from thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks her experience as a child, \u201cnot knowing if I\u2019m going to live or not, affected me \u2013 it\u2019s normal for me. I\u2019d rather live a shorter life and have it be more impactful and live it to the fullest, then have a long one living in fear, afraid to go out and do something because I might get killed.\u201d</p> <p>She was, she admits, protected to some degree by her Canadian citizenship. One girl, a contestant on a TV talent show, Afghan Star, that Jamalzadah presented from 2012 to 2013, told her: \u201cIf I had a foreign passport, I would dress like you. You can go back to Canada, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d \u201cShe was right. I could see that in the way that I was treated. I\u2019m sure that there were lots of people who would have liked to do all kinds of things but couldn\u2019t get away with it. I think my fear was lessened because at any point, I could go to the Canadian embassy and be protected.\u201d</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t, however, protect her from a horrific attack by a man who she says assumed, because she was westernised, that she would be open to a sexual relationship. She alleges he lured her to an empty nightclub, then attacked her violently; and she only got away after threatening him with a gun she kept in her bag. \u201cThe attack that happened to me happens to girls constantly, and there is nothing they can do. Even I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she says. She wanted to report it, \u201cbut as a woman there, you\u2019re pretty much voiceless. Maybe I can\u2019t do anything in Afghanistan, but I can in Canada. I can\u2019t report it there, but I told my story.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, flying back to Kabul after a break in Canada, the Canadian embassy got in touch with her en route and told her there had been a serious threat, and that she should turn back.

      "bodyText": "One Friday, after the taping of her Afghan television chatshow, a woman from the studio audience came up to Mozhdah Jamalzadah to hug her. \u201cShe was so emotional and she wouldn\u2019t let go,\u201d says Jamalzadah. The woman said Jamalzadah\u2019s programme, The Mozhdah Show, had stopped her husband beating their children, after it covered corporal punishment. \u201cBut from her face, I could tell that there was more to it,\u201d says the 37-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that maybe he stopped beating her, too. That made me very emotional, and she just kept repeating: \u2018We need you, Afghanistan needs you.\u2019\u201d Jamalzadah was five when her family escaped Afghanistan, eventually settling in Canada. In 2009, in her mid-20s, she returned to Kabul after being invited by a new TV station to host a talent show. She had started singing a few years earlier, posting music videos on YouTube; one song, Afghan Girl, had become a hit in her homeland (she would be invited to perform it in 2010 at the White House to mark International Women\u2019s Day in front of the Obamas). She and her mother, Nasrin, travelled to Kabul. But unbeknown to Jamalzadah, Nasrin had no intention of letting her daughter present a mere talent show. Instead she had packed several DVDs of The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2013 which they had been watching for years in Nasrin\u2019s hair salon in Vancouver \u2013 and during their first meeting with TV executives, she pitched The Mozhdah Show. Not just a chatshow, either, but a vehicle, modelled on Oprah, to change the lives of Afghan women. The TV station went for it \u2013 and it ran from 2009 to 2011. For a country reeling from years of war, followed by the harsh Taliban rule, Jamalzadah became an image of what a modern Afghan woman could be \u2013 and there were many people in the country of her birth who didn\u2019t like it. Jamalzadah speaks by Skype from Toronto, where she is promoting a film, Red Snow. In it, she plays the educated daughter of an Afghan family who help a First Nations Gwich\u2019in soldier in the Canadian army, who is captured by the Taliban. A biography of Jamalzadah is also just about to be published. In the film, she wears a blue burqa \u2013 it\u2019s the same garment Nasrin wore, hoping to pass as a peasant, when they fled Kabul about 30 years earlier, making a perilous journey to Pakistan. Her father, Bashir, had been a teacher when word got to him that he was about to be arrested because he was suspected of opposing the Soviet-backed government. The Jamalzadahs \u2013 Nasrin and Bashir, Mozhda and her two younger brothers, one of whom was only six months old \u2013 fled. \u201cI was well aware that there was a major possibility we might not make it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy heart would beat every time a soldier would hop up on the bus, and I would think: \u2018I hope they don\u2019t find out we\u2019re city people.\u2019\u201d They were granted asylum in Canada and moved to Ontario. Jamalzadah remembers the cold, mostly, and, while she made good friends, she also experienced overt racism. Yet, she says: \u201cAt the same time, I knew we were safe, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether my family were going to be OK. In Afghanistan I had rockets firing over my head and didn\u2019t know where they were going to land. I would be out in the yard playing with my cousin, and you could hear the rockets. The racism and all the other stuff didn\u2019t compare to trying to survive.\u201d The family settled in Vancouver, where Bashir opened a pizza restaurant and Nasrin a hair salon. As a teenager, Jamalzadah became obsessed with reports about the war in Afghanistan, searching online and watching the news as soon as she was home from school. \u201cI wanted to know how my family was, because there was no phone, no contact. I would think the worst when the bombings were happening, right after 9/11.\u201d Her parents had urged her not to take opportunities and freedoms for granted, and she didn\u2019t, but it also made her feel guilty that she was living such a different life to the friends she had left in Afghanistan. \u201cMy parents wanted me to use all of it fully so they were constantly reminding me how lucky I was.

      "bodyText": "Students who go to university after receiving an unconditional offer before their A-level results are more likely to drop out in their first year, research shows. Analysis by the Office for Students (OfS), the universities regulator, found that the dropout rate was 10% higher for students who accepted unconditional offers than would be expected had they received conditional offers. Traditionally, universities offer places subject to the applicant achieving the required A-level results. In recent years, however, there has been a huge increase in unconditional offers, which guarantee a place regardless of results. According to the OfS analysis, in 2012 one in every 100 18-year-olds in England received an offer with an unconditional element, and by 2018 the proportion had gone up to more than one in three. Critics are particularly concerned about so-called conditional unconditional offers, by which a university guarantees a student a place regardless of A-level results but only if they select the institution as their first option. The government has accused universities of unacceptable pressure-selling tactics. The OfS said its analysis discounted factors linked to dropout rates such as what subject a student studied, what university they were at and demographics. It said if the pattern persisted, more than 200 students a year could drop out who otherwise would have been expected to continue. Nicola Dandridge, the OfS chief executive, said: \u201cWe already know that students who receive an unconditional offer are more likely to miss their predicted grades at school. It is a cause of real concern that they are also more likely to drop out of university once they get there.\u201d Since a cap on student numbers was lifted, universities have been free to recruit as many students as they wish. The number of 18-year-olds in the UK population is falling and some institutions are struggling to fill spaces. \u201cWe have always been clear that some unconditional offers are necessary and in a student\u2019s interests,\u201d said Dandridge. \u201cBut many of them are not. Although it is up to universities to decide who to admit and how, they must take responsibility for the impact of those decisions and provide the right support for all students to be successful \u2013 especially if the offer they receive makes them less likely to do well at school.\u201d The University and College Union, which represents lecturers and other university staff, said the OfS findings reinforced the need for urgent reform of the admissions system. \u201cUniversities scrabbling to attract students with unconditional offers are too often focused on the bottom line rather than student interests,\u201d said the union\u2019s general secretary, Jo Grady. \u201cThese latest figures show that many students are ill-served by the current admissions system and that there is a real need for urgent reform. A move to post-qualification admissions, where students receive offers after they get their results, would be much fairer to students.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 310-year-old violin left behind by its owner on a train\u2019s luggage rack has been stolen, according to police. Stephen Morris left the instrument worth \u00a3250,000 on a London Victoria to Orpington train when he got off at Penge, south-east London, last Tuesday evening. He had appealed to the public for help, saying losing it was \u201clike having my arm cut off\u201d. After examining CCTV footage from the journey, British Transport Police said another man took the violin as the train, which had left Victoria at 11.58pm, approached Bromley South, before getting on to another train to St Mary Cray. The force has released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to about the missing instrument. The instrument, which dates to 1709, was one of only a few made by David Tecchler, a master craftsman considered to be the leading violin and cello maker of the renowned Roman school of violin making. The recently restored violin was in a white case when Morris left it on the train. It is marked with Tecchler\u2019s name inside. Morris has led a number of UK orchestras and performed as a soloist alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, and as a guest soloist director with the Scottish Ensemble and Locrian Ensemble. As a session musician he has recorded with James Brown, Stevie Wonder, David Gilmour and U2.",

      "body": "<p>Alison Prince, who has died aged 88, was an author of more than 50 books for children, as well as an artist, poet and musician, and a TV scriptwriter best known for the BBC\u2019s classic stop-motion animation series Trumpton.</p> <p>Her first script for children\u2019s TV was for the BBC pre-school programme Watch with Mother, which she wrote following the birth of her children. With Joan Hickson, another young mother whom she had met in a local playground, Alison created Joe, a story about a little boy whose parents ran a motel.</p> <p>It was broadcast in 1966 and others followed. More Joe stories were published in comics and in a Joe annual and there were also books, including Joe and a Horse and Other Stories from Watch With Mother (1968), and Joe and the Nursery School and Joe Moves House (both 1972).</p> <p>Alison had studied at the Slade School of Art and taught art in a secondary school and this artistic background combined with her storytelling skills were exactly what was needed for developing ideas for the BBC\u2019s children\u2019s programmeJackanory. Alison both wrote and presented stories for Jackanory and was then invited by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/30/monica-sims-obituary\" title=\"\">Monica Sims</a>, the head of BBC children\u2019s programmes, to write the script for Trumpton.</p> <p>A follow-up to the hugely successful Camberwick Green, Trumpton \u2013 which aired in 1967 \u2013 was also a puppet-based series, about the goings on of a small town as experienced by the local firemen.

Grub\u2019 was the silly one who came tumbling in late, having obviously been interrupted halfway through a ham sandwich. Two were absolutely identical, so I felt they must be twins: Pugh and Pugh. Another one, who had a certain largeness of gesture, I imagined to be Irish. He became Barney McGrew.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Alison wrote the 13 episodes at speed while watching the family washing go round at the local launderette. She saw it just as \u201ca little job\u201d and sold the script for each episode outright for \u00a315, having no idea that the programme would become the success that it did.</p> <p>Scriptwriting for children\u2019s TV launched Alison\u2019s book-writing career, which was also almost all for children. She had an easy fluency that she applied to stories of any kinds and for all ages. Her tales were warm-hearted adventures with a variety of settings and characters, written with the express intention of entertaining and amusing readers.</p> <p>She had a light and humorous touch and particularly enjoyed writing for newly confident readers, especially when she put animals at the centre of the stories, as in Bumble (2001), the story of a hamster aptly named for his large rear, and Spud (2003), told through the eyes of the big-hearted and big-stomached eponymous doggy hero.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf05d81158734e4ce978d35b8bc6d35f3683ae95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf05d81158734e4ce978d35b8bc6d35f3683ae95/0_0_309_475/309.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost King by Alison Prince\" width=\"309\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lost King by Alison Prince</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For older readers she was deft at writing historical stories, including How\u2019s Business (1987), set in the second world war, and The Lost King: Richard III and the Princes in the Tower (2014). In all her historical novels she balanced authenticity and accessibility, and was equally sure-footed with contemporary settings. She achieved critical success most notably for The Sherwood Hero, a contemporary remake of the Robin Hood legend set in 1990s Glasgow, for which she was a joint winner, with Philip Pullman, of the 1996 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/guardianchildrensfictionprize\" title=\"\">Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize</a>. Later, her thriller Oranges and Murder was the Scottish Arts Council\u2019s children\u2019s book of the year in 2002.</p> <p>Alison never stopped writing; interviewed when she was 86 she said she had no lack of ideas, just less time to write them down. Her books continued to be successful in the UK and were also translated into other languages, including Danish, German, Japanese and Welsh. Her notable contribution to children\u2019s books from the 70s onwards was recognised in 2005 when she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Leicester for services to children\u2019s literature.</p> <p>For adults, Alison wrote a biography of each of the great children\u2019s writers Kenneth Grahame (2015) and Hans Christian Andersen (1998). She also wrote The Necessary Goat (1992), a collection of essays on formative thinking created during a fellowship in creative writing at Jordanhill College, Glasgow. A lover of poetry from childhood, she wrote two collections of poems, The Whifflet Train (2003) and Waking at Five Happens Again (2016), and had many single poems published in magazines. She won the Literary Review\u2019s grand poetry prize twice.</p> <p>Alison was born in Beckenham, Kent, where she was educated at the local girls\u2019 grammar school. Her father, Charles, worked in the City as the manager of the Yorkshire Bank in London, while her mother, Louise (nee David), who initially trained as a nurse, was instrumental in developing the local arts council in Bromley and later became mayor of Bromley.</p> <p>From Beckenham girls, Alison won a scholarship to the Slade. Its influence never left her and she regarded herself as much an artist as a writer. On graduating, Alison found it hard to earn a living from her art; instead, she trained as a teacher at Goldsmiths College, London, and taught art at the Elliott school in Putney, south-west London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e47ca354f1fb79f23926289dcf823dfa55606a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e47ca354f1fb79f23926289dcf823dfa55606a20/0_0_328_500/328.jpg\" alt=\"The Sherwood Hero by Alison Prince\" width=\"328\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sherwood Hero by Alison Prince</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following her marriage in 1957 to Goronwy Parry, a geography and sports teacher at the school, and the birth of their three children, Alison moved into teaching art classes for adults. She also got work as a reviewer and began writing short stories for magazines, before her success with television scriptwriting. </p> <p>From her early days as a teacher, Alison valued working with children and loved the responses they offered to her work. One of her most prized writing experiences was for How\u2019s Business, created during weekly sessions in which the story was teased out with a group of children, under the auspices of a writers in schools project. The book was later made into a film (1992) and Alison remained in touch for the rest of her life with several of the children who had taken part.</p> <p>Among family and friends, Alison had the same enjoyment in being around children. She loved the directness of their thinking and their freedom and expression, and was happy to join them in make-believe and play.</p> <p>She loved the countryside and had a lifelong interest in green living and recycling, which she first put into effect when she ran a small farm in Suffolk for eight years.</p> <p>In the 80s she moved to the Scottish island of Arran, where she campaigned on green issues in articles under the heading \u201cOn the Green\u201d for the <a href=\"https://www.arranbanner.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Arran Banner</a>. She also served on the Arran community council, helped sustain the local poetry society and writers group and, as an excellent clarinet player, was a member of the Jazz Caf\u00e9 Band.</p> <p>Goronwy died in 1991. She is survived by their three children, Samantha, Andy and Ben, her son John from an earlier relationship, by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Alison Prince, writer, born 26 March 1931; died 12 October 2019</p>",

She saw it just as \u201ca little job\u201d and sold the script for each episode outright for \u00a315, having no idea that the programme would become the success that it did. Scriptwriting for children\u2019s TV launched Alison\u2019s book-writing career, which was also almost all for children. She had an easy fluency that she applied to stories of any kinds and for all ages. Her tales were warm-hearted adventures with a variety of settings and characters, written with the express intention of entertaining and amusing readers. She had a light and humorous touch and particularly enjoyed writing for newly confident readers, especially when she put animals at the centre of the stories, as in Bumble (2001), the story of a hamster aptly named for his large rear, and Spud (2003), told through the eyes of the big-hearted and big-stomached eponymous doggy hero. For older readers she was deft at writing historical stories, including How\u2019s Business (1987), set in the second world war, and The Lost King: Richard III and the Princes in the Tower (2014). In all her historical novels she balanced authenticity and accessibility, and was equally sure-footed with contemporary settings. She achieved critical success most notably for The Sherwood Hero, a contemporary remake of the Robin Hood legend set in 1990s Glasgow, for which she was a joint winner, with Philip Pullman, of the 1996 Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize. Later, her thriller Oranges and Murder was the Scottish Arts Council\u2019s children\u2019s book of the year in 2002. Alison never stopped writing; interviewed when she was 86 she said she had no lack of ideas, just less time to write them down. Her books continued to be successful in the UK and were also translated into other languages, including Danish, German, Japanese and Welsh. Her notable contribution to children\u2019s books from the 70s onwards was recognised in 2005 when she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Leicester for services to children\u2019s literature. For adults, Alison wrote a biography of each of the great children\u2019s writers Kenneth Grahame (2015) and Hans Christian Andersen (1998). She also wrote The Necessary Goat (1992), a collection of essays on formative thinking created during a fellowship in creative writing at Jordanhill College, Glasgow. A lover of poetry from childhood, she wrote two collections of poems, The Whifflet Train (2003) and Waking at Five Happens Again (2016), and had many single poems published in magazines. She won the Literary Review\u2019s grand poetry prize twice. Alison was born in Beckenham, Kent, where she was educated at the local girls\u2019 grammar school. Her father, Charles, worked in the City as the manager of the Yorkshire Bank in London, while her mother, Louise (nee David), who initially trained as a nurse, was instrumental in developing the local arts council in Bromley and later became mayor of Bromley. From Beckenham girls, Alison won a scholarship to the Slade. Its influence never left her and she regarded herself as much an artist as a writer. On graduating, Alison found it hard to earn a living from her art; instead, she trained as a teacher at Goldsmiths College, London, and taught art at the Elliott school in Putney, south-west London. Following her marriage in 1957 to Goronwy Parry, a geography and sports teacher at the school, and the birth of their three children, Alison moved into teaching art classes for adults. She also got work as a reviewer and began writing short stories for magazines, before her success with television scriptwriting. From her early days as a teacher, Alison valued working with children and loved the responses they offered to her work. One of her most prized writing experiences was for How\u2019s Business, created during weekly sessions in which the story was teased out with a group of children, under the auspices of a writers in schools project. The book was later made into a film (1992) and Alison remained in touch for the rest of her life with several of the children who had taken part. Among family and friends, Alison had the same enjoyment in being around children. She loved the directness of their thinking and their freedom and expression, and was happy to join them in make-believe and play. She loved the countryside and had a lifelong interest in green living and recycling, which she first put into effect when she ran a small farm in Suffolk for eight years. In the 80s she moved to the Scottish island of Arran, where she campaigned on green issues in articles under the heading \u201cOn the Green\u201d for the Arran Banner. She also served on the Arran community council, helped sustain the local poetry society and writers group and, as an excellent clarinet player, was a member of the Jazz Caf\u00e9 Band. Goronwy died in 1991. She is survived by their three children, Samantha, Andy and Ben, her son John from an earlier relationship, by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. \u2022 Alison Prince, writer, born 26 March 1931; died 12 October 2019",

But modern-day tree technology has leapt forward and uses injection moulding to create realistic sprigs. Even close up, the pricier artificial ones can fool most consumers into thinking they are real.</p> <p>But looks are not everything. With major retailers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\" title=\"\">John Lewis</a> reporting that \u201cfaux\u201d or artificial trees typically made from plastic are now outselling traditional fresh trees, are the ersatz ones an environmental nightmare?</p> <p>According to the Carbon Trust, it is the manufacture of the plastic, from oil, that creates most \u2013 around two-thirds \u2013 of their carbon emissions. A further quarter is created by the industrial emissions produced when the tree itself is made. Their carbon footprint is boosted by the trees typically being shipped by container from China before arriving in the shops.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth is advising consumers who have fake trees to keep using them for as long as possible (and today\u2019s versions will last for years) but to look into more environmentally friendly options when it comes to a replacement.</p> <p>Its tree campaigner Emi Murphy says: \u201cBuying a potted tree with roots lets you grow it outside and use it again year after year, reducing its environmental impact and costing you less. A living tree will carry on absorbing carbon from the atmosphere for years to come. The other option to check out is the tree-rental service offered by many garden centres and plant nurseries.\u201d Alternatively, string some fairy lights over a houseplant you already have.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Penzance could take inspiration from London\u2019s fashion district Carnaby Street, which is promising a \u201cworld-first\u201d sustainable ocean-style Christmas installation to be unveiled next week.

      "bodyText": "Residents of Penzance, Cornwall, the UK\u2019s first \u201cplastic-free\u201d town, were understandably piqued this week to find that 150 Christmas trees had been put up \u2013 every single one made of plastic. Local business chiefs behind the move defended their decision to opt for fake trees for the community and insisted they were more sustainable than the fresh alternative \u2013 which would later have to be burned \u2013 and could be dusted off and reused for many years. Artificial trees used to be a manky wire frame with a bit of tinsel attached, typically left forgotten in the loft along with their tangled Christmas lights. But modern-day tree technology has leapt forward and uses injection moulding to create realistic sprigs. Even close up, the pricier artificial ones can fool most consumers into thinking they are real. But looks are not everything. With major retailers such as John Lewis reporting that \u201cfaux\u201d or artificial trees typically made from plastic are now outselling traditional fresh trees, are the ersatz ones an environmental nightmare? According to the Carbon Trust, it is the manufacture of the plastic, from oil, that creates most \u2013 around two-thirds \u2013 of their carbon emissions. A further quarter is created by the industrial emissions produced when the tree itself is made. Their carbon footprint is boosted by the trees typically being shipped by container from China before arriving in the shops. Friends of the Earth is advising consumers who have fake trees to keep using them for as long as possible (and today\u2019s versions will last for years) but to look into more environmentally friendly options when it comes to a replacement. Its tree campaigner Emi Murphy says: \u201cBuying a potted tree with roots lets you grow it outside and use it again year after year, reducing its environmental impact and costing you less. A living tree will carry on absorbing carbon from the atmosphere for years to come. The other option to check out is the tree-rental service offered by many garden centres and plant nurseries.\u201d Alternatively, string some fairy lights over a houseplant you already have. Meanwhile, Penzance could take inspiration from London\u2019s fashion district Carnaby Street, which is promising a \u201cworld-first\u201d sustainable ocean-style Christmas installation to be unveiled next week. Every element will use recycled and reusable materials. These include repurposed fishing netting to look like green kelp, more than 500m of post-use bubble wrap standing in for coral and more than 1,500 recycled plastic bottles for fish and bubbles. The finishing touches have been added in with over 100 litres of water-based eco-friendly, vegan paint. Eat your heart out, David Attenborough.",

      "bodyText": "Even if you didn\u2019t buy a copy of Protect and Survive in 1980, you may still be familiar with the UK government\u2019s official guide to surviving nuclear war. The British public\u2019s reaction, when they learned that their government had been making preparations for a nuclear conflict for almost three decades, was both immediate and very British: they made fun of it. \u2018Make a \u201clean-to\u201d with sloping doors taken from rooms above or strong boards rested against an inner wall,\u2019 suggested Protect and Survive. The 32-page booklet, which contained instructions for civilians on how to best prepare their homes \u2013 the contents for a good \u201csurvival kit\u201d, how to build a toilet from a chair and a bucket, and what to do with your loved ones when they died \u2013 was a unique combination of sinister and silly; societal collapse and radiation poisoning don\u2019t really suit the bland language of bureaucrats. Previously only distributed to journalists and emergency planners, it had remained a badly kept secret until 1980, when The Times ran a campaign challenging Britain\u2019s preparedness should the cold war turn hot. Finally, the government published it. The structure of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKMO), and its role in warning the nation, are outlined in this promotional booklet from 1974. In a 1982 Young Ones episode, the hapless housemates hide under tables after finding a bomb in their kitchen, with Neil announcing: \u201cI\u2019m going to consult the incredibly helpful Protect and Survive manual!\u201d Jethro Tull wrote a song about it. (\u201cThey said protect and you\u2019ll survive / But our postman didn\u2019t call.\u201d) It spawned countless parodies by the peace movement and inspired similar guides in everything from the BBC\u2019s Threads (under the title Advising the Householder) to the video game Fallout 2. One illustration from it, of a family glumly looking at their shelter, became the cover art for Radiohead\u2019s single Karma Police. But Protect and Survive was not the first guide produced by the UK government on surviving nuclear war. Taras Young, author of a new history titled Nuclear War in the UK, estimates he has collected 500 booklets, pamphlets and posters produced by national and local government, volunteers and businesses. \u201cUntil you see them all in one place, it\u2019s hard to appreciate the scale of how much of this stuff was being produced,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was so much more going on than Protect and Survive.\u201d Despite describing them as \u201csinister yet pathetic\u201d, Young, who works in marketing but is about to start a PhD on the guides, has loved them since discovering Atomic Warfare (1961) in his grandparents\u2019 attic when he was 10 years old. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t got a good cover, but finding that was quite exciting. They were essentially advertising campaigns. For me as a marketer, it\u2019s like the ultimate form of marketing \u2013 can you convince people that they\u2019re going to survive when they won\u2019t?\u201d The Hydrogen Bomb (1957). The first pamphlet distributed to the public was Civil Defence and the Atom Bomb, published in 1952. In 1955, the Strath report \u2013 a government-commissioned investigation into how Britain would cope after a nuclear war \u2013 found that the country would be left on the brink of collapse with millions dead. This made the next pamphlet, 1957\u2019s The Hydrogen Bomb, hugely popular. Bomb booklets from 1983-84 By 1963, Advising the Householder on Protection Against Nuclear Attack had a print run of 500,000 copies. Meanwhile, councils across the UK were producing localised guides that imagined nuclear war decimating their high streets, with everywhere from Hull to Bristol getting their own dedicated pamphlets. There were so many that Young says there is now a steadily growing community of collectors in the UK. Some have personal connections to the country\u2019s preparatory efforts, like former volunteers of the Royal Observer Corps, a civilian volunteer force who crewed around 1,500 tiny, three-person bunkers across the UK, many on farming land. Some volunteers have even gone on to buy the bunkers they once served in and turned them into museums. The Home Office produced a set of training posters in 1958 which depicted typical British street scenes before and after a nuclear attack. The dilemma for the government since the 1950s, Young says, was that they knew that their guides \u201cweren\u2019t necessarily particularly useful.\u201d \u201cBut at the same time, they had to be seen to be producing something, as they couldn\u2019t just admit that we\u2019d all die,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they produce the stuff, people will criticise it as being useless. If they don\u2019t produce it, then they\u2019ll be criticised for not doing anything.\u201d The Home Office produced a set of training posters in 1958 that depicted typical British street scenes before and after a nuclear attack. The pamphlets were less about imparting knowledge and more about preventing negative public responses such as riots, Young says. While researching his book, he found a note by one of the civil servants preparing Protect and Survive: \u201cIt said something like, \u2018We must make people believe that they can survive.\u2019 Not that they could survive, but they needed to believe they could \u2013 that kind of sums up the whole thing. And even if you did survive, then what? You\u2019ve survived into hell on Earth. Is there any point in living with envy of the dead?\u201d After the humiliation of Protect and Survive, the government stopped distributing guides to the public, and quietly sent them only to emergency planners. In 1986, home secretary Douglas Hurd said: \u201cIf new material was issued now, everyone would throw it into the wastepaper basket or make fun of it as they did with Protect and Survive. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a sensible purpose in it.\u201d From The Hydrogen Bomb (1957) But the booklet spawned an unofficial spin-off: Protect and Survive Monthly, a magazine written by proto-preppers that ran 1981 to 1983. After a foreword in the first issue by Leon Brittan, the government distanced itself, with later issues reading more like conspiracy theory. \u201cIt became quite loopy and rightwing towards the end,\u201d Young says. \u201cThe images are great, though \u2013 they mostly came from shelter companies who saw a chance to cash in.\u201d Hurd\u2019s prediction, that any pamphlet after Protect and Survive would be mocked or thrown away, wasn\u2019t necessarily incorrect.

Firefighters showed \u201ccourage and devotion to duty\u201d and 999 call operators were \u201cunstinting\u201d in their efforts to help trapped residents.

      "body": "<p>Last weekend, Thunderdome made history: 50,000 ravers massed at a convention centre in Utrecht for the biggest indoor hardcore dance event ever staged, breaking its own record set two years ago when it pulled off the mother of all comebacks, and reclaimed its crown as the world\u2019s greatest living hardcore rave.</p> <p>The site is mapped out like a theme park, with six areas of music ranging from the slower early rave sound of the \u201cThundergods\u201d to the 200+ beats per minute blasting from the Tunnel of Terror. Tonight we\u2019re paying homage to the most significant youth culture movement in the Netherlands, gabber, which is why there\u2019s also a gabber museum, displaying limited-edition Nikes and multicoloured Australian-brand jackets \u2013 the gabber uniform \u2013 plus a tattoo station inking diehards with <a href=\"https://www.thunderdome.com/\">Thunderdome</a>\u2019s iconic Wizard logo, and a gabber barber serving up undercuts.</p> <p>Hardcore is one of the most liberated and liberating genres in dance music, encompassing a vast range of speeds, styles, and emotions. It creates euphoria from the extremities and isn\u2019t for everybody \u2013 which is why those that are in it, are in all the way.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Thunderdome brought this sound to the masses. It launched the careers of hundreds of DJs and soundtracked the youth of millions worldwide; it is one of the few living relics from the heyday of rave, charged with the difficult task of staying grounded in the present while simultaneously preserving the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10c9a90c1342de5d614a1608e4a7629488318b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10c9a90c1342de5d614a1608e4a7629488318b47/0_0_2048_1036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reach for the lasers!

The main Thunderdome arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Delio Nijmeijer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first Thunderdome event was held in an ice-skating arena in October 1992. It featured four relatively unknown DJs on the bill (who would go on to become superstars) and a colossal octopus fairground ride the team feared might crash through the ice rink. The promoters were two plucky 20-year-old schoolfriends from a village outside Amsterdam, and this was only the second major event they had ever attempted. Their first, The Final Exam, ended with the pair of them, brooms in hand, sweeping up the venue themselves afterwards. \u201cThe party finished at seven in the morning and we were still busy at 11 that night,\u201d recalls Irfan van Ewijk.</p> <p>Now both approaching 50, van Ewijk and Duncan Stutterheim are retired dance music moguls, and have walked away from the multinational events company they built together from Thunderdome \u2013 not that it was an easy journey.</p> <p>The story of <a href=\"https://www.id-t.com/\">ID&amp;T</a> has been chronicled in a 700-page tome by the Dutch newspaper journalist <a href=\"https://marygowild.nl/product/celebrate-life/\">Gert van Veen</a>, and it reads like a soap opera. Within the first year the company locked horns with major label Arcade Records over the rights to the Thunderdome CD series. \u201cWhen we had the meeting I was celebrating my birthday, so I came in with a cake as if the deal was already done, which pissed them off so hard,\u201d says van Ewijk with a laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dda8e331846ed817b9443bc728920949320f7510\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dda8e331846ed817b9443bc728920949320f7510/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thundergods \u2026 DJs Gizmo, Buzz Fuzz and Dano of the Dreamteam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thundergods \u2026 DJs Gizmo, Buzz Fuzz and Dano of the Dreamteam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Thunderdome</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The CDs, which ID&amp;T ended up producing with Arcade, were instrumental in seeding the sound of Thunderdome to the world, and are still rolled out today. This year\u2019s triple edition features 72 tracks of new music and edits, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0phlkEmzVI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">the official Thunderdome 2019 anthem</a> by <a href=\"http://ditherproductions.nl/\">Dither</a>, who performs beneath an enormous neon Wizard on the main stage to a sea of 25,000 bodies and glinting phone screens. The scene\u2019s current torchbearers, including <a href=\"https://angerfist.nl/\">Angerfist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.missk8.com/\">Miss K8</a>, play amid a spectacle of lasers and fire, ending in a sweaty closing set from \u201cGrandpa\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Public-Figure/Drokz-161616527231458/\">Drokz</a> as pillars of flame shoot skywards from the front of the stage.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a more intimate experience plays out at the Thundergods area. Residents <a href=\"http://djdano.nl/\">Dano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dj.buzz.fuzz/\">Buzz Fuzz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/djgizmoofficial/\">Gizmo</a> \u2013 also known as the Dreamteam with fourth member <a href=\"https://djtheprophet.com/\">the Prophet</a> \u2013 DJ together with the wild charisma and selections that made them the most famous hardcore group in the 90s. The set is crammed with hits from their own vault, plus fun hardcore versions of pop songs such as Message In a Bottle by the Police and Steppenwolf\u2019s Born to Be Wild.</p> <p>\u201cI remember when I put on my first record, my hand was shaking like a little child,\u201d says Dano, about playing to over 30,000 people at the very first ice-rink Thunderdome.

      "bodyText": "Last weekend, Thunderdome made history: 50,000 ravers massed at a convention centre in Utrecht for the biggest indoor hardcore dance event ever staged, breaking its own record set two years ago when it pulled off the mother of all comebacks, and reclaimed its crown as the world\u2019s greatest living hardcore rave. The site is mapped out like a theme park, with six areas of music ranging from the slower early rave sound of the \u201cThundergods\u201d to the 200+ beats per minute blasting from the Tunnel of Terror. Tonight we\u2019re paying homage to the most significant youth culture movement in the Netherlands, gabber, which is why there\u2019s also a gabber museum, displaying limited-edition Nikes and multicoloured Australian-brand jackets \u2013 the gabber uniform \u2013 plus a tattoo station inking diehards with Thunderdome\u2019s iconic Wizard logo, and a gabber barber serving up undercuts. Hardcore is one of the most liberated and liberating genres in dance music, encompassing a vast range of speeds, styles, and emotions. It creates euphoria from the extremities and isn\u2019t for everybody \u2013 which is why those that are in it, are in all the way. In the 1990s, Thunderdome brought this sound to the masses. It launched the careers of hundreds of DJs and soundtracked the youth of millions worldwide; it is one of the few living relics from the heyday of rave, charged with the difficult task of staying grounded in the present while simultaneously preserving the past. The first Thunderdome event was held in an ice-skating arena in October 1992. It featured four relatively unknown DJs on the bill (who would go on to become superstars) and a colossal octopus fairground ride the team feared might crash through the ice rink. The promoters were two plucky 20-year-old schoolfriends from a village outside Amsterdam, and this was only the second major event they had ever attempted. Their first, The Final Exam, ended with the pair of them, brooms in hand, sweeping up the venue themselves afterwards. \u201cThe party finished at seven in the morning and we were still busy at 11 that night,\u201d recalls Irfan van Ewijk. Now both approaching 50, van Ewijk and Duncan Stutterheim are retired dance music moguls, and have walked away from the multinational events company they built together from Thunderdome \u2013 not that it was an easy journey. The story of ID&amp;T has been chronicled in a 700-page tome by the Dutch newspaper journalist Gert van Veen, and it reads like a soap opera. Within the first year the company locked horns with major label Arcade Records over the rights to the Thunderdome CD series. \u201cWhen we had the meeting I was celebrating my birthday, so I came in with a cake as if the deal was already done, which pissed them off so hard,\u201d says van Ewijk with a laugh. The CDs, which ID&amp;T ended up producing with Arcade, were instrumental in seeding the sound of Thunderdome to the world, and are still rolled out today. This year\u2019s triple edition features 72 tracks of new music and edits, including the official Thunderdome 2019 anthem by Dither, who performs beneath an enormous neon Wizard on the main stage to a sea of 25,000 bodies and glinting phone screens. The scene\u2019s current torchbearers, including Angerfist and Miss K8, play amid a spectacle of lasers and fire, ending in a sweaty closing set from \u201cGrandpa\u201d Drokz as pillars of flame shoot skywards from the front of the stage. Meanwhile, a more intimate experience plays out at the Thundergods area. Residents Dano, Buzz Fuzz and Gizmo \u2013 also known as the Dreamteam with fourth member the Prophet \u2013 DJ together with the wild charisma and selections that made them the most famous hardcore group in the 90s. The set is crammed with hits from their own vault, plus fun hardcore versions of pop songs such as Message In a Bottle by the Police and Steppenwolf\u2019s Born to Be Wild. \u201cI remember when I put on my first record, my hand was shaking like a little child,\u201d says Dano, about playing to over 30,000 people at the very first ice-rink Thunderdome. This year he ends his set mounting the DJ booth, arms raised, to the sound of his own cult classic, 120-9000BPM, from one of the earliest CDs, exclusively produced by the Dreamteam. \u201cWhat happened in Holland, the whole world wanted in a finger snap,\u201d says Dano, who describes his launch to fame like a catapult. In the 90s, gabber exploded in the Netherlands until overexposure and commercial exploitation caused the scene to crash and go back underground. The media played its part in the demise. Press sensationalised the excesses of gabber culture with stories focused on drugs, football-related hooliganism, and incidents of racially motivated violence connected to the the rise of right-wing extremism in the Netherlands towards the end of the decade. The legacy of prolonged negative profiling from \u201coutsiders\u201d has left the hardcore scene scarred, although the work of contemporary scholars, researchers and visual artists about gabber history, alongside a wider interest in the music, is going some way to remove the stigma. The darker hardcore sound that emerged after the gabber crash and some of the artists that helped rekindle the scene \u2013 like DJ Promo, who programmed Thunderdome in the early 00s \u2013 are paid tribute to this year as the Heroes of Hardcore in the second largest area, with a capacity twice the size of Fabric in London. Thunderdome was wound up by ID&amp;T in 2012, but someone at the company was unwilling to let it die. Francois Maas, an employee since 1999, decided to keep the brand going \u201cin secret\u201d. After Thunderdome\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d party in December 2012, Maas organised a series of fan days and meetups over the following years with the help of a young intern, Nick Hoppezak, who joined the event\u2019s radio team at the tender age of 11. Hoppezak, now in his 20s, opens one of the smaller areas with a hardcore-indebted techno set to a crowd of cheering friends and other artists \u2013 his Thunderdome family. Thunderdome\u2019s return was announced by aerial stunt in the summer of 2016 when a plane was spotted in the sky with the message: \u201c25 Years of Thunderdome \u2013 see you in 2017!\u201d Maas says the event sold out in 30 minutes, and was only intended to be a one-off.

      "bodyText": "The Personal History of David Copperfield, the Dickens adaptation starring Dev Patel and directed by Armando Iannucci, has emerged as the front runner for the British independent film awards (Bifa) with 11 nominations, including best British independent film and best actor for Patel. Runners-up in the nominations count is the country and western musical Wild Rose, which stars Jessie Buckley as a young Glaswegian singer dreaming of success and scored 10 nods, and the retro-horror homage In Fabric, directed by Peter Strickland, which has nine. Another auteur piece, the Joanna Hogg-directed The Souvenir, also did well, with eight nominations, including best director. Although it has not yet been released in the UK, The Personal History of David Copperfield won wide praise after its premiere at the Toronto film festival and its subsequent opening slot at the London film festival. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw described it as a \u201cterrifically likable, genial adaptation [that] taps into the author\u2019s humanity and optimism\u201d and \u201ca bracing, entertaining, richly satisfying experience\u201d. Surprisingly, though, despite receiving a nod for best screenplay, Iannucci has not been nominated for best director. Equally surprising is the absence of double Palme d\u2019Or winner Ken Loach from the director list, with his latest film, the highly acclaimed gig-economy drama Sorry We Missed You securing only two nominations, for best actor (Kris Hitchen) and best screenplay (Paul Laverty). The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 1 December.

But government opponents called for an urgent investigation and some political analysts foresaw choppy waters ahead for both Bolsonaro and Brazil. Former environment minister Marina Silva demanded an inquiry into what she called \u201cvery serious allegations \u2026 so that not the slightest suspicion hangs over the occupant of the highest office in the republic\u201d. Jean-Paul Prates, a senator for the leftist Workers\u2019 party (PT), said foreign investors would \u201cshudder\u201d as they watched Bolsonaro\u2019s social media rant. \u201cThis could be a devastating blow for Bolsonaro,\u201d said David Miranda, a leftist Rio congressman who was friends with Franco.

It is an investigation not an accusation,\u201d Freixo said. Tuesday night\u2019s report is not the first time Bolsonaro has been linked to Franco\u2019s suspected killers. In March, a photograph emerged showing a grinning Bolsonaro with his arm around Queiroz, who police believe was driving the car used to commit the crime. Earlier this month another photograph surfaced showing Bolsonaro with Josinaldo Lucas Freitas, a martial arts instructor suspected of throwing the guns used in Franco\u2019s murder into the sea. Police have also confirmed that one of Bolsonaro\u2019s sons had dated Lessa\u2019s daughter. Brazilian reports have painted Bolsonaro\u2019s neighbour as a ruthless killer who lost his leg in a 2009 bomb attack and made a fortune as a member of a group of contract killers called the Escrit\u00f3rio do Crime (the Crime Bureau).

      "bodyText": "I have just read a beautiful book about something truly obscene. Full of lovely pictures and occasional bits of text, it\u2019s the kind you might read with your four-year-old. It shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank. It\u2019s a No-Money Day is narrated by the daughter who sees how her mother worries over every penny, while shielding her from the painful stuff. \u201cThere\u2019s no more cereal, so I have the last piece of toast. Luckily Mum isn\u2019t hungry,\u201d the girl says; and you know the biggest thing Mum will have for breakfast is her own little white lie. When they reach the food bank, the child tucks into biscuits and squash while her mother sags like a balloon from which the air has escaped. Only just published, it is believed to be the UK\u2019s first picture book about food banks. And, while the subject has been handled compassionately by the prize-winning author Kate Milner, I can\u2019t help but see that landmark as a disgrace \u2013 for all of us. It is the watershed moment when Britain\u2019s food banks go from newspaper headlines to a subject that teachers cover in classrooms; the moment at which mass destitution is no longer a badge of political failure but is instead accepted as part of British life. As recently as 10 years ago, child poverty was an evil that prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both vowed to abolish; now it is something you shamefacedly explain to your child as he or she nestles in your lap. Picture books used to be small worlds where kids could dream about farmyard animals and cuddly monsters; today they teach about the vast number of people that their parents\u2019 generation treat like dirt. In 2016 David Cameron casually dropped the legally binding targets to reduce child poverty \u2013 and those figures jumped. More than 4 million children live in poverty in the UK today \u2013 or nine kids in every classroom of 30. At the start of this decade, the Trussell Trust ran just 57 food banks, giving 14,000 food parcels a year to children. It operated 428 food banks last year, handing nearly 580,000 parcels to children. This is a charity that sees itself as temporary. Our failure as a society is making it permanent. In one of the richest societies in human history, such figures should mortify us, yet the Westminster classes take them as unremarkable. They hardly ever trouble TV bulletins or newspaper columns, while Conservative cabinet ministers such as Michael Gove sneer at the impoverished for not being able to \u201cmanage their finances\u201d. As the UK staggers into a rage-filled general election, well-lunched gasbags will solemnly inform us that this is an election about \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d \u2013 while ignoring the cuts, the broken economy and the other causes that helped to drive the Brexit vote of 2016. Dealing with those causes would entail being winched out of the deep embrace of the TV studio sofas, tearing out the IV drip that feeds them the untreated bullshit of No 10 \u201csources\u201d, and seeing more of the country than could ever be conveyed in a fleeting vox pop. If the experts did that, they would confront a society where levels of deprivation once considered shameful are now treated as normal; where what was scratched together just a few months ago is now relied on as part of the new, ad hoc welfare state. This week I went to Colchester, in Essex, to see something both brilliant and saddening: a Munch Club.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe parish is essentially sober but very immoral,\u201d the Reverend H Bloomer told one of social reformer Charles Booth\u2019s researchers at the end of the 19th century. He claimed to have been personally responsible for closing 20 brothels, though four to his knowledge remained. It\u2019s not very shocking that my neighbourhood in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s North Islington constituency was a den of vice in late Victorian times. After all, Hornsey Road was formerly known as the Devil\u2019s Lane and frequented by highwaymen. The superb Hornsey Road blog once attempted to exorcise my manor\u2019s diabolical reputation with the ironic tag line \u201cprobably not over a hell mouth\u201d. But maybe it is. Peter Ackroyd in London: The Biography argued that neighbourhoods retained their venerable spirits. \u201c[T]here are areas of London where time seems to have come to an end,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor ceaselessly to repeat itself.\u201d St Giles was a case in point: the impoverished district near Covent Garden inspired Hogarth\u2019s Gin Lane, and 250 years later Ackroyd found striking similarities in the 21st-century rough sleepers in its churchyard. That suggestion of eternal recurrence would explain a lot about Hornsey Road \u2013 why present-day highwaymen on mopeds nicked the phone from my hands a few years ago; why a London knife crime map would require a lot of ink in that section; why the Hamlet Cafe, whose walls feature a reproduction of Delacroix\u2019s graveyard scene, captures the manor\u2019s gloomy vibe; and why police and councillors clamped down on Aqua Sauna in 2013, saying the feared Romanian women found working there would be be \u201charmed or exploited\u201d. More likely my manor isn\u2019t cursed, just historically struggling against poverty. That\u2019s what Booth tried to capture between 1886 and 1903 by surveying the capital. He and his team of researchers walked every street in London, filling 450 notebooks with their finds and producing 60 maps, hand-coloured to indicate the level of poverty. Now those maps and edited highlights from their reports are being republished with input from researchers at the London School of Economics. The LSE has an online facility to compare then with the current situation, with modern underlay maps beneath Booth\u2019s poverty maps. \u201cSurely this is the right moment,\u201d argues Iain Sinclair in the book\u2019s foreword, \u201cwhen divisions between the visibly wretched and the invisibly rich in corporate, de-localised London are becoming critical, to publish a handsome, reconfigured presentation of Charles Booth\u2019s inspirational reckoning?\u201d Poverty is no longer quite so prevalent as in Booth\u2019s day: Booth concluded that 35% of Londoners lived in poverty at the end of the 19th century, and the Trust for London\u2019s latest figures indicate that 27% do so today. But compare that with a national average of 21% and it\u2019s clear there is a problem. Some things have not changed hugely in London. The map indicates a huge workhouse on Cornwallis Road; like so many other smithies and factories, it\u2019s long gone, and the site is now an adventure playground and park. But in November 1897, one of Booth\u2019s researchers, George H Duckworth \u2013 who was not only an Etonian, a Cambridge cricket blue but also Virginia Woolf\u2019s half-brother \u2013 strolled up Hornsey Road with Insp William Dyball, describing it as \u201ca road of small shops that depend for their existence on local knowledge: they give credit which the large houses on Holloway Rd and 7 Sisters Rd will not do\u201d. That sounds about right: even today, chain stores are rare and buying products \u201con tick\u201d is possible, as long as the proprietors know you. On Booth\u2019s poverty map, terraces running perpendicular to Hornsey Road are coloured brown, which means: \u201cMixed. Some comfortable, others poor.\u201d My cul de sac, running parallel to Hornsey Road, still fits that description. We\u2019ve got all sorts down here \u2013 Poles, Afghans, Pakistanis, City traders, tube train drivers, Nigerians, Cypriots, Muslims worshipping at the mosque round the corner, non-Muslims worshipping at the William Hill next door, council tenants, a declining number of people of Irish descent, Hooray Henry private tenants. Not to mention people like me who bought cheaply these modest late Victorian ex-council houses after Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy legislation and are now sitting on nest eggs that scramble the property market so as to exclude younger people. Beyond my garden fence, there was once a street of grander houses coloured red for \u201cMiddle class, well to do\u201d. The Luftwaffe did for them as they did for many of the homes in Booth\u2019s map. Today Tollington Place\u2019s bomb site is Wray Crescent Open Space, with cricket pitch, playground, and community-maintained raised beds. Let\u2019s not overstate the bucolic makeover, however: the leafy corners have long proved handy for drug deals. Not far away from Tollington Place on Booth\u2019s map is a street that sticks out like a sore thumb, since it is coloured black, signifying as Booth put it: \u201cLower class. Vicious, semi-criminal\u201d. That was Campbell Road, aka the Bunk, which from the 1860s until it was cleared as a slum in the 1950s was known as the worst street in London. Nearby, next to Hornsey Road Baths are two streets coloured light blue, defined as: \u201cPoor. 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family.\u201d On the other side of Hornsey Road are two streets coloured dark blue, defined as: \u201cVery poor, casual. Chronic want.\u201d These mean streets have been disappeared, but the neighbourhood still retains some of its earlier character. Those light blue streets, Marcellus Road and Orpingley Road, were both demolished in 1972 to make way for the Andover Estate, where Ann Widdecombe once made an exploitation doc about her battle with \u201cthe hoodies\u201d, to which the local youth responded with their own YouTube documentary Beyond the Hoodie. The dark blue streets, Denmark Terrace and Ellenborough Road have also gone, replaced by the jewel in my neighbourhood\u2019s social housing crown: Sussex Place, described in Pevsner as \u201can eight-storey crescent in red brick with lower blocks enclosing a garden: an ambitious post-war Islington scheme of 1950 by Monson, spaciously laid out, in startling contrast to the tight street of low stuccoed houses which then existed all around.\u201d It\u2019s as though the council was trying to lift the historic curse.

Similarly, Booth\u2019s researchers found Shoreditch to be \u201ca very poor and overcrowded district \u2026 the Jewish quarters particularly poor\u201d. But today Shoreditch is a byword for artist-catalysed gentrification and buy-to-let speculation. Typical of the latter is the Atlas Building, a 302-unit newbuild project that completed in June and where 70% of sales have been investment purchases. One of Booth\u2019s volunteers asked a police constable to describe Clerkenwell, just up the road from Shoreditch. He responded that it was a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of London. Which sounds like a lovely meeting point for migrant communities, prefiguring the cosmopolitan London of the 21st century. Not really: what he meant was that Clerkenwell was \u201cwhere all the stolen silver or jewels come to be melted or disassembled\u201d. It\u2019s less Dickensian and more genteel than that today. I wander off Seven Sisters Road to find out what happened to the Bunk. Today it is called Whadcoat Street, an anonymous dead end that became briefly notorious a couple of years ago when a terrorist drove into a crowd of Muslim worshippers nearby, killing a man. What\u2019s striking about the site of the Bunk today is that it\u2019s caught in a gentrification pincer movement. On one side is a new housing development of 22 private one- and two-bedroom flats called the Cottonworks, claiming to be \u201cclose to Upper Street, one of London\u2019s trendiest neighbourhood\u201d [sic]. (Upper Street isn\u2019t close, not really.)

      "bodyText": "Four days into the WTA Finals, the tournament\u2019s two big young stars, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu, have both been forced to retire with injury. On one hand it\u2019s a reflection of how difficult this long tennis season is, but it\u2019s particularly worrying news for Andreescu who has already had a startling amount of injuries at 19 years old. She just can\u2019t stay fit and it seems like she is going to have to manage her body for a long time. Well, with Andreescu out, here are the simple scenarios. American Sofia Kenin will take her place in the final match against Elina Svitolina if Andreescu can\u2019t play. There it is. Pliskova puts together another solid service game, but Andreescu is still struggling to move. She lets the final Pliskova serve go and retires from the match. Brutal. First set: Karolina Pliskova *5-3 Bianca Andreescu: Pliskova has decided to simply play her game and control the rallies. It is working. After a slew of winners including a peach of a drop shot, she breaks with a brilliant angled backhand return winner. Surely this won\u2019t last more than a set?

      "body": "<h2>Key points</h2> <p>Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn started by paying tribute to John Bercow, who was chairing his last PMQs before stepping down as Speaker.</p> <p>Corbyn then said Johnson\u2019s trade deal with Donald Trump would put more NHS money into private pockets, referencing the <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/trumps-plan-nhs-channel-4-dispatches\">Channel 4 Dispatches</a> investigation that showed the health service had been repeatedly discussed with US officials. Johnson denied the NHS was on the table and praised the way a cystic fibrosis drug had been made available.</p> <p>Corbyn said the US wanted full market access to the NHS and added that while ministers were meeting US corporations, waiting times for patients needing urgent treatment were three times longer than nine years ago. But Johnson said waiting times were improving. He added that the cystic fibrosis drug was made by a US company and asked Corbyn if the NHS should not talk to companies like that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/let-battle-commence-how-the-parties-are-shaping-up-for-decembers-election\">Let battle commence: how the parties are shaping up for December's election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corbyn replied that medicines should be imported but it should be done openly, not in secret. He said patients were waiting longer for cancer treatment. Johnson retorted that Corbyn should be paying tribute to the hard work of NHS staff, not talking them down. He said the NHS was supported by a strong economy and that the NHS in Labour-run Wales routinely missed targets.</p> <p>Corbyn said he was surprised Johnson could keep a straight face when his government had cut so much from the Welsh budget.</p> <p>Johnson said there were 17,300 more doctors and 17,000 more nurses since 2010. He said it was time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership. It is about standing up for the police, the economy and wealth creators, he said. And it means getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> done.</p> <p>Corbyn said Johnson should have tried to show some empathy. GPs are in short supply, he said. The NHS has suffered its longest spending squeeze ever. He said this election was a chance to end NHS underfunding and stop the government selling out the health service.</p> <p>Johnson replied that the choice was between economic catastrophe under Labour and two referendums, on Brexit and on Scotland. The UK would suffer \u201ctoxic torpor\u201d. He said his government would invest in education and infrastructure.</p> <h2>Snap verdict</h2> <p>We\u2019ve got six more weeks of this. Sometimes PMQs is used as an opportunity for a forensic analysis of a particular issue but on Wednesday, more than ever, it was dominated by Johnson and Corbyn rehearsing their election sloganising. And neither leader seemed to have an overwhelming advantage.</p> <p>Corbyn focused on the NHS in all his questions. Traditionally this has been Labour\u2019s strongest electoral territory and Corbyn had Johnson on the defensive throughout. His arguments about NHS underfunding and increasing waiting lists were more persuasive than Johnson\u2019s \u201call is fine\u201d bravado, and Johnson was confounded when Corbyn started talking about an individual case, because Corbyn sounded more empathetic than the PM.</p> <p>Corbyn also made it clear that he was going to spend much of the time claiming that a Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> would open the door to the further marketisation and privatisation of the NHS. Whether this is wholly true is contestable, but it is a fear that registers with people, and may work well on the doorstep.</p> <p>Johnson was weak on the actual details of how the NHS works. But his attack lines against Corbyn \u2013 accusing him of sweeping anti-Americanism, and wholesale hostility to the involvement of private firms in the NHS (even though many NHS services are privately provided anyway) \u2013 were much more powerful than anything Theresa May threw at Corbyn, and delivered with relish.</p> <p>At the end of the exchanges Corbyn and Johnson both segued into wider themes. Corbyn\u2019s line about the election providing a once in a lifetime opportunity for change resonated.

      "bodyText": "Key points Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn started by paying tribute to John Bercow, who was chairing his last PMQs before stepping down as Speaker. Corbyn then said Johnson\u2019s trade deal with Donald Trump would put more NHS money into private pockets, referencing the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation that showed the health service had been repeatedly discussed with US officials. Johnson denied the NHS was on the table and praised the way a cystic fibrosis drug had been made available. Corbyn said the US wanted full market access to the NHS and added that while ministers were meeting US corporations, waiting times for patients needing urgent treatment were three times longer than nine years ago. But Johnson said waiting times were improving. He added that the cystic fibrosis drug was made by a US company and asked Corbyn if the NHS should not talk to companies like that. Corbyn replied that medicines should be imported but it should be done openly, not in secret. He said patients were waiting longer for cancer treatment. Johnson retorted that Corbyn should be paying tribute to the hard work of NHS staff, not talking them down. He said the NHS was supported by a strong economy and that the NHS in Labour-run Wales routinely missed targets. Corbyn said he was surprised Johnson could keep a straight face when his government had cut so much from the Welsh budget. Johnson said there were 17,300 more doctors and 17,000 more nurses since 2010. He said it was time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership. It is about standing up for the police, the economy and wealth creators, he said. And it means getting Brexit done. Corbyn said Johnson should have tried to show some empathy. GPs are in short supply, he said. The NHS has suffered its longest spending squeeze ever. He said this election was a chance to end NHS underfunding and stop the government selling out the health service. Johnson replied that the choice was between economic catastrophe under Labour and two referendums, on Brexit and on Scotland. The UK would suffer \u201ctoxic torpor\u201d. He said his government would invest in education and infrastructure. Snap verdict We\u2019ve got six more weeks of this. Sometimes PMQs is used as an opportunity for a forensic analysis of a particular issue but on Wednesday, more than ever, it was dominated by Johnson and Corbyn rehearsing their election sloganising. And neither leader seemed to have an overwhelming advantage. Corbyn focused on the NHS in all his questions. Traditionally this has been Labour\u2019s strongest electoral territory and Corbyn had Johnson on the defensive throughout. His arguments about NHS underfunding and increasing waiting lists were more persuasive than Johnson\u2019s \u201call is fine\u201d bravado, and Johnson was confounded when Corbyn started talking about an individual case, because Corbyn sounded more empathetic than the PM. Corbyn also made it clear that he was going to spend much of the time claiming that a Johnson Brexit would open the door to the further marketisation and privatisation of the NHS. Whether this is wholly true is contestable, but it is a fear that registers with people, and may work well on the doorstep. Johnson was weak on the actual details of how the NHS works. But his attack lines against Corbyn \u2013 accusing him of sweeping anti-Americanism, and wholesale hostility to the involvement of private firms in the NHS (even though many NHS services are privately provided anyway) \u2013 were much more powerful than anything Theresa May threw at Corbyn, and delivered with relish. At the end of the exchanges Corbyn and Johnson both segued into wider themes. Corbyn\u2019s line about the election providing a once in a lifetime opportunity for change resonated. But it was not as catchy as Johnson\u2019s argument about Labour offering two referendums, which was just about true enough to register and stick as a key election message. (Labour is certainly promising a second Brexit referendum, which would fill some of the electorate with dread. Corbyn does not favour a second Scottish independence referendum, but he has not 100% ruled one out, and a minority Labour government dependent on Scottish National party support would probably end up agreeing to one.) Johnson\u2019s most lively attack lines were probably the ones he delivered against the SNP. It is widely assumed that the Tories will lose most of their seats in Scotland, and Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, had a good line when he said Johnson would be welcome in the country because he boosted SNP support. But even if this is true, Johnson seemed to enjoy the chance to bang on about \u201cborders at Berwick\u201d. Memorable lines The most memorable line came from Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips, who managed to pay tribute to Bercow while also getting in a dig at Johnson: I have never known this place without you here and I think it will be different. It\u2019s a delight to see your children here watching today. Because I know that while you have a responsibility to parliament you take your responsibilities as a parent incredibly seriously also. And now to the prime minister.",

Revealing the devastating toll of mounting debts on British households, official figures showed the number of personal insolvencies climbed to 30,879 in the three months to the end of September, up from 25,169 in the same period last year. A dramatic increase in bankruptcies across the construction industry sector also pushed the underlying trend for corporate insolvencies to a high not seen since the eurozone crisis was at its height in 2013. Duncan Swift, president of the insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said the figures provided \u201ca worrying insight into the state of personal finances\u201d and \u201cfurther evidence that the economic and political turbulence of the last 12 months has taken its toll on businesses\u201d.

The supplier, owned by the Spanish utility company Iberdrola, blamed mild winter weather and the government\u2019s energy price cap for the sharp drop in profits. Scottish Power reported profits of \u00a337.4m for the first nine months of the year, down from \u00a3170m in the same period last year when freezing weather, brought by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d storm, increased the amount of gas and electricity used in homes. Scottish Power said it had sold 10% less electricity and 8% less gas this year, in part because the weather had been milder but also due to a fall in customer numbers from 4.78 million this time last year to 4.62 million. The legacy big six energy companies have lost their stranglehold on the energy market in recent years due to a surge in new cut-price energy suppliers entering the market. Scottish Power reported far healthier profits in its renewable energy and energy networks business units, which are continuing to grow in line with the appetite for clean energy and \u201csmart\u201d energy grids. SP Energy Networks, which is regulated by Ofgem, reported profits of \u00a3626m for the first nine months of the year, up by 6% from last year. At Scottish Power Renewables, which owns a stable of onshore and offshore wind farms, profits grew by 13% to \u00a3302m. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said the company had ploughed a record \u00a32bn of investment into its renewable energy business to start up its East Anglia One offshore windfarm off the Norfolk coast. \u201cAs the UK\u2019s only integrated, 100% green energy company, our ongoing investment in smarter grids, digital systems and renewable generation will be critical to the country meeting 2050 net zero targets,\u201d he said. Scottish Power sold off its last remaining fossil fuel power plants early last year in a \u00a3700m deal with Drax, to focus its investments on windfarms and power grids. Iberdrola invested a total of \u20ac4.7bn (\u00a34bn) this year, mainly in renewable energy and energy networks, and reaped profits of \u20ac2.5bn for the first nine months of the year, up by a fifth from last year.

The inflow of foreign investment has been a big part of Vietnam\u2019s economic liberalisation.

Formosa Plastics <a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/formosa-fined-500-million-vietnams-environmental-disaster-2388515\" title=\"\">was fined $500m by the Vietnamese government</a>, but much of the compensation did not reach the affected fishermen. </p> <p>The low labour cost in these provinces is the main attraction for Chinese and other foreign investors. For instance, a factory worker here earns around two-thirds of what a similar worker earns in China, and half the local population are under the age of 30.</p> <p>Rather than wealth, foreign investment has brought mainly dead-end, low-paid jobs with few long-term prospects for young locals. The <a href=\"https://www.vietnamonline.com/az/average-salary.html\" title=\"\">average wage in Vietnam is around $150 a month</a>; in these provinces many don\u2019t even earn that. Besides, unemployment is severe. Last year, GDP per capita in both Nhge An ($1,600) and Ha Tinh ($2,200) fell below the <a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/vietnam/gdp-per-capita\" title=\"\">national average of $2,500</a>. This is the context compelling tens of thousands of Vietnamese from these impoverished provinces to choose to migrate, to seek livelihoods for themselves and their families.</p> <p>Families often depend on sons and daughters to find their way into advanced capitalist countries in the west, to work and be the breadwinners. Remittances from abroad also help sustain communities \u2013 Nghe An, for instance, brought in $225m a year, according to official estimates.</p> <p>The 39 people were not \u201cunthinking migrants\u201d lured by traffickers, as the media has suggested. They were fighting for a future for their families, and lost their precious lives as Britain firmly kept its doors locked shut.</p> <p>If the tragic deaths of these men and women truly sadden you, the best thing to do is oppose Britain\u2019s anti-migrant policies. We need to dismantle the false categories of \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and \u201cgenuine refugees\u201d. Let our fellow human beings have the opportunity to live and work in the open \u2013 that is the only way forward.</p> <p>\u2022 Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and author of Chinese Whispers: The Story Behind Britain\u2019s Hidden Army of Labour</p>",

Formosa Plastics was fined $500m by the Vietnamese government, but much of the compensation did not reach the affected fishermen. The low labour cost in these provinces is the main attraction for Chinese and other foreign investors. For instance, a factory worker here earns around two-thirds of what a similar worker earns in China, and half the local population are under the age of 30. Rather than wealth, foreign investment has brought mainly dead-end, low-paid jobs with few long-term prospects for young locals. The average wage in Vietnam is around $150 a month; in these provinces many don\u2019t even earn that. Besides, unemployment is severe. Last year, GDP per capita in both Nhge An ($1,600) and Ha Tinh ($2,200) fell below the national average of $2,500. This is the context compelling tens of thousands of Vietnamese from these impoverished provinces to choose to migrate, to seek livelihoods for themselves and their families. Families often depend on sons and daughters to find their way into advanced capitalist countries in the west, to work and be the breadwinners. Remittances from abroad also help sustain communities \u2013 Nghe An, for instance, brought in $225m a year, according to official estimates. The 39 people were not \u201cunthinking migrants\u201d lured by traffickers, as the media has suggested. They were fighting for a future for their families, and lost their precious lives as Britain firmly kept its doors locked shut. If the tragic deaths of these men and women truly sadden you, the best thing to do is oppose Britain\u2019s anti-migrant policies. We need to dismantle the false categories of \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and \u201cgenuine refugees\u201d. Let our fellow human beings have the opportunity to live and work in the open \u2013 that is the only way forward. \u2022 Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and author of Chinese Whispers: The Story Behind Britain\u2019s Hidden Army of Labour",

We also chose to use cinematic re-enactments as a storytelling device to give an insight into the young warrior\u2019s perspective, which is often intoxicated with the grandeur of fighting. I reached out to the International Committee of the Red Cross who sponsor a local acting group for help. I was also surprised by the overwhelming enthusiasm of tribes in Kompiam to perform fighting demonstrations and ceremonies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3aa92f3a7029a2aa613b67b80e1da6062dadaf5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3aa92f3a7029a2aa613b67b80e1da6062dadaf5f/67_0_2533_1520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Chris Phillips and cinematographer Michael Latham behind the scenes filming Guardian Documentary \u2018Lost Rambos\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Chris Phillips and cinematographer Michael Latham behind the scenes filming Guardian Documentary Lost Rambos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Phillips/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Your film celebrates the landscape as well as the culture of the highlands of Papua New Guinea. How did you become interested in the region?</strong></h2> <p>My obsession with the remote highlands started in 2008 when one of my closest friends was working at the field hospital in Kompiam as part of his medical degree. After completing a clinic in a town called Yangis, he spent several days accommodated generously by the locals and much of the time was spent in deep conversation with the community, who talked about the experience of living in a town ripped apart by tribal fighting. I began accompanying him back to the town each year to visit the communities on both sides of the conflict and worked with a local NGO.</p> <h2>The visits were facilitated by Joseph Lakai who would arrange the logistics for our local travel which was always complicated due to persistent instability in Yangis. Joseph and I kept in contact via email in the following years.</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d37989328105c64693ad6052a08d9c6f113a2690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d37989328105c64693ad6052a08d9c6f113a2690/0_190_3306_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Papua New Guinea highlands, Guardian Documentary \u2018Lost Rambos\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Papua New Guinea highlands, Guardian Documentary \u2018Lost Rambos\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Phillips/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>So your friendship with Joseph was in some ways the key to this film?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, years after first meeting Joseph, we got the terrible news that his own village of Kompiam had rapidly fallen into a huge tribal fight. The army had been called in, large numbers killed, and most of the town evacuated. For Joseph this was the worst-case scenario, his own tribe was central to the conflict and his efforts to call for peace had fallen on deaf ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26f3fdccd77575065c44aec337ccfbcabd152af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26f3fdccd77575065c44aec337ccfbcabd152af9/0_98_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Documentary \u2018Lost Rambos\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Joseph could open up the story of the </strong><strong>Tinalapin</strong><strong> tribe to you, but what about the story of the opposing faction, the </strong><strong>Sambe</strong><strong> tribe?</strong></h2> <p>The only story that Joseph could not facilitate was the refugees displaced by the conflict. We were looking for a family from the opposing tribe and felt we really needed a strong female voice. Given the Sambe were scattered in exile in the surrounding hills, this was always going to be the hardest story to access. However, in many ways it was the most important.</p> <p>The family we eventually filmed with were extremely keen to tell their story but it was a tricky process. We sat in a small hut with the five women in front of the camera, and off camera to the side were three men sitting in on the interview. They were senior members of the village housing the refugees, and it soon became obvious that they were becoming irritated by the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5299dbf18900b28c6d3a0519e70a78a5b552cf09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5299dbf18900b28c6d3a0519e70a78a5b552cf09/78_0_2533_1520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes filming documentary \u2018Lost Rambos\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the scenes filming documentary \u2018Lost Rambos\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Phillips/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men couldn\u2019t understand why we had chosen to talk to women about conflict. In their minds, conflict was a man\u2019s game so they continued to interrupt the women\u2019s answers and correct them. They were also disgruntled that we were focusing on a female perspective rather than the impact their displacement had on the surrounding tribes.</p> <p>I often think of this family of refugees and every time I contact people in Kompiam I ask if the Sambe have returned to their land.

      "bodyText": "Our latest Guardian documentary is filmed in the remote highlands of Papua New Guinea. Tribal fighting has long been part of life in the region but the wide circulation of bootleg copies of the 1980s action film Rambo have been used as a crude tutorial on the use of automatic weapons, turning local disputes into lethal exchanges and reshaping highlands culture forever. In this film we meet fighters and peacekeepers trying to navigate a path between tradition and modernity. Click above to watch the film and read more below about how director Chris Phillips made the film. Describe your creative approach to the story The film attempts to explore the complexities of a culture which is often misunderstood rather than offer perfect solutions to deadly tribal fighting. We touch on many themes: how difficult it is to maintain peace in a society out of the reach of state run law and order; how the influx of semi-automatic weapons has intensified tribal conflict; how gender inequality and toxic masculinity impact warfare; how cultural systems and ceremonies can prolong war and peace in small scale communities; and how difficult the journey can be for peace advocates even when the community acknowledges the suffering that fighting causes. It was important to me that we capture multiple perspectives on the fighting to explore the motivation from various points of view. We also chose to use cinematic re-enactments as a storytelling device to give an insight into the young warrior\u2019s perspective, which is often intoxicated with the grandeur of fighting. I reached out to the International Committee of the Red Cross who sponsor a local acting group for help. I was also surprised by the overwhelming enthusiasm of tribes in Kompiam to perform fighting demonstrations and ceremonies. Your film celebrates the landscape as well as the culture of the highlands of Papua New Guinea. How did you become interested in the region? My obsession with the remote highlands started in 2008 when one of my closest friends was working at the field hospital in Kompiam as part of his medical degree. After completing a clinic in a town called Yangis, he spent several days accommodated generously by the locals and much of the time was spent in deep conversation with the community, who talked about the experience of living in a town ripped apart by tribal fighting. I began accompanying him back to the town each year to visit the communities on both sides of the conflict and worked with a local NGO. The visits were facilitated by Joseph Lakai who would arrange the logistics for our local travel which was always complicated due to persistent instability in Yangis. Joseph and I kept in contact via email in the following years. So your friendship with Joseph was in some ways the key to this film? Yes, years after first meeting Joseph, we got the terrible news that his own village of Kompiam had rapidly fallen into a huge tribal fight. The army had been called in, large numbers killed, and most of the town evacuated. For Joseph this was the worst-case scenario, his own tribe was central to the conflict and his efforts to call for peace had fallen on deaf ears. Joseph could open up the story of the Tinalapin tribe to you, but what about the story of the opposing faction, the Sambe tribe? The only story that Joseph could not facilitate was the refugees displaced by the conflict. We were looking for a family from the opposing tribe and felt we really needed a strong female voice. Given the Sambe were scattered in exile in the surrounding hills, this was always going to be the hardest story to access. However, in many ways it was the most important. The family we eventually filmed with were extremely keen to tell their story but it was a tricky process. We sat in a small hut with the five women in front of the camera, and off camera to the side were three men sitting in on the interview. They were senior members of the village housing the refugees, and it soon became obvious that they were becoming irritated by the process. The men couldn\u2019t understand why we had chosen to talk to women about conflict. In their minds, conflict was a man\u2019s game so they continued to interrupt the women\u2019s answers and correct them. They were also disgruntled that we were focusing on a female perspective rather than the impact their displacement had on the surrounding tribes. I often think of this family of refugees and every time I contact people in Kompiam I ask if the Sambe have returned to their land. They have not. With no phones or addresses, I imagine even the simplest logistics can become extremely difficult. What was it was like filming there? The remote highlands make for a compelling backdrop, but it\u2019s not without difficulty. Obviously, there\u2019s the logistical difficulties of being in a remote location, electrical power for just a handful of hours each day, lugging camera gear up mountains and into villages with no cars, communication difficulties, daily thunderstorms, and the confusion a drone can cause! As well as the logistics, it must have been a challenge to navigate the cultural complexities It was absolutely crucial that everyone in the community understood our vision and motivations for the film, and had a chance to register any concerns or questions, so I had always planned to reach all key tribal leaders instantly upon arrival. When we finally arrived however, some of the most important elders were a few days walk away harvesting sweet potatoes, so it was suggested that it might be better if I made an attempt to reach the whole community together. With some local encouragement it was decided I should march straight down to the public marketplace, and make a speech to give the community a chance to ask any questions directly. The crowd circled quickly and the nervy speech and Q&amp;A took around 20 minutes. Eventually an older man came forward and announced that, as the senior member in attendance, he gave the project his blessing. We\u2019d be free to move through their land \u2013 a major obstacle had been cleared. Tell us a little bit about the film-making team I feel incredibly lucky for the talented team we had making this film. Michaela Perske and Kiki Dillon are fabulous producers who navigated lots of complexity and are always upbeat. Cinematographer Michael Latham actually grew up in Papua New Guinea, spending the first 12 years of his life in Mount Hagen, and we passed his primary school on one of our first days in the shoot. Editor Dan Lee spent many late nights in the edit and the film certainly wouldn\u2019t have reached the clarity it did without him. This type of post-production is full of complexities including working with translated dialogue. Composer Aaron Cupples has an amazing ability to interpret the emotion of the footage and strike a delicate balance between subtle accompaniment and high impact moments. He researched instruments from Enga and ended up building his own \u201cbamboo\u201d flute from plastic hardware pipes. Sound designer AJ Bradford made the jungle come alive sonically. It was a great thrill to launch the film in my hometown at the Melbourne international film festival and really feel the impact of his work in quality cinemas. And we were lucky enough to win the Best Short Documentary award at the festival!

      "body": "<p>Scouse is a dish so close to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypx9z7/global-scouse-day-is-liverpools-burns-night\" title=\"\">the Liverpudlian heart</a> that they\u2019ve adopted it as a nickname \u2013 though lobscouse, or <em>lapskaus</em>, <em>lapskojs </em>or <em>skipperlabskovs</em>, depending where you are, is a popular dish throughout northern Europe, thought to have its origins in the simple cooking of Hanseatic sailors, and with even more variants than names. In Germany, for example, labskaus is more like corned beef hash, while in Norway, lapskaus is a chunky stew much like our own.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, given the geography of the area, Liverpool\u2019s scouse isn\u2019t dissimilar to Irish stew or Lancashire hotpot, either, and, like those noble dishes, is eminently practical, easy to make in a small kitchen, or indeed a galley, and to adapt to current circumstances \u2013 there\u2019s even a vegetarian variant, blind scouse, for when you can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, run to meat. But while Scousers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\" title=\"\">united</a> on its virtues, as with all such beloved local specialities, <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/revealed-liverpools-favourite-scouse-ingredients-10953251\" title=\"\">passions run high</a> when it comes to the finer details. Beef or lamb, mince or meat, carrots or swede \u2026 wish me luck, I\u2019m going in.</p> <h2>The meat</h2> <p>The first problem I have is what kind of meat to use: lamb is apparently the classic choice, and as Andrew Webb notes in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBMLFM305MEC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=Qmi-0_yf1S&amp;dq=scouse%20Food%20britannia&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=scouse%20Food%20britannia&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">his book Food Britannia</a>, there\u2019s \u201ca strong geographical argument for lamb being more authentic\u201d, given that both Irish stew and Lancashire hotpot use it, too, but, \u201cif born-in-the-shadow-of-the-Liver-Building scousers prefer to use beef, who am I to argue?\u201d Indeed, I hear talk of scouses made with corned beef, attributed, by Wikipedia at least, to St Helens, where it is apparently known as \u201clobbies.\u201d Beef is probably as authentic as any, because sailors would presumably have used salted meat in the original version.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8cb94c3d5f66c84bd175ce706fbe3655c63fcb04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cb94c3d5f66c84bd175ce706fbe3655c63fcb04/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chuck steak and bitter ale: Liverpool FC cafe\u2019s scouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chuck steak and bitter ale: Liverpool FC cafe\u2019s scouse. Thumbnails: Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I, however, confine myself to the fresh kind, in this instance: chuck steak for the \u201cworld\u2019s best scouse\u201d (their words, not mine) as served in <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/155827-lfc-reveals-world-s-best-scouse-recipe\" title=\"\">Liverpool FC\u2019s cafe</a>; minced beef as used by Maggie May\u2019s, a place that get quite a lot of love from <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/articles/where-to-find-scouse-in-liverpool-the-citys-favourite-stew/\" title=\"\">scouse aficionados online</a>, and in <a href=\"https://www.food.com/recipe/me-ma-s-scouse-192955\" title=\"\">a family recipe posted online</a>; lamb shoulder and kidney in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scouse_84277\" title=\"\">Simon Rimmer\u2019s version</a>; and lamb neck on the bone for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scouse_pie_49004\" title=\"\">Paul Hollywood\u2019s scouse pie</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, they all give very different results: mince is handy if time is of the essence, but proves less satisfying to eat than larger chunks of meat, not least because it disappears into the gravy after an hour or so on the hob.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1cc824fce9252dd3e9191cb31475bcfd4bc2670e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc824fce9252dd3e9191cb31475bcfd4bc2670e/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scouse with mince as it\u2019s made at Maggie May\u2019s in Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scouse with mince as it\u2019s made at Maggie May\u2019s in Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chuck or shoulder are both excellent choices, depending on which meat you prefer (personally, I think lamb has a more interesting flavour), but bones will always improve any gravy \u2013 indeed, the final recipe I try, from <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L7M2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA924&amp;lpg=PA924&amp;dq=LOBSCOUSE+MINCE&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6abyR9YBok&amp;sig=ACfU3U1CxxMyreEriF12938DPcPWzi-MSQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj4ooO2uefkAhVqQxUIHVGCAw04FBDoATADegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=LOBSCOUSE%20&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Thomas Webster\u2019s 1845 Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy</a>, starts with bones from a roast, boiled up with potatoes and onions. Only latterly are pieces of leftover meat stirred in, and very fine the results are, too. Presuming you don\u2019t have enough to make a whole stew, however, I think Hollywood\u2019s lamb neck, or scrag end, is the best choice; you can always strip the meat off the bones before serving, if you like. Offal fans might like to add a few kidneys, too, for extra richness.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also chosen to brown the meat in dripping, because it feels right here; failing that, a neutral oil, or a mixture of oil and butter, as Rimmer suggests, will do fine. Hollywood\u2019s olive oil, however, tastes a bit weird.</p> <h2>The veggie version</h2> <p>You don\u2019t, of course, have to use any meat at all: when you couldn\u2019t quite run to any, you\u2019d make the aforementioned \u201cblind scouse\u201d instead \u2013 often with bones, but you could use vegetable stock, or try the <a href=\"http://www.merseysidermagazine.com/site/food-drink/scouse-with-a-twist/\" title=\"\">Quorn and sweet potato version in the Merseysider magazine</a>.</p> <h2>Vegetables</h2> <p>Either way, this is a dish that\u2019s packed full of vegetables: onion is a must, and everyone but Webster\u2019s Encyclopaedia adds carrot, too. Hollywood also sticks in swede, which divides opinion; I happen to think that the sweetness works well with lamb, but if you\u2019re not a fan, feel free to use more carrot in its place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8cfe1c57fbfc225df274e7b3bb2ab25bf66e0b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cfe1c57fbfc225df274e7b3bb2ab25bf66e0b79/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Rimmer lines his dish with veg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Rimmer lines his stewing pot with potatoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most important, however, are the spuds. You can go fancy, as Rimmer does, and use them to line the dish, finishing with a crisp potato top reminiscent of a Lancashire hotpot, but we decide it\u2019s far more comforting to cook them until they break down to thicken the gravy, as in Webster\u2019s version. That said, a few fluffy chunks are also welcome to help soak up the sauce, so I\u2019m going to add spuds in two stages: the first peeled and cut small to facilitate their dissolution, the second with the skins left on to help keep the cubes together.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.merseysidermagazine.com/site/food-drink/scouse-with-a-twist/\" title=\"\">The liquid and aromatics</a></h2> <p>Either make the stock yourself, as in Webster\u2019s recipe, or use ready-made; beef stock seems to be the name of the game, with <a href=\"http://www.oxo.co.uk\" title=\"\">Oxo cubes</a> and gravy salts mentioned specifically by several correspondents. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\" title=\"\">Liverpool FC</a> starts its gravy with bitter ale, reduced by half, giving the scouse a robustly fruity, hoppy flavour; delicious, but if it ain\u2019t broke \u2026 though I will allow for a dash of Worcestershire sauce, because lots of people tell me their mum uses it, so it must be OK.</p> <h2>The cooking</h2> <p>As with most stews, the longer the cooking, the better \u2013 I prefer to do mine in a moderate oven, to keep the temperature fairly constant, though the hob works just fine, if you prefer. Once the meat is falling off the bone, you can cool it and skim the fat off the top, if you like, or do as Hollywood suggests and cover it in puff pastry and turn your scouse into a pie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dca40605c7566a5cde1de804afa0681fed9b5f13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dca40605c7566a5cde1de804afa0681fed9b5f13/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Hollywood covers his scouse with a pastry lid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Hollywood covers his scouse with a pastry lid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Personally, I prefer to eat it straight away, with a generous helping of pickled cabbage on the side (beetroot is also acceptable, and I reckon it would also be nice with steamed greens, but I need to check that with a scouser before I try).</p> <h2>Perfect scouse</h2> <p>Prep<strong> 25 min</strong><br>Cook<strong> 2 hr</strong><br>Serves<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>800g scrag end/lamb neck</strong>, on the bone, in thick slices, or 600g boneless lamb shoulder<br><strong>2 tbsp beef dripping or neutral oil</strong><br><strong>500g floury potatoes</strong>, cleaned<br><strong>2 onions</strong><br><strong>600ml beef stock</strong><br><strong>2 sprigs fresh thyme</strong><br><strong>1 bay leaf</strong><br><strong>2 carrots</strong><br><strong>250g swede </strong>(optional)<br><strong>Salt and pepper</strong><br><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong>, to taste</p> <p>Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/320F/gas 3; alternatively, cook this on the hob.

      "bodyText": "Scouse is a dish so close to the Liverpudlian heart that they\u2019ve adopted it as a nickname \u2013 though lobscouse, or lapskaus, lapskojs or skipperlabskovs, depending where you are, is a popular dish throughout northern Europe, thought to have its origins in the simple cooking of Hanseatic sailors, and with even more variants than names. In Germany, for example, labskaus is more like corned beef hash, while in Norway, lapskaus is a chunky stew much like our own. Unsurprisingly, given the geography of the area, Liverpool\u2019s scouse isn\u2019t dissimilar to Irish stew or Lancashire hotpot, either, and, like those noble dishes, is eminently practical, easy to make in a small kitchen, or indeed a galley, and to adapt to current circumstances \u2013 there\u2019s even a vegetarian variant, blind scouse, for when you can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, run to meat. But while Scousers are united on its virtues, as with all such beloved local specialities, passions run high when it comes to the finer details. Beef or lamb, mince or meat, carrots or swede \u2026 wish me luck, I\u2019m going in. The meat The first problem I have is what kind of meat to use: lamb is apparently the classic choice, and as Andrew Webb notes in his book Food Britannia, there\u2019s \u201ca strong geographical argument for lamb being more authentic\u201d, given that both Irish stew and Lancashire hotpot use it, too, but, \u201cif born-in-the-shadow-of-the-Liver-Building scousers prefer to use beef, who am I to argue?\u201d Indeed, I hear talk of scouses made with corned beef, attributed, by Wikipedia at least, to St Helens, where it is apparently known as \u201clobbies.\u201d Beef is probably as authentic as any, because sailors would presumably have used salted meat in the original version. I, however, confine myself to the fresh kind, in this instance: chuck steak for the \u201cworld\u2019s best scouse\u201d (their words, not mine) as served in Liverpool FC\u2019s cafe; minced beef as used by Maggie May\u2019s, a place that get quite a lot of love from scouse aficionados online, and in a family recipe posted online; lamb shoulder and kidney in Simon Rimmer\u2019s version; and lamb neck on the bone for Paul Hollywood\u2019s scouse pie. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they all give very different results: mince is handy if time is of the essence, but proves less satisfying to eat than larger chunks of meat, not least because it disappears into the gravy after an hour or so on the hob. Chuck or shoulder are both excellent choices, depending on which meat you prefer (personally, I think lamb has a more interesting flavour), but bones will always improve any gravy \u2013 indeed, the final recipe I try, from Thomas Webster\u2019s 1845 Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy, starts with bones from a roast, boiled up with potatoes and onions. Only latterly are pieces of leftover meat stirred in, and very fine the results are, too. Presuming you don\u2019t have enough to make a whole stew, however, I think Hollywood\u2019s lamb neck, or scrag end, is the best choice; you can always strip the meat off the bones before serving, if you like. Offal fans might like to add a few kidneys, too, for extra richness. I\u2019ve also chosen to brown the meat in dripping, because it feels right here; failing that, a neutral oil, or a mixture of oil and butter, as Rimmer suggests, will do fine. Hollywood\u2019s olive oil, however, tastes a bit weird. The veggie version You don\u2019t, of course, have to use any meat at all: when you couldn\u2019t quite run to any, you\u2019d make the aforementioned \u201cblind scouse\u201d instead \u2013 often with bones, but you could use vegetable stock, or try the Quorn and sweet potato version in the Merseysider magazine. Vegetables Either way, this is a dish that\u2019s packed full of vegetables: onion is a must, and everyone but Webster\u2019s Encyclopaedia adds carrot, too. Hollywood also sticks in swede, which divides opinion; I happen to think that the sweetness works well with lamb, but if you\u2019re not a fan, feel free to use more carrot in its place. Most important, however, are the spuds. You can go fancy, as Rimmer does, and use them to line the dish, finishing with a crisp potato top reminiscent of a Lancashire hotpot, but we decide it\u2019s far more comforting to cook them until they break down to thicken the gravy, as in Webster\u2019s version. That said, a few fluffy chunks are also welcome to help soak up the sauce, so I\u2019m going to add spuds in two stages: the first peeled and cut small to facilitate their dissolution, the second with the skins left on to help keep the cubes together. The liquid and aromatics Either make the stock yourself, as in Webster\u2019s recipe, or use ready-made; beef stock seems to be the name of the game, with Oxo cubes and gravy salts mentioned specifically by several correspondents. Liverpool FC starts its gravy with bitter ale, reduced by half, giving the scouse a robustly fruity, hoppy flavour; delicious, but if it ain\u2019t broke \u2026 though I will allow for a dash of Worcestershire sauce, because lots of people tell me their mum uses it, so it must be OK. The cooking As with most stews, the longer the cooking, the better \u2013 I prefer to do mine in a moderate oven, to keep the temperature fairly constant, though the hob works just fine, if you prefer. Once the meat is falling off the bone, you can cool it and skim the fat off the top, if you like, or do as Hollywood suggests and cover it in puff pastry and turn your scouse into a pie. Personally, I prefer to eat it straight away, with a generous helping of pickled cabbage on the side (beetroot is also acceptable, and I reckon it would also be nice with steamed greens, but I need to check that with a scouser before I try). Perfect scouse Prep 25 min Cook 2 hr Serves 4 800g scrag end/lamb neck, on the bone, in thick slices, or 600g boneless lamb shoulder 2 tbsp beef dripping or neutral oil 500g floury potatoes, cleaned 2 onions 600ml beef stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 bay leaf 2 carrots 250g swede (optional) Salt and pepper Worcestershire sauce, to taste Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/320F/gas 3; alternatively, cook this on the hob. Heat the fat in a large, lidded saucepan or ovenproof pan over a medium-high heat, then sear the meat in batches, until properly browned. Lift out and set aside. Meanwhile, peel half the potatoes and cut into small cubes, setting the rest aside for the time being, and peel and thinly slice the onions. Turn down the heat, add the onions and fry, stirring regularly, until soft. Now add the cubed potatoes, fry for five minutes more, then stir in the stock, scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan as you do so, and return the meat to the pot along with the herbs. Bring to a simmer, then cover and put in the oven (or leave on a low heat) for 60 minutes, until the potatoes have begun to dissolve into the sauce. Mash a few of them against the sides of the pot to help them along. Meanwhile, peel and cube the carrots and swede, if using, and dice the remaining potatoes \u2013 there\u2019s no need to peel them. After the scouse has been cooking for 60 minutes, add the vegetables to the pot and return to the oven (or hob) for another hour, or until the vegetables are tender. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and serve hot with pickled cabbage or beetroot. \u2022 Scouse or lobbies, beef or lamb \u2013 or neither? How do you make yours, what do you eat it with \u2013 and can anyone shed more light on its origins?",

      "body": "<p>Cemeteries are curious places, especially when you\u2019re young. Scary and thrilling, of course; they\u2019re filled with dead people! But also oases of calm, respectful silence, often deserted, except on Sunday mornings. It\u2019s little surprise that they have fascinated writers and provided settings for a multitude of books.</p> <p>I grew up in a town bordered by three large municipal cemeteries and took bits of all of them for the graveyard that is the main setting for my novel Things Can Only Get Better. It\u2019s set in 1996, when Arthur, who is in his 70s, is so grief-stricken by the death of his wife Molly that he refuses to leave her graveside, eventually moving into and fixing up a derelict chapel and becoming a sort of unofficial caretaker.</p> <p>Like the necropolises of my youth, Arthur\u2019s graveyard is a magnet for local children, specifically a group of girls with no hope or ambition, and nothing expected of them other than to leave school and get pregnant.</p> <p>Especially when the cemeteries are surrounded by closely packed housing estates and edged with busy roads, stepping through their gates is like entering a borderland between worlds, neither this life nor the next. </p> <p>Here are some of my favourite books exploring this liminal territory.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-graveyard-book-9780747594802.html\">The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman</a><br></strong>It stands to reason, for those of a certain bent, that cemeteries, being the resting places of the dead, will be home to ghosts. The spirits who haunt Neil Gaiman\u2019s 2008 children\u2019s book are benign, taking in and looking after Nobody \u201cBod\u201d Owens, the only survivor of his family\u2019s massacre at the hands of a serial killer called Jack. There are supernatural menaces to be overcome, but ultimately the real evil is done by the living.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pet-sematary-9781444708134.html\">Pet Sematary by Stephen King</a><br></strong>Graveyards are fertile ground for horror, usually through their desecration or disrespectful treatment. King\u2019s 1983 take on the undead genre sees a family buying a remote house with its own pet burial ground that does a nicely creepy line in bringing family pets \u2013 and people \u2013 back to life, but horribly changed. Which, presumably, they never mentioned at Purple Bricks.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://www.sfreviews.net/psb_fine_private_place.html\">A Fine and Private Place by Peter S Beagle</a><br></strong>More haunting than haunted, Beagle\u2019s moving 1960 fantasy novel follows Jonathan Rebeck, a former pharmacist who has dropped out of ordinary life and lives, penniless and homeless, in the fictional Yorkchester cemetery, where a friendly raven supplies him with food stolen from picnic baskets. Able to speak with the dead, Rebeck plays matchmaker between the ghosts of a young teacher and a bookshop worker, then has to fight to keep their spirits together when the threat arises that one of their bodies will be moved.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lincoln-in-the-bardo-9781408871775.html\">Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders</a><br></strong>Here the spirits of the dead inhabit the \u201cbardo\u201d of the title, a sort of halfway house between death and resurrection based on the Tibetan notion of rebirth, which is tethered to Oak Hill Cemetery. This houses the crypt of Willie, son of Abraham Lincoln who has died aged 11. The US president\u2019s grief threatens to keep his son in the limbo of the cemetery for ever. Unlike the first three books, which are resoundingly \u201cgenre\u201d, Saunders\u2019 novel won the 2017 Booker prize so is devoutly \u201cliterary\u201d. However, it\u2019s so good we won\u2019t hold that against it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c983eda6cfc095e61a581a8855697a705ce913f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c983eda6cfc095e61a581a8855697a705ce913f8/0_141_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vistor to the Merry cemetery in Sapanta, Romania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Misnomered \u2026 the Merry cemetery in S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba, Romania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bogdan Cristel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/death-9780500519714.html\">Death: A Graveside Companion by Joanna Ebenstein</a><br></strong>A wonderful rough guide to death, to help us navigate that awfully big adventure. Through a series of essays by different writers, the cultural attitudes to death across the world are examined, and there are a wealth of illustrations of artefacts from prehistoric to modern times.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/06/fiction.features\">The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n</a><br></strong>It isn\u2019t only people that go to cemeteries to moulder and eventually be forgotten. It\u2019s books, too, as suggested in Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s bestseller. In the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, a young boy is inducted into the secrets of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, where the memories of abandoned, lost narratives are carefully curated. A cemetery in abstract terms, perhaps, but with some correlation with traditional graveyards, where the etched words on gravestones prevent the names of the dead from slipping from the world entirely.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/falling-angels-9780007217236.html\">Falling Angels by Tracy Chevalier</a><br></strong>The follow-up to Chevalier\u2019s breakout novel, Girl With a Pearl Earring, Falling Angels immerses itself in the Victorian obsession with death and taste for grand necropolises. It follows the fortunes of two families bound together by the friendship between the daughters of the houses. The girls have their own obsession with the local graveyard that houses the two families\u2019 adjacent plots. As the Victorian era gives way to the Edwardian, and a new world in a new century, sexual mores are challenged and the certainties of life and death, as reflected in the grand London graveyard, are upended.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/loren-rhoads/199-cemeteries-to-see-before-you-die/9780751571639/\">199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die by Loren Rhoads</a><br></strong>Whereas the Ebenstein book is a meditation on death, this is more a road map to some of the best graveyards around the world. From the southern gothic of <a href=\"https://bonaventurecemeterytours.com/\">Savannah\u2019s Bonaventure cemetery</a> to the celebrity-stuffed <a href=\"http://www.perelachaisecemetery.com/\">P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris</a>, Rhoads takes you on a world tour of final resting places, introduces you to their most famous residents, and offers a wealth of enticing history and sharp details, such as the brightly coloured, hand-carved wooden gravestones in Romania\u2019s surely somewhat misnomered <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/merry-cemetery\">Merry cemetery</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/12/will-my-cat-eat-my-eyeballs-how-caitlin-doughty-teaches-kids-about-death\">Will my cat eat my eyeballs?

The story details her own upbringing with her rather tyrannical father, a third-generation funeral director. The non-linear narrative entwines the business of death with both Bechdel and her father\u2019s personal journeys with their sexualities, and the aftermath of his death.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/her-fearful-symmetry-9780099524175.html\">Her Fearful Symmetry by Audrey Niffenegger</a><br></strong>As part of her research for this 2009 novel, Niffenegger, author of The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6WLSvupUeo\">took a job as a tour guide at London\u2019s Highgate cemetery</a>. That\u2019s the job she gives to Robert, who is the lover of first Elspeth, who dies of leukaemia, and Valentina, who is the daughter of Elspeth\u2019s twin sister and who is herself half of a set of identical twins, with Julia. Like the more remote corners of your favourite graveyard, it\u2019s a tangled plot, but a beautiful one.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/things-can-only-get-better-9781409185161.html\">Things Can Only Get Better by David M Barnett</a> is published by Trapeze Books (\u00a38.99) on 14 November.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cemeteries are curious places, especially when you\u2019re young. Scary and thrilling, of course; they\u2019re filled with dead people! But also oases of calm, respectful silence, often deserted, except on Sunday mornings. It\u2019s little surprise that they have fascinated writers and provided settings for a multitude of books. I grew up in a town bordered by three large municipal cemeteries and took bits of all of them for the graveyard that is the main setting for my novel Things Can Only Get Better. It\u2019s set in 1996, when Arthur, who is in his 70s, is so grief-stricken by the death of his wife Molly that he refuses to leave her graveside, eventually moving into and fixing up a derelict chapel and becoming a sort of unofficial caretaker. Like the necropolises of my youth, Arthur\u2019s graveyard is a magnet for local children, specifically a group of girls with no hope or ambition, and nothing expected of them other than to leave school and get pregnant. Especially when the cemeteries are surrounded by closely packed housing estates and edged with busy roads, stepping through their gates is like entering a borderland between worlds, neither this life nor the next. Here are some of my favourite books exploring this liminal territory. 1. The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman It stands to reason, for those of a certain bent, that cemeteries, being the resting places of the dead, will be home to ghosts. The spirits who haunt Neil Gaiman\u2019s 2008 children\u2019s book are benign, taking in and looking after Nobody \u201cBod\u201d Owens, the only survivor of his family\u2019s massacre at the hands of a serial killer called Jack. There are supernatural menaces to be overcome, but ultimately the real evil is done by the living. 2. Pet Sematary by Stephen King Graveyards are fertile ground for horror, usually through their desecration or disrespectful treatment. King\u2019s 1983 take on the undead genre sees a family buying a remote house with its own pet burial ground that does a nicely creepy line in bringing family pets \u2013 and people \u2013 back to life, but horribly changed. Which, presumably, they never mentioned at Purple Bricks. 3. A Fine and Private Place by Peter S Beagle More haunting than haunted, Beagle\u2019s moving 1960 fantasy novel follows Jonathan Rebeck, a former pharmacist who has dropped out of ordinary life and lives, penniless and homeless, in the fictional Yorkchester cemetery, where a friendly raven supplies him with food stolen from picnic baskets. Able to speak with the dead, Rebeck plays matchmaker between the ghosts of a young teacher and a bookshop worker, then has to fight to keep their spirits together when the threat arises that one of their bodies will be moved. 4. Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders Here the spirits of the dead inhabit the \u201cbardo\u201d of the title, a sort of halfway house between death and resurrection based on the Tibetan notion of rebirth, which is tethered to Oak Hill Cemetery. This houses the crypt of Willie, son of Abraham Lincoln who has died aged 11. The US president\u2019s grief threatens to keep his son in the limbo of the cemetery for ever. Unlike the first three books, which are resoundingly \u201cgenre\u201d, Saunders\u2019 novel won the 2017 Booker prize so is devoutly \u201cliterary\u201d. However, it\u2019s so good we won\u2019t hold that against it. 5. Death: A Graveside Companion by Joanna Ebenstein A wonderful rough guide to death, to help us navigate that awfully big adventure. Through a series of essays by different writers, the cultural attitudes to death across the world are examined, and there are a wealth of illustrations of artefacts from prehistoric to modern times. 6. The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n It isn\u2019t only people that go to cemeteries to moulder and eventually be forgotten. It\u2019s books, too, as suggested in Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s bestseller. In the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, a young boy is inducted into the secrets of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, where the memories of abandoned, lost narratives are carefully curated. A cemetery in abstract terms, perhaps, but with some correlation with traditional graveyards, where the etched words on gravestones prevent the names of the dead from slipping from the world entirely. 7. Falling Angels by Tracy Chevalier The follow-up to Chevalier\u2019s breakout novel, Girl With a Pearl Earring, Falling Angels immerses itself in the Victorian obsession with death and taste for grand necropolises. It follows the fortunes of two families bound together by the friendship between the daughters of the houses. The girls have their own obsession with the local graveyard that houses the two families\u2019 adjacent plots. As the Victorian era gives way to the Edwardian, and a new world in a new century, sexual mores are challenged and the certainties of life and death, as reflected in the grand London graveyard, are upended. 8. 199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die by Loren Rhoads Whereas the Ebenstein book is a meditation on death, this is more a road map to some of the best graveyards around the world. From the southern gothic of Savannah\u2019s Bonaventure cemetery to the celebrity-stuffed P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris, Rhoads takes you on a world tour of final resting places, introduces you to their most famous residents, and offers a wealth of enticing history and sharp details, such as the brightly coloured, hand-carved wooden gravestones in Romania\u2019s surely somewhat misnomered Merry cemetery. 9. Fun Home by Alison Bechdel Between us shuffling off this mortal coil and being buried, cremated or otherwise laid to rest, there is the business of preparation and funerals, brilliantly depicted in Bechdel\u2019s bestselling 2006 graphic novel. The story details her own upbringing with her rather tyrannical father, a third-generation funeral director. The non-linear narrative entwines the business of death with both Bechdel and her father\u2019s personal journeys with their sexualities, and the aftermath of his death. 10. Her Fearful Symmetry by Audrey Niffenegger As part of her research for this 2009 novel, Niffenegger, author of The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife, took a job as a tour guide at London\u2019s Highgate cemetery. That\u2019s the job she gives to Robert, who is the lover of first Elspeth, who dies of leukaemia, and Valentina, who is the daughter of Elspeth\u2019s twin sister and who is herself half of a set of identical twins, with Julia. Like the more remote corners of your favourite graveyard, it\u2019s a tangled plot, but a beautiful one. \u2022 Things Can Only Get Better by David M Barnett is published by Trapeze Books (\u00a38.99) on 14 November.",

It was one of those very rare, absolutely electrifying, moments when the ordinary lay people take over and all the professionals \u2013 from prognosticators to border guards \u2013 get quietly out of the way. From the sidelines we should now be thinking big, electric thoughts about a future where so much, as yet barely definable, is possible. Germany is a country on the verge of reunification in spirit \u2013 never mind too much yet about the jurisdictional details. Something will take shape, probably closer to confederation than a total merging of frontiers and institutions. The process under way simply sweeps aside the natural hesitations of history (from Mr Gennadi Gerasimov yesterday in Moscow to the ex-army paper-seller up the road) about seeing one Germany once again. It also sweeps aside, with only a touch-wood percentage of remaining doubt, any real chance of tanks or troops or anyone else standing in the way. The victims of Beijing died so that everyone else would realise that this is now the unacceptable and dead-end alternative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"afc60f1b870f60121eb89b603bf91c82f68ca4aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afc60f1b870f60121eb89b603bf91c82f68ca4aa/43_124_1774_2585/686.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 11 November 1989.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/10/28/11_nov_89.jpg\">The Guardian, 11 November 1989</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The crumbling of the Berlin Wall also signifies definitively, beyond the powers of any assemblage of international strategists to deny, the end of the superpowers\u2019 cold war in Europe. Those flickering black and white images of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jul/27/berlin-blockade-cold-war-1948\">Berlin airlift</a> can go back to the film archive room. Europe has emerged from the post-war transition which was no less transitional for lasting over four decades. The long-obvious truth is now openly revealed. Politics, internal and external, not weapons, kept Europe divided. Counting missiles and armoured personnel carriers was never a more mature exercise than collecting train numbers.</p> <p>There is no denying that the centre of European gravity is going to shift as a result of the German earthquake. No-one can be quite sure that some new fault line will not appear. It is very important not to encourage, in appearance or reality, a situation where East Germany simply joins \u2018the Western camp.\u2019 That would be to create a fresh imbalance \u2013 another reason why the dissolution of one monolith must be accompanied by that of the other. It would be the surest way of providing Mr Gorbachev\u2019s critics \u2013 apparently at the moment disarmed like everyone else by the speed of events \u2013 with destructive ammunition.

      "bodyText": "Communists open Berlin Wall: East Germans sweep aside Iron Curtain \u2013 all border crossing points declared legal by Anna Tomforde in East Berlin 10 November 1989 East Germany\u2019s ruling Communist Party last night took the momentous step of allowing all citizens direct passage to the West in a step that renders obsolete the Berlin Wall and puts into question the border between the two Germanies. The extraordinary announcement represents the single most dramatic transformation of the political map of post-war Europe. It follows a tumultuous week during which the Communist authorities have vainly sought to stem a tide of popular opposition. Within hours, East Germans on foot and in cars began arriving in West Germany and West Berlin. West German television said a couple crossed the Bornholmer Strasse checkpoint in West Berlin at 9.15 pm (8.15 GMT) with identity cards stamped with the new-style visas. The decision was announced by Mr G\u00fcenter Schabowski, a politburo member, after the second day of a central committee meeting in East Berlin. He said it would come into effect immediately, and would last until new travel regulations were passed into law. Soon afterwards, the official ADN news agency said tens of thousands of people, many probably unaware of the new travel rules, took to the streets in several cities demanding free elections and liberalised travel. When East German television carried the announcement, the station\u2019s switchboard was jammed almost instantly as thousands of callers tried to elicit more information. East Germans will be able to obtain exit visas without delay, allowing them to cross into the West through all border points within Berlin and along the border with West Germany. Tourists who want to return to East Germany can also obtain immediate permission. Because of the exceptional nature of the decision, passports will not be needed. \u2018We have decided today that all East Germans who want to leave permanently can do so without delay.\u2019 Continue reading. Revellers rush on hated gates by Anna Tomforde 10 November 1989 Hundreds of youths last night clambered up to dance atop the Berlin Wall near the most potent symbol of the divided Germanies, the Brandenburg Gate. West Germans, carrying hammers to chip away at the surface, rushed forward to greet them. East German border guards at times sprayed the crowd with water cannon but otherwise let the crowd revel on unchecked. \u201cOpen the gate! Open the gate!\u201d the East Berliners shouted as the gathering grew with the news that the borders would be opened. All along the wall, West Berliners trampled over the white demarcation line dividing the city, in effect crossing into the East. Continue reading. Editorial: All to hail, and all to play for 11 November 1989 They crossed the border with incredible joy, amazement, tears and good humour. They sang and sparkled, above, below and beside the Berlin Wall. It was one of those very rare, absolutely electrifying, moments when the ordinary lay people take over and all the professionals \u2013 from prognosticators to border guards \u2013 get quietly out of the way. From the sidelines we should now be thinking big, electric thoughts about a future where so much, as yet barely definable, is possible. Germany is a country on the verge of reunification in spirit \u2013 never mind too much yet about the jurisdictional details. Something will take shape, probably closer to confederation than a total merging of frontiers and institutions. The process under way simply sweeps aside the natural hesitations of history (from Mr Gennadi Gerasimov yesterday in Moscow to the ex-army paper-seller up the road) about seeing one Germany once again. It also sweeps aside, with only a touch-wood percentage of remaining doubt, any real chance of tanks or troops or anyone else standing in the way. The victims of Beijing died so that everyone else would realise that this is now the unacceptable and dead-end alternative. The crumbling of the Berlin Wall also signifies definitively, beyond the powers of any assemblage of international strategists to deny, the end of the superpowers\u2019 cold war in Europe. Those flickering black and white images of the Berlin airlift can go back to the film archive room. Europe has emerged from the post-war transition which was no less transitional for lasting over four decades. The long-obvious truth is now openly revealed. Politics, internal and external, not weapons, kept Europe divided. Counting missiles and armoured personnel carriers was never a more mature exercise than collecting train numbers. There is no denying that the centre of European gravity is going to shift as a result of the German earthquake. No-one can be quite sure that some new fault line will not appear. It is very important not to encourage, in appearance or reality, a situation where East Germany simply joins \u2018the Western camp.\u2019 That would be to create a fresh imbalance \u2013 another reason why the dissolution of one monolith must be accompanied by that of the other. It would be the surest way of providing Mr Gorbachev\u2019s critics \u2013 apparently at the moment disarmed like everyone else by the speed of events \u2013 with destructive ammunition. The Soviet Union (unlike, we should note, the US) has always insisted that it is a European power, and will be rightly alarmed if a new Germany merely enlarges the other Europe. It is preferable to see (and we can hardly prevent) the re-emergence of a Germany linked to the rest of Europe, but essentially its own arbiter. Since that was the sovereign role we deliberately created for West Germany, we can hardly deny it now to the East as well. There are shadows in many minds; of course there are shadows. But West Germany, over forty years, has developed the most prudent of democratic credentials, the most wise and cautious of voting patterns. Germany with its entirely new human face is the formidable economic power on the European \u2013 and world \u2013 scene. If reunification is a challenge, it can only be met by more and wider European cooperation. As the horizons enlarge, even 1992 begins to appear a somewhat limited concept which will move sharply down the agenda in Strasbourg next month. Looking even further ahead (but if ever there was a stimulus to vision it is now) we begin to understand the potential behind the idea of Mr Gorbachev\u2019s common European home. A Europe where national rivalries are subsumed by economic cooperation, where military budgets are cut to ceremonial levels, where the wealth is at last available not only to tackle long-neglected evils at home but to pay for a genuine fight against poverty, injustices and ecological disaster in the rest of the world \u2026 This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Transport of delight sounds anthem of unity by Ed Vulliamy in Berlin 13 November 1989 The anthem of the reunification of Berlin established itself in the west of the city over the weekend, and it was neither a political speech nor a verse from Deutschland Uber Alles. It was the amicable, scooter-like chugging of thousands upon thousands of little Trabant cars, brimful with families map-reading their way through the biggest weekend party of the 20th century. The cars formed convoys along the cobblestones and boulevards, or parked \u2013 illegally but unpunished \u2013 on the pavements. Two million East Germans invaded West Berlin, making history with a good day out. The cork-popping on the Berlin Wall at the end of last week had been portrayed to the world as the symbolic theatre of reunification. That drama was played by a few thousand. The millions that followed them came for a first, awestruck inspection of the lavish shop windows and the capacious bars of the \u2018Modell Deutschland\u2019. All over the city, seven-hour queues crammed the pavement, waiting for each visitor\u2019s DM 100 gift from the government. In the banks, they collected a white slip of paper, walked over to the Kasse and exchanged it for either a blue note or two brown ones.

      "body": "<p>Unpaid overtime, precarious contracts, working hours so antisocial your only friends are people who do the same job \u2026 after a minimum of seven years\u2019 education and professional training, the reality of working as an architect can be a bleak prospect. It\u2019s not hard to see why so many of them wear black, as if in permanent mourning for the lives they once had.</p> <p>\u201cSpending almost 10 years at uni to be paid \u00a320,000 doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d says Joseph, a qualified architect who recently left the award-winning practice he had worked at for five years, to become a (better-paid) technical consultant. \u201cI was getting really fed up with the dysfunctional nature of the profession. It\u2019s in complete crisis. Practices are undercutting each other, competing on fees in a race to the bottom, and it\u2019s the workers who bear the brunt.\u201d</p> <p>His experience prompted him to get involved with the formation of a new union for architectural workers, remarkably the first time an attempt has been made to unionise the whole sector. The illustrious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/riba\">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>, founded in 1834, mainly exists to promote the profession, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2004/jun/23/1\">Architects Registration Board</a> has more of a policing role, regulating conduct. Because of its long history as an exclusive \u201cgentleman\u2019s profession\u201d, architecture has few safeguards to ensure that workers aren\u2019t being exploited in practice. There is still a deeply ingrained culture of architects thinking of their work as a \u201cvocation\u201d, and an artistic labour of love, so the long hours and poor remuneration have become an inevitable part of the package. But a new generation, saddled with more debt than ever, has had enough, and thinks the time is ripe for change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b55f00ce8edc5dceb287290795a64cf5bcbb38ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b55f00ce8edc5dceb287290795a64cf5bcbb38ca/0_0_2635_2643/997.jpg\" alt=\"The organising group of new union UVW-SAW this month.\" width=\"997\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The organising group of new union UVW-SAW this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UVW-SAW</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Someone told us they joined a well-known practice and had to work 60 hours' overtime a week. They burnt out and left</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt all started with grumpy chats in the pub after work,\u201d says Aska, one of the group who began formulating ideas for the union two years ago. \u201cWe realised that the issues of overwork, underpay and instability of employment were so endemic that something had to be done.\u201d Together, the group of friends and colleagues launched an 18-month <a href=\"https://archworkersinquiry.wordpress.com/\">Workers\u2019 Inquiry</a> to assess the lie of the land, organising a series of workshops, surveys and meetings to build a picture of labour conditions in architectural practices in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the feedback was shocking,\u201d says fellow member Jake. \u201cSomeone told us they joined a very well-known practice and had to work 60 hours\u2019 overtime a week for the first three weeks. Someone else worked every single weekend for four months, then burnt out and left architecture altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Such horror stories are rife. When I worked as an intern for a high-profile firm in Rotterdam, my regular hours were 10am to 2am, seven days a week. As competition deadlines drew nearer, we were discouraged from leaving the office, dusk fading to dawn in a delirious blur of styrofoam models and AutoCAD grids. I left and became a critic.</p> <p>While architectural <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/08/initiative-to-crack-down-on-unpaid-internships-launched-in-uk\">internships have been mostly outlawed</a> in the UK, exploitative practices persist. One of the most common findings of the group\u2019s inquiry was people being encouraged to opt out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/nov/06/workandcareers.europeanunion\">EU working time directive</a> as part of their employment agreements. The directive, first introduced in 1998 and extended in 2003, provides for a right to work no more than 48 hours per week, with four weeks\u2019 paid holiday a year and restrictions on night work. But it is possible to opt out of the directive by signing a declaration \u2013 which, the group found, is frequently being included as an extra page in many practice\u2019s employment contracts. Many were told they would not get the job unless they signed the clause. Extensive hours of unpaid overtime were also found to be common, with some salaries equating to less than the minimum wage when overtime was factored in. Extended probationary periods were allegedly being used to threaten people into working longer hours, too; some were simply dismissed for leaving on time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9df41879e6fe53c394aac9ced1c90ebba1895376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9df41879e6fe53c394aac9ced1c90ebba1895376/92_0_5270_3164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chained to the desk \u2026 extended probations have allegedly been used to threaten workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chained to the desk \u2026 extended probations have allegedly been used to threaten workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Sattlberger/Getty Images/Cultura RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese are structural problems with the industry,\u201d says union member Esma. \u201cIt begins at university, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/may/30/architectural-education-professional-courses\">masochistic studio culture</a> of staying late and courses designed to breed individual competition rather than collaborative working.

      "bodyText": "Unpaid overtime, precarious contracts, working hours so antisocial your only friends are people who do the same job \u2026 after a minimum of seven years\u2019 education and professional training, the reality of working as an architect can be a bleak prospect. It\u2019s not hard to see why so many of them wear black, as if in permanent mourning for the lives they once had. \u201cSpending almost 10 years at uni to be paid \u00a320,000 doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d says Joseph, a qualified architect who recently left the award-winning practice he had worked at for five years, to become a (better-paid) technical consultant. \u201cI was getting really fed up with the dysfunctional nature of the profession. It\u2019s in complete crisis. Practices are undercutting each other, competing on fees in a race to the bottom, and it\u2019s the workers who bear the brunt.\u201d His experience prompted him to get involved with the formation of a new union for architectural workers, remarkably the first time an attempt has been made to unionise the whole sector. The illustrious Royal Institute of British Architects, founded in 1834, mainly exists to promote the profession, while the Architects Registration Board has more of a policing role, regulating conduct. Because of its long history as an exclusive \u201cgentleman\u2019s profession\u201d, architecture has few safeguards to ensure that workers aren\u2019t being exploited in practice. There is still a deeply ingrained culture of architects thinking of their work as a \u201cvocation\u201d, and an artistic labour of love, so the long hours and poor remuneration have become an inevitable part of the package. But a new generation, saddled with more debt than ever, has had enough, and thinks the time is ripe for change. \u201cIt all started with grumpy chats in the pub after work,\u201d says Aska, one of the group who began formulating ideas for the union two years ago. \u201cWe realised that the issues of overwork, underpay and instability of employment were so endemic that something had to be done.\u201d Together, the group of friends and colleagues launched an 18-month Workers\u2019 Inquiry to assess the lie of the land, organising a series of workshops, surveys and meetings to build a picture of labour conditions in architectural practices in the UK. \u201cSome of the feedback was shocking,\u201d says fellow member Jake. \u201cSomeone told us they joined a very well-known practice and had to work 60 hours\u2019 overtime a week for the first three weeks. Someone else worked every single weekend for four months, then burnt out and left architecture altogether.\u201d Such horror stories are rife. When I worked as an intern for a high-profile firm in Rotterdam, my regular hours were 10am to 2am, seven days a week. As competition deadlines drew nearer, we were discouraged from leaving the office, dusk fading to dawn in a delirious blur of styrofoam models and AutoCAD grids. I left and became a critic. While architectural internships have been mostly outlawed in the UK, exploitative practices persist. One of the most common findings of the group\u2019s inquiry was people being encouraged to opt out of the EU working time directive as part of their employment agreements. The directive, first introduced in 1998 and extended in 2003, provides for a right to work no more than 48 hours per week, with four weeks\u2019 paid holiday a year and restrictions on night work. But it is possible to opt out of the directive by signing a declaration \u2013 which, the group found, is frequently being included as an extra page in many practice\u2019s employment contracts. Many were told they would not get the job unless they signed the clause. Extensive hours of unpaid overtime were also found to be common, with some salaries equating to less than the minimum wage when overtime was factored in. Extended probationary periods were allegedly being used to threaten people into working longer hours, too; some were simply dismissed for leaving on time. \u201cThese are structural problems with the industry,\u201d says union member Esma. \u201cIt begins at university, with the masochistic studio culture of staying late and courses designed to breed individual competition rather than collaborative working. We\u2019re taught to believe architecture is like a religion. We\u2019re trying to make it heard that we\u2019re actually workers and our rights matter.\u201d There have been previous attempts to unionise architects, most notably in the 1970s, when the radical New Architecture Movement encouraged people to join the technical, administrative and supervisory section of the AUEW engineers\u2019 union, but the enthusiasm was short-lived. Marking a departure from previous efforts, the current group\u2019s ambitions go beyond just architects alone. \u201cWe\u2019re open to everyone involved in the production of architecture,\u201d says Jake, \u201cfrom the model-maker to the office cleaner and admin staff, everyone should be united under the same umbrella.\u201d They have formalised their union as a section of the United Voices of the World (UVW), one of the new breed of grassroots trade unions, supporting policies such as bringing outsourced workers in-house, for groups previously considered \u201cun-unionisable\u201d, including cleaners, security staff and sex workers.

      "bodyText": "A doctor in Uganda faces charges of professional misconduct over allegations he assaulted a lesbian patient. The country\u2019s minister of health, Jane Aceng, referred Ben Kiwanuka Mukwaya to the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC) over allegations he assaulted the patient at his private health facility in a suburb of the capital, Kampala, on 19 October. He also faces police charges of assault. It is understood to be the first time a doctor has been referred to the medical council for attacking a member of the LGBT community. The rights of LGBT+ people in Uganda have come under renewed attack recently. Earlier this month, James Nsaba Buturo said he and other parliamentarians wanted to retable a bill that would make homosexual sex punishable by death. Previous attempts have been ruled unconstitutional. Last week, 16 LGBT+ activists were arrested on suspicion of gay sex. \u201cIt is the policy of ministry of health that all patients should be able to seek medical treatment without fear of discrimination, violence, personal vengeance or retaliation,\u201d said Aceng. Mukwaya is a licensed member of the UMDPC and sits on the board. \u201cWe appeal to all healthcare providers and stakeholders to accord equal and appropriate treatment to all patients who present at the health facilities irrespective of their race, tribe and gender.\u201d Aceng added: \u201cWe also strongly condemn assault and violence against any individual and appeal to the public to report any such incidents to the relevant authorities. \u201cIn particular, we request the public to report any medical related abuse to the ministry of health.\u201d An inquiry into the incident is expected to last two weeks. If found guilty, Mukwaya faces suspension from practice and the removal of his name from the register, or he could be asked to pay a fine. Luke Owoyesigire, deputy police spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan, said Mukwaya faces assault charges after the victim filed a case with police. Mukwaya has accused the woman of trespassing, which is being investigated by police. Members of the LGBT community say they risk physical attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment, as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and healthcare. The 16 men arrested last week worked for the charity Let\u2019s Walk Uganda. They were initially taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d after a crowd surrounded their office, shouting abuse, rights groups said. The men were released on bail until 5 November.",

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s media and commentators couldn\u2019t quite believe it: after months of indecision and immobility in London, some actual Brexit action. But, they warned, the coming election would be brutal \u2013 and may end up not resolving anything. \u201cHurrah! Something has moved within the walls of the palace of Westminster,\u201d cheered France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cThe British parliament has finally agreed on \u2026 no, not Brexit, that would be too easy. But on snap elections, to be held on 12 December.\u201d The paper noted that after another day of \u201cbarely comprehensible developments\u201d, parliament would now be dissolved on 5 November, \u201cthe day the skies light up with bonfires and fireworks in memory of an earlier attempt to blow it up\u201d. Johnson\u2019s plan was to return to Westminster \u201cwith a comfortable majority, which will allow him to get his Brexit deal through parliament and therefore Britain to leave the EU on 31 January\u201d, the paper said. \u201cBut it is a big bet.\u201d Make no mistake, it added, these elections \u201cwill be won or lost on the question of Brexit. But will the British make a clear choice? Nothing is less sure. The risk of a new hung parliament is very real. In which case, all options remain open.\u201d Le Monde said Johnson\u2019s election bid \u201cworked at the fourth try\u201d. The prime minister had \u201crisked complete and utter paralysis, without a parliamentary majority and with a freshly negotiated deal meeting more and more resistance from MPs\u201d, it said. \u201cBut will the elections help Johnson regain the Conservatives\u2019 lost majority? And above all: will they help the country out of its Brexit impasse?\u201d If the Tories win, Britain could be out of the EU even before 31 January, Le Monde said. \u201cBut Labour has promised to renegotiate the deal and put it to a second referendum, and the Lib Dems to cancel Brexit entirely \u2026 In a country so deeply divided and fed up with Brexit, nothing is certain. The nightmare would be another hung parliament.\u201d Germany\u2019s Die Zeit rejoiced that at long last, \u201cthe House of Commons has reached a decision for something, rather than against\u201d.

But he failed to touch the stump with the ball - NOT OUT, says the TV umpire. Two in a match would surely have been a first in T20s.

Smith has enough time to raise his bat himself, clipping Malinga - now coming around the wicket - into the gap for four more. He gets another couple past point to move into the 40s before finishing the set with another lavish boundary, timing the pants off an off-drive. What a shot.

Look at what they did in the World Cup when they looked a broken and divided rabble - they beat England, who went on to win the whole thing. Or that absurd Test win in Durban. Or sweeping Pakistan last month. </p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s too optimistic this time around, though. Poor old Kasun Rajitha\u2019s analysis of 0/75 - the worst in T20I history - summed it up as Australia\u2019s openers put on 122 before Warner and Maxwell added another 109 in about 25 minutes then the quicks went to work. The hosts are determined to up their game in this format with a home T20 World Cup ahead of them exactly a year from now. </p> <p>Ahead of the toss, we already know Mitch Starc hasn\u2019t made the trip, instead attending his brother\u2019s wedding. Fair play. Big Queenslander Billy Stanlake comes into the XI. As for Sri Lanka, expect bulk changes with Dickwella and Udana the most likely inclusions. <br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from the Gabba. We\u2019ll be back with the OBO for a double-header on Friday: New Zealand v England in their first T20 followed a couple of hours later by Australia v Sri Lanka in Melbourne. Between now and then, I will spend 24 hours on a flight before joining you for both of those fixtures at the MCG. Until then - bye! Steve Smith speaks: \u201cWe played well tonight. The bowlers did a terrific job early on and bowled excellent areas. They restricted them to 117, which wasn\u2019t enough on that wicket. It\u2019s good to be back in this team ahead of the T20 World Cup next year. It\u2019s nice batting up the other end from Davey, it makes it easy. He\u2019s a strong little lad. I\u2019ll bat where I\u2019m told in Melbourne on Friday.\u201d Australia 118-1 (Warner 60, Smith 53) Target 118 Hasaranga denies Warner the chance to hit the winning run, sending a wide down the legside. That just about sums up the game and the series so far, Sri Lanka hammered once again. They have chased this down with seven overs to spare, barely breaking a sweat. In Smith\u2019s first hit back in national colours in Australia, he was excellent, as was Warner. 13th over: Australia 117-1 (Warner 60, Smith 53) Target 118 Sandakan nearly gives us a bit of trivia to end the night, pulling the stump out the way Cummins did in the first innings after Smith\u2019s bails were broken. But he failed to touch the stump with the ball - NOT OUT, says the TV umpire. Two in a match would surely have been a first in T20s. Warner levels the scores with a single to finish the set, after a four down the ground before the run out that wasn\u2019t. 12th over: Australia 111-1 (Warner 55, Smith 52) Target 118 Pradeep goes up for leg before with a very unlikely shout as it has pitched a mile outside Warner\u2019s leg stump but he sends it upstairs anyway. Four from it. Nearly done. Far more interesting is the commentary. Warne won\u2019t be at the MCG game on Friday, he explains, because he has \u201can exciting meeting\u201d in LA about a film. 11th over: Australia 107-1 (Warner 55, Smith 50) Target 118 A Warner boundary pushes Australia beyond 100, crunching a Sandakan half-tracker past point. There\u2019s a bit of confusion later in the over, which would have removed the left-hander had the throw been accurate, but nae bother: Smith steers another four next ball, past point with no trouble at all. He then moves to 50 with one to mid-off, in 32 balls. As Adam Gilchrist notes on TV, it is his first hit in a T20I since the 2016 World T20 but that matters little. Start the car. 10th over: Australia 97-1 (Warner 50, Smith 45) Target 118 Warner raises his half-century with a pulled single, his 14th fifth in T20Is to go with the ton he made on Sunday. It has taken him 30 deliveries to get there, seven boundaries collected along the way. Easy peasy. Smith has enough time to raise his bat himself, clipping Malinga - now coming around the wicket - into the gap for four more. He gets another couple past point to move into the 40s before finishing the set with another lavish boundary, timing the pants off an off-drive. What a shot. He\u2019s 45 from 29 balls. 12 off the over. 9th over: Australia 85-1 (Warner 49, Smith 35) Target 118 Going through the motions? Just about. Warner spices it up a bit with a perfect reverse sweep, the rest of the runs taken with ease. Australia now need 33 runs in 66 balls, for what it\u2019s worth. 8th over: Australia 75-1 (Warner 40, Smith 33) Target 118 Oh, easy as you like from Warner who helps a misdirected Udana short ball on its way over the man inside the fielding ring on the 45. More good running ensures they finish with ten runs from the over. \u201cThey have such an understanding,\u201d notes Isa Guha on the telly. 7th over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 34, Smith 29) Target 118 Sandakan with his left-arm wrist spin now the power play is complete, as is the custom. He starts well, giving just enough air with sufficient accuracy to deny either Australian the chance to free their arms. They manage to jag two runs from the final ball, which Malinga dives to stop at cover. They\u2019re so quick between the wickets. 6th over: Australia 58-1 (Warner 30, Smith 26) Target 118 Udana, one of the best death bowlers in the ODI World Cup earlier this year, will need to draw on some of that despite the fact that this is only the sixth over of Australia\u2019s chase. He doesn\u2019t do a bad job either, using about five slower balls in the over, giving up just the six runs. 5th over: Australia 52-1 (Warner 29, Smith 22) Target 118 \u201cI\u2019m about to have a shower,\u201d Victor Onions on twitter informs us. \u201cIf I call you will you read the OBO out to me like you are commentating?\u201d Well, speaking of early showers... this is what they are getting tonight. Hasaranga is no match for Warner with his leg spin, crushing him for four boundaries in the over - sweeping, cutting, pulling, driving. 4th over: Australia 35-1 (Warner 13, Smith 21) Target 118 Australia\u2019s former leadership axis are now scoring off every ball, galloping between the wickets as they accumulate. Then Warner, yet to hit a boundary, finishes the over with some real stand-and-deliver stuff, hammering Pradeep straight down the ground. Have that. Have a look at Smith\u2019s drive from the previous over. 3rd over: Australia 25-1 (Warner 8, Smith 17) Target 118 Malinga to Smith, the latter off strike first up with one to square leg, Warner then pulling a short ball for two more. Later, with one ball to face in the set, Smith leaps on a full ball, stroking it past the boots of the bowler for four more. He\u2019s already 17 off 10 balls. 2nd over: Australia 15-1 (Warner 5, Smith 10) Target 118 Nice punch from Warner off Pradeep\u2019s first ball, grabbing three from it. Smith later in the over plays a perfect square drive that goes all the way for four. They cut to him on the television from a pre-game interview where the former captain says there are some nights during a Test Match when he doesn\u2019t sleep at all, most of the time getting two or three hours. Goodness me. He makes it two fours on the trot with a clip through the air that Hasaranga can\u2019t quite keep him before his roof hits the rope. Yup, he\u2019s away. 1st over: Australia 1-1 (Warner 1, Smith 1) Target 118 Another first in the Smith comeback: his first innings in Australia since the sandpaper farrago. He defends that initial delivery back down the track before ducks an accurate short one, then can\u2019t beat midwicket with a flick. Never write off Lasith Malinga. Whoa, Finch bags a golden duck! Not much of a delivery from Malinga, comfortably down the legside, but he\u2019s tickled it into the gloves of Dickwella. The players are back on the field. Some more news from Cricket Australia to report as Warner and Finch make their way: Andrew McDonald has been appointed as Australia\u2019s new senior assistant coach. He will be allowed to continue his his IPL and Hundred gigs at the same time to help afford him. Clever or conflicted? We\u2019ll see. \u201cEvening Adam.\u201d Hello, Jake Santa Maria. \u201cWith two Dutch cricketers living with me I must shout out to Netherlands for qualifying for the WC next year but would love to know your thoughts on PNG getting there especially being their first ever tournament relatively close to home.\u201d Fantastic, isn\u2019t it? Some want to present this as emerging teams getting worse (take Ireland\u2019s troubles in this competition), but the more compelling argument is that more nations than ever are seriously competitive in these qualification tournaments. Yet, sadly, the ODI World Cup remains at ten teams. We shouldn\u2019t forget this. Sharp work from Cummins to finish his spell and the Sri Lankan innings. Sandakan did well enough throughout the over to add seven, Pradeep smashing the final ball back dead straight, hitting the stumps at the non-strikers\u2019 end. The big quick reacted quickly to the deflection, realising Sandakan was well down the track, managing to pull the stump out of the ground to execute the run out. You don\u2019t see that happen too often. Australia require 118 to win the series. 18th over: Sri Lanka 110-9 (Sandakan 5, Pradeep 1) My guy Pradeep gets off the mark with a biiig top edge, which Zampa tries to snaffle running back with the flight at extra cover but his dive doesn\u2019t quick stick. His four overs are now done, claiming 2/20. Lovely bowling. Zampa\u2019s slower leggie strikes again, in very similar circumstanes to how he picked up his earlier wicket. This time, he draws Malinga down the track, Carey taking the bails. The ball before the Sri Lankan skipper was given out lbw but had it turned around on review, bouncing over the top - but the spinner has his measure. 17th over: Sri Lanka 107-8 (Sandakan 3, Malinga 9) Malinga knows the drill trying to rehabilitate a sketchy innings, making room to twice pop Richardson above the ring at cover for a couple of timely boundaries to start the over. That gets the band singing. Sandakan\u2019s turn but he can\u2019t make the same sort of contact. Still, it moves the visitors beyond 100 and within striking distance of, say, 130? 16th over: Sri Lanka 97-8 (Sandakan 2, Malinga 0) Sandakan wants nothing to do with the faster shorter one but is able to slice over backward point for a couple to finish yet another successful over for the home side. Once again it is just four runs and a wicket. This is grim for Sri Lanka, but take nothing away from the classy Australian bowlers. Cummins nails his shorter, slower off-cutter, prompting a hack across the line from Udana landing in the hands of Richardson on the deep backward square rope. 15th over: Sri Lanka 93-7 (Udana 8, Sandakan 0) Sandakan is happy enough keeping Zampa\u2019s wrong\u2019un out rather than trying to score from it. Just four runs and the wicket from the spinners\u2019 over. Breaking news: England\u2019s women have a new coach. Classic leg-spinners\u2019 wicket, bringing the right-hander forward with a bit of extra flight, beating the edge and leaving him stranded. Carey does the rest. All of Australia\u2019s bowlers have been tip-top tonight. 14th over: Sri Lanka 89-6 (Hasaranga 9, Udana 5) Agar finishes with 2/27, getting through another without a boundary. Indeed, that makes two T20Is in a row where he\u2019s achieved that. Thrilled to see he\u2019s back in national colours and ticking over nicely. Lovely fella. 13th over: Sri Lanka 82-6 (Hasaranga 5, Udana 2) The life has been sucked out of the Sri Lankan innings through these middle overs, especially since Perera fell. Just five singles from Zampa here. 12th over: Sri Lanka 77-6 (Hasaranga 1, Udana 1) Stanlake\u2019s four overs have netted him 2/23. He was a big part of Australia\u2019s success in the format in 2018 - twice coming within a fration of a point of overtaking Pakistan as the No1 ranked team. Stanlake bounces Shanaka out on the hook! The deflection is so slight that Carey barely appeals when the ball lands in his gloves, but the decision goes the way of the bowler. No review - that\u2019s out. Perera chops the straight one on. They\u2019re in big strife now. 11th over: Sri Lanka 75-5 (Hasaranga 0, Shanaka 1) Shane Warne is trying to get Maxwell to talk about the nicknames of Agar and Cummins. Thankfully, he realises this isn\u2019t a good idea. 10th over: Sri Lanka 65-4 (Perera 18) Perera unfurls his second booming drive, this time giving Cummins the treatment through cover. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised, according to those who have crunched the data, he did play one of the best Test innings of all-time just eight months ago. Dickwella\u2019s turn, who scoops for four! Stanlake could have stopped it but didn\u2019t get his hand down in time. But Dickwella doesn\u2019t get properly in, sending a gentle leading edge to Turner at point to finish the over. Nice change of pace from Cummins to earn his entry to the book. Fine work from Agar, tempting Fernando with a slower one through the air, well wide of the off-stump. He takes the bait, top-edging high into the sky, taken nicely by Cummins running in from long-off. 9th over: Sri Lanka 54-3 (Perera 12, Dickwella 0) 8th over: Sri Lanka 49-2 (Avishka 15, Perera 9) Zampa now, with his wrist spin. His wrong\u2019un is spot on from the outset, winning Avishka\u2019s inside edge then beating Fernando on the outside of his bat. Avishka gets more of it next time he\u2019s up, timing a forceful drive into the gap at extra cover for a boundary. They needed that. 7th over: Sri Lanka 41-2 (Avishka 9, Perera 7) It\u2019s spin with Agar for the first time tonight. He had a good game on Sunday, conceding just 13 runs. Not his best over here but ge gets out of it with five singles. 6th over: Sri Lanka 36-2 (Avishka 7, Perera 4) Shoooot. Kusal Perera strokes a gorgeous off-drive to the rope first ball - on the up, thanks for coming. Shane Warne says Shane Warne things on TV in response, champing Billy Stanlake in the process. Fernando has a dash later in the over, lifting high out to midwicket, but Richardson does well with an athletic stop on the rope. Power play done. Gunathilaka makes room but misses an attempted slap, Stanlake\u2019s delivery clipping the very top of off-stump. That\u2019ll do it. 5th over: Sri Lanka 28-1 (Gunathilaka 21, Avishka 4) Cummins is on and with his first ball he\u2019s immediately on that nagging hip length to Avishka. Gunathilaka\u2019s turn, who nails a cut shot but Maxwell is there at point, diving with one hand to stop a certain boundary. Superb. Warner is also into the act, racing around to stop more runs at mid-off. Nobody can stop four from the final ball though, a thick edge racing away to the rope; the left-hander into the 20s. 4th over: Sri Lanka 21-1 (Gunathilaka 16, Avishka 2) Gunathilaka backs out of a reverse something-or-another as Stanlake\u2019s first ball arrives, deciding at the last minute to dab to third man. His execution improves dramatically as the over goes on, picking up a boundary over midwicket then scooping a SIX over the head of the \u2018keeper. As you do when the quick is 6\u201910\u201d and bowling 145kph. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 9-1 (Gunathilaka 4, Avishka 2) Another high-quality over from Richardson, beating Gunathilaka\u2019s outside edge to begin, giving him very little thereafter. Avishka is off the mark from the final ball but he was lucky his hoick didn\u2019t end up in the hands of the man at deep midwicket. \u201cWinning the toss and batting first was the only way Sri Lanka could make a comeback in this series today,\u201d insists Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWith no scoreboard pressure, presence of decent batsmen for flat pitches such as today\u2019s, and an opportunity to cash in on the Starc-less death overs, it\u2019s do or die for the islanders. It\u2019s unbelievable Rajapaksa has been dropped after a great series versus Pakistan, but that\u2019s just the way it is now. Hope they put aside the pessimism to revive their talent for unexpected heroics and make this series exciting again!\u201d Yes, he sent this before the innings started. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 6-1 (Gunathilaka 3, Avishka 0) Gunathilaka is beaten by the final ball of the excellent Stanlake over. Earlier, he already sorted him out twice with sharp deliveries outside the off-stump. Between times, a spinkler came on at mid-off. Eventful. Ugly cricket. Gunathilaka took off after pushing to point and Mendis was coming, but he was sent back far too late. Agar deflected cleverly at the bowlers\u2019 end upon receiving the throw. 1st over: Sri Lanka 4-0 (Gunathilaka 2, Mendis 1) As Gunathilaka gets off the mark first all to third man, Shane Warne rolls out the favoured stat of most TV commentators: if you lose three wickets in a T20 power play, you lose three times in four. Richardson is right on the money to the right-handed Mendis, beating him with good\u2019un. Warne is now talking about lasagne because it helped Stanlake, who will we will shortly, put on six kilograms. Smith drops Mendis to finish the first over, diving to his right at backward point with the right hand. It is a tough chance by normal-people standards, but they are the type that the former skipper makes a habit of snaffling. Gunathilaka and Mendis are opening the batting. Richardson, of the Kane variety, has the new ball in his hand. PLAY! The crowd numbers will be a talking point tonight. Men\u2019s international cricket in Australia doesn\u2019t come much more Off-Broadway than this. October, mid-week, pay TV coverage only - not a great combination. Anyway, the players are on the field so positive vibes only, as they say on the internet. At the toss. Sri Lankan skipper Malinga said he wants them to \u201cshow character\u201d today and believes batting first will take a bit of pressure off to begin. Finch was \u201ca bit undecided\u201d due to the dew, leaning towards batting. \u201cBut we\u2019re not too disappointed bowling first.\u201d Three changes for Sri Lanka. Kasun Rajitha, Oshada Fernando and Bhanuka Rajapaska are out. Coming in: Avishka Fernando (HOW WAS HE OUT TO BEGIN WITH?), Niroshan Dickwella and Isuru Udana. For Australia, just Stanlake for Starc. Australia: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Ashton Turner, Alex Carey (wk), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa, Billy Stanlake. Sri Lanka: Danushka Gunathilaka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Perera, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dasun Shanaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Isuru Udana, Lakshan Sandakan, Lasith Malinga (c), Nuwan Pradeep. While we wait for those teamsheets. I mentioned Mitch Starc\u2019s brother. I really should have identified him as Commonwealth Games gold medallist, Brandon Starc. Handy family. They are batting. Teams shortly. To the Gabba we go for the second men\u2019s international of this marathon Australian summer. It\u2019s it there that the Sri Lankans will try and recover form the 134-run mauling they copped in the city of churches on Sunday at the hands of Warner and Maxwell and co. It\u2019d be daft to completely rule them out in this three-game T20 series on the basis of that first performance, though. Look at what they did in the World Cup when they looked a broken and divided rabble - they beat England, who went on to win the whole thing. Or that absurd Test win in Durban. Or sweeping Pakistan last month. Maybe that\u2019s too optimistic this time around, though. Poor old Kasun Rajitha\u2019s analysis of 0/75 - the worst in T20I history - summed it up as Australia\u2019s openers put on 122 before Warner and Maxwell added another 109 in about 25 minutes then the quicks went to work. The hosts are determined to up their game in this format with a home T20 World Cup ahead of them exactly a year from now. Ahead of the toss, we already know Mitch Starc hasn\u2019t made the trip, instead attending his brother\u2019s wedding. Fair play. Big Queenslander Billy Stanlake comes into the XI. As for Sri Lanka, expect bulk changes with Dickwella and Udana the most likely inclusions.",

Which is fine.\u201d She smiles, well aware of the fascination. \u201cBut I tend to live in the present and in the future.\u201d A 2001 profile of the model/actor in the New York Times described her as a \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig\" title=\"\">Zelig</a> of the zeitgeist \u2026 popping up in the right place at the right time\u201d. And there is certainly something magical about her life and the people who have passed through it. As a child (she is now 72) she was taught to dance by Gene Kelly. Greta Garbo came to her parents\u2019 parties; Salvador Dal\u00ed \u2013 a friend of her grandmother, the designer Elsa Schiaparelli \u2013 wanted to paint her. The legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland pushed her to become a model \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent would describe her as \u201cthe face of the 70s\u201d \u2013 and she was photographed by giants such as David Bailey, Irving Penn and Richard Avedon. Andy Warhol photographed her wedding.</p> <p>She discovered meditation in India alongside George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was at Bianca Jagger\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/bianca-jagger-studio-54\" title=\"\">Studio 54 birthday party</a> \u2013 the fabled night of the white horse \u2013 and attended Truman Capote\u2019s famed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/fashion/black-and-white-ball-anniversary-truman-capote.html\" title=\"\">Black and White ball</a>. Although she continues to work in film, she hasn\u2019t made a huge number of movies \u2013 but the biggest, early in her career, were Luchino Visconti\u2019s Death in Venice, Bob Fosse\u2019s Cabaret and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Barry Lyndon.</p> <p>Berenson lives in a villa down an unprepossessing road on the outskirts of Marrakech. Even this place seems suitably magical \u2013 \u201cmy paradise\u201d, she says \u2013 an oasis of bright colours and patterns, and lush greenery amid the scrub. We sit on her terrace, overlooking the garden and pool. Tiny birds flit in and out. Berenson, beautiful and glamorous, is wearing a long, patterned kaftan, her slight but athletic frame untroubled by the weight of her heavy jade earrings and matching tangled vine of necklaces. Her sunglasses stay on throughout \u2013 I never once see her eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea92cc223e093be930049be71325dc4e629abd9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea92cc223e093be930049be71325dc4e629abd9c/0_608_5752_3452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berenson with Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli at the Paris premiere of Cabaret in 1972.

She is thinking, she says, of writing a lifestyle book, filled with healthy recipes, and interiors and gardening advice. There is something both timeless and very current about Berenson. She was well ahead of the \u201cwellness\u201d trend, and stands at something like high priestess level now \u2013 she doesn\u2019t eat sugar or gluten, she does yoga, pilates and meditation \u2013 and has taken to Instagram.</p> <p>Berenson is one of a generation of supremely cultured, well-connected Euro-aristocrats (she speaks five languages), born to socialite Gogo Schiaparelli, daughter of Elsa, and Robert Berenson, a director of Aristotle Onassis\u2019s shipping company who became a US diplomat. As a child she wanted to be in the movies, her bedroom plastered with pictures of Audrey Hepburn, Rita Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich.</p> <p>She grew up moving around Europe, then was sent to boarding school in Berkshire, where she concluded she was \u201chopeless\u201d at acting. \u201cThey had plays they put on and we were obliged to get up on stage and do things. And I remember running off the stage crying, because I was so terrified.

Vreeland, she remembers, \u201csaid, \u2018We have to photograph Marisa.\u2019 That was it. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d Berenson had already been turned down by one model agent, the influential Eileen Ford, but with Vreeland\u2019s backing, she became one of the most sought-after faces of the 60s and 70s. Elsa Schiaparelli wasn\u2019t too pleased. \u201cI think she was afraid for me,\u201d says Berenson. \u201cI was so young, and living in New York alone.\u201d Also, she adds with a smile, \u201cI was a little bit outrageous too. I did the first nude in Vogue, and things like that, and she was horrified.\u201d</p> <p>In her spare time she was hanging out at parties with artists and rock stars, and in relationships with actors and rich heirs. She remembers doing a shoot for Vogue in Iran. \u201cIn those days, everything was accessible.\u201d She makes it sound so glamorous and bohemian. Was she a wild hippy? \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was a combination of very well-brought-up, and an old-fashioned romantic way of looking at life.\u201d She was on, she says, a \u201cspiritual quest\u201d. Being into health and meditation probably saved her. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people didn\u2019t survive. I went through that whole period on orange juice and meditation.\u201d Drugs, she says, were \u201cterrifying to me. I couldn\u2019t imagine losing it like that. And then sexually I was kind of romantic, so I never did the whole crazy thing that way.\u201d</p> <p>It was on a Vogue shoot in India when she was about 18, in the late 60s, that she learned about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\u2019s ashram, the birthplace of transcendental meditation. Two of the Beatles were there when she arrived. \u201cAnd one of the Beach Boys,\u201d she points out. \u201cSo I ended up staying there for a while, going through the initiation, becoming a vegetarian. The days went by and we would just meditate, sleeping in little huts.\u201d Did she spend much time with George and Ringo? \u201cWhen we\u2019d finish the day, George would say, \u2018Come into my room\u2019 and we\u2019d sit on the floor, and listen to them playing guitar.\u201d At the time, she says, it didn\u2019t feel like a big deal. \u201cWe were all on the same quest \u2013 there was a lot of peace and love in those days that we were all looking for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"761e2b5055a43220f3b5dd0f2bb8b148c5c474b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/761e2b5055a43220f3b5dd0f2bb8b148c5c474b9/0_0_2448_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marisa Berenson with Andy Warhol in 1975.

But then I set foot on that stage, and I just had this incredible feeling that this is where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d</p> <p>She was doing Death in Venice when she got a call from a producer who said Bob Fosse wanted to see her for a film, which turned out to be Cabaret. On the set of that, she says she remembers trembling so badly that Fosse asked her why her hat was shaking. \u201cIt was terrible. It was only my second movie.\u201d Then Kubrick saw Cabaret and decided he wanted her to play Lady Lyndon in his adaptation of the Thackeray novel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvukpagR0Y\" title=\"\">Barry Lyndon</a>. He called her when she was in bed with pneumonia and could hardly speak. \u201cI was practically unconscious,\u201d she says. \u201cI just let him speak because I was speechless anyway. But he carried on for quite a while about every detail of what he\u2019d liked about my performance in Cabaret.\u201d She didn\u2019t meet him until she was on the set.</p> <p>Berenson moved into the wing of a draughty castle in Ireland, where they were shooting. Every day Kubrick would tell her she might be needed on set, but she never was (her scenes were filmed once the production suddenly moved to England, reportedly following a threat from the IRA). \u201cIt was the most depressing place,\u201d she says. \u201cI had visions of going riding in the Irish countryside and all that, but in the end, it rained all the time and I was so lonely. I think Stanley liked the idea that I became very melancholic there.\u201d She would cook spaghetti bolognese for the crew, just to have visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd5b4df2525221ad28d3e1a4124522cc5d5e8cf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd5b4df2525221ad28d3e1a4124522cc5d5e8cf5/0_724_5400_4547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berenson in a Vogue fashion shoot in Capri, 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"842\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berenson in a Vogue fashion shoot in Capri, 1968.

He never raised his voice, he was always very gentle, but he wanted what he wanted, so if he wanted a scene shot 50 times then it would be shot 50 times. Yes, he was a perfectionist and he wanted you to give the best of yourself, and he expected people to be available.\u201d She understands that, she adds. \u201cEvery great person I\u2019ve worked with, whether a director or photographer, they have this exceptional kind of rarity. You have to be demanding, you have to be a perfectionist, you have to know what you want, and you have to have the best of what you can have because otherwise you don\u2019t do extraordinary things.\u201d</p> <p>Her acting career had got off to an electrifying start, but Berenson walked away. \u201cI got married shortly after that, so my career sort of \u2026\u201d She pauses, then says crisply, \u201cI put everything on hold for a period of time, which was a choice.\u201d Her marriage to rivet tycoon Jim Randall didn\u2019t last. \u201cAnd then I went through a series of very challenging things in my life, so I had to kind of move through all of that and come out the other side. I had a marriage, a divorce, a car crash\u201d \u2013 she was injured, but the two people in the other car were killed \u2013 \u201cand another marriage and another divorce.\u201d</p> <p>She started working again, in theatre and European films, but none of her roles have had the same impact as her first three. Does she regret not pushing her career? \u201cI can\u2019t regret anything because I had a great, beautiful daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now I have a granddaughter, so I\u2019m thrilled. With Hollywood, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if I had stayed. It\u2019s true that Barry Lyndon was such an amazing thing for me, that had I continued on that road, maybe, I don\u2019t know \u2026 But one makes choices and I made that choice at the time so I can\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p> <p>There doesn\u2019t seem much room in Berenson\u2019s life for negativity. She takes her spiritual practice very seriously, and it has seen her through the toughest times, she says, among them the death of her sister Berry, a talented photographer who was a passenger on one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11.</p> <p>Berenson was also in the air that day, flying to New York, when her plane was diverted to Newfoundland, where she was stuck for several days. \u201cWe were put into this big stadium place, and there were tables they had organised with fruit and a toothbrush and a piece of soap, and medical whatever, and then a whole line of telephones on another table.\u201d She called her daughter, who had frantically been trying to track her down, and learned what had happened to Berry. She remembers accompanying a priest, a fellow passenger, to a tiny church on a hill where they said prayers and sang songs.</p> <p>It must be a particularly painful loss because those images are so vivid, and are still used in reports and documentaries all the time. She nods. \u201cTo see that tower constantly, it\u2019s awful. It\u2019s so huge and so beyond anything imaginable.\u201d</p> <p>She has been able to deal with it, she says, because of her spirituality. \u201cI try and look at things on a different level of consciousness, and I connect with my sister all the time. So that helps a lot.\u201d She adds, very sincerely: \u201cI believe that so strongly that I never feel alone and I always know that I\u2019m accompanied by higher powers.\u201d</p> <p>When she looks back, does she really have no regrets? \u201cSometimes I think maybe I wasted too much time on things. But in the end, I talk myself out of it \u2013 nothing is a waste of time, because everything is a growing process.\u201d</p> <p>Berenson isn\u2019t slacking. She spent much of last year in Paris doing a musical, realising her dream to sing and dance. Three years ago, she took on Shakespeare for the first time, performing in London\u2019s West End in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s production of Romeo and Juliet. \u201cI don\u2019t let age get in the way of my life. I continue to do the things I want to do and thank God I\u2019m able to do it.\u201d Nobody likes getting old, she says, \u201cbut it can also be glorious. I feel better about a lot of things now than I did when I was younger, and creatively I think I\u2019m much better now. I\u2019m more secure within myself.\u201d</p> <p>By now it\u2019s late afternoon, and a far-off call to prayer comes shimmering through the warm air. She likes this time of day \u2013 she\u2019ll watch films, or read books. Perhaps have a swim. A time for contemplation, and planning. What does she want to achieve? \u201cLots of things. I\u2019m not finished yet.\u201d</p>",

She discovered meditation in India alongside George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was at Bianca Jagger\u2019s Studio 54 birthday party \u2013 the fabled night of the white horse \u2013 and attended Truman Capote\u2019s famed Black and White ball. Although she continues to work in film, she hasn\u2019t made a huge number of movies \u2013 but the biggest, early in her career, were Luchino Visconti\u2019s Death in Venice, Bob Fosse\u2019s Cabaret and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Barry Lyndon. Berenson lives in a villa down an unprepossessing road on the outskirts of Marrakech. Even this place seems suitably magical \u2013 \u201cmy paradise\u201d, she says \u2013 an oasis of bright colours and patterns, and lush greenery amid the scrub. We sit on her terrace, overlooking the garden and pool. Tiny birds flit in and out. Berenson, beautiful and glamorous, is wearing a long, patterned kaftan, her slight but athletic frame untroubled by the weight of her heavy jade earrings and matching tangled vine of necklaces. Her sunglasses stay on throughout \u2013 I never once see her eyes. A housekeeper brings green juice made with vegetables from her organic garden. She is thinking, she says, of writing a lifestyle book, filled with healthy recipes, and interiors and gardening advice. There is something both timeless and very current about Berenson. She was well ahead of the \u201cwellness\u201d trend, and stands at something like high priestess level now \u2013 she doesn\u2019t eat sugar or gluten, she does yoga, pilates and meditation \u2013 and has taken to Instagram. Berenson is one of a generation of supremely cultured, well-connected Euro-aristocrats (she speaks five languages), born to socialite Gogo Schiaparelli, daughter of Elsa, and Robert Berenson, a director of Aristotle Onassis\u2019s shipping company who became a US diplomat. As a child she wanted to be in the movies, her bedroom plastered with pictures of Audrey Hepburn, Rita Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich. She grew up moving around Europe, then was sent to boarding school in Berkshire, where she concluded she was \u201chopeless\u201d at acting. \u201cThey had plays they put on and we were obliged to get up on stage and do things. And I remember running off the stage crying, because I was so terrified. So you can imagine I never thought it would ever happen.\u201d When she was 16, her father took her to a ball in New York where Vreeland spotted her and decided she must start modelling. Vreeland, she remembers, \u201csaid, \u2018We have to photograph Marisa.\u2019 That was it. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d Berenson had already been turned down by one model agent, the influential Eileen Ford, but with Vreeland\u2019s backing, she became one of the most sought-after faces of the 60s and 70s. Elsa Schiaparelli wasn\u2019t too pleased. \u201cI think she was afraid for me,\u201d says Berenson. \u201cI was so young, and living in New York alone.\u201d Also, she adds with a smile, \u201cI was a little bit outrageous too. I did the first nude in Vogue, and things like that, and she was horrified.\u201d In her spare time she was hanging out at parties with artists and rock stars, and in relationships with actors and rich heirs. She remembers doing a shoot for Vogue in Iran. \u201cIn those days, everything was accessible.\u201d She makes it sound so glamorous and bohemian. Was she a wild hippy? \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was a combination of very well-brought-up, and an old-fashioned romantic way of looking at life.\u201d She was on, she says, a \u201cspiritual quest\u201d. Being into health and meditation probably saved her. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people didn\u2019t survive. I went through that whole period on orange juice and meditation.\u201d Drugs, she says, were \u201cterrifying to me. I couldn\u2019t imagine losing it like that. And then sexually I was kind of romantic, so I never did the whole crazy thing that way.\u201d It was on a Vogue shoot in India when she was about 18, in the late 60s, that she learned about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\u2019s ashram, the birthplace of transcendental meditation. Two of the Beatles were there when she arrived. \u201cAnd one of the Beach Boys,\u201d she points out. \u201cSo I ended up staying there for a while, going through the initiation, becoming a vegetarian. The days went by and we would just meditate, sleeping in little huts.\u201d Did she spend much time with George and Ringo? \u201cWhen we\u2019d finish the day, George would say, \u2018Come into my room\u2019 and we\u2019d sit on the floor, and listen to them playing guitar.\u201d At the time, she says, it didn\u2019t feel like a big deal. \u201cWe were all on the same quest \u2013 there was a lot of peace and love in those days that we were all looking for.\u201d Back in New York, Berenson took acting classes in the evenings. \u201cAnd then I started doing very off-off-Broadway things, just to learn and to get past my insecurities and shyness.\u201d She met Visconti though her then-boyfriend Helmut Berger \u2013 he had also been in a relationship with Visconti \u2013 and he virtually cast her on sight for Death in Venice. \u201cThe first day, I thought I was going to die of fright. But then I set foot on that stage, and I just had this incredible feeling that this is where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d She was doing Death in Venice when she got a call from a producer who said Bob Fosse wanted to see her for a film, which turned out to be Cabaret. On the set of that, she says she remembers trembling so badly that Fosse asked her why her hat was shaking. \u201cIt was terrible. It was only my second movie.\u201d Then Kubrick saw Cabaret and decided he wanted her to play Lady Lyndon in his adaptation of the Thackeray novel Barry Lyndon. He called her when she was in bed with pneumonia and could hardly speak. \u201cI was practically unconscious,\u201d she says. \u201cI just let him speak because I was speechless anyway. But he carried on for quite a while about every detail of what he\u2019d liked about my performance in Cabaret.\u201d She didn\u2019t meet him until she was on the set. Berenson moved into the wing of a draughty castle in Ireland, where they were shooting. Every day Kubrick would tell her she might be needed on set, but she never was (her scenes were filmed once the production suddenly moved to England, reportedly following a threat from the IRA). \u201cIt was the most depressing place,\u201d she says. \u201cI had visions of going riding in the Irish countryside and all that, but in the end, it rained all the time and I was so lonely. I think Stanley liked the idea that I became very melancholic there.\u201d She would cook spaghetti bolognese for the crew, just to have visitors. Kubrick was, she recalls, \u201ctotally kind and respectful, and very amusing. He never raised his voice, he was always very gentle, but he wanted what he wanted, so if he wanted a scene shot 50 times then it would be shot 50 times. Yes, he was a perfectionist and he wanted you to give the best of yourself, and he expected people to be available.\u201d She understands that, she adds. \u201cEvery great person I\u2019ve worked with, whether a director or photographer, they have this exceptional kind of rarity. You have to be demanding, you have to be a perfectionist, you have to know what you want, and you have to have the best of what you can have because otherwise you don\u2019t do extraordinary things.\u201d Her acting career had got off to an electrifying start, but Berenson walked away. \u201cI got married shortly after that, so my career sort of \u2026\u201d She pauses, then says crisply, \u201cI put everything on hold for a period of time, which was a choice.\u201d Her marriage to rivet tycoon Jim Randall didn\u2019t last. \u201cAnd then I went through a series of very challenging things in my life, so I had to kind of move through all of that and come out the other side. I had a marriage, a divorce, a car crash\u201d \u2013 she was injured, but the two people in the other car were killed \u2013 \u201cand another marriage and another divorce.\u201d She started working again, in theatre and European films, but none of her roles have had the same impact as her first three. Does she regret not pushing her career? \u201cI can\u2019t regret anything because I had a great, beautiful daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now I have a granddaughter, so I\u2019m thrilled. With Hollywood, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if I had stayed. It\u2019s true that Barry Lyndon was such an amazing thing for me, that had I continued on that road, maybe, I don\u2019t know \u2026 But one makes choices and I made that choice at the time so I can\u2019t regret it.\u201d There doesn\u2019t seem much room in Berenson\u2019s life for negativity. She takes her spiritual practice very seriously, and it has seen her through the toughest times, she says, among them the death of her sister Berry, a talented photographer who was a passenger on one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11. Berenson was also in the air that day, flying to New York, when her plane was diverted to Newfoundland, where she was stuck for several days. \u201cWe were put into this big stadium place, and there were tables they had organised with fruit and a toothbrush and a piece of soap, and medical whatever, and then a whole line of telephones on another table.\u201d She called her daughter, who had frantically been trying to track her down, and learned what had happened to Berry. She remembers accompanying a priest, a fellow passenger, to a tiny church on a hill where they said prayers and sang songs. It must be a particularly painful loss because those images are so vivid, and are still used in reports and documentaries all the time. She nods. \u201cTo see that tower constantly, it\u2019s awful. It\u2019s so huge and so beyond anything imaginable.\u201d She has been able to deal with it, she says, because of her spirituality. \u201cI try and look at things on a different level of consciousness, and I connect with my sister all the time. So that helps a lot.\u201d She adds, very sincerely: \u201cI believe that so strongly that I never feel alone and I always know that I\u2019m accompanied by higher powers.\u201d When she looks back, does she really have no regrets? \u201cSometimes I think maybe I wasted too much time on things. But in the end, I talk myself out of it \u2013 nothing is a waste of time, because everything is a growing process.\u201d Berenson isn\u2019t slacking. She spent much of last year in Paris doing a musical, realising her dream to sing and dance. Three years ago, she took on Shakespeare for the first time, performing in London\u2019s West End in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s production of Romeo and Juliet. \u201cI don\u2019t let age get in the way of my life. I continue to do the things I want to do and thank God I\u2019m able to do it.\u201d Nobody likes getting old, she says, \u201cbut it can also be glorious. I feel better about a lot of things now than I did when I was younger, and creatively I think I\u2019m much better now. I\u2019m more secure within myself.\u201d By now it\u2019s late afternoon, and a far-off call to prayer comes shimmering through the warm air. She likes this time of day \u2013 she\u2019ll watch films, or read books. Perhaps have a swim. A time for contemplation, and planning. What does she want to achieve? \u201cLots of things. I\u2019m not finished yet.\u201d",

We\u2019re all young enough not to have experienced Soviet communism first-hand. We associate leftism with Bernie Sanders rather than the gulags. We share lectures by the Marxist anthropologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/01/marx-capital-and-the-madness-of-economic-reason-review\" title=\"\">David Harvey</a>, and will happily post memes of Marx saying, \u201cOh shit, I forgot about human nature\u201d, but are as opposed to authoritarianism and government corruption as our grandparents are. We are also more critical of western societies, and share concerns about working conditions, the power of big business, and access to social services and public spaces. The western-like left is growing among a small minority of young people in eastern Europe, via civic groups, art co-operatives, zines, independent publishers, online platforms, or tiny parties made up of academics. Their main criticism of contemporary eastern European societies is the rise of inequality. They have a point.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The creepiest communist heritage of them all, the Big Brother \u2013 to many westerners just a historical blip \u2013 is still very much alive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/26/this-is-the-golden-age-eastern-europes-extraordinary-30-year-revival\" title=\"\">eastern European states have became wealthier</a>, the poor in these states have become poorer and the rich richer. In the 1980s, the total earnings of the poorer half of east Europeans was equivalent to 25-35% of national income. Since the end of communism, this figure has dropped to 17% in some countries. The most unequal country in the region is Russia, where the richest <a href=\"https://wid.world/world/#sptinc_p99p100_z/MD;RO;SI;SK;RS;RU;PL;LV;EE;CZ;HR;BG;AL;BA/last/s/k/p/yearly/s/false/0.4814999999999996/30/curve/false/region\" title=\"\">1% now earns 27% of national income</a> \u2013 a dramatic increase from 3.5% before the fall of the iron curtain.</p> <p>But if in the west the solutions to inequality proposed by the left are clearly viable, in eastern Europe it\u2019s more complicated.

Nostalgic after their youth, voters on state pensions are often bought off with a pair of socks or a sack of flour, and a promise of more to come. </p> <p>One of the most perverse of the so-called left-leaning parties in the region is Romania\u2019s Social Democratic party (PSD), which led the governing coalition until this month and has dominated domestic politics since 1989. It has often prioritised big business over local communities, most notably in 2013 when it allowed the opening of a gold mine using cyanide at the ancient settlement Rosia Montana, generating mass protests. PSD stands accused of shocking nepotism in filling state institutions and boards, of trying to water down anti-corruption legislation and remove judges. A leading party figure was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48421430\" title=\"\">jailed</a> earlier this year for corruption. No wonder Romanians have come to distrust state institutions.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just party politics that are messy. The social protection system itself is officially state-funded, but unofficially it\u2019s semi-privatised. On paper, right across eastern Europe, we have preserved free (or almost free) healthcare, nursery, school and university education. But in reality, particularly in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Lithuania and Hungary, many people have to pay informally for these services. Patients are often expected to give <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5940713/\" title=\"\">a fat tip after a medical consultation</a>, or, in the case of more expensive surgeries, to pay up front to have it performed in the first place, regardless of insurance cover.

We\u2019re all young enough not to have experienced Soviet communism first-hand. We associate leftism with Bernie Sanders rather than the gulags. We share lectures by the Marxist anthropologist David Harvey, and will happily post memes of Marx saying, \u201cOh shit, I forgot about human nature\u201d, but are as opposed to authoritarianism and government corruption as our grandparents are. We are also more critical of western societies, and share concerns about working conditions, the power of big business, and access to social services and public spaces. The western-like left is growing among a small minority of young people in eastern Europe, via civic groups, art co-operatives, zines, independent publishers, online platforms, or tiny parties made up of academics. Their main criticism of contemporary eastern European societies is the rise of inequality. They have a point. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, despite the fact that eastern European states have became wealthier, the poor in these states have become poorer and the rich richer. In the 1980s, the total earnings of the poorer half of east Europeans was equivalent to 25-35% of national income. Since the end of communism, this figure has dropped to 17% in some countries. The most unequal country in the region is Russia, where the richest 1% now earns 27% of national income \u2013 a dramatic increase from 3.5% before the fall of the iron curtain. But if in the west the solutions to inequality proposed by the left are clearly viable, in eastern Europe it\u2019s more complicated. I might vote Labour or Green in the UK, where I\u2019ve lived for the past seven years, but in Moldova or Romania I\u2019m a centrist. That\u2019s because the greatest common enemy across the political spectrum in eastern Europe is government corruption. And while liberal centre-right pro-European parties lack answers on many things, on this they have just been more committed to the fight. Former Romanian president Traian B\u0103sescu\u2019s centre-right coalition set up a national anti-corruption directorate that, for all its flaws, managed to imprison some of the most influential corrupt political figures and is considered a successful model for the region. In Moldova, the prime minister, Maia Sandu\u2019s party for Action and Solidarity is the first party to have been fully transparent about the sources of its funding. Outrageous levels of corruption combined with the communist inheritance mean politics in eastern Europe can\u2019t easily be mapped on to the familiar left-to-right spectrum that explains voter behaviour in much of western Europe. It\u2019s far messier than that. Leftist ideals and slogans carry the weight of totalitarianism but are also hijacked by populists to win elections by exploiting poor or elderly people. Nostalgic after their youth, voters on state pensions are often bought off with a pair of socks or a sack of flour, and a promise of more to come. One of the most perverse of the so-called left-leaning parties in the region is Romania\u2019s Social Democratic party (PSD), which led the governing coalition until this month and has dominated domestic politics since 1989. It has often prioritised big business over local communities, most notably in 2013 when it allowed the opening of a gold mine using cyanide at the ancient settlement Rosia Montana, generating mass protests. PSD stands accused of shocking nepotism in filling state institutions and boards, of trying to water down anti-corruption legislation and remove judges. A leading party figure was jailed earlier this year for corruption. No wonder Romanians have come to distrust state institutions. It\u2019s not just party politics that are messy. The social protection system itself is officially state-funded, but unofficially it\u2019s semi-privatised. On paper, right across eastern Europe, we have preserved free (or almost free) healthcare, nursery, school and university education. But in reality, particularly in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Lithuania and Hungary, many people have to pay informally for these services. Patients are often expected to give a fat tip after a medical consultation, or, in the case of more expensive surgeries, to pay up front to have it performed in the first place, regardless of insurance cover. Parents, too, are widely expected to pay for extra classes, exams and \u201cpresents\u201d for teachers. The creepiest communist heritage of them all, Big Brother \u2013 to many westerners just a historical blip \u2013 is still very much alive. Romania spends more money on its intelligence services, the SRI, than Germany, Turkey or Canada. In 2017, in Moldova (population 3.5 million), the number of recorded phone calls by the secret services was more than three times that of the UK. The police often seem to defend corrupt politicians rather than citizens \u2013 another police state hangover. In 2018, Romanian police used teargas on a peaceful crowd demanding that government revoke plans for a law that would have allowed corrupt politicians to escape prison. Moldovan police cracked down hard last year when the country was rocked by anti-government rallies, many protesters carrying EU flags and chanting, \u201cDown with the mafia!\u201d Justice has never been served for the arrests, beatings, rapes and deaths that followed mass protests against vote rigging by Moldova\u2019s Communist party in April 2009. In many ways, the state is the problem in eastern Europe \u2013 large, corrupt, inefficient and oppressive \u2013 which explains why both centre-right reformists and the new, youth-led left groups emerging in civil society are looking for solutions outside it. \u2022 Paula Erizanu is a Moldovan writer currently based in the UK",

A firefighter, David Badillo, met her sister leaving the building. She told him Jessica was still in their flat and he promised he would go and get her.</p> <p>Badillo took the fire lift intending to rescue the young girl but it stopped at the 15th floor and when the door opened, the stairwell was filled with black smoke. He was not wearing breathing apparatus and was forced to descend.</p> <p>A firefighting team equipped with breathing apparatus then tried to reach her. At 1.48am, firefighters including Badillo made it to flat 176 on the 20th floor where Jessica was thought to be. They searched the flat but found no one and left, assuming she had already escaped. In fact, she had fled to the top floor to escape the flames.</p> <p>Call records showed she rang the emergency fire control room at 1.29am. The conversation with the control room officer (CRO), Sarah Russell, ended at 2.24am.</p> <p>Jessica repeatedly asked Russell: \u201cPlease can you hurry up?\u201d A transcript of the phone call, running to about 70 pages, shows that Russell told Jessica: \u201cThey are hurrying up. Is there another room you can go into?\u201d</p> <p>Jessica replied: \u201cNo, can you hurry up please? I\u2019m begging you.\u201d Russell replied: \u201cThey are, they\u2019re right below you. But you need to keep yourself safe.\u201d</p> <p>Jessica was with a group of 10 people on the 23rd floor as the flames rose up the building. They ended up in in a single bedroom in flat 201.</p> <p>Throughout the call Jessica repeatedly said she was having trouble breathing. She told Russell there was smoke in the bedroom. She said others had tried to leave but there was too much smoke.</p> <p>\u201cCRO Russell could hear the sound of breathing for some time after that and ended the call only when the line went silent. That was the last known contact with Jessica Ramirez,\u201d the inquiry report says. Her body was eventually discovered in a flat on the 23rd floor.</p> <h2>Choucair family</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"753b39875ca890b69bdc457364ada2a53a666513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/753b39875ca890b69bdc457364ada2a53a666513/0_51_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Choucair family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A composite image shown during the Grenfell inquiry of six members of the Choucair family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Choucair family lived in two flats on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower.

      "bodyText": "Jessica Ramirez The desperate efforts to rescue 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez from her home in Grenfell Tower became emblematic of the bravery but ultimate failure of the London fire brigade on that night. Ramirez lived with her family on the 20th floor of the building. A firefighter, David Badillo, met her sister leaving the building. She told him Jessica was still in their flat and he promised he would go and get her. Badillo took the fire lift intending to rescue the young girl but it stopped at the 15th floor and when the door opened, the stairwell was filled with black smoke. He was not wearing breathing apparatus and was forced to descend. A firefighting team equipped with breathing apparatus then tried to reach her. At 1.48am, firefighters including Badillo made it to flat 176 on the 20th floor where Jessica was thought to be. They searched the flat but found no one and left, assuming she had already escaped. In fact, she had fled to the top floor to escape the flames. Call records showed she rang the emergency fire control room at 1.29am. The conversation with the control room officer (CRO), Sarah Russell, ended at 2.24am. Jessica repeatedly asked Russell: \u201cPlease can you hurry up?\u201d A transcript of the phone call, running to about 70 pages, shows that Russell told Jessica: \u201cThey are hurrying up. Is there another room you can go into?\u201d Jessica replied: \u201cNo, can you hurry up please? I\u2019m begging you.\u201d Russell replied: \u201cThey are, they\u2019re right below you. But you need to keep yourself safe.\u201d Jessica was with a group of 10 people on the 23rd floor as the flames rose up the building. They ended up in in a single bedroom in flat 201. Throughout the call Jessica repeatedly said she was having trouble breathing. She told Russell there was smoke in the bedroom. She said others had tried to leave but there was too much smoke. \u201cCRO Russell could hear the sound of breathing for some time after that and ended the call only when the line went silent. That was the last known contact with Jessica Ramirez,\u201d the inquiry report says. Her body was eventually discovered in a flat on the 23rd floor. Choucair family The Choucair family lived in two flats on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower. Sirria Choucair, 60, who was born in Lebanon, lived in flat 191. Her daughter Nadia, 33, son-in-law Bassem Choukair, 40, and their three children, Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab, three, lived in flat 193. All six were trapped and died in flat 193. The last phone call from the flat was at 3.24am. Another resident, Hashim Kedir, rang the emergency services. The report says they were \u201crepeatedly advised that their only chance of survival was to cover their faces with wet cloths and make for the stairs. The option of a helicopter was not possible.\u201d Kedir told the emergency services they had tried to leave but had been unable to do so because of the smoke. \u201cWith the fire approaching, it was difficult to breathe or see anything. He said they could not reach the door, let alone the staircase,\u201d the report says. \u201cTowards the end of the call, [a] control room officer tried to persuade [Kedir] to leave and was again told it was impossible.

I remember talking to Jonny Wilkinson on the field afterwards. \u2018Wow, fantastic,\u2019 I said. \u2018Well done.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Thank you for what you\u2019ve done for my game.\u2019 For him, at that moment, to have the presence of mind to say that shows what a quality bunch they were. They were an amazing combination of people together.\u201d Winning with the Boks in 2007 \u2013 and subsequently at the Suntory club in Japan \u2013 also cemented her professional respect for Jones. \u201cI see him as a rugby mastermind. That\u2019s my experience of him. He\u2019s great at what he does.\u201d She also knows the Springbok coach, Rassie Erasmus, but any split national loyalties will disappear out of the window should the Webb Ellis Cup once again find its way into England\u2019s \u2013 and her own \u2013 hands. \u201cIt would be marvellous. Words probably couldn\u2019t describe it but I\u2019m not a person who counts their chickens before they\u2019re hatched. I\u2019m just blessed. I created the science, I love what I do and I know it makes a difference.\u201d To say this England squad have their eyes on the prize is a serious understatement.",

      "body": "<p>Facebook has agreed to pay a \u00a3500,000 fine, the highest possible, to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, ending more than a year of litigation between the regulator and social network.</p> <p>The ICO announced its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/11/facebook-fined-for-data-breaches-in-cambridge-analytica-scandal\">intention to fine Facebook</a> in July 2018. Unusually, the office went public with its intention before giving Facebook a chance to respond, and ultimately issued the official penalty notice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/25/facebook-fined-uk-privacy-access-user-data-cambridge-analytica\">three months later</a>, in October. Facebook appealed against the fine, and in June 2019 the tribunal issued an interim decision \u201cholding that procedural fairness and allegations of bias on the part of the ICO should be considered as part of the appeal, and that the ICO should be required to disclose materials relating to its decision-making process\u201d.</p> <p>Under the terms of the settlement, Facebook has made no admission of liability. The company has also been allowed to retain the documents disclosed by the ICO, in part because they may help it in its own investigation into the issues around Cambridge Analytica. That investigation had been paused at the ICO\u2019s request.</p> <p>Since Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data protection violations occurred in 2015, before the implementation of the EU\u2019s general data protection regulation in 2018, the maximum possible fine the ICO could levy was \u00a3500,000. If the offences had occurred after May 2018, the potential fine could have been much higher \u2013 up to 4% of Facebook\u2019s annual turnover.</p> <p>James Dipple-Johnstone, the ICO\u2019s deputy commissioner, said: \u201cThe ICO welcomes the agreement reached with Facebook for the withdrawal of their appeal against our monetary penalty notice and agreement to pay the fine. The ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm.</p> <p>\u201cProtection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy. We are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection. With this strong commitment to protecting people\u2019s personal information and privacy, we expect that Facebook will be able to move forward and learn from the events of this case.\u201d</p> <p>Harry Kinmonth, a lawyer representing Facebook, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached a settlement with the ICO. As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015. We made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information which app developers could access. Protecting people\u2019s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information.</p> <p>\u201cThe ICO has stated that it has not discovered evidence that the data of Facebook users in the EU was transferred to Cambridge Analytica by Dr [Aleksandr] Kogan. However, we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the ICO\u2019s wider and ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Facebook has agreed to pay a \u00a3500,000 fine, the highest possible, to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, ending more than a year of litigation between the regulator and social network. The ICO announced its intention to fine Facebook in July 2018. Unusually, the office went public with its intention before giving Facebook a chance to respond, and ultimately issued the official penalty notice three months later, in October. Facebook appealed against the fine, and in June 2019 the tribunal issued an interim decision \u201cholding that procedural fairness and allegations of bias on the part of the ICO should be considered as part of the appeal, and that the ICO should be required to disclose materials relating to its decision-making process\u201d. Under the terms of the settlement, Facebook has made no admission of liability. The company has also been allowed to retain the documents disclosed by the ICO, in part because they may help it in its own investigation into the issues around Cambridge Analytica. That investigation had been paused at the ICO\u2019s request. Since Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data protection violations occurred in 2015, before the implementation of the EU\u2019s general data protection regulation in 2018, the maximum possible fine the ICO could levy was \u00a3500,000. If the offences had occurred after May 2018, the potential fine could have been much higher \u2013 up to 4% of Facebook\u2019s annual turnover. James Dipple-Johnstone, the ICO\u2019s deputy commissioner, said: \u201cThe ICO welcomes the agreement reached with Facebook for the withdrawal of their appeal against our monetary penalty notice and agreement to pay the fine. The ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. \u201cProtection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy. We are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection. With this strong commitment to protecting people\u2019s personal information and privacy, we expect that Facebook will be able to move forward and learn from the events of this case.\u201d Harry Kinmonth, a lawyer representing Facebook, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached a settlement with the ICO. As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015. We made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information which app developers could access. Protecting people\u2019s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information. \u201cThe ICO has stated that it has not discovered evidence that the data of Facebook users in the EU was transferred to Cambridge Analytica by Dr [Aleksandr] Kogan. However, we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the ICO\u2019s wider and ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes.\u201d",

Olivette Otele will take up her role as professor of the history of slavery in January 2020. She will be based at the university\u2019s history department and the Centre for Black Humanities, where she will work with staff, students and communities. Otele became the UK\u2019s first female black history professor after being awarded a professorship and a chair in history by Bath Spa University in 2018.

      "body": "<p>Eva Gouwens had heard that the tech industry was male-dominated, but it wasn\u2019t until she attended the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona for the first time that the extent of the gender imbalance really hit her. <br><br>\u201cI hadn\u2019t really noticed it as an issue until I saw the line for the toilets,\u201d says Gouwens, chief executive of the ethical phone manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.fairphone.com/en/\">Fairphone</a>, which creates phones with no \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (ie from areas of the world with violence and human rights abuses), manufactured in a factory where workers are fairly paid. \u201cIt\u2019s the first event I\u2019ve been to where the queue was longer for the men than for the women.\u201d<br><br>Her initial lack of awareness has its reasons. For one, Gouwens is relatively new to the sector. A veteran of the food industry, the 44-year-old business development expert only switched to tech two years ago \u2013 first as managing director of Amsterdam-based Fairphone and then, since last October, as its chief executive. <br><br>Second, she stepped in at the helm of what was already a fairly egalitarian ship. The gender split of Fairphone\u2019s 75-person workforce is almost straight down the middle (52% male, 48% female). On the firm\u2019s executive management team, meanwhile, six of the eight members are women (including the commercial and operations directors). <br><br>Such atypical parity partly owes to the Dutch way of doing things, according to Gouwens. Rules on shared parental leave, childcare and other types of care provision are \u201cquite progressive\u201d, she says. That said, the Netherlands only ranks 19th on the <a href=\"https://www.pwc.nl/nl/actueel-publicaties/assets/pdfs/pwc-women-in-work-2019-nl.pdf\">Women in Work Index</a> (six places behind the UK). The report also points out that females make up a mere 14% of ICT specialists in the Netherlands. <br><br>So, is Fairphone doing something especially different? Not really, Gouwens admits sheepishly. Sure, the firm is gender-blind with respect to pay and promotion, but it doesn\u2019t go the extra mile to accommodate childcare needs, say, or to extend maternity pay. <br> <br>More influential in creating a balanced workforce, she conjectures, is the phone manufacturer\u2019s mission and backstory. The firm\u2019s origins date back to the hackers\u2019 movement and a long-running activist campaign around human rights abuses in the supply chains of large mobile phone manufacturers. <br><br>In 2013, the organisation switched focus, she explains: \u201cAt the beginning, our focus was on disclosing the influence of mobile phones on society and on your life, but we realised that, while we were raising awareness, we weren\u2019t offering solutions, which is why we decided to make our own ethical phone.\u201d <br><br>It is this singular purpose (\u201cdare to care\u201d is how Gouwens phrases it) that resonates so powerfully with Fairphone\u2019s female workforce, she argues: \u201cI think adding this angle to tech might well attract more women to Fairphone than to other tech companies.\u201d<br><br>The testimonials of Fairphone\u2019s website give credence to the claim. Finance manager Mariana da Costa credits her job to her sense that \u201cpositive changes are possible\u201d, while supply chain expert (and ex-human rights worker) Laura Gerritsen is cited as saying that the firm\u2019s ethical ambitions make her \u201chappy to work crazy hours\u201d.<br></p> <p>Evidence of the positive effects that an overt social mission can have on gender balance extends beyond just Fairphone. According to research by the British Council, women make up <a href=\"https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/social_enterprise_and_womens_empowerment_july.pdf\">66% of the workforce in UK social enterprises</a> and 65% in US ones, while making only 46% of the working population as a whole in both nations. <br><br>When it comes to women and tech, Gouwens\u2019 chief challenge focuses less on her workforce and more on consumers. At present, about two-thirds (65%) of Fairphone\u2019s retail customers are men \u2013 a disparity that bucks the trend for the firm\u2019s target market of \u201cconscious consumers\u201d, which, according to Gouwens, is \u201cquite balanced\u201d. <br><br>It\u2019s not entirely clear what the sticking point is here. One reason could be price. Women on average spend <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/samsung/2017/11/13/women-shop-for-tech-differently-than-men-do-and-why-that-matters/#139335c657a8\">10% less on consumer electronics</a> than men and so might feasibly be more averse to paying an ethical \u201cpremium\u201d for a Fairphone device (its newest device, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/18/fairphone-3-review-ethical-phone\">Fairphone 3</a>, costs \u00a3420, which is \u00a3200 more than a similar, non-ethical, smartphone).</p> <p>Gouwens is quick on the defence here. The overall cost of ownership of a Fairphone, she maintains, is \u201ccheaper than many comparable phones\u201d. How so? It\u2019s all to do with the \u201cmodular\u201d nature of the phone\u2019s design, apparently. Unlike standard mobile phones, Fairphones are easy to dismantle and update as new technology comes in. Fairphone also offers three years of software support and repairs \u2013 for free.</p> <p>Welcome as it is to fix your phone rather than fling it, having a device that you can dissemble also leaves it feeling a little chunky and over-complicated. A <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/1976/mobile-phone-purchasing-factors/\">Statista.com study</a> suggests that while men and women place similar importance on a phone\u2019s design, male consumers tend to be more interested in the phone\u2019s technical characteristics. <br><br>Language plays a vital role in resolving this hurdle, Gouwens insists. Tech engineers operate in a world of jargon, which, to the untrained ear, can make mobile technology feel inaccessible and off-putting, she says. Gouwens speaks from experience. In her early days at Fairphone, conversations with the firm\u2019s product engineers felt to her like \u201clistening to a different language\u201d. <br><br>She had the same sensation when she first disassembled her phone, admitting a sense of \u201cnervousness\u201d the initial time she tried. Those fears didn\u2019t last long. Indeed, today she lauds the ability to tinker with Fairphone\u2019s internal mechanics as one of the phone\u2019s prize assets, arguing that it provides people with a stellar introduction into the world of technology. <br><br>\u201cWe want people to open up the world behind our phones. That\u2019s why all our sets come with screwdrivers. I think it\u2019s especially important for young people, and girls in particular, who might think that technology is not really for them.\u201d <br><br>This minnow Dutch brand isn\u2019t about to dent the sales of the smartphone giants \u2013 Fairphone\u2019s first two models sold 175,000 units though the company hopes to ship 42,000 units of its latest phone by the end of the year \u2013 but Gouwens hopes they might see in Fairphone a model of doing tech differently, including with respect to gender. <br><br>She takes encouragement here from Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop, who, when challenged about being too small to have an impact, liked to retort: \u201cTry going to bed with a mosquito in the room.\u201d In the smartphone industry, Gouwens quips, \u201cFairphone <em>is</em> that mosquito.\u201d</p>",

Fairphone also offers three years of software support and repairs \u2013 for free. Welcome as it is to fix your phone rather than fling it, having a device that you can dissemble also leaves it feeling a little chunky and over-complicated. A Statista.com study suggests that while men and women place similar importance on a phone\u2019s design, male consumers tend to be more interested in the phone\u2019s technical characteristics. Language plays a vital role in resolving this hurdle, Gouwens insists. Tech engineers operate in a world of jargon, which, to the untrained ear, can make mobile technology feel inaccessible and off-putting, she says. Gouwens speaks from experience. In her early days at Fairphone, conversations with the firm\u2019s product engineers felt to her like \u201clistening to a different language\u201d. She had the same sensation when she first disassembled her phone, admitting a sense of \u201cnervousness\u201d the initial time she tried. Those fears didn\u2019t last long. Indeed, today she lauds the ability to tinker with Fairphone\u2019s internal mechanics as one of the phone\u2019s prize assets, arguing that it provides people with a stellar introduction into the world of technology. \u201cWe want people to open up the world behind our phones. That\u2019s why all our sets come with screwdrivers. I think it\u2019s especially important for young people, and girls in particular, who might think that technology is not really for them.\u201d This minnow Dutch brand isn\u2019t about to dent the sales of the smartphone giants \u2013 Fairphone\u2019s first two models sold 175,000 units though the company hopes to ship 42,000 units of its latest phone by the end of the year \u2013 but Gouwens hopes they might see in Fairphone a model of doing tech differently, including with respect to gender. She takes encouragement here from Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop, who, when challenged about being too small to have an impact, liked to retort: \u201cTry going to bed with a mosquito in the room.\u201d In the smartphone industry, Gouwens quips, \u201cFairphone is that mosquito.\u201d",

Preston finished seventh, two points off the play-offs in Alex Neil\u2019s first season in charge, and there is a belief that West Bromwich Albion\u2019s spring pursuit of their Scottish manager disrupted their rhythm at a key stage last season. Preston\u2019s recruitment, led by Neil and the former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, an adviser to the owner Trevor Hemmings, has been impressive. Neil and Ridsdale regularly attend matches together, and Ridsdale speaks daily to Hemmings, who lives on the Isle of Man.</p> <p>Preston are not parsimonious \u2013 they paid Barnsley and Coventry seven-figure fees for Brad Potts and Tom Bayliss respectively \u2013 but prudent. The onus is on finding value for money. Callum Robinson and Jordan Hugill, \u00a3170,000 and \u00a325,000 signings from Aston Villa and Port Vale respectively, were both sold for \u00a38m in the past two years, and the team that came from two goals down to beat Blackburn on Saturday included the Republic of Ireland midfielder Alan Browne, a \u00a315,000 signing from Cork City five years ago, and Daniel Johnson, a \u00a350,000 recruit from Aston Villa, as well as three free transfers: Darnell Fisher, Patrick Bauer and Paul Gallagher, who is in his fourth spell at the club.</p> <p>Preston recruit similarly to Bristol City and Brentford in scouring the lower leagues for young and hungry talent, as well as finding homes for those with limited opportunities at Premier League clubs, such as Ben Pearson, who has excelled since joining from Manchester United. They are proactive and have already identified next summer\u2019s transfer targets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Preston\u2019s wage bill is among the lowest in the division at around \u00a313m \u2013 a third of West Brom\u2019s last season</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Preston boast the best home record in the Championship \u2013 only Manchester City have won at Deepdale this season \u2013 and they are also the division\u2019s leading scorers. Tom Barkhuizen, for whom Preston paid Morecambe \u00a3150,000 compensation two years ago, has flourished, while Sean Maguire, Jayden Stockley and David Nugent, who returned to the club this summer, provide a variety of attacking options. Only Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ollie Watkins have scored more league goals this season than Johnson, who has relished playing as a No 10 and shares penalty duties with Gallagher, an evergreen performer.</p> <p>Last season Preston were bottom after 11 matches and playing catch-up but, before travelling to Charlton on Sunday, they are two points off leaders West Brom, whose \u00a38m outlay on Kenneth Zohore this summer highlights a financial disparity; Preston\u2019s wage bill is among the lowest in the division at around \u00a313m \u2013 a third of West Brom\u2019s last season.</p> <p>An eight-point blanket covers the top half and, in the absence of runaway leaders, plenty of teams will fancy their chances of promotion, or at least being in the mix in May. No team have suffered heartbreak in the play-offs more than Preston \u2013 failing nine times in 10 attempts \u2013 but that does not stop them from wanting to get there. Preston are one of five Championship clubs to have never played in the Premier League, but it feels as if they are getting closer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85f58bbce2892f408c0a35478aa546b35c365aaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85f58bbce2892f408c0a35478aa546b35c365aaa/0_334_5014_3008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Neil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is a belief that West Brom\u2019s spring pursuit of Alex Neil disrupted Preston at a key stage last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Oldham/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think the difference is as a group of players we understand what it\u2019s going to take to achieve something this year, ie to get into the top six or even get into the top two,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI think our squad is a lot stronger now. You obviously want to put on a performance but you can\u2019t always win the pretty way and we are well adapted to changing our style to dig out results. We have got everything in abundance as a team. We have been together for many years and we have been hanging around that top half for quite a while.</p> <p>\u201cIn our first season [back in the Championship following promotion in 2015], we finished in the top half, when a lot of people wrote us off to get relegated, but we stood strong because we know what we\u2019re capable of and we know the quality we\u2019ve got. Last season we went on an unbelievable unbeaten run and had a little blip at the end and the season before that we finished seventh. We\u2019ve been in and around it [the top six] for a very long time and now is our opportunity to go and grab it with both hands and cement our place in there. We\u2019ve been there quite a few times now and we\u2019ve had a little feeling of that \u2018it\u2019s really nice being in the top six\u2019, but we want to stay there at the end of the season and to be fighting for something.

      "bodyText": "In an era of wild spending, soft transfer embargoes and Championship clubs selling their stadiums before leasing them back to balance the books, a reminder that Preston North End\u2019s record outlay remains the \u00a31.5m plus add-ons they paid Manchester United to sign David Healy in 2001. Barnsley\u2019s biggest buy dates back even further, to 1997 when they signed Gjorgji Hristov, but in the past two years 14 second-tier teams have smashed their transfer record, with five doing so this summer. Splashing the cash is not Preston\u2019s style \u2013 their starting XI against Blackburn last weekend cost \u00a31.6m \u2013 and they deserve credit for doing things differently. It is a model that continues to serve them well; after 14 matches Preston are second in the table and hopeful of gatecrashing the top six after a couple of near misses. Preston finished seventh, two points off the play-offs in Alex Neil\u2019s first season in charge, and there is a belief that West Bromwich Albion\u2019s spring pursuit of their Scottish manager disrupted their rhythm at a key stage last season. Preston\u2019s recruitment, led by Neil and the former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, an adviser to the owner Trevor Hemmings, has been impressive. Neil and Ridsdale regularly attend matches together, and Ridsdale speaks daily to Hemmings, who lives on the Isle of Man. Preston are not parsimonious \u2013 they paid Barnsley and Coventry seven-figure fees for Brad Potts and Tom Bayliss respectively \u2013 but prudent. The onus is on finding value for money. Callum Robinson and Jordan Hugill, \u00a3170,000 and \u00a325,000 signings from Aston Villa and Port Vale respectively, were both sold for \u00a38m in the past two years, and the team that came from two goals down to beat Blackburn on Saturday included the Republic of Ireland midfielder Alan Browne, a \u00a315,000 signing from Cork City five years ago, and Daniel Johnson, a \u00a350,000 recruit from Aston Villa, as well as three free transfers: Darnell Fisher, Patrick Bauer and Paul Gallagher, who is in his fourth spell at the club. Preston recruit similarly to Bristol City and Brentford in scouring the lower leagues for young and hungry talent, as well as finding homes for those with limited opportunities at Premier League clubs, such as Ben Pearson, who has excelled since joining from Manchester United. They are proactive and have already identified next summer\u2019s transfer targets. Preston boast the best home record in the Championship \u2013 only Manchester City have won at Deepdale this season \u2013 and they are also the division\u2019s leading scorers. Tom Barkhuizen, for whom Preston paid Morecambe \u00a3150,000 compensation two years ago, has flourished, while Sean Maguire, Jayden Stockley and David Nugent, who returned to the club this summer, provide a variety of attacking options. Only Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ollie Watkins have scored more league goals this season than Johnson, who has relished playing as a No 10 and shares penalty duties with Gallagher, an evergreen performer. Last season Preston were bottom after 11 matches and playing catch-up but, before travelling to Charlton on Sunday, they are two points off leaders West Brom, whose \u00a38m outlay on Kenneth Zohore this summer highlights a financial disparity; Preston\u2019s wage bill is among the lowest in the division at around \u00a313m \u2013 a third of West Brom\u2019s last season. An eight-point blanket covers the top half and, in the absence of runaway leaders, plenty of teams will fancy their chances of promotion, or at least being in the mix in May. No team have suffered heartbreak in the play-offs more than Preston \u2013 failing nine times in 10 attempts \u2013 but that does not stop them from wanting to get there. Preston are one of five Championship clubs to have never played in the Premier League, but it feels as if they are getting closer. \u201cI think the difference is as a group of players we understand what it\u2019s going to take to achieve something this year, ie to get into the top six or even get into the top two,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI think our squad is a lot stronger now. You obviously want to put on a performance but you can\u2019t always win the pretty way and we are well adapted to changing our style to dig out results. We have got everything in abundance as a team. We have been together for many years and we have been hanging around that top half for quite a while. \u201cIn our first season [back in the Championship following promotion in 2015], we finished in the top half, when a lot of people wrote us off to get relegated, but we stood strong because we know what we\u2019re capable of and we know the quality we\u2019ve got. Last season we went on an unbelievable unbeaten run and had a little blip at the end and the season before that we finished seventh. We\u2019ve been in and around it [the top six] for a very long time and now is our opportunity to go and grab it with both hands and cement our place in there. We\u2019ve been there quite a few times now and we\u2019ve had a little feeling of that \u2018it\u2019s really nice being in the top six\u2019, but we want to stay there at the end of the season and to be fighting for something. This league is wide open.\u201d Talking points \u2022 With Jim Bentley stepping down after more than eight years in charge at Morecambe, the Wycombe manager, Gareth Ainsworth, has taken his mantle as the longest-serving manager in England\u2019s top four divisions at seven years and 35 days. After Ainsworth, the longest-serving managers are Eddie Howe, Sean Dyche, Mauricio Pochettino and Accrington Stanley\u2019s John Coleman. Kevin Ellison and Barry Roche have been placed in interim charge at Morecambe. Ainsworth, as well as guiding Wycombe to second in League One, has been busy making an early play for the Christmas No 1 with his band, the Cold Blooded Hearts, recording a cover of Dion\u2019s The Wanderer, which will be released as a B-side and is on the matchday playlist at Adams Park. \u2022 Stoke\u2019s woes have perhaps taken some of the heat off Jonathan Woodgate at Middlesbrough but pressure is building on the former defender, who has won two of his opening 15 games as a manager. Boro are the lowest scorers in the division, with 11 goals from 14 matches, and last Saturday they mustered one shot on target in a 0-0 draw against a Fulham side reduced to 10 men after 17 minutes. They travel to Derby on Saturday hoping to end a seven-match winless run. \u2022 Sol Campbell worked miracles at Macclesfield and, if Southend are to get out of trouble in League One, he will need to do so again. They have lost 12 of their 15 matches and are nine points from safety. The size of the task is not lost on Campbell, who takes his side to Sunderland on Saturday before a trip to Portsmouth. \u201cI\u2019ve got to overachieve, the players have got to overachieve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot waste a second.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last week we included a few examples of stadiums with open ends or buildings where terracing should be. You sent us so many great examples we decided to showcase them \u2026 \u201cYou just have to look at the 6,000-capacity Estadio Ol\u00edmpico in Uruguay\u2019s first division,\u201d cheers Guillermo Sienra. \u201cHome to Rampla Juniors F\u00fatbol Club, it has an unbeatable view!\u201d \u201cRed Star FC in Paris has only three stands, with only one in use. Behind one of the goals, there is an apartment building,\u201d writes Joseph Chapman. \u201cI live just over the border from Gibraltar, and Victoria Stadium, home to all the league teams and Gibraltar national team, has no stands at either end,\u201d points out Tom Thronicker. \u201cOne looks towards a bunch of flats and is loomed over by The Rock, while the other looks out on the Gibraltar International Airport runway. Planes landing and taking off are quite the distraction for unaware visiting teams, which leads to another question: is there any level of stadium located closer to an international airport?\u201d \u201cMansfield Town\u2019s Field Mill (currently called the One Call Stadium) is a three-sider in the sense that one of its touchline stands has been boarded up for 15 years after being condemned,\u201d mails Mike Pollitt. \u201cIt\u2019s covered in advertising hoardings and was last used in May 2004. It\u2019s an odd sight as the rest of the ground is otherwise quite decent. Thinking about the ground\u2019s history has made me think of another question: when it was redeveloped in 2000, the ends that traditionally housed the hardcore support and away fans were reversed. Has this happened elsewhere?\u201d \u201cI\u2018m surprised there\u2019s been no mention of the Estadio Municipal de Braga,\u201d writes a surprised Michael Holmes. \u201cIt has no stands at either end, with one being the rock wall of a former quarry. However, the stadium has won the Pritzker prize for architecture. \u201cWhile on the subject of Portugal, in August I went to see Belenenses v Boavista at the Estadio Nacional in Lisbon, which has stands round one side and both ends ... but a big gap on the east side.\u201d \u201cYou seem to have missed the end apparently graced by the longest bar at a ground in the world, Avaya Stadium, home of the San Jose Earthquakes,\u201d offers Colin Richardson, who took this picture \u2026 \u201cSheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane used to be open at one end (until 1973),\u201d offers Guy Cudmore. \u201cIt started as a cricket ground. Bramall Lane is one of only two English grounds which have hosted an FA Cup final, an England football international and a Test match (the other is The Oval). Bolton\u2019s Burnden Park had a Normid superstore covering half of one end until the club moved to their new stadium in Horwich 1997. \u201cNo discussion of three-sided grounds can be complete without mentioning the County Ground in Northampton,\u201d pipes up Stewart Robinson. \u201cUntil 1994 it was shared between Northampton Town and Northamptonshire County Cricket Club, with the two pitches alongside one another. Football spectators in the Abingdon Avenue stand had an unimpeded view across to the cricket pavilion, nearly 200 metres away.\u201d And Andre Leme Lopes writes: \u201cLaranjeiras Stadium of Fluminense Football Club was built to host the 1919 South American Championship. It originally had a full set of stands but, in 1961, renovation work in an adjacent street caused the demolition of one stand (and the capacity dropped from 25,000 to mere 8,000). It hasn\u2019t been used for First Division matches since 2003. Nowadays, the only Brazilian First Division stadium with an open end is Independ\u00eancia Arena.\u201d What an open end it is, though. The worst points total for miles travelled in a league fixture \u201cHas any side got a worse points/distance ratio than Carlisle to Plymouth?\u201d asks Richard van der Wilshuizen. \u201cOne point in the last 10,000 miles seems about as poor a ratio as you can get in the UK.\u201d We\u2019re pretty sure Carlisle own that unwanted record for league games in the UK Richard but, globally, we can\u2019t imagine any team has travelled further than Luch-Energiya Vladivostok for so little reward. Here\u2019s Russel Yong: \u201cFrom 2006 to 2008, Luch-Energiya Vladivostok were members of the Russian Premier League for the first and only time in their history. Being from the eastern extremity of Russia meant some epic long-distance travelling; their closest rivals were Siberian team Tom Tomsk, \u2018only\u2019 3,465 miles from Vladivostok, while Spartak Nalchik\u2019s home ground was an eye-watering 6,048 miles away. \u201cLuch were famously decent at home and abysmal travellers, which made for some pretty poor away records, such as 0-0-3 (W-D-L) from three games v Zenit St Petersburg (5,984 miles), or 0 points for 35,904 miles travelled; 0-1-1 from two games v FC Rostov (5,901 miles), one point for 23,604 miles travelled; and 0-0-3 v CSKA Moscow (5,697 miles), 0 points for 34,182 miles travelled. \u201cIn 16 away games against the six Moscow teams (CSKA, Dynamo, FC Moscow, Lokomotiv, Spartak and Torpedo), Luch gained only three points, all from draws. If you calculate it based on the driving distance to/from each team\u2019s home ground and Luch\u2019s Dynamo Stadium (and given some fans didn\u2019t think driving distance was an impediment, I don\u2019t see why not), Luch travelled a staggering 182,052 miles to and from Moscow, 60,684 miles per point, the equivalent of going almost two and a half times around the Equator to get a draw, and going over three-quarters the distance to the Moon to snag a win.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cI seem to remember that Darren Anderton left a game, not due to injury, but because he lost a contact lens\u201d wrote Chris Stanley in 2009. \u201cHave any other players suffered a similar fate?\u201d There are a few such examples. Perhaps the most famous was during the World Cup qualifier between Wales and Scotland in 1985, the match which tragically ended with the death of Jock Stein. As Wales mounted a series of attacks Jim Leighton, the Scotland goalkeeper, flapped at crosses, dropped shots and looked generally confused. His teammates were convinced he was concussed but in fact he wore contact lenses \u2013 a fact he had kept to himself for seven years \u2013 and one of them had been lost in the Ninian Park mud. He confessed the truth to Stein at half-time and was promptly replaced by Alan Rough. \u2022 For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here. Can you help? \u201cVit\u00f3ria FC are 14th in the Portuguese league, with eight points from eight games,\u201d notes David Valente. However, they have only scored once. What are the most points procured in a spell from the fewest goals scored?\u201d \u201cPort Vale signed Will Atkinson on loan in 2007,\u201d begins Rob Fielding. \u201cThis season he has returned on a short-term contract.

There have been strikes and player protests before but these have often revolved around the conditions and pay of the national team. In 2017 Republic of Ireland players threatened action after going public on having to change in airport toilets and sharing tracksuits. The same year Denmark players forfeited a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands while in a pay dispute with their football association \u2013 a decision which ultimately cost them a place in France after they finished second in the group and went into tough play-offs for the final European place. Members of the Nigeria national team held a sit-in at their hotel after this year\u2019s World Cup exit to demand outstanding expenses be paid \u2013 they did the same after winning the Afcon in 2004 and again in Cameroon in 2016.

There are two of them displayed, part of a collection of more than 300 stored elsewhere. There\u2019s a man\u2019s face and a woman\u2019s head and shoulders, inked on to what at first looks like vellum, with deckle edges like an old book. It is, of course, vellum of a kind: medieval books were written on split, stretched animal skins, and this is human leather. Like many of the objects collected by Henry Wellcome, the provenance of the tattoos is vague. They were bought in Paris in the 1930s from another collector, and probably removed from bodies in the late 19th century, probably in France.</p> <p>Human remains without provenance are worrying to curators. They can\u2019t be returned to anyone, reincorporated into the culture or community from which they came. It\u2019s hard to display them with dignity and compassion when there\u2019s no story to tell, no history to offer context or connection. The tattoos appealed to me as a subject because research for my last novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/ghost-wall-sarah-moss-review\" title=\"\">Ghost Wall</a></em>, left me thinking uneasily about skin and leather, marking and preservation, and less nobly because like many of my fortysomething friends, I\u2019d started to wonder if maybe I might like to get a tattoo myself. But when I first saw the two faces, I didn\u2019t think abstractly about the fragile barrier between inside and outside the human body, the container of the self, but about individual bodies. There were the skins of two people, and also the work of two tattooists, and the faces of the subjects of the tattoos; the woman with her complex hairdo, above, and the man in the matelot top. And the work of the people who removed the skin from the bodies and pinned it out and preserved it, and the hands of the dealer who bought it for Henry Wellcome, though probably not the attention of the man himself who, like many Victorian collectors, was more interested in owning than seeing or handling objects of interest. I kept asking the museum\u2019s curator: who were they? Why are they here? Where are all the others? What are you going to do with them?</p> <p>He answered as best he could, and referred me to some excellent research, but the individual stories are long lost. The tattoos are bits of people drifting in time, present among us at least a century after the rest of the bodies, and the bodies of the subjects and tattooists, turned to dust. They are cut off from their stories, and so the writer\u2019s work is to make new ones for them.</p> <p><strong>\u2018The more you contemplate the chastity belt the less sense it makes\u2019</strong><br><em>Imogen Hermes Gow</em><em>ar</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"52f6f1d2ba7e5047a264d3693797fa1885bf00d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52f6f1d2ba7e5047a264d3693797fa1885bf00d1/0_27_800_852/469.jpg\" alt=\"Iron chastity belt Wellcome Collection\" width=\"469\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Years ago as a gallery warder at the British Museum I would often choose an object as I patrolled, and extemporise a brief story from it.

      "body": "<p>Labour must avoid taking sides in the Brexit \u201cculture war\u201d if Jeremy Corbyn is to win the upcoming general election, one of his key advisers has warned.</p> <p>Andrew Murray is the chief of staff of the Unite union and worked closely with Corbyn in the Stop the War coalition. He has been seconded to the Labour leader\u2019s office part-time and is closely involved in conversations about a series of issues, including Brexit.</p> <p>In a rare interview, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/downing-street-signals-compromise-on-potential-general-election-date\">a general election looming after </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/downing-street-signals-compromise-on-potential-general-election-date\">Corbyn declared on Tuesday that Labour\u2019s conditions for an early vote had been met</a>, he warned that the campaign to stop Brexit had increasingly become a form of identity politics, with remainers and leavers pitted against each other.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s had aspects of it from the beginning, and now the culture war aspect of it is very, very powerful,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf Labour becomes one side of the culture war \u2013 the side that is, stereotyping, the liberal side \u2013 that would be very damaging to the present project, and would have no basis in social justice.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Brexit policy has shifted over the past 12 months. The party now advocates negotiating a softer deal within three months of coming to power \u2013 and then putting it to the public in a referendum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/nick-brown-joins-senior-labour-figures-vowing-back-remain\">Many Labour members and MPs</a>, not least the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, would like their party to go further, and embrace an all-out remain position. But Murray insisted that that would be a mistake.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the Labour party membership is remain, with varying degrees of intensity. About two-thirds of the 2017 Labour vote was remain. But that vote, as I keep reminding people, isn\u2019t big enough. The Labour vote as it stands needs to be larger \u2013 you have got to think about people who aren\u2019t voting Labour that voted leave.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cTo go from speculation to fact, we actually lost six seats at the last general election. Only six, but had we held them, Theresa May\u2019s deal with the DUP may not have stacked up. And they were all the leave-voting areas.\u201d</p> <p>Those six lost seats included Mansfield, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Stoke-on-Trent South, while in many remain seats, such as Norwich South and Bristol West, Labour MPs saw their majorities increase significantly in 2017.</p> <p>Murray voted leave himself, he admits \u2013 and was disappointed that progressive voices were absent from the Brexit campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI personally voted leave, but the leave campaign unfortunately gives no warrant for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/06/labour-left-lexit-dead-members-leftwing-brexit\">Lexit</a> position, because it was dominated by this alliance of xenophobic nationalists and Thatcherite utopians. And they set the tone.\u201d</p> <p>Together with his old friend the senior Corbyn aide Seumas Milne, the recently sidelined chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, Murray is part of a group branded the \u201cfour Ms\u201d, regarded by remain campaigners as a block on Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a referendum.</p> <p>Asked if he thinks of himself as part of a shadowy cabal manipulating the Labour leader, Murray said: \u201cI think \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m not maligning him \u2013 that was an invention of Alastair Campbell, because he\u2019s still got the old magic.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t take that seriously. For one thing, none of the four Ms are elected politicians, and in the end it\u2019s elected politicians who are going to decide these things. And Jeremy has advisers who don\u2019t begin with M who have as much influence as those that do.\u201d</p> <p>But he is unrepentant about the influence of his union. \u201cUnite has influence, and it should have influence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Labour\u2019s biggest affiliate, and it has been rock solid in supporting JC from the very beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Murray has just published a book, The Fall and Rise of the British Left, placing Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour in a historic context.</p> <p>His influence alarms many centrist Labour MPs. Murray \u2013 a longtime member of the Communist party, who has in the past expressed <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20031210230502/http:/www.communist-party.org.uk/articles/2003/march/10-03-03.shtml\">solidarity with North Korea</a> and praised aspects of Stalin\u2019s legacy \u2013 only joined Labour in 2016.</p> <p>Some also balk at the juxtaposition between his comfortable background (his grandfather was the governor of Madras, and he attended a minor public school) and the class struggle he espouses.</p> <p>But he insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour in a general election \u2013 never voted anything else. My joining Labour was largely motivated by the wishes of my union: that as its chief of staff I be in a place to help advance its political strategy, which requires being a member of the Labour party. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election removed any remaining doubts.\u201d</p> <p>He has some reservations, however, about some of the radical policies bubbling up from Labour\u2019s grassroots. Plans passed at the party\u2019s conference last month included \u201cintegrating\u201d public schools into the state system (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/09/abolish-eton-labour-groups-aim-to-strip-elite-private-schools-of-privileges\">under the slogan #AbolishEton</a>), and implementing eye-wateringly ambitious <a href=\"https://www.labourgnd.uk/agreed-conference-motion\">carbon reduction targets</a>.</p> <p>Murray sees little need for policy to \u201crush far ahead\u201d of the 2017 manifesto.</p> <p>Even once passed by the party\u2019s conference, policy motions are only included in the manifesto if agreed at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes members of the national executive committee, the shadow cabinet and representatives of the trade unions.</p> <p>\u201cI think the 2017 manifesto \u2013 which I had no direct part in writing \u2013 was extremely well-judged and successful. And I\u2019d imagine when the clause V meeting convenes, that politicians and others there would want to look at good reasons why you would be doing something very different,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At Labour\u2019s annual conference \u2013 which Murray missed, because he was recovering from heart surgery \u2013 the chat in the bars and cafes was about who could replace Corbyn if, as even some of his staunchest supporters fear, Labour loses another general election.</p> <p>But he is convinced that such an outcome would not mean a return to the politics of New Labour. \u201cCorbynism\u2019s critics haven\u2019t really articulated an attractive alternative. And I think politics as usual \u2013 or politics as was usual from the mid-1980s until 2008, or maybe a bit later, because politics takes a while to catch up with economics \u2013 is not coming back anywhere in the world that I can see. And the main question is whether it\u2019s going to be a nasty authoritarian right wing that benefits, or radical progressive movements like the Labour party has become.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour must avoid taking sides in the Brexit \u201cculture war\u201d if Jeremy Corbyn is to win the upcoming general election, one of his key advisers has warned. Andrew Murray is the chief of staff of the Unite union and worked closely with Corbyn in the Stop the War coalition. He has been seconded to the Labour leader\u2019s office part-time and is closely involved in conversations about a series of issues, including Brexit. In a rare interview, with a general election looming after Corbyn declared on Tuesday that Labour\u2019s conditions for an early vote had been met, he warned that the campaign to stop Brexit had increasingly become a form of identity politics, with remainers and leavers pitted against each other. \u201cIt\u2019s had aspects of it from the beginning, and now the culture war aspect of it is very, very powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Labour becomes one side of the culture war \u2013 the side that is, stereotyping, the liberal side \u2013 that would be very damaging to the present project, and would have no basis in social justice.\u201d Labour\u2019s Brexit policy has shifted over the past 12 months. The party now advocates negotiating a softer deal within three months of coming to power \u2013 and then putting it to the public in a referendum. Many Labour members and MPs, not least the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, would like their party to go further, and embrace an all-out remain position. But Murray insisted that that would be a mistake. \u201cMost of the Labour party membership is remain, with varying degrees of intensity. About two-thirds of the 2017 Labour vote was remain. But that vote, as I keep reminding people, isn\u2019t big enough. The Labour vote as it stands needs to be larger \u2013 you have got to think about people who aren\u2019t voting Labour that voted leave.\u201d He added: \u201cTo go from speculation to fact, we actually lost six seats at the last general election. Only six, but had we held them, Theresa May\u2019s deal with the DUP may not have stacked up. And they were all the leave-voting areas.\u201d Those six lost seats included Mansfield, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Stoke-on-Trent South, while in many remain seats, such as Norwich South and Bristol West, Labour MPs saw their majorities increase significantly in 2017. Murray voted leave himself, he admits \u2013 and was disappointed that progressive voices were absent from the Brexit campaign. \u201cI personally voted leave, but the leave campaign unfortunately gives no warrant for a Lexit position, because it was dominated by this alliance of xenophobic nationalists and Thatcherite utopians. And they set the tone.\u201d Together with his old friend the senior Corbyn aide Seumas Milne, the recently sidelined chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, Murray is part of a group branded the \u201cfour Ms\u201d, regarded by remain campaigners as a block on Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a referendum. Asked if he thinks of himself as part of a shadowy cabal manipulating the Labour leader, Murray said: \u201cI think \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m not maligning him \u2013 that was an invention of Alastair Campbell, because he\u2019s still got the old magic.\u201d He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t take that seriously. For one thing, none of the four Ms are elected politicians, and in the end it\u2019s elected politicians who are going to decide these things. And Jeremy has advisers who don\u2019t begin with M who have as much influence as those that do.\u201d But he is unrepentant about the influence of his union. \u201cUnite has influence, and it should have influence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Labour\u2019s biggest affiliate, and it has been rock solid in supporting JC from the very beginning.\u201d Murray has just published a book, The Fall and Rise of the British Left, placing Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour in a historic context. His influence alarms many centrist Labour MPs. Murray \u2013 a longtime member of the Communist party, who has in the past expressed solidarity with North Korea and praised aspects of Stalin\u2019s legacy \u2013 only joined Labour in 2016. Some also balk at the juxtaposition between his comfortable background (his grandfather was the governor of Madras, and he attended a minor public school) and the class struggle he espouses. But he insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour in a general election \u2013 never voted anything else. My joining Labour was largely motivated by the wishes of my union: that as its chief of staff I be in a place to help advance its political strategy, which requires being a member of the Labour party. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election removed any remaining doubts.\u201d He has some reservations, however, about some of the radical policies bubbling up from Labour\u2019s grassroots. Plans passed at the party\u2019s conference last month included \u201cintegrating\u201d public schools into the state system (under the slogan #AbolishEton), and implementing eye-wateringly ambitious carbon reduction targets. Murray sees little need for policy to \u201crush far ahead\u201d of the 2017 manifesto. Even once passed by the party\u2019s conference, policy motions are only included in the manifesto if agreed at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes members of the national executive committee, the shadow cabinet and representatives of the trade unions. \u201cI think the 2017 manifesto \u2013 which I had no direct part in writing \u2013 was extremely well-judged and successful. And I\u2019d imagine when the clause V meeting convenes, that politicians and others there would want to look at good reasons why you would be doing something very different,\u201d he said. At Labour\u2019s annual conference \u2013 which Murray missed, because he was recovering from heart surgery \u2013 the chat in the bars and cafes was about who could replace Corbyn if, as even some of his staunchest supporters fear, Labour loses another general election. But he is convinced that such an outcome would not mean a return to the politics of New Labour. \u201cCorbynism\u2019s critics haven\u2019t really articulated an attractive alternative. And I think politics as usual \u2013 or politics as was usual from the mid-1980s until 2008, or maybe a bit later, because politics takes a while to catch up with economics \u2013 is not coming back anywhere in the world that I can see. And the main question is whether it\u2019s going to be a nasty authoritarian right wing that benefits, or radical progressive movements like the Labour party has become.\u201d",

The British team, though, are spread between a much wider range of stables, with no fewer than 13 trainers sending horses to Los Angeles, most of whom have a single runner.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/29/talking-horses-documentary-reveals-drama-behind-khadijah-mellahs-win\">Talking Horses: documentary reveals drama behind Khadijah Mellah's win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Charlie Appleby\u2019s challenge at the meeting was reduced from two to one in desperate circumstances on Saturday when Line Of Duty, who took the Juvenile Turf last year and was due to contest the Mile on Saturday, suffered a fatal injury on the gallops. Appleby will now rely on Old Persian, a leading contender for the Turf, as he attempts to improve an already remarkable strike rate at the Breeders\u2019 Cup, where he has had three winners and a second from six starters.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was six years ago that we were here with Outstrip, bless him,\u201d Appleby said on Tuesday, looking back to his first Breeders\u2019 Cup runner, and winner, in the 2013 Juvenile Turf. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here but it\u2019s not a holiday, as much as it\u2019s lovely to have the [mountainous] backdrop we see out there. We try to bring the right horses out, with the experience we\u2019ve had through the years.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was always looking [for a juvenile to run] but didn\u2019t want to put one on the wagon just to have a spin around. The great thing about a horse like him [Old Persian] is that shipping is second nature to him. He went to Dubai, he went to Canada [to win the Grade One Northern Dancer Stakes at Woodbine last time] and he\u2019s shipped well here.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis race was our target from Dubai [in March, where he won the Group One Sheema Classic]. I was confident he\u2019d take all the beating [in Canada], he was the class horse in the race and he showed it. We wanted to keep the dream alive and we were always going to come straight here.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes going into these big races, you look at the challenge and don\u2019t know with some horses how they\u2019re going to adapt. But for me he ticks a good few boxes, going into it: quick ground won\u2019t worry him, the tight turns, the travelling, the day-to-day work going into the race, he\u2019s unfazed by it all.\u201dOld Persian, currently top-priced at 7-2, is one of three horses that dominate the betting for the Turf, with Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner at Epsom in June, the narrow favourite at 9-4 and US-trained Bricks And Mortar available at 9-2.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/28/magical-retired-out-of-breeders-cup-blow-aidan-o-brien-horse-racing\">Magical\u2019s last-minute departure from the weekend\u2019s cast list</a> means that European horses head the market for four races: the Turf, the Juvenile Turf (Arizona), the Mile (Circus Maximus), and the Juveniles Fillies Turf, where Albigna and Daahyeh, trained by Jessica Harrington and Roger Varian respectively, are locked together at 7-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>O\u2019Brien\u2019s two entries for the Turf Sprint \u2013 So Perfect and Fairyland - were withdrawn on Monday leaving it as the only turf event without a runner from Europe, despite it seemingly being an obvious one for European turf sprinters to target.</p> \n<p>And the dirt events too are, once again, effectively being left to the Americans.

      "bodyText": "The Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting at Santa Anita lost three of its European team members on Monday \u2013 including Magical, the Champion Stakes winner \u2013 but there is still likely to be a total of 33 runners from the continent\u2019s stables in California on Friday and Saturday, on a par with recent years and including representatives in all but one of the seven turf events. All but three of those are from Britain and Ireland, with two generations of the O\u2019Brien racing dynasty \u2013 Aidan and his son Joseph \u2013 accounting for the bulk of Irish runners. The British team, though, are spread between a much wider range of stables, with no fewer than 13 trainers sending horses to Los Angeles, most of whom have a single runner. Charlie Appleby\u2019s challenge at the meeting was reduced from two to one in desperate circumstances on Saturday when Line Of Duty, who took the Juvenile Turf last year and was due to contest the Mile on Saturday, suffered a fatal injury on the gallops. Appleby will now rely on Old Persian, a leading contender for the Turf, as he attempts to improve an already remarkable strike rate at the Breeders\u2019 Cup, where he has had three winners and a second from six starters. \u201cIt was six years ago that we were here with Outstrip, bless him,\u201d Appleby said on Tuesday, looking back to his first Breeders\u2019 Cup runner, and winner, in the 2013 Juvenile Turf. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here but it\u2019s not a holiday, as much as it\u2019s lovely to have the [mountainous] backdrop we see out there. We try to bring the right horses out, with the experience we\u2019ve had through the years. \u201cI was always looking [for a juvenile to run] but didn\u2019t want to put one on the wagon just to have a spin around. The great thing about a horse like him [Old Persian] is that shipping is second nature to him. He went to Dubai, he went to Canada [to win the Grade One Northern Dancer Stakes at Woodbine last time] and he\u2019s shipped well here. \u201cThis race was our target from Dubai [in March, where he won the Group One Sheema Classic]. I was confident he\u2019d take all the beating [in Canada], he was the class horse in the race and he showed it. We wanted to keep the dream alive and we were always going to come straight here. \u201cSometimes going into these big races, you look at the challenge and don\u2019t know with some horses how they\u2019re going to adapt. But for me he ticks a good few boxes, going into it: quick ground won\u2019t worry him, the tight turns, the travelling, the day-to-day work going into the race, he\u2019s unfazed by it all.\u201dOld Persian, currently top-priced at 7-2, is one of three horses that dominate the betting for the Turf, with Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner at Epsom in June, the narrow favourite at 9-4 and US-trained Bricks And Mortar available at 9-2. Magical\u2019s last-minute departure from the weekend\u2019s cast list means that European horses head the market for four races: the Turf, the Juvenile Turf (Arizona), the Mile (Circus Maximus), and the Juveniles Fillies Turf, where Albigna and Daahyeh, trained by Jessica Harrington and Roger Varian respectively, are locked together at 7-2. O\u2019Brien\u2019s two entries for the Turf Sprint \u2013 So Perfect and Fairyland - were withdrawn on Monday leaving it as the only turf event without a runner from Europe, despite it seemingly being an obvious one for European turf sprinters to target. And the dirt events too are, once again, effectively being left to the Americans. Jane Chapple-Hyam is the only European trainer with a runner on the dirt, as Ambassadorial, who finished third in a race in Seoul in early September, has made it into the Dirt Mile with Jamie Spencer booked to ride. Wednesday\u2019s best bets Nursery handicaps can be a capricious betting at the best of times and heavy going does not make life any easier for punters, but if there is an obvious bet to be had it is probably the hat-trick-seeking Ainsdale (1.50) in the valuable nursery at Nottingham. Karl Burke\u2019s runner was available at 11-8 overnight and that looks a very fair price for a horse with winning form on heavy ground and just four rivals to beat. He is up another 8lb for his second success of the month but has shown improved form on both occasions and finished two-and-a-half lengths clear on his most recent start despite being eased in the closing stages. Goshen (2.50) is also going for a third win on the bounce and is worth a close look. His juvenile form was uninspiring but stepping up in trip has brought significant improvement on both starts this term and his nine length success at Sandown last time out was backed up by a strong time. Nathans Pride (3.10), who returns at Fakenham, showed hints of a return to form last time and has also dropped 10lb in the weights since the start of the year, while Pointed And Sharp (3.00) has a big chance on the card at Taunton. Casa Comigo (7.10), who had plenty to spare when winning his third handicap in a row at Kempton earlier this month, looks best at Kempton.",

They had turned heads with a $325,000 donation to a Trump-aligned political action committee in May 2018, facilitating access to the White House and the US president\u2019s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago.</p> <p>They also paid Giuiliani $500,000, the former New York mayor has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-giuliani-excl/exclusive-trump-lawyer-giuliani-was-paid-500000-to-consult-on-indicted-associates-firm-idUSKBN1WU07Z\">said</a>, and accompanied him to high-profile events such as the state funeral of George Bush, the former US president, in December.</p> <p>Fruman, 53, had the better connections in Ukraine. Since the 1990s, he had run a luxury goods business in Odessa, the Black Sea port city, that provided everything from Jaguar automobiles to exotic food products to Ukraine\u2019s jet set, and he also owned stakes in hotels and Kyiv clubs including Buddha Bar.</p> <p>But business could be unpredictable: SEC records show that Fruman\u2019s company, Fd Import &amp; Export Corp, sued in 2001 for nearly $1m in damages when a shipment of bananas from Ecuador to Ukraine was shown to be diseased and \u201cfraudulently and intentionally\u201d mislabeled as Bonita bananas.</p> <p>By 2016 \u2013 even before a difficult divorce settlement with his ex-wife \u2013 Fruman was seen as desperate.</p> <p>\u201cHe was just a bankrupt guy, a crook I would say, who was looking for some fortune and opportunities,\u201d said David Sakvarelidze, a former Ukrainian regional prosecutor who met Fruman after he was assigned to work in Odessa in 2015. \u201cHe had big financial troubles and I was told he basically already was living in the United States at that time, in Miami. He was looking for some opportunities to settle his financial problems. Maybe he could use his connections to Giuliani\u2019s team to settle his financial troubles, that\u2019s my presumption.\u201d</p> <p>Fruman and Parnas appeared to do just that, attempting to persuade the Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky to set up a meeting with Zelenskiy, the new president, and also pitching a scheme to replace the head of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state oil and gas company, with an executive who could direct business their way.</p> <p>Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, later made similar efforts, lobbying the Ukrainian government to make changes to Naftogaz\u2019s board of directors, the Associated Press reported.</p> <p>Fruman also had become a major player in Kyiv\u2019s Jewish community, employing Giuliani\u2019s public profile to help fundraise for one of Ukraine\u2019s top rabbis, Moshe Reuven Azman.</p> <p>At a celebration for the 120th anniversary of the founding of Kyiv\u2019s Brodsky synagogue, Fruman pledged to raise more than $1m for orphans at a village established by Azman for Jewish refugees from the war in east Ukraine. And in an interview with an Israeli journalist, Fruman claimed to have delivered a handwritten note from Azman to Trump. Azman declined repeated requests for interviews.</p> <p>Also present at the synagogue was Rabinovich, the Ukrainian businessman, who donated the memorial in Kyiv to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York bearing the words \u201cthou shalt not kill\u201d. Through his library foundation, Rabinovich claimed Giuliani had not been paid and said he had not seen Giuliani since the visit.</p> <p>But the 2003 visit heralded a decade of consulting and publicity trips to Ukraine for Giuliani, who has traded on his US political connections and his reputation as the mayor who steered New York through the Trade Centre attack to collect a small fortune in lucrative speaking fees and security contracts in the ex-Soviet state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/trump-ukraine-scandal-zelenskiy-biden-hunter\">Trump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2008, he consulted the former heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko during his campaign to become the mayor of Kyiv.

The following account is based on interviews with associates of Giuliani and his business partners in Ukraine, prosecutors familiar with his attempts to gather information about the Bidens, and officials and politicians concerned about the flamboyant former mayor. The Guardian\u2019s reporting shows that Giuliani boasted of his ties to Trump to gain access to high-ranking prosecutors and officials while his associates used the Giuliani name to bolster their reputations and legitimise dubious business ventures. \u201cHe announced that he was a lawyer for the president of the United States, that he was working for Donald Trump, there was nothing to hide,\u201d said Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian embassy official who met with Giuliani in the US over burgers and cigars.

A law enforcement source has told the Guardian that Lutsenko exaggerated claims to Giuliani, including the \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list, in order to curry political favour to help him keep his job.

They had turned heads with a $325,000 donation to a Trump-aligned political action committee in May 2018, facilitating access to the White House and the US president\u2019s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago. They also paid Giuiliani $500,000, the former New York mayor has said, and accompanied him to high-profile events such as the state funeral of George Bush, the former US president, in December. Fruman, 53, had the better connections in Ukraine. Since the 1990s, he had run a luxury goods business in Odessa, the Black Sea port city, that provided everything from Jaguar automobiles to exotic food products to Ukraine\u2019s jet set, and he also owned stakes in hotels and Kyiv clubs including Buddha Bar. But business could be unpredictable: SEC records show that Fruman\u2019s company, Fd Import &amp; Export Corp, sued in 2001 for nearly $1m in damages when a shipment of bananas from Ecuador to Ukraine was shown to be diseased and \u201cfraudulently and intentionally\u201d mislabeled as Bonita bananas. By 2016 \u2013 even before a difficult divorce settlement with his ex-wife \u2013 Fruman was seen as desperate. \u201cHe was just a bankrupt guy, a crook I would say, who was looking for some fortune and opportunities,\u201d said David Sakvarelidze, a former Ukrainian regional prosecutor who met Fruman after he was assigned to work in Odessa in 2015. \u201cHe had big financial troubles and I was told he basically already was living in the United States at that time, in Miami. He was looking for some opportunities to settle his financial problems. Maybe he could use his connections to Giuliani\u2019s team to settle his financial troubles, that\u2019s my presumption.\u201d Fruman and Parnas appeared to do just that, attempting to persuade the Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky to set up a meeting with Zelenskiy, the new president, and also pitching a scheme to replace the head of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state oil and gas company, with an executive who could direct business their way. Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, later made similar efforts, lobbying the Ukrainian government to make changes to Naftogaz\u2019s board of directors, the Associated Press reported. Fruman also had become a major player in Kyiv\u2019s Jewish community, employing Giuliani\u2019s public profile to help fundraise for one of Ukraine\u2019s top rabbis, Moshe Reuven Azman. At a celebration for the 120th anniversary of the founding of Kyiv\u2019s Brodsky synagogue, Fruman pledged to raise more than $1m for orphans at a village established by Azman for Jewish refugees from the war in east Ukraine. And in an interview with an Israeli journalist, Fruman claimed to have delivered a handwritten note from Azman to Trump. Azman declined repeated requests for interviews. Also present at the synagogue was Rabinovich, the Ukrainian businessman, who donated the memorial in Kyiv to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York bearing the words \u201cthou shalt not kill\u201d. Through his library foundation, Rabinovich claimed Giuliani had not been paid and said he had not seen Giuliani since the visit. But the 2003 visit heralded a decade of consulting and publicity trips to Ukraine for Giuliani, who has traded on his US political connections and his reputation as the mayor who steered New York through the Trade Centre attack to collect a small fortune in lucrative speaking fees and security contracts in the ex-Soviet state. In 2008, he consulted the former heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko during his campaign to become the mayor of Kyiv. In 2017, he spoke at a conference organised by Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian metals magnate who had previously donated $150,000 to Trump\u2019s charitable foundation, attracting scrutiny from the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller. His security firm was also hired by Pavel Fuks, a wealthy businessman from Kharkiv, in 2017 to consult the city on its emergency services and foreign investment. While the value of the contracts have not been made public, a person with knowledge of Giuliani\u2019s business dealings said their total value was well above $1m. For many Ukrainians, Giuliani was seen as a bridge into exclusive political and decision-making circles that could review US policy toward Ukraine. \u201cGiuliani was not searching for us, we were searching for him,\u201d Telizhenko, the former Ukrainian embassy employee, said of how Ukrainians concerned about political pressure in the country sought out Giuliani. Giuliani \u201cknew the names, who was connected to who. He\u2019s the filter in all this situation ... He might be the top expert on Ukraine in the United States\u201d.",

To put it bluntly, they\u2019re exaggerating collisions and falling down when they wouldn\u2019t normally have to. So when are they flopping? We felt we could address that from a rigorous scientific framework.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Everybody flops</strong></h2> <p>Marcus Smart did not step on a landmine. It only looked that way. During an Atlanta-Boston game in 2016, the Celtics guard \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmLio-r8SwY\">acknowledged grandmaster</a> of contemporary NBA flopping \u2013 dashed along the baseline to position himself for an offensive rebound. Hawks forward Kyle Korver bumped (brushed?) Smart with his hip. <a href=\"https://nesn.com/2019/04/watch-marcus-smarts-legendary-flop-on-its-three-year-anniversary/\">Smart went airborne</a>, knees tucked toward his chest like a platform diver, groan-gasping as if Mike Tyson had just landed a kidney shot, eventually landing somewhere in the vicinity of the basket stanchion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"925e3e9e4ae3d5a5c1420fcb9ad7fea9c1928d15\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/10/29/manu-flop.jpg\" alt=\"Manu Ginobili was known for his simulation skills during his career\" width=\"600\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manu Ginobili was known for his simulation skills during his career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/marcus-smart-defends-flopping-i-flop-defense-your-favorite-player-flops-offense\">Speaking to ESPN earlier this year</a>, Smart didn\u2019t defend his flop, which earned him a $5,000 fine from the league office. But he didn\u2019t exactly condemn the practice, either. \u201cLet\u2019s get that straight, that\u2019s a flop, this was hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cI deserved everything that came my way after that. I flop on defense, your favorite player flops on offense. That\u2019s the only difference. Especially in a game where the offense has nothing but the advantage, the defense has to do something to get the advantage back.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLaEAJfdKgo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLaEAJfdKgo?start=91&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=91\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Smart wasn\u2019t wrong. In the NBA, there are two types of players. Those who have flopped, and those who haven\u2019t \u2013 yet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJJkvilMSuw\">LeBron James flops</a>. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KvDUewrU9Yw?t=63\">Chris Paul flops</a>. <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2471029-steph-curry-fined-5k-for-flopping-in-warriors-vs-rockets-game-1\">Stephen Curry flops</a>. Hoops history\u2019s attic is crammed with Oscar-worthy efforts: a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjGq9fO--8s\">Vlade Divac pratfall</a> here, a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gLaEAJfdKgo?t=91\">Dwyane Wade tumble</a> there, a truly magnificent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&amp;v=mNxiWES8G0o\">offense-defense double dive</a> from Manu Ginobili and Raja Bell, the flopping equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/27/al-pacino-robert-de-niro-discuss-their-famed-heat-face-off/102229228/\">the Al Pacino-Robert DeNiro diner face-off in Heat</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFlops have been around for a long time,\u201d says Ronnie Nunn, a former NBA referee and league director of officials. \u201cWe even have rebounding flops! Dennis Rodman was really good at grabbing the wrist of his opponent while going up and making it look like he was being fouled. Karl Malone introduced an arching back on rebounds \u2013 if he was closer to the basket than his man, he would make it look like he was pushed [in the back] and was being moved, even if that [opponent\u2019s] forearm never came forward.\u201d</p> <p>Nunn laughs. \u201cBasketball is a crafty game. In terms of fooling the referee, flopping is part of its art and culture.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Cracking down</strong></h2> <p>Flopping is also, to use a technical term, <em>cheating</em>. A kind of athletic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/12/how-fyre-festival-went-up-in-flames-bella-hadid-ja-rule\">Fyre Festival ticket</a>. Basketball fans love to see the good guys get away with some well-timed ersatz contact; they get irate when the bad guys pull the same trick.</p> <p>Players, coaches, and NBA front offices are no different. In 2012, the league cracked down, announcing that flops \u2013 defined as any physical act that appears to have been intended to cause the referees to call a foul on another player \u2013 would earn warnings for first-time violators, followed by an escalating series of fines for repeat offenders.</p> <p>\u201cI think flopping had a lot of [general managers] up in arms,\u201d says Washington Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard, who has worked in the NBA for 26 years. \u201cIt had become a weapon, and it seemed like an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right. It doesn\u2019t pass the eye test. So the league tried to shame people into not flopping.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/22/nba-2019-20-predictions-new-season-lakers-clippers\">NBA 2019-20 predictions: The rise of Los Angeles and the era of the super duos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To stop flopping, however, you first have to spot flopping \u2013 yet by definition, a good flop is indistinguishable in real time from a genuine foul. According to Nunn, separating fiction from fact isn\u2019t always easy. Not when the game features some of the world\u2019s most explosive athletes. And not when officials already are keeping a watchful eye on a half-dozen different things in any given moment.</p> <p>Besides, not all flops are considered flops. Pretending to get hit and falling down? Verboten. Acting as though a forearm that never touched your face nearly removed your head? A no-no. But adding a dramatic physical flourish when you\u2019re also really and truly being fouled? That\u2019s just \u201cselling a call\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z74vOQ1w2BQ\">and the NBA is fine with it</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEmbellishments are the other piece to this,\u201d Nunn says. \u201cPlayers use them to win calls they were going to win anyway. Say you have a dribbler putting his arm into the chest of a defender. The defender flailing away like the offensive player threw a punch may be less bad than the offensive player using their arm to get an advantage.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Beyond the eye test</strong></h2> <p>Enter Cuban. Curious and data-driven, he approached SMU biomechanics professor Peter Weyand in 2013 with a novel request.</p> <p>Could Weyand\u2019s lab study flopping, the better to reduce referee guesswork by creating some basic guidelines on what levels of force, speed, and size contribute to genuine falls \u2013 especially in a league where guards weighing less than 200lbs regularly bowl over front court players more than 50lbs heavier?</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a high-contact sport like football, you see few pancakes, where guys end up on their behinds,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323844804578531481905403790\">Cuban told the Wall Street Journal at the time</a>. \u201cYet in our sport, guys end up on their backsides all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Weyand and his team specialize in athletic performance \u2013 they\u2019ve researched Usain Bolt\u2019s unique stride, Oscar Pistorius\u2019 artificial legs, and how to run a marathon in less than two hours. Yet when they began to investigate athletic performance art, they quickly realized it was virgin scientific territory.</p> <p>\u201cWe looked at sports science related to soccer \u2013 there\u2019s obviously a lot of flopping there,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe looked at the biomechanics of slips and falls in daily living. We looked all over the place. There wasn\u2019t much out there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df2f289dfb7a26a19cc0d915fd384a2734bc2ebc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df2f289dfb7a26a19cc0d915fd384a2734bc2ebc/0_114_3372_2023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban commissioned the study into flopping\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban commissioned the study into flopping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facing a void, the SMU researchers began with a basic question: just how much force does it take to knock someone off balance, or completely over? Weyand\u2019s team wrote predictive equations. They fashioned a mechanical dummy \u2013 nicknamed \u201cGus\u201d \u2013 out of plywood, PVC pipes, and galvanized tubing and repeatedly knocked it down with a padded, sensor-equipped yellow bar. They used to same bar to topple lab volunteers outfitted with reflective sensors.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to put a [San Antonio] Spurs jersey on Gus,\u201d Weyand said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe Ginobili or someone else known to be a flopper. But not everyone in the group would have been happy with that \u2013 it would have been pushing it little too far to put [the Mavericks\u2019] cross-state rivals in there. No pun intended.\u201d</p> <p>All three experiments told the same story. It doesn\u2019t take much to knock someone standing upright off balance \u2013 just 50lbs for a quarter of a second, roughly the same as walking or lightly jogging into someone.</p> <p>Weyand, who played basketball at Bates College, was surprised. \u201cIf we had found that it takes huge amounts of force, then you could assume that every time you see someone falling over in a NBA game, they\u2019re faking it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut no \u2013 in many cases, if the defender just doesn\u2019t move their feet, then down they go. I\u2019ve been through thousands of charge-block collisions, and never realized how easy it was.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Adding extra</strong></h2> <p>Next came human-on-human collisions. One person got a running start. The other remained stationary. Participants wore boxing headgear and baseball catcher chest pads, and fell into a padded track and field pit mat.</p> <p>\u201cIt was more fun than dangerous,\u201d Weyand says. \u201cWe had very thick mats.\u201d</p> <p>Did anyone end up needing to wear a cup? \u201cIf someone had gotten really doubled over or took a shot [between the legs], it would have been common knowledge in the lab,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The researchers staged hundreds of collisions at different speeds, heights, and angles. In some, the stationary targets were told to react naturally; in others, they were told to flop. All of the hits were recorded using a 12-camera system similar to the ones used to create motion-capture animations for video games such as NBA 2K.</p> <p>Analyzing that data, Weyand and company drew two key conclusions. First, during natural two-person collisions, the stationary recipient will fall backwards with their arms out \u2013 but not up, and certainly not high enough to direct traffic on an aircraft carrier flight deck.</p> <p>\u201cThose big, above the head gestures you see in the NBA?\u201d Clark says. \u201cThat\u2019s not natural counter-movement. That\u2019s what floppers do.\u201d</p> <p>Second, the SMU researchers confirmed that human collisions are subject to the same laws of physics as billiard balls. How so? When two objects collide, total momentum is conserved \u2013 that is, the stationary object can\u2019t gain any more momentum following the impact than the moving object loses. In flops, however, total momentum increased, a telltale sign that the floppers were adding something extra to the equation.</p> <p>\u201cEither they were jumping after the collisions, or it was excessive arm action,\u201d Clark says. \u201cEither way, we could measure it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lasting value</strong></h2> <p>Drawing on their study, the SMU group has recommendations for NBA officials \u2013 and anyone watching at home \u2013 making Flop or Not calls:</p> <ul> <li><p>Make sure the defender\u2019s body and feet are stationary;</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Make sure actual contact has occurred;</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Make sure the defender\u2019s response time is appropriate \u2013 that is, that they don\u2019t start going down before a collision, nor too late after one;</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Check for defender arm motion that\u2019s excessively upward.</p><p><br></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97bfeb79cdcecd8a45532fef1b7d36a1aad1ed1f\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/10/29/karl-malone_FINAL_2.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Malone\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Malone: \u2018if he was closer to the basket than his man, he would make it look like he was pushed\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe main thing is just to look at what players do with their upper bodies,\u201d Clark says. \u201cThat\u2019s the major giveaway. Anything going on probably isn\u2019t necessary. They\u2019re doing it to sell it. It may still be a charge, but they are selling.\u201d</p> <p>If that all seems obvious \u2013 less Galileo championing heliocentricity than the latest concussion study confirming that getting hit in the head is bad \u2013 well, sometimes the scientific method leads to known territory.</p> <p>Besides, Clark does have one potentially revolutionary idea: use data from the sophisticated motion-tracking cameras installed in every NBA arena to calculate the momentum conserved or added during questionable player collisions, the better to flag who might be flopping.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought about that a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know much these players weigh, and what speed they\u2019re moving at all times. Depending on how accurate the cameras are, you don\u2019t need a system like we have in our laboratory to do similar calculations.\u201d</p> <p>But does the NBA need a system at all? In the first three seasons following the adoption of anti-flopping rules, the league <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2016/04/08/nba-flops-fouls-fines-clippers-grizzlies-matt-barnes-kyle-lowry-jj-redick\">reportedly handed out</a> a total of 87 warnings and 13 fines to 73 players. Last season, by contrast, just five warnings and zero fines were issued.</p> <p>Nunn attributes the drop to improved officiating. Sheppard says an emphasis on perimeter play means fewer low-post backdowns and rim-attacking drives \u2013 which also means fewer opportunities for traditional defensive pratfalls.</p> <p>Still, neither man believes flopping is a dying art. Instead, it\u2019s simply evolving. \u201cNow you have more varied flops,\u201d Nunn says, \u201cand more flops by offensive players.\u201d To wit: in 2017, Houston guard James Harden\u2019s ability to draw dubious fouls on three-point shot attempts <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/how-the-nbas-newly-imposed-harden-rule-will-impact-james-harden-this-season/\">led the league to adopt new officiating guidelines</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Flopping] gets passed down from generation to generation,\u201d Sheppard says. \u201cUsually it\u2019s peer-to-peer, but sometimes players become a coach and teaches it.

      "bodyText": "Ken Clark did it for science. It was 2014, and Clark, then a doctoral student at Southern Methodist University, was part of a biomechanics group tasked by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban with studying \u2013 and perhaps fixing \u2013 flopping, basketball\u2019s dark, daffy art of fooling referees into calling fouls that aren\u2019t. Like all researchers, the SMU team needed data. Specifically, collision data. The underlying idea, Clark tells the Guardian, was \u201cwhat if we just imagine people like billiard balls and go from there?\u201d And that\u2019s how Clark, his colleagues, and some hardy student volunteers found themselves in a campus lab, slamming each other off their feet, over and over again, as sensors captured every pileup. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get the lab in trouble, as far as exposing students to bumps and bruises,\u201d says Clark, now a kinesiology professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019ll say this: the collisions were designed to replicate what goes on in a game.\u201d Years after a company owned by Cuban gave a six-figure grant to SMU to investigate a perpetual hoops quandary that leaves game officials perplexed and fans apoplectic \u2013 flop or not? \u2013 the school\u2019s Locomotor Performance Laboratory has released its findings in an amusing and informative video that breaks down everything you wanted to know about the physics of flopping, but probably never thought to ask: It takes surprisingly little force to knock a stationary human off balance or entirely onto their keister, even someone as large and strong as the typical National Basketball Association player \u2013 which means flopping may not be as common as people assume. If a player throws their arms skyward upon contact like they\u2019ve just crawled through 500 yards of sewage-smelling foulness to escape the Shawshank penitentiary, then yes, they\u2019re probably flopping. Floppers bring a distinct quality to their performances \u2013 measurable momentum \u2013 that can be used to help identify and perhaps even police the act. \u201cThe athletes in the NBA and college basketball are incredible,\u201d Clark says. \u201cBut when you watch them take a hit, it\u2019s obvious that sometimes they are positioning themselves in a way to topple with the least amount of force possible \u2013 and that\u2019s putting it tactfully. To put it bluntly, they\u2019re exaggerating collisions and falling down when they wouldn\u2019t normally have to. So when are they flopping? We felt we could address that from a rigorous scientific framework.\u201d Everybody flops Marcus Smart did not step on a landmine. It only looked that way. During an Atlanta-Boston game in 2016, the Celtics guard \u2013 and acknowledged grandmaster of contemporary NBA flopping \u2013 dashed along the baseline to position himself for an offensive rebound. Hawks forward Kyle Korver bumped (brushed?) Smart with his hip. Smart went airborne, knees tucked toward his chest like a platform diver, groan-gasping as if Mike Tyson had just landed a kidney shot, eventually landing somewhere in the vicinity of the basket stanchion. Speaking to ESPN earlier this year, Smart didn\u2019t defend his flop, which earned him a $5,000 fine from the league office. But he didn\u2019t exactly condemn the practice, either. \u201cLet\u2019s get that straight, that\u2019s a flop, this was hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cI deserved everything that came my way after that. I flop on defense, your favorite player flops on offense. That\u2019s the only difference. Especially in a game where the offense has nothing but the advantage, the defense has to do something to get the advantage back.\u201d Smart wasn\u2019t wrong. In the NBA, there are two types of players. Those who have flopped, and those who haven\u2019t \u2013 yet. LeBron James flops. Chris Paul flops. Stephen Curry flops. Hoops history\u2019s attic is crammed with Oscar-worthy efforts: a Vlade Divac pratfall here, a Dwyane Wade tumble there, a truly magnificent offense-defense double dive from Manu Ginobili and Raja Bell, the flopping equivalent of the Al Pacino-Robert DeNiro diner face-off in Heat. \u201cFlops have been around for a long time,\u201d says Ronnie Nunn, a former NBA referee and league director of officials. \u201cWe even have rebounding flops! Dennis Rodman was really good at grabbing the wrist of his opponent while going up and making it look like he was being fouled. Karl Malone introduced an arching back on rebounds \u2013 if he was closer to the basket than his man, he would make it look like he was pushed [in the back] and was being moved, even if that [opponent\u2019s] forearm never came forward.\u201d Nunn laughs. \u201cBasketball is a crafty game. In terms of fooling the referee, flopping is part of its art and culture.\u201d Cracking down Flopping is also, to use a technical term, cheating. A kind of athletic Fyre Festival ticket. Basketball fans love to see the good guys get away with some well-timed ersatz contact; they get irate when the bad guys pull the same trick. Players, coaches, and NBA front offices are no different. In 2012, the league cracked down, announcing that flops \u2013 defined as any physical act that appears to have been intended to cause the referees to call a foul on another player \u2013 would earn warnings for first-time violators, followed by an escalating series of fines for repeat offenders. \u201cI think flopping had a lot of [general managers] up in arms,\u201d says Washington Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard, who has worked in the NBA for 26 years. \u201cIt had become a weapon, and it seemed like an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right. It doesn\u2019t pass the eye test. So the league tried to shame people into not flopping.\u201d To stop flopping, however, you first have to spot flopping \u2013 yet by definition, a good flop is indistinguishable in real time from a genuine foul. According to Nunn, separating fiction from fact isn\u2019t always easy. Not when the game features some of the world\u2019s most explosive athletes. And not when officials already are keeping a watchful eye on a half-dozen different things in any given moment. Besides, not all flops are considered flops. Pretending to get hit and falling down? Verboten. Acting as though a forearm that never touched your face nearly removed your head? A no-no. But adding a dramatic physical flourish when you\u2019re also really and truly being fouled? That\u2019s just \u201cselling a call\u201d \u2013 and the NBA is fine with it. \u201cEmbellishments are the other piece to this,\u201d Nunn says. \u201cPlayers use them to win calls they were going to win anyway. Say you have a dribbler putting his arm into the chest of a defender. The defender flailing away like the offensive player threw a punch may be less bad than the offensive player using their arm to get an advantage.\u201d Beyond the eye test Enter Cuban. Curious and data-driven, he approached SMU biomechanics professor Peter Weyand in 2013 with a novel request. Could Weyand\u2019s lab study flopping, the better to reduce referee guesswork by creating some basic guidelines on what levels of force, speed, and size contribute to genuine falls \u2013 especially in a league where guards weighing less than 200lbs regularly bowl over front court players more than 50lbs heavier? \u201cIf you look at a high-contact sport like football, you see few pancakes, where guys end up on their behinds,\u201d Cuban told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cYet in our sport, guys end up on their backsides all the time.\u201d Weyand and his team specialize in athletic performance \u2013 they\u2019ve researched Usain Bolt\u2019s unique stride, Oscar Pistorius\u2019 artificial legs, and how to run a marathon in less than two hours. Yet when they began to investigate athletic performance art, they quickly realized it was virgin scientific territory. \u201cWe looked at sports science related to soccer \u2013 there\u2019s obviously a lot of flopping there,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe looked at the biomechanics of slips and falls in daily living. We looked all over the place. There wasn\u2019t much out there.\u201d Facing a void, the SMU researchers began with a basic question: just how much force does it take to knock someone off balance, or completely over? Weyand\u2019s team wrote predictive equations. They fashioned a mechanical dummy \u2013 nicknamed \u201cGus\u201d \u2013 out of plywood, PVC pipes, and galvanized tubing and repeatedly knocked it down with a padded, sensor-equipped yellow bar. They used to same bar to topple lab volunteers outfitted with reflective sensors. \u201cI wanted to put a [San Antonio] Spurs jersey on Gus,\u201d Weyand said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe Ginobili or someone else known to be a flopper. But not everyone in the group would have been happy with that \u2013 it would have been pushing it little too far to put [the Mavericks\u2019] cross-state rivals in there. No pun intended.\u201d All three experiments told the same story. It doesn\u2019t take much to knock someone standing upright off balance \u2013 just 50lbs for a quarter of a second, roughly the same as walking or lightly jogging into someone. Weyand, who played basketball at Bates College, was surprised. \u201cIf we had found that it takes huge amounts of force, then you could assume that every time you see someone falling over in a NBA game, they\u2019re faking it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut no \u2013 in many cases, if the defender just doesn\u2019t move their feet, then down they go. I\u2019ve been through thousands of charge-block collisions, and never realized how easy it was.\u201d Adding extra Next came human-on-human collisions. One person got a running start. The other remained stationary. Participants wore boxing headgear and baseball catcher chest pads, and fell into a padded track and field pit mat. \u201cIt was more fun than dangerous,\u201d Weyand says. \u201cWe had very thick mats.\u201d Did anyone end up needing to wear a cup? \u201cIf someone had gotten really doubled over or took a shot [between the legs], it would have been common knowledge in the lab,\u201d he says. The researchers staged hundreds of collisions at different speeds, heights, and angles. In some, the stationary targets were told to react naturally; in others, they were told to flop. All of the hits were recorded using a 12-camera system similar to the ones used to create motion-capture animations for video games such as NBA 2K. Analyzing that data, Weyand and company drew two key conclusions. First, during natural two-person collisions, the stationary recipient will fall backwards with their arms out \u2013 but not up, and certainly not high enough to direct traffic on an aircraft carrier flight deck. \u201cThose big, above the head gestures you see in the NBA?\u201d Clark says. \u201cThat\u2019s not natural counter-movement. That\u2019s what floppers do.\u201d Second, the SMU researchers confirmed that human collisions are subject to the same laws of physics as billiard balls. How so? When two objects collide, total momentum is conserved \u2013 that is, the stationary object can\u2019t gain any more momentum following the impact than the moving object loses. In flops, however, total momentum increased, a telltale sign that the floppers were adding something extra to the equation. \u201cEither they were jumping after the collisions, or it was excessive arm action,\u201d Clark says. \u201cEither way, we could measure it.\u201d Lasting value Drawing on their study, the SMU group has recommendations for NBA officials \u2013 and anyone watching at home \u2013 making Flop or Not calls: Make sure the defender\u2019s body and feet are stationary; Make sure actual contact has occurred; Make sure the defender\u2019s response time is appropriate \u2013 that is, that they don\u2019t start going down before a collision, nor too late after one; Check for defender arm motion that\u2019s excessively upward. \u201cThe main thing is just to look at what players do with their upper bodies,\u201d Clark says. \u201cThat\u2019s the major giveaway. Anything going on probably isn\u2019t necessary. They\u2019re doing it to sell it. It may still be a charge, but they are selling.\u201d If that all seems obvious \u2013 less Galileo championing heliocentricity than the latest concussion study confirming that getting hit in the head is bad \u2013 well, sometimes the scientific method leads to known territory. Besides, Clark does have one potentially revolutionary idea: use data from the sophisticated motion-tracking cameras installed in every NBA arena to calculate the momentum conserved or added during questionable player collisions, the better to flag who might be flopping. \u201cWe thought about that a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know much these players weigh, and what speed they\u2019re moving at all times. Depending on how accurate the cameras are, you don\u2019t need a system like we have in our laboratory to do similar calculations.\u201d But does the NBA need a system at all? In the first three seasons following the adoption of anti-flopping rules, the league reportedly handed out a total of 87 warnings and 13 fines to 73 players. Last season, by contrast, just five warnings and zero fines were issued. Nunn attributes the drop to improved officiating. Sheppard says an emphasis on perimeter play means fewer low-post backdowns and rim-attacking drives \u2013 which also means fewer opportunities for traditional defensive pratfalls. Still, neither man believes flopping is a dying art. Instead, it\u2019s simply evolving. \u201cNow you have more varied flops,\u201d Nunn says, \u201cand more flops by offensive players.\u201d To wit: in 2017, Houston guard James Harden\u2019s ability to draw dubious fouls on three-point shot attempts led the league to adopt new officiating guidelines. \u201c[Flopping] gets passed down from generation to generation,\u201d Sheppard says. \u201cUsually it\u2019s peer-to-peer, but sometimes players become a coach and teaches it. It\u2019s getting that handful of jersey, or sticking that elbow under someone\u2019s arm, and somehow you\u2019re the one being held or being hit. Guys that can master it can squeeze another year or two out of their careers. Setting screens, drawing fouls, getting an extra possession \u2013 that is valuable.\u201d Should Cuban again decide that flopping is valuable enough to research, there\u2019s much more to study. \u201cThe circumstance we looked at in the lab was stationary defender, offensive player coming in, the most controlled situation so we could be most certain of the numbers,\u201d Weyand says. \u201cBut a lot of collisions on the court are not like that. You have off-ball picks, rolls with two players moving. To have firm answers to those, we\u2019d have to [study] an actual NBA game. Is it potentially possible? Sure.\u201d",

I don\u2019t like booing players on the other team, even if they\u2019ve destroyed you in the past. That\u2019s just poor sportsmanship.

Jones, a 49-year-old Astros fan, said the boos were \u201ca disgrace \u2026 To boo him, and continue to boo him? This is how sick and delusional the far left has gone.\u201d Though Harris County, which includes Houston, voted Democratic in the 2016 election, thousands of supporters queued for hours last October to attend a Trump rally at the Toyota Center, the 18,300-seat home of the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets located a short walk from the Astros\u2019 ballpark. Had Trump turned up for a game in Texas, Jones speculated, the crowd would have reacted more cordially. \u201c[It] would have been \u2018hail to the chief\u2019. We have respect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the president is. If it were Obama and he got booed, I\u2019d say, \u2018that\u2019s a frigging disgrace\u2019. He\u2019s the president of the United States, I don\u2019t care Democratic, I don\u2019t care Republican. That\u2019s the commander in chief of our country.\u201d Mike Layton, a 36-year-old Astros fan, said he was unaware of the jeering as it happened. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear any of that during the live game,\u201d Layton said. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t care what people think of him or don\u2019t. I\u2019m here to watch a baseball game. I would like to think that he wouldn\u2019t get booed here but you never know.\u201d Kelly, 33, an Austin-based Nationals fan who declined to give her last name, saw nothing wrong with the crowd\u2019s reaction. \u201cI think you\u2019re fair game wherever you are. You can\u2019t really completely separate the two: politics and baseball. He\u2019s a public figure and when you\u2019re a public figure you\u2019re going to be subject to what people think. I think he\u2019s used to that, it kind of comes with the territory,\u201d she said. Artie Anderson, a 59-year-old Astros supporter, felt otherwise. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do, personally. I don\u2019t like booing players on the other team, even if they\u2019ve destroyed you in the past. That\u2019s just poor sportsmanship. Let\u2019s have an affirmative, fun atmosphere and enjoy ourselves,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI think it depends on where you are. The northeastern part of the United States is a little bit more abrasive than those of us in the south. We\u2019re a little bit more cordial, still.\u201d Also, Anderson said, he prefers to focus on the game rather than the guest VIPs: \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want that infringing on my experience of figuring out what the count is and how Justin Verlander\u2019s doing.\u201d The answer to that last one: not well. Verlander, one of the Astros\u2019 ace starting pitchers, extended his streak of World Series futility to historic proportions as the Nationals won, 7-2, to set up a winner-takes all seventh game in Houston on Wednesday. Yet Dave Martinez, the Washington manager, was ejected for furiously arguing a dubious interference call, becoming the first skipper in 24 years to be tossed out of a World Series game. Trump may have looked surprised to be the target of ire at a ballpark, but all umpires know that for them, it is an inevitable part of the job.",

In a judgment handed down on Wednesday, judge John Logan said the impost \u2013 a 15% tax on income that would normally be tax-free \u2013 could not be levied on some backpackers who were also Australian residents at the time because doing so violated agreements with other countries. Catherine Addy, the backpacker who brought the test case, is a British national but the solicitors who organised the lawsuit, Taxback.com, said similar treaties also existed with the US, Germany, Finland, Chile, Japan, Norway and Turkey. These countries account for about half of all visitors to Australia who hold working holiday visas, they said. Australian residents are not taxed on income they earn up to a threshold of $18,200. However, in 2016 the government introduced the backpacker tax, which hit people who come to Australia on a working holiday visa with a tax of 15% from the first dollar they earn. Logan found that the government discriminated against Addy by charging her the tax in 2017 because she held a working holiday visa. \u201cThat is a disguised form of discrimination based on nationality,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is exactly the type of discrimination which is prohibited by \u2026 the double taxation agreement.\u201d A Taxation Office spokesman said an appeal was being considered and played down the significance of the ruling. \u201cThis decision only affects the tax rates applying to a minority of [working holiday makers] who are also residents, and only those from countries affected by a similar clause in the double tax agreement with their home country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe consider most working holiday makers are not residents for tax purposes and this decision has no impact for these working holiday makers.\u201d However, this interpretation is likely to also face challenge, based on another of Logan\u2019s recent rulings in which he said a backpacker who intended to move to Australia for 10 months, and does so, would become a resident for tax purposes.

Researchers will also measure the oxytocin and cortisol levels of 400 mothers to monitor the impact of singing on the mother\u2019s body. And 135 Parkinson\u2019s patients will be assessed to see if weekly ballet classes improve their mobility, stability and tremors. Of the Parkinson\u2019s patients, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ability to control one\u2019s own body, but it also has a wellbeing and mental health component.\u201d</p> <p>It will form part of treatment pathways at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, King\u2019s College hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trusts, and community centres in Lambeth and Southwark.

Sometimes in schools, sometimes in health settings. All the time I was getting this feeling: the art I do can make a difference. I could see people were altered, that they felt better about themselves, that they behaved differently. And I really wanted to understand why. But there were no researchers there.\u201d</p> <p>One of the reasons she says she left her previous role as creative director of the Royal Opera House and came to King\u2019s was so she could get closer to academics studying the changes she had witnessed as a dancer. Shortly after joining the university in 2012, she led \u201ca mission\u201d, she says, to find peer-reviewed, \u201cproper research\u201d around the globe about the impact of arts and culture on health and wellbeing, as well as other environmental, social and educational impacts.</p> <p>Each piece of research was given a 300-word layman\u2019s summary by a team of academics and put on a <a href=\"http://www.culturecase.org\" title=\"\">free site</a>, with a link to its original paper.</p> <p>It soon became obvious that the biggest sector of research by far was arts, health and wellbeing \u2013 and also that \u201cthere is a lot of research going on, but most of it is on a very small scale\u201d, according to Bull.</p> <p>Some of the interventions detailed in the papers had even been robustly trialled, but never rolled out at scale: \u201cThe sector was crying out for the potential to test at the next level.\u201d This was the impetus for the new, large study. </p> <p>\u201cThrough King\u2019s Health Partners, we have the potential to take these three interventions and roll them out to bigger populations, and test whether they are clinically effective, economically effective and implementable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Throughout her career, she says she noticed that \u201cwhen people engaged, not just in something that was good for them, but in something that they enjoyed, they were much more likely to change their behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>She welcomes the move by the government to promote \u201csocial prescribing\u201d as a recognition of the benefits of the arts in transforming patients\u2019 lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/05/parkinsons-disease-and-dance-it-keeps-me-alive\">Parkinson's disease and dance: 'It keeps me alive'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI do think we\u2019re seeing a shift. There is a move towards social prescribing, and arts interventions would be an element of that,\u201d she says, citing the fact that these social and physical activities bring psychological and physical benefits to patients.</p> <p>Bull believes the project could have wider applications. \u201cIt\u2019s about partnership. The world\u2019s greatest challenges are not going to be solved by working in isolation. They are going to be solved by working imaginatively across institutions and disciplines and between partners like the English National Ballet and Parkinson\u2019s researchers.\u201d</p> <p>For Bull, it has been a tremendous journey. \u201cI\u2019m not a researcher myself, nor will I ever be. But I want to be in an environment where I can be closer to these questions.\u201d She puts her faith in the research. \u201cBut from my own experience, I have had great joy and found great strength in dancing, singing and the arts. So I very much hope this is what we will find.

And 135 Parkinson\u2019s patients will be assessed to see if weekly ballet classes improve their mobility, stability and tremors. Of the Parkinson\u2019s patients, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ability to control one\u2019s own body, but it also has a wellbeing and mental health component.\u201d It will form part of treatment pathways at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, King\u2019s College hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trusts, and community centres in Lambeth and Southwark. Carmine Pariante, professor of biological psychiatry at King\u2019s, and Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at University College London, will lead the study. \u201cWe know these interventions can work \u2013 now we need to know whether they work for the NHS and in the NHS,\u201d says Pariante. For Bull, who spent decades observing what was happening to people\u2019s health when she danced for them, the research project represents a huge leap forward. \u201cIn my time in the company, we took part in lots and lots of these interventions. Sometimes in schools, sometimes in health settings. All the time I was getting this feeling: the art I do can make a difference. I could see people were altered, that they felt better about themselves, that they behaved differently. And I really wanted to understand why. But there were no researchers there.\u201d One of the reasons she says she left her previous role as creative director of the Royal Opera House and came to King\u2019s was so she could get closer to academics studying the changes she had witnessed as a dancer. Shortly after joining the university in 2012, she led \u201ca mission\u201d, she says, to find peer-reviewed, \u201cproper research\u201d around the globe about the impact of arts and culture on health and wellbeing, as well as other environmental, social and educational impacts. Each piece of research was given a 300-word layman\u2019s summary by a team of academics and put on a free site, with a link to its original paper. It soon became obvious that the biggest sector of research by far was arts, health and wellbeing \u2013 and also that \u201cthere is a lot of research going on, but most of it is on a very small scale\u201d, according to Bull. Some of the interventions detailed in the papers had even been robustly trialled, but never rolled out at scale: \u201cThe sector was crying out for the potential to test at the next level.\u201d This was the impetus for the new, large study. \u201cThrough King\u2019s Health Partners, we have the potential to take these three interventions and roll them out to bigger populations, and test whether they are clinically effective, economically effective and implementable,\u201d she says. Throughout her career, she says she noticed that \u201cwhen people engaged, not just in something that was good for them, but in something that they enjoyed, they were much more likely to change their behaviours.\u201d She welcomes the move by the government to promote \u201csocial prescribing\u201d as a recognition of the benefits of the arts in transforming patients\u2019 lives. \u201cI do think we\u2019re seeing a shift. There is a move towards social prescribing, and arts interventions would be an element of that,\u201d she says, citing the fact that these social and physical activities bring psychological and physical benefits to patients. Bull believes the project could have wider applications. \u201cIt\u2019s about partnership. The world\u2019s greatest challenges are not going to be solved by working in isolation. They are going to be solved by working imaginatively across institutions and disciplines and between partners like the English National Ballet and Parkinson\u2019s researchers.\u201d For Bull, it has been a tremendous journey. \u201cI\u2019m not a researcher myself, nor will I ever be. But I want to be in an environment where I can be closer to these questions.\u201d She puts her faith in the research. \u201cBut from my own experience, I have had great joy and found great strength in dancing, singing and the arts. So I very much hope this is what we will find. And I wait with excitement to find out.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 56. Family: Lives with her partner. Lives: north London.

It is in itself a rather attractive notion, especially in our culture of personal make-overs and radical transformations. Brexit is the New You. It proposes a Year Zero and an Independence Day \u2013 points of origin at which a whole other story of British greatness begins. Like most revolutions, it imagines a sloughing off of history, especially, of course, the history of half a century of deep entanglement with the European Union. It offers a free programme of collective rehab, a political version of the Scientologists\u2019 goal of \u201cgoing clear\u201d.</p> <p>Yet one of the many incoherences of the Brexit project is that it cannot sustain even this rhetoric of a magical escape from the past. It proposes a giant leap into a glorious future but, as the Anglo-Irish philosopher Johnny Rotten snarled more than 40 years ago, \u201cthere is no future in England\u2019s dreaming\u201d. What is to follow from the great rupture has always been fuzzy. There is, instead, an awful lot of past.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>\u2019s ecstatic effusion at the Tory conference in 2017: \u201cWe need to be reiterating the benefits of Brexit! ...

There are Boris Johnson\u2019s literary and rhetorical Churchill impersonations. There are the zombie refrains of empire in the dream of Global Britain.</p> <p>Above all, there is the constant harking back to the second world war, to the Dunkirk spirit and the blitz spirit and, more darkly, to a rhetoric (aimed at the infidels) of appeasement, collaboration and, in Johnson\u2019s endlessly repeated term for the Benn act that sought to prevent a no-deal exit, of surrender. In a plaintive appeal to party members last April, the Tories\u2019 great lost leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\">Matt Hancock</a> (remember him?) agonised that \u201cwe have got to sound like we actually like this country. We have got to be patriots of the Britain of now and not the Britain of 1940.\u201d But neither the Britain of now nor the putative future Britain can hold a candle to the imagined flame of past glory.</p> <p>In this mixed-up discourse, the Brexit project can\u2019t decide whether it is a revolution or a restoration. If, like the characters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/18/his-dark-materials-the-enduring-terrifying-appeal-of-philip-pullmans-world\" title=\"\">Philip Pullman\u2019s</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/18/his-dark-materials-the-enduring-terrifying-appeal-of-philip-pullmans-world\" title=\"\"> His Dark Materials</a></em>, it has an animal daemon to represent its true self, is it a beautiful butterfly emerging from the cocoon of European slavery or a homing pigeon returning to the comfortable roost of old England?</p> <p>It wants, perhaps, to be both, to suggest simultaneously that all things will be made new in the buccaneering, disruptive, hyperglobalised capitalism that will be unleashed once freedom is gained; and that everything is just going back to the way it was meant to be before the terrible mistake of 1973. In this sense, the contradictory notions of history also expose the much deeper contradiction of Brexit \u2013 for most of those who are driving it, it is a radical breach in the British postwar social order; for most of those in the back of the bus, it is supposed to be a refurbishment and strengthening of that same social order.</p> <p>Complicating all of this is the way the very potency of the idea of a restoration of the past is itself a restoration of the past. As David Reynolds points out in his concise, elegant and lucid revisiting of key themes in British history in the light of Brexit, Margaret Thatcher, in her very first election campaign, when she was just 24, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s prestige in the eyes of the world has gone down and down \u2026 it is our earnest desire to make Great Britain great again.\u201d That was in 1950, just after the triumph of the second world war and before the shock of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\" title=\"\">Suez </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\" title=\"\">crisis</a>. Yet here, in this proto-Trump rhetoric, there is already the notion of intolerable national decline: if British greatness has to be regained, it has by definition been lost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexiters are anxious to\u00a0ignore the fraught nature of the inter\u00adrelationships of\u00a0England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Decline \u2013 or rather declinist rhetoric \u2013 is one of Reynolds\u2019s four themes. As an overriding notion in British political psychology, it has the odd quality of being at once inevitable and irrelevant. Inevitable because \u201cgreatness\u201d as defined by the empire was an extraordinary episode of political gigantism. Great Britain became Greater Britain as a result of a historically freakish conjunction of circumstances. It could not possibly sustain a situation in which it accounted for 33% of the world\u2019s exports of manufactured goods or one in which it controlled nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s population.</p> <p>But this inevitable retreat is irrelevant because Britain\u2019s descent from these impossible heights went hand-in-hand with great improvements in the lives of its own inhabitants. Given a choice between continuing to hold India captive and building a National Health Service, there is little doubt that ordinary people in Britain would have chosen the dignity of good healthcare over imperial \u201cgreatness\u201d.</p> <p>Reynolds gives a nicely crisp account of all of this but he might have risked a further thought. If it is true that a story of relative decline does not really matter to most people so long as their own circumstances are improving, then perhaps when people\u2019s lives stop improving, as they did as a result of static wages and austerity, they become susceptible to declinism. Their lives, they may come to accept, are not great because Britain is no longer great. This sleight-of-mind is surely one of the central and most effective tactics of Brexit. It suggests that membership of the EU, in which Britain is \u201creduced\u201d to the normality of being one country among 28, is the real reason why people\u2019s own life chances have been reduced.</p> <p>It is possible to make this false connection because of Reynolds\u2019s second theme, the persistent ambivalence in English politics about whether or not it is possible to stand aloof from continental Europe. It goes back a long way, certainly more than 1,000 years, and even in the postwar era, it has weighed heavily on both main parties. It is good to be reminded by Reynolds that even in the infamous Bruges speech of 1988 that gave its name to the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party, Thatcher insisted starkly: \u201cOur links to the rest of Europe, the continent of Europe, have been the dominant factor in our history.\u201d (Not, note, empire, industrialism or Protestantism, which she might have chosen.) And equally that it was a Labour leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/19/hugh-gaitskell-death-labour-party-1963\" title=\"\">Hugh Gaitskell</a>, who insisted in 1962 that \u201cwe are not just a part of Europe \u2013 at least not yet. We have a different history.\u201d Here we see that the very notion of British history has long been deeply uncertain: is it fundamentally shaped by Europe or is it \u201cdifferent\u201d?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/26/dear-europe-letters-from-jk-rowling-neil-gaiman-may-beard-and-more\">Dear Europe: letters from JK Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Mary Beard and more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One great appeal to difference is the profound exceptionalism that was seemingly endorsed by imperial success, the notion, as the historian and Whig politician Thomas Babington Macaulay put it in 1833 of the British as a \u201cpeople blessed with far more than an ordinary measure of political liberty and intellectual light\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Industry, farming and investor groups say the federal government signed up to a goal of global net zero emissions under the Paris agreement and have warned unless new policies are introduced taxpayer spending on climate programs will need to be dramatically increased. A joint letter by 10 business organisations, including the Australian Industry Group and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, says the government will either need to back new climate policies that drive private-sector action or boost taxpayer funding now and into the future. The letter was sent to a panel of business leaders and policy experts appointed by Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, to find new ways to \u201cenhance\u201d the emissions reduction fund, the government\u2019s main climate policy. The panel\u2019s appointment, which was not made public, is seen as an admission the fund is not reducing national pollution. Only select groups were asked to give feedback to a discussion paper circulated by the panel. The Clean Energy Council confirmed it wasn\u2019t approached \u201cdirectly\u201d to participate in the rapid-fire review, which began in mid-October and is expected to offer initial feedback early next month, but said it welcomed the government\u2019s putative shift on one of its signature policies. The business group letter says the 10 organisations have different views on policy but agreed on broad principles that should underpin what the government does. It says Australia\u2019s medium-term climate target set for 2030 is just a staging post on the way to meeting the Paris deal goals of keeping global heating well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. This would ultimately mean global net zero emissions. In Australia, it would require policy mechanisms that could efficiently deliver \u201cimmediate, cost-effective abatement opportunities\u201d in every part of the economy and also encourage innovation. The letter says the emissions reduction fund has worked in \u201cthe land sector\u201d \u2013 mostly projects supporting native vegetation \u2013 but was poorly suited to driving cuts in industry and buildings and unlikely to bring change in energy and transport. The groups would support well-designed policies that put less of the cost of cutting emissions on taxpayers, as the emissions reduction fund does, and instead encouraged the private sector to act. \u201cIn the absence of such policies, the government will need to commit more resources \u2013 both now and over time \u2013 to finance abatement,\u201d the letter says. The panel, which is headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia and a former chief executive of Origin Energy, was appointed after the government has been privately sounding out some groups about an overhaul of the fund for months. But stakeholders were taken aback when the panel approached them to provide detailed comments on options in less than two weeks.

King stressed the government\u2019s target, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, was not a cap. \u201cWhat we want to do is exceed those targets and we can do that that, we believe, through listening to people\u2019s experience \u2026 and improving the way it is working,\u201d he said. Taylor agreed the government would \u201clike to beat our targets\u201d and said the review was about \u201cusing the best expertise we can\u201d. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to use that money [committed to the fund] to maximise the abatement we get from it,\u201d he said. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, gave the Coalition a blast for failing to have a coherent policy. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have an energy policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a plan.

But he would welcome any opportunity to put forward ideas that would ensure the fund played a more substantial role in providing investor confidence across all sectors of the economy. As well as contributing to the joint letter, the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) has contributed its own submission to the process, urging the Morrison government to pursue least cost abatement in the reboot. Its submission says market mechanisms, including \u201cprice signals and tradable instruments\u201d, can be efficient and effective if well designed, but there are also roles for careful regulation and public funding. \u201cThe existing landscape of policy and proposals is far from consistent with these principles,\u201d it says. The discussion paper floats changing the scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was supposed to limit emissions from big industry but in practice has allowed pollution to increase, so companies that emit less than their limit are awarded carbon credits they could sell to the government or business. The Ai Group says adjusting the safeguards regime is an important option for the government, but will \u201crequire especially careful and consultative development\u201d. It says in theory it should be simple to reward facilities for emissions cuts when they emit less than tight limits, or baselines, but in reality \u201cthere are many difficult issues involved\u201d. Other signatories to the business group letter backed by the Ai Group are the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Property Council, the Energy Users Association, the Energy Efficiency Council, the Green Building Council, the Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity, the Carbon Market Institute and the Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers\u2019 support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The emissions policy review came to light as the government announced it would give the government green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, an extra $1bn to invest in projects aimed at ensuring a reliable electricity supply. The new fund is earmarked for power generation, storage and transmission projects such as pumped hydro, batteries and gas. National emissions have risen each year since 2015 and analyses have found the government would not reach its 2030 target, a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels, unless policies changed. Scientists say Australia should be aiming for deeper cuts if it is play its part under the Paris agreement.",

Boris Johnson won his fourth bid to go to the polls by 438 to 20 after Jeremy Corbyn declared that Labour would support an election as a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance to transform our country\u201d. The pre-Christmas vote will be the first December poll since 1923. The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party abstained, after their preferred day for it to be held \u2013 9 December \u2013 was rejected. Almost half of all Labour MPs were absent or voted against the legislation in a sign of unhappiness about a snap election, although some blamed a mix-up by the whips for their failure to attend. Parliament will dissolve next Wednesday for a short campaign of five weeks, so long as the House of Lords passes Johnson\u2019s legislation as expected in the coming days. Corbyn set the stage for his campaign by calling on voters to kick out Johnson\u2019s Conservatives who think they are \u201cborn to rule\u201d, while Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said it was \u201cour best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit\u201d. Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, Johnson argued that a \u201cnew and revitalised\u201d parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union. \u201cWe are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse,\u201d he told MPs. But he later struck a cautious note, telling a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be \u201ca tough election but we will do the best we can\u201d. He told them he had not wanted an election but was forced to seek one because Labour would have \u201csliced and diced\u201d his Brexit legislation beyond recognition. In a move to unite his party, the prime minister decided to readmit 10 of the 21 MPs he expelled last month for defying his Brexit plan. The major battle lines of the campaign will be drawn along on the subject of Brexit, after Johnson failed to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d as he had promised. The Conservatives will campaign to get Brexit done by pushing through Johnson\u2019s deal, while Labour is promising a second referendum to let the people resolve the EU question. The Brexit party will try to outgun the Tories by arguing for a no-deal Brexit, while the Lib Dems will seek to attract remain voters from Labour by pledging to revoke article 50. Although parliament voted decisively for an election, many backbenchers in the two biggest parties are extremely nervous about going to the polls at such a politically volatile time and an unusual time of year. The Tories under Johnson are about 10 points ahead of Labour in the average polls, roughly half the lead that Theresa May had before she led her party to a disastrous result that saw her lose her majority. Labour has been deeply split for months about whether to back an election or a second referendum first. In a sign of reluctance on the backbenches, more than 100 Labour MPs abstained and 11 voted against the motion. Those rejecting an election included strongly pro-remain campaigners such as Margaret Beckett, Peter Kyle, David Lammy and Owen Smith, who later said he would be standing down. Speaking earlier in the Commons, Corbyn confirmed that the party would back a poll after rejecting one on three previous occasions, after getting confirmation that the EU had granted an extension to article 50. \u201cI\u2019m ready for it, we\u2019re ready for it,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cBecause we want to be able to say to the people of this country there is an alternative to austerity. There is an alternative to inequality. There is an alternative to sweetheart trade deals with Donald Trump.\u201d Polling experts have said the result is likely to be hard to gauge, with the British Election Survey suggesting a third of voters have switched parties in the last two elections. The Tories will be targeting leave-voting Labour marginal constituencies in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, while defending areas of the south-west against the Lib Dems and its seats in Scotland against the SNP. Labour will be hoping to build on its successes in 2017 at picking up marginal seats from the Tories, especially in remain-voting urban areas. Corbyn\u2019s campaign will also be bolstered by the leftwing activists in Momentum, who are planning to mobilise tens of thousands of people to knock on doors in marginal seats and launch a \u201cviral video response unit\u201d to reach millions online. The Lib Dems have been speaking to the Greens and Plaid Cymru about maximising the chances of pro-remain parties, by standing single \u201cStop Brexit\u201d candidates in certain seats. However, the number of these is likely to be limited. Paula Surridge, a political sociologist at the University of Bristol, said the 12 December election was \u201clikely to pose key challenges to both the Labour and Conservative parties, both of whom need to improve on their performance in terms of seats, while simultaneously unlikely to match their 2017 vote share\u201d. \u201cWho manages to hold on to the larger part of the 2017 votes is likely to form the next government. Will this be the Brexit election 2017 never quite managed to be? The Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party will be pushing hard to make it so, while Labour are likely to want to talk about almost anything else,\u201d she said. In its remaining days of business, the government is planning to hold a debate on the Grenfell Tower fire report and rush through legislation relating to Northern Ireland\u2019s budget. However, it is still unclear whether a vote on the new Commons Speaker will be able to take place on Monday, as many MPs will be heading back to campaign immediately and are likely to be reluctant to return. The candidates for the job are split as to whether to press ahead, with Lindsay Hoyle, the favourite, and Meg Hillier, pushing for it to happen, while Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Rosie Winterton and Eleanor Laing, would prefer a new parliament to decide. John Bercow, the outgoing Speaker, could decide to defer his decision to stand down and allow the new parliament to elect his successor.",

      "body": "<p>Zigzagging through Karachi\u2019s main road, Layla Gulnaz*, 46, is on a mission. Beneath a sweltering sun, she goes from one car to the next, peering intently at the backseat passengers as she asks for spare change. She approaches a black car with a family of five inside. </p> <p>As the father reaches for change, Gulnaz quickly scans the faces of the three children in the back. To buy time, she makes small talk, but the man passes her a few rupees and hastily rolls up the car window.</p> <p>\u201cThey think we\u2019re freaks,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cThat we steal children because we can\u2019t have our own. But here we are, doing the exact opposite.\u201d Gulnaz pulls out a crumpled photo from her purse and sighs; the missing child she has spent all afternoon searching for \u2013 13-year-old Asma Razzak \u2013 is nowhere to be found.</p> <p>Gulnaz is one of Pakistan\u2019s estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/pakistani-transgender-people-office-election\">500,000</a> transgender people, who are largely shunned and driven to the dangerous margins of Karachi life. Many end up working in vulnerable industries such as the sex trade.</p> <p>Gulnaz is also on the frontline of Pakistan\u2019s battle to overcome an epidemic of child disappearances linked to slavery, exploitation and murder.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://sahil.org/\">NGO Sahil</a>, in a survey of 85 national and regional newspapers, 1,064 child abduction cases were reported, of which 79% were girls and 21% boys. This is part of a wider story of children going missing across Pakistan; exploited, abused, sold into forced marriage or slavery. In <a href=\"http://sahil.org/cruel-numbers/\">its latest report, Sahil</a> found the main reasons for abduction were trafficking, begging, sex work and bonded labour in brick kilns.</p> <p>For years this issue has been largely ignored, but in recent weeks the desperate tale of Pakistan\u2019s missing children has become a national scandal. The discovery of four children\u2019s bodies in shallow graves and on rubbish dumps in the Kasur district of Punjab, south of Lahore, in September sparked <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/world/asia/pakistan-child-rapes-killings-kasur.html\">demonstrations over police inaction</a>. Cars were burned and the local police station was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49745328\">pelted with stones</a>.

In 2007, Ali <a href=\"https://www.roshnihelpline.org/\">founded Roshni Helpline,</a> Pakistan\u2019s first hotline for missing children, which uses a complex system of volunteer informants. This includes transgender sex workers, neighbours, blacksmiths, street vendors and all those aware of who is coming and going through the underground routes of trafficking.

From 10 onwards, we also find runaway cases due to domestic abuse or the threat of child marriage.\u201d</p> <p>The walls of his small office are plastered with cut-out clippings of missing children \u2013 small, black-and-white printed faces stare back, frozen in time.

Missing children ads are as regular as crossword puzzles in Urdu newspapers.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea to involve transgender [people] came because they have good connections in the city,\u201d says Ali. It was the ability of the <em>khawaja sira \u2013 </em>as trans people are commonly known \u2013 to move through the margins of society, dangerous places that traditional authorities have no access to, that led him to approach them. \u201cIt seemed obvious,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would be able to help us.\u201d</p> <p>Typically cast out by their families, Pakistan\u2019s transgender community knows all too well what estrangement feels like. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been abandoned,\u201d Gulnaz laments. \u201cWe understand the pain of separation so reuniting these children with their families makes us feel good for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Gulnaz moved to Karachi at the age of 15 after being disowned by her family. \u201cI came here to find a job, but found only one difficulty after another.\u201d To survive, she juggles her time between begging and dancing. \u201cI take work wherever I can find it,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>On a warm afternoon, Ali and his team gather around for their weekly meeting. Shehla Khan*, 40, has been working with Roshni for the past four years and manages a group of 50 other transgender volunteers. Today they are being briefed by the case management team on children who have recently gone missing in the area. The volunteers listen intently as they are equipped with photos and information about each child.</p> <p>Ali\u2019s team carefully maps out an area where a child has gone missing. Colour-coded drawing pins determine key entryways and exits to ensure they are carefully watched. Volunteers are told to scout vulnerable areas such as Mobina Town, Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Jamshed Town, where they must remain particularly vigilant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/pakistani-transgender-people-office-election\">Once ostracised, now Pakistani transgender people are running for parliament</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was recently tipped off on the whereabouts of a kidnapped girl, who was being exploited at an unknown house,\u201d says Khan. \u201cI immediately informed Roshni, who, together with the police, were able to track down the location.

      "bodyText": "Zigzagging through Karachi\u2019s main road, Layla Gulnaz*, 46, is on a mission. Beneath a sweltering sun, she goes from one car to the next, peering intently at the backseat passengers as she asks for spare change. She approaches a black car with a family of five inside. As the father reaches for change, Gulnaz quickly scans the faces of the three children in the back. To buy time, she makes small talk, but the man passes her a few rupees and hastily rolls up the car window. \u201cThey think we\u2019re freaks,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cThat we steal children because we can\u2019t have our own. But here we are, doing the exact opposite.\u201d Gulnaz pulls out a crumpled photo from her purse and sighs; the missing child she has spent all afternoon searching for \u2013 13-year-old Asma Razzak \u2013 is nowhere to be found. Gulnaz is one of Pakistan\u2019s estimated 500,000 transgender people, who are largely shunned and driven to the dangerous margins of Karachi life. Many end up working in vulnerable industries such as the sex trade. Gulnaz is also on the frontline of Pakistan\u2019s battle to overcome an epidemic of child disappearances linked to slavery, exploitation and murder. According to NGO Sahil, in a survey of 85 national and regional newspapers, 1,064 child abduction cases were reported, of which 79% were girls and 21% boys. This is part of a wider story of children going missing across Pakistan; exploited, abused, sold into forced marriage or slavery. In its latest report, Sahil found the main reasons for abduction were trafficking, begging, sex work and bonded labour in brick kilns. For years this issue has been largely ignored, but in recent weeks the desperate tale of Pakistan\u2019s missing children has become a national scandal. The discovery of four children\u2019s bodies in shallow graves and on rubbish dumps in the Kasur district of Punjab, south of Lahore, in September sparked demonstrations over police inaction. Cars were burned and the local police station was pelted with stones. The prime minister, Imran Khan, stepped in, promising that the police would be held to account, and unveiling an app to track children from the moment they vanish. Kasur was already notorious across Pakistan for child murder. In January 2018 seven-year-old Zainab Ansari went missing while walking the short distance from her house to Qur\u2019an school. Four days later, after her family tracked down CCTV footage, reportedly with little help from the police, her body was found on a rubbish dump. She had been raped and strangled. Her disappearance was the latest in a long line of local children to go missing. Imran Ali, 24, was convicted of Zainab\u2019s killing, and police investigators also matched his DNA with seven other girls\u2019 bodies. In Karachi, a low-tech revolution, led by society\u2019s outcasts, is leading where police have failed. Gulnaz is part of a team put together by human rights activist Muhammad Ali. In 2007, Ali founded Roshni Helpline, Pakistan\u2019s first hotline for missing children, which uses a complex system of volunteer informants. This includes transgender sex workers, neighbours, blacksmiths, street vendors and all those aware of who is coming and going through the underground routes of trafficking. Together, they claim to have helped locate more than 5,000 of Karachi\u2019s missing children and reunited them with their families. Living on the margins gives Gulnaz a strong empathy with the families who are losing children. \u201cThey usually belong to poorer families, so the police don\u2019t take their cases seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cSecurity is a luxury not everyone here can afford.\u201d Sitting on a swivel chair behind a mahogany desk stacked with case files of missing children, Ali says the reasons for abductions vary. \u201cNewborns until the age of three are mainly kidnapped for false adoption while children between three and 10 are more vulnerable to sexual exploitation, [forced begging] and ransom. From 10 onwards, we also find runaway cases due to domestic abuse or the threat of child marriage.\u201d The walls of his small office are plastered with cut-out clippings of missing children \u2013 small, black-and-white printed faces stare back, frozen in time. Mursaleen Khizer, six, missing since 26 August 2017. Aisha Zafar, 12, missing since 1 September 2018. Tahir Khan, 16, missing since 6 March 2019 \u2013 the list is long. Missing children ads are as regular as crossword puzzles in Urdu newspapers. \u201cThe idea to involve transgender [people] came because they have good connections in the city,\u201d says Ali. It was the ability of the khawaja sira \u2013 as trans people are commonly known \u2013 to move through the margins of society, dangerous places that traditional authorities have no access to, that led him to approach them. \u201cIt seemed obvious,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would be able to help us.\u201d Typically cast out by their families, Pakistan\u2019s transgender community knows all too well what estrangement feels like. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been abandoned,\u201d Gulnaz laments. \u201cWe understand the pain of separation so reuniting these children with their families makes us feel good for a while.\u201d Gulnaz moved to Karachi at the age of 15 after being disowned by her family. \u201cI came here to find a job, but found only one difficulty after another.\u201d To survive, she juggles her time between begging and dancing. \u201cI take work wherever I can find it,\u201d she explains. On a warm afternoon, Ali and his team gather around for their weekly meeting. Shehla Khan*, 40, has been working with Roshni for the past four years and manages a group of 50 other transgender volunteers. Today they are being briefed by the case management team on children who have recently gone missing in the area. The volunteers listen intently as they are equipped with photos and information about each child. Ali\u2019s team carefully maps out an area where a child has gone missing. Colour-coded drawing pins determine key entryways and exits to ensure they are carefully watched. Volunteers are told to scout vulnerable areas such as Mobina Town, Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Jamshed Town, where they must remain particularly vigilant. \u201cI was recently tipped off on the whereabouts of a kidnapped girl, who was being exploited at an unknown house,\u201d says Khan. \u201cI immediately informed Roshni, who, together with the police, were able to track down the location. After carrying out a raid, they not only found the girl but three others who were being kept in the basement.\u201d Shehla is also a guru, a guardian of younger transgender women, many of whom come to her after being abandoned by their families. Shunned by mainstream society, Pakistan\u2019s transgender community is often subjected to violence and hostility. In the past three years, 58 have been murdered in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone. Ali\u2019s persistence has taken his fight all the way to Pakistan\u2019s supreme court, where he is now pushing for a law that would ensure the police act promptly when a child goes missing. \u201cEven 24 hours is too long to wait,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has to be the moment a child goes missing.\u201d Later that evening Gulnaz is back on the road. Asma Razzak has yet to be found, and Gulnaz isn\u2019t giving up. The call to prayer rings out from a minaret and worshippers start to descend on a nearby mosque. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get overlooked in this big city. But one glance is all it takes,\u201d Gulnaz says determinedly. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the right place at the right time, a glance can save someone\u2019s life.\u201d *Names changed to protect identities",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Is Johnson making same mistake as May? Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray here. Did you know election signs are made of something called \u201ccorrex\u201d? You\u2019re going to be seeing quite a lot of it \u2026 Brexit will again be taken to the ballot box with a general election to be held on 12 December. Parliament will dissolve on Wednesday of next week for a five-week campaign, assuming the House of Lords passes the election bill as expected, as soon as today. MPs voted in favour of an election by 438 to 20; a majority of 418. For toeing the line this time, the Conservatives restored the party whip to 10 of the 21 rebel MPs ejected in September when they voted against the government. This morning our political team assess how well the parties are prepared. Dan Sabbagh asks whether Labour can eat into the 58-seat majority projected for Boris Johnson, who is ahead 10 points in published opinion polls. Labour has axed its \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d process where incumbent MPs could be deselected by the local branch membership. The party\u2019s national executive committee will meet to consider the fate of controversial MPs such as Keith Vaz, Chris Williamson and Roger Godsiff. Our editorial carries a reminder that Theresa May called a snap election in 2017 thinking she had the upper hand \u2013 but ended up dumped into minority government. \u201cMore often than not, politicians overestimate their ability to frame the terms of political debate \u2026 Boris Johnson might be on the verge of making a similar mistake.\u201d The spectre of the Brexit party looms, with incumbent Tory MPs reportedly begging Nigel Farage\u2019s party not to run candidates against them. Electoral meltdown or not for the Tories, thousands of 50p coins minted in advance to mark 31 October as Brexit day are going to be melted down until when (and if) the metal is actually needed. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green party are set to unveil a pact in which the parties will stand aside in certain seats to boost each other\u2019s chances and reduce the risk of a damaging Brexit. The Lib Dem MP Heidi Allen \u2013 who arrived at the party by way of the Conservatives, then Change UK, then a stint as an independent \u2013 is standing down, citing the \u201cinvasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation\u201d she has experienced as a politician: \u201cNobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.\u201d This morning it emerges that the Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto is being drawn up by Rachel Wolf, a lobbyist for the fracking company Cuadrilla and partner at a business that lobbies ministers on behalf of the shale gas industry. Much more news and many more twists to come as we embark on the trudge to 12 December \u2013 head over to our live blog to keep track of this first full day of campaigning. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Priti Patel\u2019s chief of staff, James Starkie, was escorted by armed police out of the Strangers\u2019 Bar in the Houses of Parliament last night. Witnesses said he had started swearing, punched a door and been refused service. He apologised as he was ejected. &gt; \u201cExtremely disturbing\u201d testimony to the Trump impeachment inquiry from Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a decorated military officer, has left Republicans grappling with how to counter a highly credible account from a Purple Heart veteran about the president\u2019s attempts to recruit Ukraine into a political smear campaign. &gt; Police are hunting Ronan Hughes aka Rowan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, both from Armagh, for the suspected manslaughter and human trafficking of 39 people whose bodies were found in a lorry trailer in Essex. &gt; Female MPs have condemned the British media\u2019s treatment of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in running \u201coften distasteful and misleading\u201d stories that sometimes display \u201coutdated, colonial undertones\u201d. &gt; The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has declined a prestigious environmental award, declaring: \u201cThe climate movement does not need any more awards. What we need is for our politicians and the people in power start to listen to the current, best available science.\u201d * * * WhatsApp sues spyware lab \u2013 WhatsApp has launched a lawsuit against the Israeli cyber-weapons and surveillance firm NSO Group, alleging its software was used for attacks on more than 100 human rights activists, lawyers, journalists and academics. The attacks exploited a vulnerability that allowed a malicious party to install spyware on people\u2019s phones. WhatsApp said it believed the technology sold by NSO was used to target the phones of more than 1,400 of its users in 20 different countries during a 14-day period from the end of April to the middle of May. The lawsuit, filed in a California court on Tuesday, demands a permanent injunction blocking NSO from attempting to access WhatsApp computer systems and those of its parent company, Facebook. * * * And finally \u2013 The Great British Bake Off is done and dusted (with cocoa powder and the like). Here is the result. Today in Focus podcast: The day Baghdadi\u2019s time ran out The Guardian\u2019s Martin Chulov describes how US special forces finally tracked down Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who died in a raid at the weekend. Plus: Robert Booth on the criticism of the London fire brigade\u2019s response to the Grenfell Tower disaster. Lunchtime read: How to love your job \u2013 forever What is it like to have the same job in the same company for as long as 40 years? A tailor, school meals supervisor, bus driver and sexual health nurse tell all about being some of Britain\u2019s most loyal employees. Sport England coach Eddie Jones has gone back to what he feels has worked, writes Ugo Monye, and ahead of the Rugby World Cup final, we have discovered the new trend is actually an old trend. Saturday\u2019s opponents, South Africa, are using the experience seven of their squad have of playing in the Premiership to aid their preparation. Meanwhile, England have been reprimanded and fined for their V-shaped formation when facing the haka before their semi-final victory over New Zealand. Richard Freeman, the former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor, will admit to telling \u201ca lot of lies\u201d and supplying banned testosterone to a senior figure in both organisations, an independent medical tribunal heard. Ashleigh Barty experienced mixed emotions as she became the first Australian to secure the year-end No 1 ranking simply by stepping onto the court at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen but then lost in three sets to Kiki Bertens. Bulgaria have been sanctioned by Uefa after the racist chanting which marred the Euro 2020 qualifier with England this month, but people should stop throwing stones inside English football\u2019s glass house, writes David Conn. Sergio Ag\u00fcero scored twice in Manchester City\u2019s 3-1 win in the Carabao Cup as Southampton at least avoided a repeat of their hiding by Leicester. And goals from Mason Holgate and Richarlison spared Marco Silva\u2019s blushes against his former club Watford and sent Everton into the quarter-finals. Business Asian share markets have slipped as the prospect of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve is countered by worries a China-US first-stage trade deal could be delayed. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell from Tuesday\u2019s three-month high while Japan\u2019s Nikkei also dropped off from a one-year high. On Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 index touched a record intraday high, led by strong earnings from drug manufacturers such as Merck and Pfizer, before ending down 0.08%. A disappointing profit report from Google parent Alphabet kept the Nasdaq in the red. Sterling is trading around $1.286 and \u20ac1.158 at time of writing; the FTSE is flat. The papers Wednesday\u2019s papers all look ahead to a festive snap election with turkeys, a Grinch and even a New Year\u2019s Leave party. The Guardian casts the election vote in terms of Brexit: \u201cParliament breaks deadlock with December 12 election\u201d and notes the national poll could be the most unpredictable in a generation.

South Africa are expected to provide England with their most physical challenge this tournament, but Proudfoot noted that New Zealand fell victim to brain as well as brawn. \u201cI think the final will be very tight,\u201d said Proudfoot. \u201cEngland were very efficient and powerful against New Zealand. We have spoken about having to match that intensity, but it was not just about brute force. There was a lot of very intelligent play from their pack. I was very impressed with what I saw. We know it will be a big challenge. \u201cWe played them four times last year, but as a pack they are a lot more confident in what they are doing. There is more understanding about what they want and so they are executing better. The New Zealand game was a great one to watch and they will look to play the same way. As a team we watched it and went: \u2018Wow.\u2019 They were just great. \u201cWe know what we are up against, but I have been impressed with how mature our guys have become.

More than 100 new churches were announced last year in coastal areas, market towns and urban housing estates \u2013 a serious attempt to expand Anglicanism, while about 25 churches are closed each year.</p> <p>Some, like St Peter\u2019s in Brighton, have modernised the music, decor and ethos of old churches. Others have occupied secular buildings. For a time, the Harbour church in Portsmouth could be found in an old department store. In Swindon, plans are under way to turn a former Great Western Railway building into a <a href=\"https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/17535004.historic-swindon-building-to-be-turned-into-mega-church/\">large new place of worship</a>.

Gas Street is technically \u201cSt Luke\u2019s\u201d, but churchy names are falling out of fashion too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>83% of people live in urban areas, but 83% of [church] finance doesn\u2019t go there. But it should.</p> <footer> <cite>Ric Thorpe, bishop of Islington</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The plan is to attract young people, in part by going to the city centres, where young people can be found. The next round of grants from the church\u2019s Strategic Development Fund, part of the Renewal and Reform programme, will be <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/SDF%20-%20Guidance%20-%20July%202019_3.pdf\">explicitly devoted to projects</a> that \u201care targeted on promoting church growth within the largest urban areas; and one or both of younger generations and poorer communities\u201d. In effect, though everyone insists that the church has not forgotten the countryside, it means a focus for the future on the UK\u2019s 75 largest cities and towns.</p> <p>There are about 150 students at Gas Street on the night I visit. Worship starts at 8pm, before which they socialise over plates of paella from a giant pan. It is early in the term and some of them may be taking their first steps into the church, so the organisers asked me not to talk to people at random. Instead I am introduced to several regulars, including Mark, who is certainly a fine example of how they can help some young people in need. Right now the church\u2019s own needs are nearly as great, however. If they do not ignite an Anglican revival among young people in the next couple of decades, then these new city-centre ventures will be the last stand of the Church of England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/11/c-of-e-to-create-100-new-churches-as-number-of-anglicans-hits-new-low\">C of E to create 100 new churches as number of Anglicans hits new low</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the British Social Attitudes survey began recording people\u2019s religious affiliations in 1983, 40% considered themselves Anglicans, whether or not they went to church. Last year this reached 12%. Such a decline in one generation would be worrying enough on its own, but it hides the worst news of all, which is the age of the faithful. One third of people over 75 consider themselves part of the Church of England. Ask people aged 18-24, and it is 1%. At that rate, you could add together all the undergraduates at the University of Birmingham (22,710), Birmingham City University (19,790) and Aston University (11,850) and expect to find just 544 Anglicans. You could fit all the churchgoers among them into a single gathering at Gas Street.</p> <p>For the Church of England, this is not a downward slope. It is the edge of a cliff. According to BSA data, children brought up without religion very rarely find it in adulthood, whereas about half of children from Anglican backgrounds ultimately leave the faith. For roughly every Anglican who dies, therefore, two must be raised to replace them, which requires lots of young Anglican parents \u2026 and there are almost none left, and fewer every year. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From where things stand, if Anglicans still account for 1% of the British population by the end of the century, it would be an astonishing recovery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From where things stand, if Anglicans still account for 1% of the British population by the end of the century, it would be an astonishing recovery. The proportions calling themselves Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist are all falling as well, but this is the Church of England, led by the monarch, with 26 bishops in the House of Lords and control over about a quarter of England\u2019s schools. Without a miracle, at some point there will be some serious explaining to do.</p> <p>Like all religions, the Church of England says it is keen to improve people\u2019s lives, not just protect its own interests. For Tim and Rachel Hughes, the lead pastors at Gas Street, their work is an attempt to share something they love with others who don\u2019t know much about it. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a Church of England church in this area,\u201d Tim says. \u201cCentral, buzzing with young people. Where people can begin to come and engage with who is Jesus. Is he real? Is he alive? And if he is, what difference might that make for my life?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c708d0f8bbe91946d78e5770eb61af16f64a160e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c708d0f8bbe91946d78e5770eb61af16f64a160e/0_0_5282_3521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This former night club complex in Bradford will soon be home to the Fountains church, the plans for whcih also include a cafe and a gym.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This former<a href=\"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/17865902.plan-turn-nightclub-city-centre-church-approved/\"> night</a><a href=\"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/17865902.plan-turn-nightclub-city-centre-church-approved/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/17865902.plan-turn-nightclub-city-centre-church-approved/\">club complex</a> in Bradford will soon be home to the Fountains church, the plans for whcih also include a cafe and a gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Dinsdale/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many ways, this wave of church-planting in British cities is like modern missionary work. Before moving to Birmingham in 2015 to set up Gas Street, the Hugheses worked at Holy Trinity Brompton, where the Alpha course was developed. HTB, as it is known, now sits at the centre of the network of 60 planted churches in towns and cities all over England, with a slick formula for establishing outposts of Anglican evangelism that now guides the church\u2019s future. You may notice that most of the churches mentioned in this article have <a href=\"https://www.gasstreet.org/\">excellent</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.htb.org/\">similar</a> \u2013 websites.</p> <p>Hughes himself is quite a big attraction at Gas Street, being famous in the world of Christian rock for several hits in the early 2000s. The best known, Here I Am to Worship, won a Dove award (like a Christian Grammy) in 2003, and has been watched in various versions more than 100m times on YouTube. On a typical Sunday, Ali Herbert, another Gas Street minister, tells me that they get about 600 or 700 people, including children, across three gatherings (not \u201cservices\u201d any more). They estimate that 70% of the congregation is under 30.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>St Thomas, Norwich, has pioneered \u201csports ministry\u201d. Meanwhile, churches in poorer communities offer debt advice, school uniforms, food banks and other services</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, both Hughes and Herbert are happy with the new church\u2019s progress, although of course it is hard to know how much of the congregation considered themselves Anglican already. Gas Street has done some marketing and work on social media, but for Hughes, the key will be word of mouth. \u201cThe way I think you grow, is you envision and equip people to invite their friends,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Besides planting itself in new areas, the Church of England is also using its \u00a38bn investment fund to be more creative with what they offer, especially when it means offering something that laypeople definitely like. In cathedrals, this has taken shape in zany schemes like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/09/helter-skelter-installed-in-nave-of-norwich-cathedral-ornate-roof\">helter-skelter installed in Norwich</a> over the summer, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/shortcuts/2019/jul/30/holey-moly-the-worlds-ten-most-sensational-minigolf-courses\">crazy golf</a> in Rochester. Elsewhere, plans for the Fountains church in Bradford include a gym and a cafe within the complex.</p> <p>St Thomas, Norwich, has pioneered \u201csports ministry\u201d, providing holiday clubs, five-a-side pitches, netball and other fitness groups to local people. Meanwhile, churches in poorer communities offer debt advice, school uniforms, food banks and other services to help people on low incomes. The plan is that successfully planted big city churches will go on to plant other smaller ones, using the good ideas they learned along the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b30c148627503815d8a838d6e5481b74d0afd769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b30c148627503815d8a838d6e5481b74d0afd769/0_168_3056_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Hughes performs at Big Church Day Out in Sussex in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"773\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Hughes performs at Big Church Day Out in Sussex in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shorelark/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Debbie Clinton, director of Renewal and Reform at the Church of England, says: \u201cParticularly over the last few years, we have been trying to look more intentionally at some of the bigger areas.

If not, let\u2019s go and see how we might do that. In other cities we might look at areas of urban deprivation, particularly in housing estates around the fringes of cities. In central London, we\u2019re looking at workplace populations, where people commute long distances. So what can the church provide for people during the week?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/07/spiritual-gentrification-christianity-regeneration-game-stokes-croft-bristol\">Would Jesus be a gentrifier?

From some angles, this search for a secret formula to bring city-dwellers back into church looks like the energetic and imaginative relaunch of a video rental shop. Although, ironically, the scarcity of young Anglicans in the wider world might increase the church\u2019s appeal to those who remain.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like family,\u201d says Hazel Lynch. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to describe it.\u201d Lynch is 22, a recent graduate of the University of Birmingham, and studying for an MA in theology.

For Lynch, on the other hand, Gas Street is one place where she is no longer a curiosity. \u201cI walked through the door, and just felt at home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>* <em>Some names have been changed</em></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p>",

Some, like St Peter\u2019s in Brighton, have modernised the music, decor and ethos of old churches. Others have occupied secular buildings. For a time, the Harbour church in Portsmouth could be found in an old department store. In Swindon, plans are under way to turn a former Great Western Railway building into a large new place of worship. The Fountains in Bradford will soon take over an old nightclub complex, once home to less godly venues called Revolution, Tequila and Vibe. Gas Street is technically \u201cSt Luke\u2019s\u201d, but churchy names are falling out of fashion too. The plan is to attract young people, in part by going to the city centres, where young people can be found. The next round of grants from the church\u2019s Strategic Development Fund, part of the Renewal and Reform programme, will be explicitly devoted to projects that \u201care targeted on promoting church growth within the largest urban areas; and one or both of younger generations and poorer communities\u201d. In effect, though everyone insists that the church has not forgotten the countryside, it means a focus for the future on the UK\u2019s 75 largest cities and towns. There are about 150 students at Gas Street on the night I visit. Worship starts at 8pm, before which they socialise over plates of paella from a giant pan. It is early in the term and some of them may be taking their first steps into the church, so the organisers asked me not to talk to people at random. Instead I am introduced to several regulars, including Mark, who is certainly a fine example of how they can help some young people in need. Right now the church\u2019s own needs are nearly as great, however. If they do not ignite an Anglican revival among young people in the next couple of decades, then these new city-centre ventures will be the last stand of the Church of England. When the British Social Attitudes survey began recording people\u2019s religious affiliations in 1983, 40% considered themselves Anglicans, whether or not they went to church. Last year this reached 12%. Such a decline in one generation would be worrying enough on its own, but it hides the worst news of all, which is the age of the faithful. One third of people over 75 consider themselves part of the Church of England. Ask people aged 18-24, and it is 1%. At that rate, you could add together all the undergraduates at the University of Birmingham (22,710), Birmingham City University (19,790) and Aston University (11,850) and expect to find just 544 Anglicans. You could fit all the churchgoers among them into a single gathering at Gas Street. For the Church of England, this is not a downward slope. It is the edge of a cliff. According to BSA data, children brought up without religion very rarely find it in adulthood, whereas about half of children from Anglican backgrounds ultimately leave the faith. For roughly every Anglican who dies, therefore, two must be raised to replace them, which requires lots of young Anglican parents \u2026 and there are almost none left, and fewer every year. From where things stand, if Anglicans still account for 1% of the British population by the end of the century, it would be an astonishing recovery. The proportions calling themselves Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist are all falling as well, but this is the Church of England, led by the monarch, with 26 bishops in the House of Lords and control over about a quarter of England\u2019s schools. Without a miracle, at some point there will be some serious explaining to do. Like all religions, the Church of England says it is keen to improve people\u2019s lives, not just protect its own interests. For Tim and Rachel Hughes, the lead pastors at Gas Street, their work is an attempt to share something they love with others who don\u2019t know much about it. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a Church of England church in this area,\u201d Tim says. \u201cCentral, buzzing with young people. Where people can begin to come and engage with who is Jesus. Is he real? Is he alive? And if he is, what difference might that make for my life?\u201d In many ways, this wave of church-planting in British cities is like modern missionary work. Before moving to Birmingham in 2015 to set up Gas Street, the Hugheses worked at Holy Trinity Brompton, where the Alpha course was developed. HTB, as it is known, now sits at the centre of the network of 60 planted churches in towns and cities all over England, with a slick formula for establishing outposts of Anglican evangelism that now guides the church\u2019s future. You may notice that most of the churches mentioned in this article have excellent \u2013 and similar \u2013 websites. Hughes himself is quite a big attraction at Gas Street, being famous in the world of Christian rock for several hits in the early 2000s. The best known, Here I Am to Worship, won a Dove award (like a Christian Grammy) in 2003, and has been watched in various versions more than 100m times on YouTube. On a typical Sunday, Ali Herbert, another Gas Street minister, tells me that they get about 600 or 700 people, including children, across three gatherings (not \u201cservices\u201d any more). They estimate that 70% of the congregation is under 30. So far, both Hughes and Herbert are happy with the new church\u2019s progress, although of course it is hard to know how much of the congregation considered themselves Anglican already. Gas Street has done some marketing and work on social media, but for Hughes, the key will be word of mouth. \u201cThe way I think you grow, is you envision and equip people to invite their friends,\u201d he says. Besides planting itself in new areas, the Church of England is also using its \u00a38bn investment fund to be more creative with what they offer, especially when it means offering something that laypeople definitely like. In cathedrals, this has taken shape in zany schemes like the helter-skelter installed in Norwich over the summer, or the crazy golf in Rochester. Elsewhere, plans for the Fountains church in Bradford include a gym and a cafe within the complex. St Thomas, Norwich, has pioneered \u201csports ministry\u201d, providing holiday clubs, five-a-side pitches, netball and other fitness groups to local people. Meanwhile, churches in poorer communities offer debt advice, school uniforms, food banks and other services to help people on low incomes. The plan is that successfully planted big city churches will go on to plant other smaller ones, using the good ideas they learned along the way. Debbie Clinton, director of Renewal and Reform at the Church of England, says: \u201cParticularly over the last few years, we have been trying to look more intentionally at some of the bigger areas. I think the starting place for us is that there are lots of people in cities. Then you start to zoom down in the particular cities. \u201cSo some will have a very high student population, and we would look and see, are the churches engaging with that population? If not, let\u2019s go and see how we might do that. In other cities we might look at areas of urban deprivation, particularly in housing estates around the fringes of cities. In central London, we\u2019re looking at workplace populations, where people commute long distances. So what can the church provide for people during the week?\u201d Ric Thorpe, bishop of Islington, has previously pointed out that small rural churches have a higher number of clergy per capita than those in urban areas. He said, \u201cIf we are an outward-facing church we need to position people where they\u2019re most needed. Eighty-three percent of people live in urban areas, but 83% of [church] finance doesn\u2019t go there. It should.\u201d There is a remorseless reality about the demographic challenge that the Church of England faces. From some angles, this search for a secret formula to bring city-dwellers back into church looks like the energetic and imaginative relaunch of a video rental shop. Although, ironically, the scarcity of young Anglicans in the wider world might increase the church\u2019s appeal to those who remain. \u201cIt\u2019s like family,\u201d says Hazel Lynch. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to describe it.\u201d Lynch is 22, a recent graduate of the University of Birmingham, and studying for an MA in theology. She has been interested in religion all her life, but not once had a housemate who was Christian. \u201cBefore I meet people I think they\u2019re going to be a bit standoffish about it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut actually my experience through uni was people being really open.\u201d Many of her friends even came to Gas Street with her, to see what it was like. For Lynch, on the other hand, Gas Street is one place where she is no longer a curiosity. \u201cI walked through the door, and just felt at home,\u201d she says. * Some names have been changed Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "body": "<p>In 2017, a poll in the UK asked: \u201cWhose opinion do you trust the most when they talk about their field of expertise?\u201d Nurses came first \u2013 84% trust them. Politicians came last. Economists were second from bottom on 25%.This trust deficit is mirrored by the fact that the consensus of economists (when it exists) is often systematically different from the views of ordinary citizens. The Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago regularly asks a group of about 40 prominent academic economists their views on core economic topics. Working with the economist Stefanie Stantcheva, we ran a survey: we selected 10 of the questions that were asked of the Booth panel and put them to 10,000 Americans.</p> <p>On most of these issues, our respondents were sharply at odds with economists. For example, every single member of the <a href=\"http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/steel-and-aluminum-tariffs\" title=\"\">Booth panel disagreed</a> with the proposition that \u201cimposing new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/trade-war-what-you-need-to-know-about-us-steel-tariffs\" title=\"\">US tariffs on steel</a> and aluminium will improve Americans\u2019 wellbeing\u201d. Only a third of our respondents shared their view. And the gap is not only because people are not informed of what economists think: telling them does not seem to <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.3.636\" title=\"\">change their opinion</a> one bit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Economists are often too wrapped up in models and methods, and sometimes forget where science ends and ideology begins</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is troubling, because questions of economics and economic policy are central to the present crisis. Is migration actually threatening the livelihoods of poor workers? Has international trade worsened inequality? Should we worry about the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\" title=\"\">artificial intelligence</a> or celebrate it? Why are our societies becoming increasingly unequal, and what can we (or should we) do about it? How can society help all those people whom the markets leave behind?</p> <p>Economists have a lot to say about these big issues: they study immigration to see what it does to wages, taxation to determine if it discourages enterprise, redistribution through social programmes to figure out whether it encourages sloth. They have long worried about what happens when nations trade. They have worked hard to understand why some countries grow and others don\u2019t, and what, if anything, governments can do to help. They gather data on what makes people generous or wary, what makes a man leave home and migrate to a strange place, how social media plays on our prejudices. The most recent research often has surprising things to say about all these issues \u2013 especially to those used to the pat answers coming from old high school textbooks and TV \u201ceconomists\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that when economists and the public have different views the economists are always right. We, the economists, are often too wrapped up in our models and methods and sometimes forget where science ends and ideology begins. But good economics can be a source of hope \u2013 a way to understand what went wrong but also to explain how our world can be put back together, as long as we are honest in our diagnosis of the problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e68aac65d870349630575ae1c270955c9d6ce7aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e68aac65d870349630575ae1c270955c9d6ce7aa/0_369_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child wait for a plate of food at a soup kitchen in Salta province, Argentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018How can society help all those people whom the markets leave behind?\u2019 A child wait for a plate of food at a soup kitchen in Salta province, Argentina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Corbalan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For that to happen, we need to understand what undermines trust in economists. Part of the problem is that there is plenty of bad economics around. The self-proclaimed economists on TV and in the press \u2013 chief economist of Bank X or Firm Y \u2013 are, with important exceptions, primarily spokespeople for their firms\u2019 economic interests, who often feel free to ignore the weight of the evidence. Moreover, they have a relatively predictable slant towards market optimism at all costs, which is what the public associates with economists in general. It does not help that there is a class of economists who make predictions about broad trends in the economy, which often turn out to be wrong.</p> <p>Another part of the problem is that, especially in the UK and the US, a lot of the economics that has filtered into government thinking is the most beholden to orthodoxy, and the least able to pay attention to any fact that does not square with it. Economists are therefore naturally seen as those who keep repeating that regulations, taxes, and public spending all need to be slashed to let the market be, and that eventually everything will all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/why-are-we-still-pretending-trickle-down-economics-work\" title=\"\">\u201ctrickle down\u201d</a> to the poor, even as we watch inequality exploding.</p> <p>But good economics is much less strident, and quite different. It is less like the hard sciences and more like engineering or plumbing: it breaks big problems into manageable chunks and tries to solve them with a pragmatic approach \u2013 a combination of intuition and theory, trial and acknowledged errors. Good economics starts with some facts that are troubling, makes some guesses based on what we already know about human behaviour and theories that have been shown to work, uses data to test those guesses, refines (or radically alters) its line of attack based on the new set of facts and, eventually, with some luck, gets to a solution.</p> <p>We have spent our careers studying the poor, trying to apply this kind of experimental approach to the problems they face. Instead of relying on our intuition, or that of others, we set up large-scale, rigorous randomised controlled trials to understand what works, what does not work, and why. We are not alone: this movement has taken hold in economics. The <a href=\"https://www.povertyactionlab.org/\" title=\"\">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)</a>, the network we co-founded in 2013, has 400 affiliated or invited researchers, and together they have finished or are working on nearly a thousand projects on topics as different as the impact of sleep on productivity and happiness, and the role of incentives for tax collectors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2984b9fd7aa51ade3b6f898dd382c98868bb3c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2984b9fd7aa51ade3b6f898dd382c98868bb3c2/0_138_3186_1912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A homeless man outside Victoria Station in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Economists have a tendency to adopt a notion of wellbeing that is often too narrow \u2013 some version of income or material consumption.\u2019 A homeless man outside Victoria Station in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This work is starting to make a difference. To date, 400 million people have been touched by policies that J-PAL affiliates have shown to be effective. Just as importantly, although no single project offers a definitive answer, together they allow us to understand much better some of the mechanisms behind the persistence of poverty. While our own beat has mostly been the poor countries, there are many others doing good economics in countries like the US, which can help shed light on the big issues our societies are grappling with.</p> <p>Economists have a tendency to adopt a notion of wellbeing that is often too narrow \u2013 some version of income or material consumption. Yet we know in our guts that a fulfilling life needs much more than that: the respect of the community, the comforts of family and friends, dignity, lightness, pleasure. The focus on income alone is not just a convenient shortcut \u2013 it is a distorting lens that has often led the smartest economists down the wrong path, and policymakers to the wrong decisions. This is a big part of what persuades so many of us that the whole world is waiting at the door to steal our well-paying jobs. It is what has led to a single-minded focus on restoring the western nations to some glorious past of rapid economic growth. It is also what makes the trade-off between the growth of the economy and the survival of the planet seem so stark.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/29/global-protest-children-financial-crash-hong-kong-london\">This wave of global protest is being led by the children of the financial crash | Jack Shenker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A better conversation must start by acknowledging the deep human desire for dignity and human contact \u2013 and treating it not as a distraction but as a better way to understand each other, and to set ourselves free from what may appear to be unresolvable contradictions.</p> <p>Restoring human dignity to its central place has the potential to set off a profound rethinking of economic priorities and the ways in which societies care for their members, particularly when they are in need.

      "bodyText": "In 2017, a poll in the UK asked: \u201cWhose opinion do you trust the most when they talk about their field of expertise?\u201d Nurses came first \u2013 84% trust them. Politicians came last. Economists were second from bottom on 25%.This trust deficit is mirrored by the fact that the consensus of economists (when it exists) is often systematically different from the views of ordinary citizens. The Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago regularly asks a group of about 40 prominent academic economists their views on core economic topics. Working with the economist Stefanie Stantcheva, we ran a survey: we selected 10 of the questions that were asked of the Booth panel and put them to 10,000 Americans. On most of these issues, our respondents were sharply at odds with economists. For example, every single member of the Booth panel disagreed with the proposition that \u201cimposing new US tariffs on steel and aluminium will improve Americans\u2019 wellbeing\u201d. Only a third of our respondents shared their view. And the gap is not only because people are not informed of what economists think: telling them does not seem to change their opinion one bit. This is troubling, because questions of economics and economic policy are central to the present crisis. Is migration actually threatening the livelihoods of poor workers? Has international trade worsened inequality? Should we worry about the rise of artificial intelligence or celebrate it? Why are our societies becoming increasingly unequal, and what can we (or should we) do about it? How can society help all those people whom the markets leave behind? Economists have a lot to say about these big issues: they study immigration to see what it does to wages, taxation to determine if it discourages enterprise, redistribution through social programmes to figure out whether it encourages sloth. They have long worried about what happens when nations trade. They have worked hard to understand why some countries grow and others don\u2019t, and what, if anything, governments can do to help. They gather data on what makes people generous or wary, what makes a man leave home and migrate to a strange place, how social media plays on our prejudices. The most recent research often has surprising things to say about all these issues \u2013 especially to those used to the pat answers coming from old high school textbooks and TV \u201ceconomists\u201d. It\u2019s not that when economists and the public have different views the economists are always right. We, the economists, are often too wrapped up in our models and methods and sometimes forget where science ends and ideology begins. But good economics can be a source of hope \u2013 a way to understand what went wrong but also to explain how our world can be put back together, as long as we are honest in our diagnosis of the problems. For that to happen, we need to understand what undermines trust in economists. Part of the problem is that there is plenty of bad economics around. The self-proclaimed economists on TV and in the press \u2013 chief economist of Bank X or Firm Y \u2013 are, with important exceptions, primarily spokespeople for their firms\u2019 economic interests, who often feel free to ignore the weight of the evidence. Moreover, they have a relatively predictable slant towards market optimism at all costs, which is what the public associates with economists in general. It does not help that there is a class of economists who make predictions about broad trends in the economy, which often turn out to be wrong. Another part of the problem is that, especially in the UK and the US, a lot of the economics that has filtered into government thinking is the most beholden to orthodoxy, and the least able to pay attention to any fact that does not square with it. Economists are therefore naturally seen as those who keep repeating that regulations, taxes, and public spending all need to be slashed to let the market be, and that eventually everything will all \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the poor, even as we watch inequality exploding. But good economics is much less strident, and quite different. It is less like the hard sciences and more like engineering or plumbing: it breaks big problems into manageable chunks and tries to solve them with a pragmatic approach \u2013 a combination of intuition and theory, trial and acknowledged errors. Good economics starts with some facts that are troubling, makes some guesses based on what we already know about human behaviour and theories that have been shown to work, uses data to test those guesses, refines (or radically alters) its line of attack based on the new set of facts and, eventually, with some luck, gets to a solution. We have spent our careers studying the poor, trying to apply this kind of experimental approach to the problems they face. Instead of relying on our intuition, or that of others, we set up large-scale, rigorous randomised controlled trials to understand what works, what does not work, and why. We are not alone: this movement has taken hold in economics. The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), the network we co-founded in 2013, has 400 affiliated or invited researchers, and together they have finished or are working on nearly a thousand projects on topics as different as the impact of sleep on productivity and happiness, and the role of incentives for tax collectors. This work is starting to make a difference. To date, 400 million people have been touched by policies that J-PAL affiliates have shown to be effective. Just as importantly, although no single project offers a definitive answer, together they allow us to understand much better some of the mechanisms behind the persistence of poverty. While our own beat has mostly been the poor countries, there are many others doing good economics in countries like the US, which can help shed light on the big issues our societies are grappling with. Economists have a tendency to adopt a notion of wellbeing that is often too narrow \u2013 some version of income or material consumption. Yet we know in our guts that a fulfilling life needs much more than that: the respect of the community, the comforts of family and friends, dignity, lightness, pleasure. The focus on income alone is not just a convenient shortcut \u2013 it is a distorting lens that has often led the smartest economists down the wrong path, and policymakers to the wrong decisions. This is a big part of what persuades so many of us that the whole world is waiting at the door to steal our well-paying jobs. It is what has led to a single-minded focus on restoring the western nations to some glorious past of rapid economic growth. It is also what makes the trade-off between the growth of the economy and the survival of the planet seem so stark. A better conversation must start by acknowledging the deep human desire for dignity and human contact \u2013 and treating it not as a distraction but as a better way to understand each other, and to set ourselves free from what may appear to be unresolvable contradictions. Restoring human dignity to its central place has the potential to set off a profound rethinking of economic priorities and the ways in which societies care for their members, particularly when they are in need. At the very least, this should help persuade some of the disaffected that economics is about them as well, and that we economists have useful contributions to make to the rebuilding that must happen. \u2022 Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee are joint winners of the 2019 Nobel prize in economic sciences and the authors of Good Economics for Hard Times: Better Answers to Our Biggest Problems, published by Allen Lane",

One of her most publicized platforms is lobbying for strippers to be classified as employees in Oregon.</p> <p>Most strippers in the US are deemed independent contractors. They\u2019re paid in tips, rather than an hourly wage or salary.</p> <p>\u201cMany of them prefer the freedom to schedule their own shifts, wear whatever they want, do the job in the way they want, work for competitors even,\u201d said the labor lawyer Rich Meneghello. \u201cNow if they became employees, a lot of that freedom goes away.\u201d</p> <p>But freedom also means contractors don\u2019t pay into social security or Medicare, are not eligible for sick leave, overtime or unemployment benefits and are not protected in the same way as employees from workplace harassment.</p> <p>In addition, as contractors, strippers essentially have to pay to work, through what are called stage or house fees. They can range anywhere from five dollars to well over a hundred. It\u2019s a \u201cpay for the pole\u201d policy that is typically meant to cover expenses like advertising and club maintenance.</p> <p>If they\u2019re late to a shift, get sick or don\u2019t make enough in a night to pay those fees, the stripper then owes \u201cback rent\u201d to the club.</p> <p>In January this year, a Democratic state senator, Kathleen Taylor, introduced a bill that would have classified strippers as employees. The bill was eventually laid to rest, marking the third attempt to get this type of legislation passed.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1202&amp;context=mcnair\">study by Portland State University</a>, because Portland strippers don\u2019t require a permit, can perform fully nude, allow clients to touch them with consent during private dances, and, as contractors, lack protection from workplace agencies, \u201cthe research suggests that exotic dancers are at risk of experiencing various forms of violence while at work with limited resources to turn to for help\u201d.</p> <p>Of 33 strippers who participated in the study, 32 reported experiencing some form of violence while at work, while 84% reported they had experienced \u201cunwanted groping, rape, forced or coerced unwanted sexual acts\u201d.</p> <p>Elle Stanger, who dances at Portland\u2019s Lucky Devil Lounge, is fiercely committed to maintaining her independent contractor status. She makes good money, has control over her performances and schedule, and keeps all her earnings from private dances.</p> <p>But she recognizes that her club is not all clubs, which means there\u2019s no silver bullet solution.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to caution people to be wary of a quick fix approach to labor problems, when the issues tend to be so different in some cases,\u201d said Stanger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aafbde2caf7932be5c4ee9bbf2294449bcf70c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aafbde2caf7932be5c4ee9bbf2294449bcf70c5d/0_25_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stripper and podcaster Elle Stanger, who has been co-organizing the Portland Slutwalk in Portland, Oregon, since 2014.

At first sight, it sounds good.</p> <p>But Stanger, who co-hosts the sex worker industry podcast <a href=\"https://strangebedfellowspdx.com/your-hosts\">Strange Bedfellows</a>, has been asking for feedback from strippers in California who have recently become employees. According to Stanger, the majority say the bill is damaging to their industry, claiming lower earnings and fewer bookings.</p> <p>Stanger foresees clubs forced to fire dancers, simply because they won\u2019t be able to afford their wages.</p> <p>\u201cI heard from dancers who said: \u2018I was deemed too fat for my club.\u2019 Or due to racist management practices, they cut a lot of dancers of color,\u201d said Stanger.</p> <p>Aaliyah Topps, who danced in Seattle, said she believed club managers and owners favored Caucasian strippers. \u201cI know multiple girls who aren\u2019t allowed back to the club due to back rent and most of these are women of color. They don\u2019t advertise women of color on any flyers, posters or websites,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Topps is part of a coalition called <a href=\"http://www.workingwa.org/strippersareworkers\">Strippers Are Workers</a>, which formed in the summer of 2018 through the not-for-profit Working Washington. It was co-founded by the dancer Angelique, who declined to offer her last name. She works at one of the only clubs in Seattle that is not owned by D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, which runs roughly 132 strip clubs in 41 states. It owns 11 of Washington\u2019s 14 strip clubs.</p> <p>\u201cMore and more customers were becoming aggressive, they were starting to not pay for services,\u201d said Angelique of why she started the coalition. \u201c[The clubs] were treating us like employees in terms of scheduling us, having control over our work and setting our prices, which is illegal.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition took its complaints to the Washington legislature last October. Topps, who stripped at D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, testified about the lack of running water at the club, having to use a portable toilet as a restroom, harassment from management, and the $140 to $200 stage fees the dancers had to pay the club per night, which can quickly become back rent.</p> <p>This May, Strippers Are Workers succeeded in getting <a href=\"http://www.workingwa.org/strippersareworkers/hb1756\">House Bill 1756</a> passed. It\u2019s a landslide piece of legislation for the sex worker industry that requires Washington strip clubs to install panic buttons in VIP rooms; offers a Know Your Rights training for dancers who apply for a business license; creates a record and \u201cblacklist\u201d of violent customers; and establishes an advisory committee to help implement and enforce the bill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/29/make-yourselves-at-home-the-meaning-of-hospitality-in-a-divided-world\">Make yourselves at home: the meaning of hospitality in a divided world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The efforts in Washington echo another reform movement in Minneapolis.

And it\u2019s just made with love.\u201d Julie Flores, a stripper at Club Rogue, said her favorite was the Cha Cha Cha, which blends brown rice, citrus slaw, black olives, avocado and tortilla chips. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really good, clean option for us,\u201d said Flores. \u201cWhere I work, we just have fried shit, like wings. So [Meals 4 Heels] provides wholesome meals that fuel our bodies, because every time I come home I feel like I just did a workout.\u201d Late-night employees would be hard pressed to find food options that are open at 2am and not teeming with trans fats and cholesterol. But a healthy diet is just one of the issues facing Portland\u2019s sex workers and strippers. Matilda Bickers, a former stripper, and Amy Pitts, another dancer, sued Portland\u2019s Casa Diablo strip club in 2015, citing unpaid wages and harassment, on the part of the customers and employees. They settled out of court. Since then, Bickers, who now works as an escort, has been a vocal proponent of sex workers\u2019 rights in the city. One of her most publicized platforms is lobbying for strippers to be classified as employees in Oregon. Most strippers in the US are deemed independent contractors. They\u2019re paid in tips, rather than an hourly wage or salary. \u201cMany of them prefer the freedom to schedule their own shifts, wear whatever they want, do the job in the way they want, work for competitors even,\u201d said the labor lawyer Rich Meneghello. \u201cNow if they became employees, a lot of that freedom goes away.\u201d But freedom also means contractors don\u2019t pay into social security or Medicare, are not eligible for sick leave, overtime or unemployment benefits and are not protected in the same way as employees from workplace harassment. In addition, as contractors, strippers essentially have to pay to work, through what are called stage or house fees. They can range anywhere from five dollars to well over a hundred. It\u2019s a \u201cpay for the pole\u201d policy that is typically meant to cover expenses like advertising and club maintenance. If they\u2019re late to a shift, get sick or don\u2019t make enough in a night to pay those fees, the stripper then owes \u201cback rent\u201d to the club. In January this year, a Democratic state senator, Kathleen Taylor, introduced a bill that would have classified strippers as employees. The bill was eventually laid to rest, marking the third attempt to get this type of legislation passed. According to a study by Portland State University, because Portland strippers don\u2019t require a permit, can perform fully nude, allow clients to touch them with consent during private dances, and, as contractors, lack protection from workplace agencies, \u201cthe research suggests that exotic dancers are at risk of experiencing various forms of violence while at work with limited resources to turn to for help\u201d. Of 33 strippers who participated in the study, 32 reported experiencing some form of violence while at work, while 84% reported they had experienced \u201cunwanted groping, rape, forced or coerced unwanted sexual acts\u201d. Elle Stanger, who dances at Portland\u2019s Lucky Devil Lounge, is fiercely committed to maintaining her independent contractor status. She makes good money, has control over her performances and schedule, and keeps all her earnings from private dances. But she recognizes that her club is not all clubs, which means there\u2019s no silver bullet solution. \u201cI just want to caution people to be wary of a quick fix approach to labor problems, when the issues tend to be so different in some cases,\u201d said Stanger. In neighboring California, a bill passed the legislature in September that designates independent contractors in several industries as employees, including strippers. At first sight, it sounds good. But Stanger, who co-hosts the sex worker industry podcast Strange Bedfellows, has been asking for feedback from strippers in California who have recently become employees. According to Stanger, the majority say the bill is damaging to their industry, claiming lower earnings and fewer bookings. Stanger foresees clubs forced to fire dancers, simply because they won\u2019t be able to afford their wages. \u201cI heard from dancers who said: \u2018I was deemed too fat for my club.\u2019 Or due to racist management practices, they cut a lot of dancers of color,\u201d said Stanger. Aaliyah Topps, who danced in Seattle, said she believed club managers and owners favored Caucasian strippers. \u201cI know multiple girls who aren\u2019t allowed back to the club due to back rent and most of these are women of color. They don\u2019t advertise women of color on any flyers, posters or websites,\u201d she said. Topps is part of a coalition called Strippers Are Workers, which formed in the summer of 2018 through the not-for-profit Working Washington. It was co-founded by the dancer Angelique, who declined to offer her last name. She works at one of the only clubs in Seattle that is not owned by D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, which runs roughly 132 strip clubs in 41 states. It owns 11 of Washington\u2019s 14 strip clubs. \u201cMore and more customers were becoming aggressive, they were starting to not pay for services,\u201d said Angelique of why she started the coalition. \u201c[The clubs] were treating us like employees in terms of scheduling us, having control over our work and setting our prices, which is illegal.\u201d The coalition took its complaints to the Washington legislature last October. Topps, who stripped at D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, testified about the lack of running water at the club, having to use a portable toilet as a restroom, harassment from management, and the $140 to $200 stage fees the dancers had to pay the club per night, which can quickly become back rent. This May, Strippers Are Workers succeeded in getting House Bill 1756 passed. It\u2019s a landslide piece of legislation for the sex worker industry that requires Washington strip clubs to install panic buttons in VIP rooms; offers a Know Your Rights training for dancers who apply for a business license; creates a record and \u201cblacklist\u201d of violent customers; and establishes an advisory committee to help implement and enforce the bill. The efforts in Washington echo another reform movement in Minneapolis. In August, its city council unanimously voted in a new ordinance that mandates adult entertainment workers receive a copy of their contracts, prohibits retaliation against those who report violations and requires businesses to post customer conduct and workers\u2019 rights information. Back in Portland, Nikeisah Newton knows the importance of lifting up those who are sidelined \u2013 as a gay, black woman working for the sex worker industry: \u201cIt\u2019s all about marginalized groups. We\u2019ve got to take care of each other.\u201d",

She started behind the bar in 1957, when she began going out with John, who would become her husband. His father, Eric, managed the pub. \u201cIt was the first pub I had ever been in,\u201d Hallworth remembers. \u201cI\u2019d come and stand at the bar when John was working. And then my father-in-law said: \u2018It\u2019s no use you standing there! Get behind the bar and get something done.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Bar work didn\u2019t come easily to her at first. \u201cI was a nervous wreck.

Yvonne has struggled at times. She has gone through two recessions. Pub life isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard work. You put in so many hours \u2013 it\u2019s not an eight-hour day. You\u2019ve got to be dedicated.\u201d</p> <p>Despite a life spent around alcohol, Hallworth doesn\u2019t actually drink. \u201cMy husband used to ask: \u2018Is there nothing you like the look of?\u2019\u201d Yet she has witnessed changing drinking habits: before, you\u2019d struggle to get people out of the pub after last orders. \u201cYou\u2019d have to shout at them to drink up. Now, people drink earlier. You can lock up more easily.\u201d</p> <p>Hallworth still does five two-hour shifts a week. She\u2019ll carry food from the kitchen and pull pints, although she has stopped changing barrels. \u201cI like the social side of it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBeing able to talk to people. Since my husband died, it has been a blessing for me to keep coming in here and meeting people, rather than being on my own.\u201d</p> <p>The pub still has customers whom Hallworth served in the 80s and 90s. \u201cThey say: \u2018You don\u2019t look any different, June.\u2019 I say: \u2018I must have looked like an old-so-and-so 20 years ago.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although Hallworth never thought she would work in a pub her whole life, she is at peace with how things turned out. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other life.

And passengers can be tricky. \u201cYou can get some very aggressive passengers,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when they\u2019re shouting at you, you have to stay cool and calm.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, Talbot took leave from National Express to do a six-month tour of Afghanistan as an army reserve sergeant. \u201cI just loved that green uniform,\u201d Talbot says of his parallel career. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in weapons. I thought: the only way to fire a gun is to be in the army.\u201d</p> <p>He loves his driving job because he\u2019s a sociable person. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to have a good talk with the passengers \u2026 a bit of banter. You can\u2019t just drive like a robot and not say anything.\u201d Almost everyone on Talbot\u2019s route, the 94 from Birmingham to Chelmsley Wood, knows him. \u201cThey say: \u2018You\u2019re my favourite driver \u2026 what\u2019s up?\u2019 Everyone says hello to me.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, Talbot qualified as a master bus driver, a title conferred by National Express on drivers with \u201can impeccable safety record and driving skills\u201d. It was a proud achievement. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a master driver, you have to wear a white shirt and blue tie. People asked me about it, and I said: \u2018As it says on the tin \u2013 master driver!

Serving the children. \u201cEspecially when they come back and say: \u2018Miss, can we have seconds?\u2019 Your job feels worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>Why does Barrett love her job so much? \u201cIt\u2019s the babies! They\u2019re lovely,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like cooking for your family.\u201d Barrett\u2019s grandchildren, Charlie and Chanel, went to St Ursula\u2019s \u2013 but she is adamant that she didn\u2019t slip them any extra treats. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get any special treatment.\u201d</p> <p>When Barrett started, everything was prepared from scratch. They made meat puddings, mince-and-onion pie and toad-in-the-hole. The 90s marked the advent of processed food. But with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/mar/29/jamie-oliver-school-dinners-meals\" title=\"\">Jamie Oliver\u2019s healthy school dinners campaign</a> in the 00s, the pendulum swung back. \u201cWe have gone back to how things were before,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cFresh meat and fresh veg.\u201d She welcomes it. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better for the children. Now, we hardly fry at all. Everything goes in the oven.\u201d The one constant? Fish and chips on a Friday.</p> <p>Technology, however, has transformed the job. Once, Barrett was one of a team of 11 school meals supervisors. Now, she leads a team of four, who make 290 meals daily. Every morning, the children will choose from three meal options on an iPad in their classrooms and the orders will then come through to Barrett. \u201cI like the technology,\u201d she says. \u201cI found it quite easy to adopt.\u201d</p> <p>Barrett thinks she is a good employee because she never gave her bosses any trouble. \u201cI go into work, do my job properly and help out where I can. If they needed me to cater functions now and again for visitors, I\u2019d always say yes.\u201d</p> <p>Being around children keeps her young, she thinks. \u201cI should have retired, but I don\u2019t want to. Please, God, I want to go on as long as I can. That\u2019s how much I love it. I don\u2019t get bored of it.\u201d</p> <p>Barrett didn\u2019t plan to spend her working life at the same school \u2013 things just turned out that way. \u201cI never thought I would be here as long as this.

      "bodyText": "In the future, the people who spend their careers doing the same job will be historical curios, the workplace equivalent of a narwhal\u2019s tusk. We\u2019ll look at them, and marvel at how much careers have changed. Technology has profoundly transformed the nature of the work we do. The Office for National Statistics predicts that 1.5 million British workers risk losing their jobs as a result of automation, with farm workers, waiting staff and shelf fillers notably at risk. At the same time, globalisation has decimated UK manufacturing, with jobs outsourced to developing nations with cheaper workforces and fewer labour protections. The rise of the gig economy has also seen a growing number of people in precarious, low-paid temporary work, without the perks of permanent employees: maternity leave, sick pay or a pension. What this means is that the halcyon days of a job for life are slipping away. The future is coming for us, whether we want it or not. But it is not here just yet. There are still people who have proudly spent their entire lives with one company. What can we learn about the world of work from the most loyal employees? The tailor Andrew Gomez, 80, Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Savile Row Andrew Gomez is pinning a summer jacket in navy-blue Italian wool, a silver thimble on his right forefinger, when I arrive. He has worked here, in the basement workshop underneath the luxuriously appointed showroom of Gieves &amp; Hawkes, for 45 years. After training as a tailor in his native Spain, Gomez came to Gieves &amp; Hawkes in September 1974 looking for a job. They asked him to tailor a \u201cfull baste\u201d \u2013 which means he had to half make a bespoke suit \u2013 as a test. After inspecting it, the manager asked him to come in the next Monday. \u201cThey fell in love with my work,\u201d Gomez laughs. He didn\u2019t plan to spend his career at Gieves &amp; Hawkes. But every time Gomez muttered about leaving, his bosses would give him a pay rise. \u201cThey said: \u2018We\u2019ll give you the money you want! No one else will pay you more than us. You\u2019ll have a job for life.\u2019\u201d So he stayed. Time passed. He was a speedy \u2013 and hard \u2013 worker. \u201cNo one ever complained about my work, or gave me anything back to redo,\u201d he says proudly. \u201cI always did my best.\u201d He believes this is why he has lasted so long in the organisation. \u201cYou cannot just work for money,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cYou have a responsibility to do a proper job. You have to make the effort every single day, otherwise the job will go wrong.\u201d Nearly half a century on, Gomez has made, by his own estimation, 15,000 jackets. But he isn\u2019t ready to retire yet. \u201cMy wife and daughter tell me off all the time. They say: \u2018Why do you work? Why don\u2019t you retire?\u2019 But I wouldn\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t want to stay home and be bored.\u201d The bar worker June Hallworth, 81, the Davenport Arms, Stockport, Greater Manchester The Davenport Arms \u2013 known locally as the Thief\u2019s Neck \u2013 has been in Hallworth\u2019s family for 87 years. She started behind the bar in 1957, when she began going out with John, who would become her husband. His father, Eric, managed the pub. \u201cIt was the first pub I had ever been in,\u201d Hallworth remembers. \u201cI\u2019d come and stand at the bar when John was working. And then my father-in-law said: \u2018It\u2019s no use you standing there! Get behind the bar and get something done.\u2019\u201d Bar work didn\u2019t come easily to her at first. \u201cI was a nervous wreck. People would be asking for drinks, and I didn\u2019t understand what they meant.\u201d With time came confidence. \u201cI could stand up for myself and answer people back, rather than being meek and mild.\u201d John died 18 years ago. Hallworth\u2019s daughter Yvonne runs the pub now. It\u2019s an increasingly difficult trade to be in \u2013 more than 25% of British pubs have closed since 2001 \u2013 and Hallworth worries about Yvonne\u2019s future. \u201cJohn and I had the best years of it. Yvonne has struggled at times. She has gone through two recessions. Pub life isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard work. You put in so many hours \u2013 it\u2019s not an eight-hour day. You\u2019ve got to be dedicated.\u201d Despite a life spent around alcohol, Hallworth doesn\u2019t actually drink. \u201cMy husband used to ask: \u2018Is there nothing you like the look of?\u2019\u201d Yet she has witnessed changing drinking habits: before, you\u2019d struggle to get people out of the pub after last orders. \u201cYou\u2019d have to shout at them to drink up. Now, people drink earlier. You can lock up more easily.\u201d Hallworth still does five two-hour shifts a week. She\u2019ll carry food from the kitchen and pull pints, although she has stopped changing barrels. \u201cI like the social side of it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBeing able to talk to people. Since my husband died, it has been a blessing for me to keep coming in here and meeting people, rather than being on my own.\u201d The pub still has customers whom Hallworth served in the 80s and 90s. \u201cThey say: \u2018You don\u2019t look any different, June.\u2019 I say: \u2018I must have looked like an old-so-and-so 20 years ago.\u2019\u201d Although Hallworth never thought she would work in a pub her whole life, she is at peace with how things turned out. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other life. I\u2019ve been quite happy.\u201d The bus driver Neil Talbot, 56, National Express, Birmingham. The first time Talbot saw a doubledecker bus, he remembers thinking: \u201c\u2018Yes!\u2019 It had always been a dream to drive a doubledecker bus,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to get into that chair.\u201d He applied to National Express in 1990 and never looked back. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I clipped a few car mirrors when I started,\u201d Talbot admits. And passengers can be tricky. \u201cYou can get some very aggressive passengers,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when they\u2019re shouting at you, you have to stay cool and calm.\u201d In 2013, Talbot took leave from National Express to do a six-month tour of Afghanistan as an army reserve sergeant. \u201cI just loved that green uniform,\u201d Talbot says of his parallel career. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in weapons. I thought: the only way to fire a gun is to be in the army.\u201d He loves his driving job because he\u2019s a sociable person. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to have a good talk with the passengers \u2026 a bit of banter. You can\u2019t just drive like a robot and not say anything.\u201d Almost everyone on Talbot\u2019s route, the 94 from Birmingham to Chelmsley Wood, knows him. \u201cThey say: \u2018You\u2019re my favourite driver \u2026 what\u2019s up?\u2019 Everyone says hello to me.\u201d In 2017, Talbot qualified as a master bus driver, a title conferred by National Express on drivers with \u201can impeccable safety record and driving skills\u201d. It was a proud achievement. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a master driver, you have to wear a white shirt and blue tie. People asked me about it, and I said: \u2018As it says on the tin \u2013 master driver! I\u2019m one of the best in the pack.\u2019\u201d I ask him why he has stayed in the same job for nearly three decades. \u201cYou have to be passionate about what you\u2019re doing. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. If I weren\u2019t, I\u2019d have gone ages ago. This is the job for me. I just love talking to the passengers. I\u2019m a people person.\u201d And the best seat on the bus? \u201cThe driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Talbot laughs. Of course.

      "body": "<h2>Conservatives</h2> <p><strong>Preparedness<br></strong>The Conservatives have been obviously preparing for a general election since the summer. The signs were all there, even while Boris Johnson was insisting he did not want to go to the polls, with the appointment of Isaac Levido, a protege of Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, as campaigns director. Two women from a thinktank background, Munira Mirza and Rachel Wolf, have been writing the party\u2019s manifesto for months. MPs have been hitting the phones canvassing, and special advisers are expecting to be assigned roles in Conservative party headquarters and on the campaign. \u201cWe are much more advanced than when Theresa May called her election in 2017,\u201d says one adviser.</p> <p>The party has had a bounce in membership since Johnson became prime minister but its ground campaign is traditionally less impressive than Labour\u2019s network of activists. However, it has a big war chest of donations built up, after raising more than \u00a35m in the second quarter of the year, and money is expected to be ploughed into social media and mailshots.</p> <p><strong>Policies<br></strong>Johnson\u2019s big slogan will be a promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by passing his deal through parliament, banking on weariness in the country about a further referendum. He will therefore ramp up his claims that parliament frustrated his efforts to implement Brexit before his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline of 31 October, which he may be punished for failing to meet. Casting it as a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Johnson portraying himself on the side of the electorate, the Tories want to frame their leader as an anti-establishment candidate despite his privileged background and a lifetime spent in politics and the media.</p> <p>The prime minister will also want some focus on domestic policies, after May\u2019s 2017 campaign was criticised for promoting her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership at the expense of any eye-catching offers for voters. He will concentrate on law and order, believing this is a strong suit because the Tories are pledging more police officers.

But they do have an increasingly well-organised election machine and one energised by good results in May\u2019s local elections, where they gained 700-plus councillors, and the European elections saw them finish second, on nearly 20% of the vote.</p> <p>The party is also enjoying a real sense of momentum, growing in recent months from the 12-MP haul in the 2017 election to 19 now, a tally swelled by one byelection win and a series of defections from other parties. The final piece of the jigsaw is a new leader, with Jo Swinson taking over from Vince Cable in July, a choice largely welcomed by the party\u2019s MPs and members.</p> <p>The Lib Dem autumn conference in Bournemouth saw near-constant chatter about the number of seats the party could win in an imminent election, with predictions tending to start at about 40 and rise in accordance with ambition, excitement and the number of glasses of wine consumed.</p> <p>Many target seats will be in the southwest of England or in remain-minded urban seats such as several in leafy southwest London, or places such as Sheffield and Cambridge. The somewhat limited Lib Dem war chest will be offset by the fact the party\u2019s number of target seats, or those being defended, is smaller than for the Tories or Labour.</p> <p><strong>Policies<br></strong>Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit. There was a reason why Swinson insisted her party could only back an election if the government first shelved its withdrawal bill. The Lib Dems are the anti-leave party-in-chief, banking on outraged remain sentiment, plus a sense among voters that Labour is sitting on the fence, to propel them to significant gains. A key moment at the party\u2019s conference was the decision to commit to revoking Brexit in the admittedly unlikely event they win a majority in the Commons.</p> <p>Other than that, the party will campaign on areas such as supporting the NHS, investment in public transport and an increased focus on the climate emergency.</p> <p><strong>Campaign<br></strong>The Lib Dems are a traditionally localised party \u2013 to the regular annoyance of leaders past and present \u2013 but are also an increasingly slick campaigning machine. Expect daily TV shots of Swinson decamping from a shiny battlebus to deliver policy soundbites in a string of target seats.</p> <p>A novelty for the party will be the focus on the fight for new arrivals to take new seats, into which a fair amount of resources could be diverted \u2013 something which will not delight all party members. Key focuses will be Chuka Umunna, once of Labour, trying to take Cities of London and Westminster and ex-Tory Sam Gyimah in Kensington.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ac42e1949ab9696e51198ee4279a8a83773218b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ac42e1949ab9696e51198ee4279a8a83773218b/0_47_2988_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Brexit party are hoping to make significant inroads in Labour heartlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Brexit party are hoping to make significant inroads in Labour heartlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Brexit party</h2> <p><strong>Preparedness<br></strong>The Brexit party led by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is untested at a general election but they are hoping to make significant inroads in Labour\u2019s heartlands in northern England, Midlands and along the Kent coast \u2013 the areas they believe are out of bounds for Conservatives.</p> <p>On the number of seats they might gain they estimate it could be \u201csomewhere in the teens\u201d to 50, however they continue their offer of a pact with the Conservatives in order to return as many leave-supporting MPs to Westminster as possible.</p> <p>In return the Brexit party will want a seat at the top table if they were needed to prop up a Tory majority government with a greater say over future negotiations.

In the past 12 months, total donations have been below \u00a3200,000 and a fall in their vote share in the 2017 election led to a drop in official funding for parliamentary activity, forcing them to resort to a public crowdfunder to avoid laying off staff.</p> <p>That said, the Greens have an increasingly sophisticated election operation, and one that has expanded as its local councillors have spread. At May\u2019s local elections, the party won 200 councillors, something the leadership put down to years of carefully-targeted effort.</p> <p>As a campaign machine, the Greens have the advantage of two eloquent and telegenic co-leaders in Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, an arrangement that is no longer mocked, as happened when Bartley first co-led with Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP.</p> <p><strong>Policies<br></strong>The Greens\u2019 offer is a remain stance as strong as the Lib Dems, policies on the economy and social justice which they would argue are even more radical than Labour, plus an abiding commitment to tackling the climate emergency.</p> <p>The rueful half-joke about Green policies is that other parties spend several years mocking the ideas before quietly lifting them, as with Labour\u2019s interest in a universal basic income and the four-day working week.</p> <p>One paradox is that while the Greens have tried to expand their message beyond environmental issues, these are now high on the news agenda thanks to climate strikers such as Greta Thunberg and the actions of Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p><strong>Campaign<br></strong>Lucas\u2019s seat of Brighton Pavilion is now fairly safe, with the 1,200 majority she had when she took it from Labour now expanded to well over 14,000. However, the electoral system works strongly against the Greens and gains elsewhere seem unlikely.</p> <p>But with Lucas, Berry and Bartley all out campaigning, the party will hope at the very least for a result closer to 2015, when they took almost 4% of the total vote, as opposed to the 2017 result when a squeeze by the main parties pushed the Greens\u2019 return down to 1.9%.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 5 November 2019.

      "bodyText": "Conservatives Preparedness The Conservatives have been obviously preparing for a general election since the summer. The signs were all there, even while Boris Johnson was insisting he did not want to go to the polls, with the appointment of Isaac Levido, a protege of Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, as campaigns director. Two women from a thinktank background, Munira Mirza and Rachel Wolf, have been writing the party\u2019s manifesto for months. MPs have been hitting the phones canvassing, and special advisers are expecting to be assigned roles in Conservative party headquarters and on the campaign. \u201cWe are much more advanced than when Theresa May called her election in 2017,\u201d says one adviser. The party has had a bounce in membership since Johnson became prime minister but its ground campaign is traditionally less impressive than Labour\u2019s network of activists. However, it has a big war chest of donations built up, after raising more than \u00a35m in the second quarter of the year, and money is expected to be ploughed into social media and mailshots. Policies Johnson\u2019s big slogan will be a promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by passing his deal through parliament, banking on weariness in the country about a further referendum. He will therefore ramp up his claims that parliament frustrated his efforts to implement Brexit before his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline of 31 October, which he may be punished for failing to meet. Casting it as a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Johnson portraying himself on the side of the electorate, the Tories want to frame their leader as an anti-establishment candidate despite his privileged background and a lifetime spent in politics and the media. The prime minister will also want some focus on domestic policies, after May\u2019s 2017 campaign was criticised for promoting her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership at the expense of any eye-catching offers for voters. He will concentrate on law and order, believing this is a strong suit because the Tories are pledging more police officers. However, this backfired in 2017, when the opposition highlighted cuts to the police at a time when the country was reeling from terror attacks. Johnson has also been visiting hospitals and intends to promote his Vote Leave pledge to give another \u00a3350m a week to the NHS, although this is a risky ploy going head to head with Labour on their traditional turf. The campaign will also emphasise pledges on schools funding \u2013 despite this being another difficult area for the party in 2017 with voters unhappy about education cuts and years of austerity affecting the system. Campaign The campaign is set to be directed from CCHQ by Levido, who helped deliver Scott Morrison\u2019s shock victory in Australia for the Liberals. However, the extent of Crosby\u2019s role is unclear. Crosby is an old friend and associate of the prime minister, having run his mayoral campaigns and Tory elections in both 2015 and 2017. However, the pair fell out over Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, during Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign and one Tory adviser said Crosby was expected to be more \u201chands-off\u201d this time. The campaign is likely to take inspiration from the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, with a big emphasis on social media. The party has already been trialling new methods of catching people\u2019s attention with badly-designed memes that get people talking and therefore amplify its message. Two New Zealanders in their 20s, Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, who used to work as contractors for Crosby, have been employed to improve the party\u2019s online operations, after a disastrous 2017 election when the Tories were outgunned by Labour in internet campaigning. Labour Preparedness Labour raised just over \u00a32m in donations in the second quarter of this year\u2013 but in 2017, the party\u2019s coffers were significantly boosted during the campaign by large one-off donations from the trades union Unite and a flood of smaller donations from grassroots members. The party has been pressing ahead with the re-selection of sitting MPs and selections in seats it hopes to win. The results have been a mixed bag but candidates backed by the leftwing Momentum have fared well, winning selections in Barry, Bury South and Poplar and Limehouse. In seats where no one has yet been selected, Labour rules give the national executive committee (NEC) wide discretion to impose candidates once a campaign is under way. Policies Labour\u2019s Brexit position, hard-fought at its annual conference in Brighton last month, is that it will seek to negotiate a close future relationship with the EU27 and then put that deal to the public in a referendum. That would allow Corbyn\u2019s party to say to remainers that a Labour government will give them a referendum, while holding out the possibility of a Labour Brexit to leave voters. But the party will hope to shift the focus to transformative domestic policies, including its plans for a green new deal, and a significant increase in spending on public services. There will be a fierce internal debate about how much more radical the manifesto should be than in 2017. Grassroots members passed several radical policy motions in Brighton, including rejecting any caps or controls on migration, and incorporating private schools into the state system. Final decisions will be made at a so-called clause V meeting, which will include members of the party\u2019s governing national executive committee, as well as representatives of the unions and the Scottish and Welsh parties. Campaign Labour honed its campaigning machine in 2017, combining large-scale public events to create buzzy footage for the TV news, with spiky social media material, much of it shared organically. The campaign will be jointly chaired by Andrew Gwynne, who played the same role in 2017, and close Corbyn ally Ian Lavery. The manifesto is expected to be drafted by Labour\u2019s policy chief Andrew Fisher, who has promised to stay on for a general election, despite tendering his resignation last month. At the party\u2019s Southside HQ in Victoria, where many Labour advisers will decamp for the campaign, Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, is expected to play a central role, as will his strategic adviser, Seumas Milne. Murphy locked horns with Labour staffers in 2017 about how offensive Labour\u2019s campaign should be. Conversations have already been taking place in recent weeks about whether to circle the wagons around MPs whose seats are under threat or push resources into those constituencies Labour would need to gain to win a majority. The election will represent the first run-out for a new army of local \u201ccommunity organisers\u201d. John McDonnell has repeatedly highlighted them as a key part of the \u201csocial movement\u201d Labour wants to build, but some party veterans complain they are not sufficiently focused on campaigning or plugged into local party networks. Scottish National party Preparedness Perhaps the most keen of all the political parties to hold a winter general election due to the forthcoming trial of former first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, which is due to take place next month. There is a feeling an earlier election would be beneficial because the political fall-out from the case is unknown and the ramifications so difficult to factor into an election strategy. Right now, the SNP appears to be in a strong position, with polling in its favour and the potential to take all 13 Tory seats in the north-east and the borders. Polling is also strong for another Scottish independence referendum \u2013 most recently at 50% \u2013 which once again will be their core election offer. Party finances are said to be in a decent position with membership fees paid by 120,000 people. SNP MPs also crowdfund for the party. In the second quarter of this year, they received \u00a3500,000, although the majority came from public money and not private donors. By comparison, in the same time period the Brexit party received \u00a31m from private individuals. Policies The SNP thinks this is the perfect time to push for a second independence referendum. If it is asked to support a Labour minority government in some kind of post-election deal, party leader Nicola Sturgeon has already made clear another poll on independence is her primary demand. The party will push the case that Scotland is better off as an independent nation and that the country deeply opposes Brexit. Opposition to austerity, welfare reforms and tackling the Tories\u2019 \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration strategy are other topics expected to feature in the SNP election manifesto. It is also likely to continue their campaign for votes for 16-year-olds.

It gets dark very early in December in the north of Scotland and bad weather is to be expected but since the SNP is pushing for a poll, it can be assumed they are not too concerned about campaigning in the elements. Liberal Democrats Preparedness As evidence by the fact it was a Lib Dem-instigated plan which unblocked the election process, the party is raring to go and hopes to make significant gains now it has accepted a second referendum seems impossible in this parliament. The Lib Dems are notably less well-resourced than the big two, with donations of \u00a34.2m in the past 12 months, about a third of those seen by Labour, and a quarter of the Conservative haul. But they do have an increasingly well-organised election machine and one energised by good results in May\u2019s local elections, where they gained 700-plus councillors, and the European elections saw them finish second, on nearly 20% of the vote. The party is also enjoying a real sense of momentum, growing in recent months from the 12-MP haul in the 2017 election to 19 now, a tally swelled by one byelection win and a series of defections from other parties. The final piece of the jigsaw is a new leader, with Jo Swinson taking over from Vince Cable in July, a choice largely welcomed by the party\u2019s MPs and members. The Lib Dem autumn conference in Bournemouth saw near-constant chatter about the number of seats the party could win in an imminent election, with predictions tending to start at about 40 and rise in accordance with ambition, excitement and the number of glasses of wine consumed. Many target seats will be in the southwest of England or in remain-minded urban seats such as several in leafy southwest London, or places such as Sheffield and Cambridge. The somewhat limited Lib Dem war chest will be offset by the fact the party\u2019s number of target seats, or those being defended, is smaller than for the Tories or Labour.

Other than that, the party will campaign on areas such as supporting the NHS, investment in public transport and an increased focus on the climate emergency. Campaign The Lib Dems are a traditionally localised party \u2013 to the regular annoyance of leaders past and present \u2013 but are also an increasingly slick campaigning machine. Expect daily TV shots of Swinson decamping from a shiny battlebus to deliver policy soundbites in a string of target seats. A novelty for the party will be the focus on the fight for new arrivals to take new seats, into which a fair amount of resources could be diverted \u2013 something which will not delight all party members. Key focuses will be Chuka Umunna, once of Labour, trying to take Cities of London and Westminster and ex-Tory Sam Gyimah in Kensington. Brexit party Preparedness The Brexit party led by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is untested at a general election but they are hoping to make significant inroads in Labour\u2019s heartlands in northern England, Midlands and along the Kent coast \u2013 the areas they believe are out of bounds for Conservatives. On the number of seats they might gain they estimate it could be \u201csomewhere in the teens\u201d to 50, however they continue their offer of a pact with the Conservatives in order to return as many leave-supporting MPs to Westminster as possible. In return the Brexit party will want a seat at the top table if they were needed to prop up a Tory majority government with a greater say over future negotiations. This offer has so far been rejected outright by No 10, despite Farage claiming that if they \u201cworked together they would be an unstoppable electoral force\u201d. Their finances are understood to be in a healthy state with money flowing in from former Tory donors and those who choose to give funds to both parties. They also take a significant amount from registered supporters who pay a \u00a325 one-off fee to join. Policies A central objective is delivering a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, which is their term for a no-deal Brexit and emphasises the need for full freedom to trade around the world as well as a genuine extraction of the UK from EU institutions. Their doorstep pitch is also about wider political reform, including abolishing the House of Lords, proportional representation, reviewing the way the BBC works, abolishing inheritance tax and redirecting foreign aid. Expect to hear their other financial pledge trotted out in media interviews, which is that they would cancel HS2 and that saving, combined with no future payments for EU membership, would give \u00a3200bn back to the Treasury over the next few years. How they will campaign Money will be spent on a huge social media drive, creating viral videos and taking inspiration from American campaigning techniques including large, professionally produced rallies. Their ability to get through to voters with precision social media targeting is a source of pride for the party. However they admit they will need to combat the Conservative slogan of \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d, which they admit is extremely powerful and will appeal to their potential voters. They are already selling winter campaigning merchandise on their website, including a handy ice scraper. Ambitiously, for a first general election, they will campaign right across the country and have vetted 600 candidates so far. Green party Preparedness The Greens are by no means a rich party. In the past 12 months, total donations have been below \u00a3200,000 and a fall in their vote share in the 2017 election led to a drop in official funding for parliamentary activity, forcing them to resort to a public crowdfunder to avoid laying off staff. That said, the Greens have an increasingly sophisticated election operation, and one that has expanded as its local councillors have spread. At May\u2019s local elections, the party won 200 councillors, something the leadership put down to years of carefully-targeted effort. As a campaign machine, the Greens have the advantage of two eloquent and telegenic co-leaders in Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, an arrangement that is no longer mocked, as happened when Bartley first co-led with Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP. Policies The Greens\u2019 offer is a remain stance as strong as the Lib Dems, policies on the economy and social justice which they would argue are even more radical than Labour, plus an abiding commitment to tackling the climate emergency. The rueful half-joke about Green policies is that other parties spend several years mocking the ideas before quietly lifting them, as with Labour\u2019s interest in a universal basic income and the four-day working week. One paradox is that while the Greens have tried to expand their message beyond environmental issues, these are now high on the news agenda thanks to climate strikers such as Greta Thunberg and the actions of Extinction Rebellion. Campaign Lucas\u2019s seat of Brighton Pavilion is now fairly safe, with the 1,200 majority she had when she took it from Labour now expanded to well over 14,000. However, the electoral system works strongly against the Greens and gains elsewhere seem unlikely. But with Lucas, Berry and Bartley all out campaigning, the party will hope at the very least for a result closer to 2015, when they took almost 4% of the total vote, as opposed to the 2017 result when a squeeze by the main parties pushed the Greens\u2019 return down to 1.9%.

      "body": "<p>The word \u201cphilausophy\u201d did not exist until Wednesday and, depending on its reception, may not exist for much longer.</p> <p>The latest international campaign from Tourism Australia has landed, with its awkward, crow-barred pun already dividing audiences in the same way that it inelegantly divides the word \u201cphilosophy\u201d itself.</p> <p>Costing $38m and featuring scores of celebrities over the campaign\u2019s lifetime (Chris Hemsworth, Paul Hogan, Kylie Minogue), it is targeted at potential visitors from North America, Europe and Asia, and plays on the idea that the Australian way of life is as attractive to tourists as the country itself.</p> <p>Whether that works remains to be seen. It will last for three years, meaning we only have 1,095 more days of philausophy to endure.</p> <p>In light of \u201cphilausophy\u201d, Guardian Australia has compiled a list of the best, worst and most baffling Australian tourism ads of recent years, both state and national. From \u201cWhere the bloody hell are you\u201d to the big ball of yarn that briefly terrorised Melbourne.</p> <p>Have we missed any of your favourite, or least favourite, tourism ads? And where does the latest one rank? Tell us in the comments.</p> <h2>The bad</h2> <p><strong>Philausophy \u2013 Australia</strong></p> <p>Forget Foucault, here\u2019s far north Queensland?</p> <p>Philausophy has come out of the blocks very slowly. It\u2019s baffling to see and to hear. The pun is strange and, once you get it, not even particularly good, reminiscent of academia rather than fun.</p> <p>Technically, the full slogan is \u201cCome live our Philausophy\u201d. The problem is that \u201ccome live our philosophy\u201d is not a thing that anybody really says anyway. \u201cCome live our philosophy\u201d is what you hear before you enter a large, sealed compound in Utah.</p> <p>According to the campaign, there are nine \u201cphilausophies\u201d. These include: mateship, \u201cno worries attitude\u201d, generosity of spirit, sense of adventure and boundless optimism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/14/bondi-to-manly-sydneys-spectacular-harbour-walk\">Bondi-to-Manly interactive: experience Sydney\u2019s spectacular harbour walk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said: \u201cPhilausophy is about giving travellers from around the world a taste of what makes Australia such an enjoyable destination by shining a spotlight on the people, lifestyle and personality that make Australian experiences so memorable.\u201d</p> <p>These are strings of words that are somehow emptier and more meaningless than the invented word \u201cphilausophy\u201d.

The ad shows an elderly man, called Dave, touring the beautiful sights of Adelaide, but then becoming sad that he didn\u2019t come here earlier. It ends with Dave crying, and the line: \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for Old Mate \u2013 it\u2019s his own damn fault he didn\u2019t visit Adelaide sooner.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s a write-up where I\u2019ve toned down the tragedy.

Costing $38m and featuring scores of celebrities over the campaign\u2019s lifetime (Chris Hemsworth, Paul Hogan, Kylie Minogue), it is targeted at potential visitors from North America, Europe and Asia, and plays on the idea that the Australian way of life is as attractive to tourists as the country itself. Whether that works remains to be seen. It will last for three years, meaning we only have 1,095 more days of philausophy to endure. In light of \u201cphilausophy\u201d, Guardian Australia has compiled a list of the best, worst and most baffling Australian tourism ads of recent years, both state and national. From \u201cWhere the bloody hell are you\u201d to the big ball of yarn that briefly terrorised Melbourne. Have we missed any of your favourite, or least favourite, tourism ads? And where does the latest one rank? Tell us in the comments. The bad Philausophy \u2013 Australia Forget Foucault, here\u2019s far north Queensland? Philausophy has come out of the blocks very slowly. It\u2019s baffling to see and to hear. The pun is strange and, once you get it, not even particularly good, reminiscent of academia rather than fun. Technically, the full slogan is \u201cCome live our Philausophy\u201d. The problem is that \u201ccome live our philosophy\u201d is not a thing that anybody really says anyway. \u201cCome live our philosophy\u201d is what you hear before you enter a large, sealed compound in Utah. According to the campaign, there are nine \u201cphilausophies\u201d. These include: mateship, \u201cno worries attitude\u201d, generosity of spirit, sense of adventure and boundless optimism. The tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said: \u201cPhilausophy is about giving travellers from around the world a taste of what makes Australia such an enjoyable destination by shining a spotlight on the people, lifestyle and personality that make Australian experiences so memorable.\u201d These are strings of words that are somehow emptier and more meaningless than the invented word \u201cphilausophy\u201d. It takes a special kind of skill to take something so bad, and make it worse. Where the bloody hell are you? \u2013 Australia The sands of time have rendered this infamous ad \u2013 devised when now prime minister Scott Morrison was the managing director of Tourism Australia \u2013 better than it first appeared. Many may now look back on it fondly, with a healthy dose of nostalgia and irony. But there is no escaping the fact that, like \u201cphilausophy\u201d, it was almost completely incomprehensible to people outside Australia. Lara Bingle\u2019s iconic \u201cswear\u201d even resulted in it being banned from many countries, thus falling at the first hurdle for an international ad. It\u2019s also not even that appealing to those that do manage to see it. Confusing and jarring, it\u2019s the television equivalent of a jabbed finger and a sign that says, \u201cIf you lived here, you\u2019d be home by now\u201d. Old mate \u2013 South Australia If you cannot handle too much sadness, you genuinely should not watch this ad. South Australia\u2019s latest campaign, launched only last month, is already one of the worst tourism ads ever created. Actively mean, it essentially makes fun of an old man and has been described as \u201cso depressing it needs the Lifeline number at the end\u201d. Try and follow the twisted logic here. The ad shows an elderly man, called Dave, touring the beautiful sights of Adelaide, but then becoming sad that he didn\u2019t come here earlier. It ends with Dave crying, and the line: \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for Old Mate \u2013 it\u2019s his own damn fault he didn\u2019t visit Adelaide sooner.\u201d And that\u2019s a write-up where I\u2019ve toned down the tragedy. Watch at your own risk. The good Ball of yarn \u2013 Victoria This is a tricky one. I\u2019m going to say that it is good. Why? Well we\u2019re talking about it, aren\u2019t we? Not actively offensive. Not too confusing. Weird enough to hold your interest. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose yourself in Melbourne\u201d does what a good ad should. It highlights some distinguishing features about the place (laneways, a supposed sense of whimsy, indie music), and sticks in your head. Even if you hate it, it sort of works. Be consumed \u2013 South Australia This award-winning ad for the Barossa Valley shows how good SA Tourism can be when not making old men weep. It\u2019s mostly in here for the music \u2013 Nick Cave\u2019s Red Right Hand. The action is earthy, the camerawork atmospheric and again, it hits the food and wine element people are looking for. Roast a bulb of fennel! Caress some eggs! Does it remind people of the Snowtown serial killings and Adelaide\u2019s supposedly abnormally high rate of murders? Maybe. Does the title hint that a visitor to the Barossa may not survive the experience? Perhaps. But it also won the grand prix award at the Cannes Corporate Media and TV Awards, so something is going right. Beautiful one day, perfect the next \u2013 Queensland So good they used it twice. Genuinely snappy and concise, the Queensland campaign slogan has been the state\u2019s official tagline for decades, and has made its way into the collective consciousness. When the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast came around, they used it again. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a good thing \u2013 stick to it,\u201d said premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. It\u2019s clearly stuck in the mind, and has now become a cultural reference in its own right, which is exactly what you want. Visiting US president Barack Obama even said it in 2015. C U in the NT \u2013 Northern Territory This is not actually official. But nothing Northern Territory tourism creates can ever beat \u201cC U in the NT\u201d \u2013 a satirical, viral marketing campaign that first popped up in 2016 and is run by a private company. It is miles better than actual Tourism NT slogans, such as 2018\u2019s \u201cBoundless Possible\u201d, which makes no sense. You will still find many, many people who think that C U in the NT is official, and those who know will treasure it anyway. The website sells its own merch, and has inspired tonnes of copycats, allowing it to proliferate all across the top end. Darwin City council has attempted to pass bylaws to ban it, but locals have steadfastly ignored them. The baffling Run, Rabbit, Run \u2013 Victoria Watch this. Even if you remember this ad from 2004, its weirder than you thought. Quite sinister, with a lot of over-the-shoulder shots, we peer round hidden corners as people crouch in fields and pursue a couple through the Yarra Valley. \u201cYou\u2019ll never want to leave\u201d, it says. This gets the message across \u2013 but at what cost? Many moments of this ad are strange, and will have you saying to yourself: \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d Maybe the tides of film culture have shifted in the meantime, and this came across as less frightening back in the day. Maybe it always elicited this response. For some reason, it led to an 18% rise in visitors in its first year.",

The Crescent City native has a specific memory to go with this one: \u201cI remember going to see A Ciambra, Jonas Carpignano\u2019s movie about the Romani people in Italy, at the Orpheum a couple years ago. I never imagined I\u2019d play there one day.

His story, that of a resourceful and determined kid going full DIY to accomplish something plenty of adults spend their entire lives trying to complete, has an instant boy-wonder hook. But beyond all the precocity, beyond his narrative, beyond the satisfying uncanniness of getting VIP treatment at places he once paid to enter, there\u2019s a movie.

It paints a portrait of the struggles of those attending a sweltering service every Sunday in the deep south, focusing on a mother concerned for her son and his burgeoning drinking problem. The poetic look at all that this corner of Christianity has to offer \u2013 solidarity and strength, though not without prejudice and reactionary thinking \u2013 began as a short when he was only 16, though he just used that as a concept for the full-length project in his head. \u201cI\u2019d decided that this was what I wanted to do,\u201d Youmans says, \u201cso I just had tunnel vision. I had to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>So he did, though, of course, that was much easier said than done. The biggest hurdle standing between most first-timers and the realization of their vision has always been money, and that was no different in Youmans\u2019 case. He cobbled together a budget by taking a little here and a little there. \u201cI put all of my savings into the film, which was around twenty-five hundred bucks,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cashed out a lot of savings bonds that I\u2019d gotten from family members. I was working at a beignet stand in City Park that\u2019s no longer in operation now; it turned into another Caf\u00e9 du Monde. It was quick, and a lot of cash for a high school job. I was stacking that up in the months leading to principal photography, and then me and my producer Mose Mayer started an Indiegogo. Started pooling from my family, some of Mose\u2019s family donated a bit too, and that was enough to get us through production. We never had extra funds. There was a lot of stuff we needed to get for free.\u201d</p> <p>The generosity of kindred Louisiana locals, admiring the gumption and ambition of Youmans\u2019 crackerjack operation, took him far. (\u201cPeople take care of each other around New Orleans,\u201d he says.) The jack-of-all-trades spent most of what he had on locations, from a Thibodaux sugar plantation complete with standing slaves\u2019 quarters to the Mount Sinai Baptist church in Algiers, but shot in many places for free. He found collaborators in friends, family, family friends and friends\u2019 families. Everything started to get real when he landed Wendell Pierce, a TV veteran and the most well-known name in the cast, through a favor from a stranger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1af47150857b8c2c30559ce0805aab3611f00227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af47150857b8c2c30559ce0805aab3611f00227/0_0_3840_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wendell Pierce plays the pastor in Burning Cane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendell Pierce plays the pastor in Burning Cane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Array Releasing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was waiting on a woman named Lula one day at the beignet stand, and she\u2019d gone to Nocca (New Orleans Center for Creative Arts) too,\u201d Youmans explains. \u201cI got to chatting with her, she asked me what I wanted to do with my life, and I told her about the film. I was saying that I\u2019d cast every role except the pastor, because we had been looking at one actor whose schedule didn\u2019t really work, and she said that she knew Wendell. When she brought him up, I was shocked, because I didn\u2019t think his echelon of talent and success was one I was even allowed to approach. But she said he was cool, and she texted him right there and he gave me his email. I sent him the script, then immediately emailed again and told him not to read it, so I could expand his role.\u201d</p> <p>He had the advantage of attending classes part-time at Nocca, a well-regarded arts school for those students demonstrating promise at a young age. \u201cTo be completely transparent, I did a lot of this during class,\u201d Youmans laughs. \u201cI went to two high schools, doing a half-day program; I\u2019d leave Ben Franklin and then do the rest of my day at Nocca. I got so much done at Franklin while I was supposed to be paying attention. My grades suffered some, and in my junior year too. But it really does feel like it\u2019s the easiest to concentrate on something when you should be concentrating on something else!\u201d</p> <p>The final piece of the puzzle was Benh Zeitlin, Sundance darling and the director of 2012\u2019s Oscar-nominated Beasts of the Southern Wild. Youmans threw a Hail Mary and sent Zeitlin an out-of-the-blue direct message via Instagram, having found an account mentioning the film-maker\u2019s production company in its bio. To his surprise, Zeitlin wrote back expressing great interest in helping out and scaling up, and went on to become a \u201cmentor\u201d, as Youmans puts it.</p> <p>\u201cHe gave a lot of face time, sitting through the edit, helping me along. For a director to do that, while at the same time working on his own movie, that meant the world. That would\u2019ve been enough, and then he also advocated for us to get this grant that changed everything. We got a cash award from CreateLouisiana, but the biggest thing that came with that was editing space at Second Line Stages, and color-correction as well as photochemical work \u2026 This was the next level.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab2f47c4e3b95d2cd0869f781be1f5cc56edf20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab2f47c4e3b95d2cd0869f781be1f5cc56edf20/0_0_3000_1686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Youmans is the 19-year-old director of Burning Cane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Youmans is the 19-year-old director of Burning Cane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Mendez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Zeitlin\u2019s assistance, he was able to wrap up a cut in time for submission to the Tribeca Film Festival. During one morning\u2019s psychology class, he snuck a peek at his emails to find the director of programming asking if they could host his world premiere. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Holy fucking shit\u2019,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went to the bathroom, called three people, came back to class frozen. I kept refreshing my phone, making sure it was real. After that, I left class walking blindly, nowhere in particular.\u201d</p> <p>He bagged the best narrative feature prize and Pierce earned best actor, identifying their film as the runaway success of the festival. Ava DuVernay\u2019s company Array took notice and offered Youmans a deal he could feel good about. \u201cI thought they were an interesting distributor, seriously dedicated to promoting black voices and female film-makers. They put that front and center, and this is unapologetically a southern black story, so Array was the perfect home for it. And, I\u2019d add to that, Ava\u2019s a real one.\u201d</p> <p>Youmans went on to enroll in NYU\u2019s famed film program as his film made the rounds on the festival circuit, but as the whirlwind picked up, he decided to take a semester off. Now, he\u2019s thinking he\u2019ll probably join the esteemed ranks of such Tisch dropouts as Paul Thomas Anderson and John Waters instead of finishing up the four-year degree. He\u2019s already made plans for his next feature, a movie about the Black Panther chapter in New Orleans during 1978 that will be well-funded enough to capitalize on Louisiana\u2019s generous tax break programs. Why bother preparing for a career he\u2019s already started?</p> <p>He\u2019s not concerned about the reputation of a wunderkind weighing him down as he moves forward; if the novelty of his youth brings more attention to his work, no objections there. One gets the sense he\u2019ll have a long career over which to prove that he deserves his place in the business. He\u2019s on the inside of the industry he\u2019s spent the entirety of his brief life gazing at, and he\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cI want to make a movie, then another movie, then another movie, then hopefully another movie, and then after that, another movie,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Burning Cane is out in New York now and in Los Angeles on 8 November.

We got a cash award from CreateLouisiana, but the biggest thing that came with that was editing space at Second Line Stages, and color-correction as well as photochemical work \u2026 This was the next level.\u201d With Zeitlin\u2019s assistance, he was able to wrap up a cut in time for submission to the Tribeca Film Festival. During one morning\u2019s psychology class, he snuck a peek at his emails to find the director of programming asking if they could host his world premiere. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Holy fucking shit\u2019,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI went to the bathroom, called three people, came back to class frozen. I kept refreshing my phone, making sure it was real. After that, I left class walking blindly, nowhere in particular.\u201d He bagged the best narrative feature prize and Pierce earned best actor, identifying their film as the runaway success of the festival. Ava DuVernay\u2019s company Array took notice and offered Youmans a deal he could feel good about. \u201cI thought they were an interesting distributor, seriously dedicated to promoting black voices and female film-makers. They put that front and center, and this is unapologetically a southern black story, so Array was the perfect home for it. And, I\u2019d add to that, Ava\u2019s a real one.\u201d Youmans went on to enroll in NYU\u2019s famed film program as his film made the rounds on the festival circuit, but as the whirlwind picked up, he decided to take a semester off. Now, he\u2019s thinking he\u2019ll probably join the esteemed ranks of such Tisch dropouts as Paul Thomas Anderson and John Waters instead of finishing up the four-year degree. He\u2019s already made plans for his next feature, a movie about the Black Panther chapter in New Orleans during 1978 that will be well-funded enough to capitalize on Louisiana\u2019s generous tax break programs. Why bother preparing for a career he\u2019s already started? He\u2019s not concerned about the reputation of a wunderkind weighing him down as he moves forward; if the novelty of his youth brings more attention to his work, no objections there. One gets the sense he\u2019ll have a long career over which to prove that he deserves his place in the business. He\u2019s on the inside of the industry he\u2019s spent the entirety of his brief life gazing at, and he\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cI want to make a movie, then another movie, then another movie, then hopefully another movie, and then after that, another movie,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d Burning Cane is out in New York now and in Los Angeles on 8 November. It will be available on Netflix from 6 November.",

It was so refreshing and cathartic that I found myself desperately searching to find a space exclusively for this \u201cgenre\u201d of joke somewhere in New York. I wanted to capture it, to share this story as a film-maker, but I couldn\u2019t find a standup show anywhere. There was this obvious hole where there needed to be a show, and so I decided to fill that.</p> <p>My show was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/kelly-bachman-comedian-interview-confront-harvey-weinstein\">Rape Jokes by Survivors</a>.</p> <p>Every woman knows another woman who has a \u201cme too\u201d story, so I started by reaching out to a comic who I know publicly identifies as a survivor of rape. She knew of two more women. Those women knew of three more women. Overnight, I had a list of over 50 comics, and I could see the strength in their numbers.</p> <p>Watching these comics perform made me realize there was something healing to the process of making a <em>funny</em> joke about your own rape. For a joke to be funny, it has to be tested. It can bomb. And when you\u2019re writing a joke about what might be the worst night of your life, that bomb is no easy rejection to swallow. I discovered that in order for these jokes to be funny, the comedians in many cases had to first and foremost process their traumatic experiences. If an audience senses that a comedian is not \u201cOK\u201d with what they\u2019re talking about, the audience often tenses up and feels sympathy rather than the release of laughter.</p> <p>On the night of Rape Jokes by Survivors, I was shocked to see the show sold out 150 tickets, with a line of people on standby out the door. Still, as the show began, there was a bit of tension. You could feel that some of the audience members were holding back.</p> <p>I brought out a heavy hitter early on, trusting that she would bring up the energy of the room \u2013 and Wendi Starling did not disappoint. She called out the audience on their own hesitance and demanded their laughter, stating that the comics needed laughter to heal. \u201cWhen you withhold your laughter from me, it feels like you\u2019re taking your pain, and forcing it inside of my body!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"489c7bc8dabfc74349523f2be42518afb113700a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489c7bc8dabfc74349523f2be42518afb113700a/0_6_1528_917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rape Jokes by Survivors comedy show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rape Jokes by Survivors comedy show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Bailey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After that there was a sigh of relief, and a steady stream of laughter for the rest of the night. There was Irene Fagan Merrow smiling ear to ear while she roasted her rapist for having a sad blog and describing all of the \u201cperks\u201d of being raped. Rebecca O\u2019Neal telling us about how Prozac was gentrifying her brain. Adrienne Truscott closed the show by singing her own version of Whistle by Flo Rida, with a rape whistle between her legs. Their hilarity was a fearless reclaiming of the rape joke, and the crowd couldn\u2019t get enough of it.</p> <p>On stage and off, there was a unique sense of sisterhood that I haven\u2019t seen often in comedy. In a green room that might normally be packed with men, there were women survivors laughing, sharing stories from their worst nights of survivorship, drinking wine and hugging one another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/kelly-bachman-comedian-interview-confront-harvey-weinstein\">'I had to say something': the comedian who confronted Harvey Weinstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You could feel that community in the audience, too, as many people in the room were survivors themselves. One woman approached me after the show and said that she and her friends had driven up from Baltimore. She said that she laughed at stories she didn\u2019t know she was ready to laugh at, and described to me how important that was for her. I heard the same sense of eager excitement and healing that I knew myself.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult not to feel defined by trauma, especially when it becomes public knowledge. As comedians, we often make a choice to be more defined by how we respond to the pain in our lives. I set out to tell the stories of these women. When I saw them on stage, like so many others, I saw myself too. They are my heroes.</p>",

When the news broke in 2017 about rape accusations against him, it was difficult to find a comedy show where I didn\u2019t hear a bad rape joke, usually coming from a male comedian who was punching down on accusers with unoriginal and offensive jabs. I never thought it was time to ban comics from talking about rape, but it did seem like time for a new kind of rape joke, from new voices. I remember thinking: if rape survivors make up at least 20% of women in America and a significant number of men, why don\u2019t they have the mic right now? Warning: the below video contains strong language The first time I heard a comic talking about her sexual assault, at a bar show in Brooklyn, it felt like a religious experience. It was so refreshing and cathartic that I found myself desperately searching to find a space exclusively for this \u201cgenre\u201d of joke somewhere in New York. I wanted to capture it, to share this story as a film-maker, but I couldn\u2019t find a standup show anywhere. There was this obvious hole where there needed to be a show, and so I decided to fill that. My show was Rape Jokes by Survivors. Every woman knows another woman who has a \u201cme too\u201d story, so I started by reaching out to a comic who I know publicly identifies as a survivor of rape. She knew of two more women. Those women knew of three more women. Overnight, I had a list of over 50 comics, and I could see the strength in their numbers. Watching these comics perform made me realize there was something healing to the process of making a funny joke about your own rape. For a joke to be funny, it has to be tested. It can bomb. And when you\u2019re writing a joke about what might be the worst night of your life, that bomb is no easy rejection to swallow. I discovered that in order for these jokes to be funny, the comedians in many cases had to first and foremost process their traumatic experiences. If an audience senses that a comedian is not \u201cOK\u201d with what they\u2019re talking about, the audience often tenses up and feels sympathy rather than the release of laughter. On the night of Rape Jokes by Survivors, I was shocked to see the show sold out 150 tickets, with a line of people on standby out the door. Still, as the show began, there was a bit of tension. You could feel that some of the audience members were holding back. I brought out a heavy hitter early on, trusting that she would bring up the energy of the room \u2013 and Wendi Starling did not disappoint. She called out the audience on their own hesitance and demanded their laughter, stating that the comics needed laughter to heal. \u201cWhen you withhold your laughter from me, it feels like you\u2019re taking your pain, and forcing it inside of my body!\u201d After that there was a sigh of relief, and a steady stream of laughter for the rest of the night. There was Irene Fagan Merrow smiling ear to ear while she roasted her rapist for having a sad blog and describing all of the \u201cperks\u201d of being raped. Rebecca O\u2019Neal telling us about how Prozac was gentrifying her brain. Adrienne Truscott closed the show by singing her own version of Whistle by Flo Rida, with a rape whistle between her legs. Their hilarity was a fearless reclaiming of the rape joke, and the crowd couldn\u2019t get enough of it. On stage and off, there was a unique sense of sisterhood that I haven\u2019t seen often in comedy. In a green room that might normally be packed with men, there were women survivors laughing, sharing stories from their worst nights of survivorship, drinking wine and hugging one another. You could feel that community in the audience, too, as many people in the room were survivors themselves. One woman approached me after the show and said that she and her friends had driven up from Baltimore. She said that she laughed at stories she didn\u2019t know she was ready to laugh at, and described to me how important that was for her. I heard the same sense of eager excitement and healing that I knew myself. It\u2019s difficult not to feel defined by trauma, especially when it becomes public knowledge. As comedians, we often make a choice to be more defined by how we respond to the pain in our lives. I set out to tell the stories of these women. When I saw them on stage, like so many others, I saw myself too. They are my heroes.",

The Washington Nationals blew it and now they\u2019re a game away from being eliminated. The Nationals beat the Houston Astros on the road in the first two games of the series, scoring victories despite the fact the other team started Gerrit Cole and then Justin Verlander. They had their next three games at home at Nationals Park where all they had to do was take two out of the next three to win the 2019 World Series.</p> <p>Instead the Washington offense faltered badly. The Nationals couldn\u2019t even get their scoring going in what was supposed to be a Bullpen Game (which ended up becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/26/world-series-game-4-houston-astros-v-washington-nationals-live\">the Jose Urquidy Game)</a>. Then Max Scherzer was scratched from his Game 5 start, not that it mattered much since the Nationals hitters were absolutely stymied by Cole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/27/houston-astros-washington-nationals-game-5-world-series-baseball\">in what ended up being a 7-1 loss</a>. </p> <p>So, now the Nationals are a game away from elimination. The good news is that they have Stephen Strasburg, who has gone 4-0 with a 1.93 ERA in the postseason, on the mound for Game 6. Meanwhile, the Astros can\u2019t be 100% certain about what they will get from Verlander, who has been less than stellar ever since Houston tried pitching him on short rest earlier in the postseason.</p> <p>There\u2019s no real need to manufacture drama here. This is an elimination game, which means the MLB season either ends right here and now or we get a dramatic Game 7. The stakes don\u2019t get any higher.</p> <p>So, will the Astros close things out or will the World Series \u201chome field disadvantage\u201d trend continue? We\u2019ll find out in a few hours.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the complete report for Game 6 of the World Series Well, there\u2019s no other way they can win it now. Hats off to the Nationals, who looked dead in the water earlier in this game. Strasburg settled down, the offense came alive and not even an incredibly questionable umpiring call could distract them from their goal. So now there\u2019s officially one more game remaining in the MLB playoffs and it\u2019s basically anybody\u2019s guess about where it goes from here. We\u2019ll have continuing coverage of the 2019 World Series here at the Guardian, including a liveblog of tomorrow\u2019s Game 7 between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros. That will conclude tonight\u2019s live report, however, thanks to everybody who stuck with us throughout today\u2019s thriller, especially those who contributed. Ciao! Home Field Disadvantage This continues to be one of the strangest World Series I can ever recall as the home team has now lost every single game. Now the question is, will that trend continue in tomorrow\u2019s Game 7? Will it all come down to the starting pitchers? Normally Max Scherzer would have an edge over Zack Greinke, but how healthy will Scherzer be? Thanks to an astounding start from Stephen Strasburg and a five RBI night from Anthony Rendon, the Washington Nationals have beaten the Houston Astros and forced a Game 7 in the 2019 World Series. Nationals 7-2 Astros, FINAL So now Chirinos is up, hoping to keep the line moving. Doolittle\u2019s first pitch is way too high. 1-0. He gets a high strike call on the next pitch. 1-1. He doesn\u2019t get the call on the next pitch. 2-1. The next pitch is way high. 3-1. The Astros, to put it mildly, need baserunners here so Chirinos would like to reach by any means necessary. He takes the next pitch, but that\u2019s a strike. 3-2. Chirinos pops up and the Nationals have won Game 6! Nationals 7-2 Astros, bottom 9th Carlos Correa is up trying to keep the Astros\u2019 Game 6 hopes alive. He hits a booming double off the wall that could have been a home run. It just barely missed the yellow line. Nationals 7-2 Astros, bottom 9th It feels a bit weird to bring in Strasburg for just one batter in the ninth. I\u2019m guessing some sort of matchup thing? In any case, here\u2019s Sean Doolittle to face Yordan Alvarez. Alvarez flies out to Soto for the second out. The Nationals are one out away from forcing Game 7. Nationals 7-2 Astros, bottom 9th Strasburg is indeed out for the ninth. His first batter will be Gurriel, who takes a strike and then hits one off the pitcher\u2019s glove, but Cabrera gets to the ball and barehands it for the first out of the inning. It looks like that\u2019s the end for Strasburg. That\u2019s 8 1/3 innings of two-run baseball. A season-saving performance from one of the game\u2019s best. Nationals 7-2 Astros, top 9th Soto lines out and we\u2019re heading to the bottom of the ninth! Nationals 7-2 Astros, top 9th Here\u2019s Anthony Rendon with two on and a chance to just put this one completely to bed. AND HE DOES! His double knocks in two more runs and this is over! You know what, with those two extra runs I think it\u2019s pretty safe to at least give him a shot. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 9th And Eaton is hit by a pitch, so the Nationals have runners on first and second with two out. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 9th Turner hits a double and nobody is going to call him out at second this time. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 9th Yan Gomes falls behind 0-2 and then takes three balls to work a full count. Washington wouldn\u2019t mind maybe an extra run or two here because who knows what can happen in this game. Or Gomes can swing and miss and become the inning\u2019s second out. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 9th Chris Devenski is pitching the top of the ninth, facing Robles who flies out for the first out. Now the question is: does Strasburg start the ninth inning? I\u2026 I don\u2019t like the idea, I\u2019ve seen that kind of move backfire in the past. Just ask Matt Harvey about how those things can do. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 8th And Alex Bregman pops up Strasburg\u2019s 101st pitch. Just outstanding. The Nationals are three outs away from forcing Game 7. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 8th Will Strasburg being coming out for the bottom of the 8th? He\u2019s only at 97 pitches\u2026 Well, yes he is. He\u2019s here to face Altuve, who takes a strike. 0-1. The next pitch brushes Altuve back, but probably not purposefully at this point in the game. 1-1. He chops the next one to third and Rendon gets him on first in a bang-bang play. He\u2019s having a game, this Rendon guy. And Brantley grounds out before I can even post this update. Strasburg has been unreal. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 8th Pressly gets ahead of Zimmerman 0-2 and then finds the outside corner. Well that was a much less eventful top of the inning. To the bottom of the 8th! Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 8th Cabrera is up next and he works a full count off of Pressly before swinging and missing. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d Pressly says. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 8th Ryan Pressly is pitching for the Astros now. He falls behind Kendrick 3-1 but is able to induce a groundout. Email from Gerry in NJ: And they can\u2019t feckin\u2019 protest?!?!?? And Martinez gets thrown out. With the dodgy feckin\u2019 pitching calls the other night, there\u2019s obviously something going on! Conspiracy theories, I know, but aren\u2019t they facts now? With officials I always go by this standard: never assume a conspiracy when incompetence is as an equally likely explanation. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 7th Strasburg gets Springer to fly out. It looks like Scherzer is sitting down. Apparently my \u201cBall Don\u2019t Lie\u201d line was not as original as I had hoped. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 7th Reddick lines out for the second out of the inning. Nationals 5-2 Astros, bottom 7th Dave Martinez is still angry about the call and was just thrown out after a lot of loud, very physical, arguing with the umpires. The Nationals are attempting to play under protest, but it\u2019s not allowed apparently? Meanwhile, Strasburg strikes out Chirinos for the first out in the bottom of the seventh because there is, in case you forgot (and I nearly did), there is an actual baseball game going on. Seventh inning stretch Well after all that ridiculousness, I feel like the most ridiculous version of \u201cTake Me Out To The Ballgame\u201d is required listening. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 7th Soto lines out to end the inning but, wow, what an inning. Nationals 5-2 Astros, top 7th Rendon takes out his frustrations on the second pitch he sees, hitting it 353 feet and maybe saving all from spending tomorrow complaining about umpiring. Ball don\u2019t lie. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Meanwhile, Will Harris is in the game just waiting to warm up. Turner is back in the dugout, absolutely furious and apparently swearing, he (rightfully) believes it should be second and third with nobody out. And they\u2019re sticking with the call? They\u2019re sticking with the call. Harris pitches to Eaton who immediately pops up. It\u2019s two down, I guess. \u201cThe crowd doesn\u2019t have any idea of what is going on.\u201d Me either, man. If the Nationals lose this game, this is going down in the bad kind of World Series history. Okay now the umpires are getting together on this one. I guess they\u2019re arguing that Turner was impeding the throw even though he technically was in his lane? I am trying to explain the rule better but I don\u2019t understand how Turner is out either. I went on Twitter to get their ruling and... well... Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Oh dear. Turner hits what looks like an infield hit but gets called out for interference for messing with the throw for apparently not being in the lane. Gomes is sent back to first and the Nationals are furious Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Peacock falls behind Gomes 3-1 and, what\u2019s this? Scherzer is throwing with purpose in the Nationals bullpen. Are they really going to do this? Gomes hits a solid single on a 3-2 pitch, but the Scherzer talk is now overshadowing what\u2019s going on in the actual game. The thing about having a disappointing record in the World Series is that it means that you\u2019ve made a lot of World Series appearances. It\u2019s a good bad record to have. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 6th Carlos Correa falls behind 0-2 but lays off a breaking ball outside. 1-2. He can\u2019t lay off on the next Strasburg pitch as he strikes out. Strasburg looks like he would be good to start the bottom of the seventh, which Washington has to love. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 6th Alvarez hits into a fielder\u2019s choice and the Nationals are able to gun down Gurriel at second. So still a runner on first but with two out. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 6th It looks like Gurriel has hit into a double play but he hustles his way to first in time to beat out the throw to first. It\u2019s one down with a runner on a first. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 6th The ideal for the Nationals would be to get one more inning out of Strasburg here but that\u2019s going to depend on how well he\u2019s pitching. He\u2019s only at 77 pitches but if he\u2019s wild, Martinez will have no choice but to go to the bullpen. Aaaand Strasburg immediately falls behind 2-0. Patrick Corbin is waiting in the bullpen as is\u2026 Max Scherzer? Bregman beats out an infield hit to start the bottom of the sixth. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 6th Two out and nobody on for Robles, who almost instantly falls into an 0-2 hole. He doesn\u2019t chase Peacock\u2019s slider away. 1-2. Or the next slider away. 2-2. Robles fouls the next pitch off. Still 2-2. Peacock catches the corner again and ends the top of the sixth on a strikeout. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 6th Peacock gets ahead of Zimmerman 1-2 before catching the corner for a strikeout. Zimmerman\u2019s not happy but it looked like a strike from this blogger\u2019s untrained eye. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 6th And Justin Verlander will not be getting a win in a World Series unless there is a Game 7 and he comes out of the bullpen. Brad Peacock is up and he gets Cabrera to ground out. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 5th Brantley takes a ball. 1-0. Then he fouls a pitch off. 1-1. He hits one hard but it\u2019s right at Turner. It wasn\u2019t drama-free, but Strasburg gets out of the inning unscathed! Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 5th Altuve\u2019s the exact kind of hitter you want in this situation. Pretty much any situation, really. He\u2019s looking to make contact here\u2026 but can\u2019t do it on a first-pitch changeup. 0-1. He then fouls off the next one. He\u2019s in an 0-2 hole, not that this makes him any less dangerous of a hitter. AND STRASBURG GETS HIM TO STRIKE OUT ON A PITCH IN THE DIRT. Nationals fans breath out, but the Astros still have a chance here with Michael Brantley at the plate. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 5th Springer takes a borderline strike. 0-1. Strasburg\u2019s next pitch has to be corralled by Gomes. 1-1. Strasburg gets another call, this one low and on the corner. 1-2. Springer can\u2019t do anything with the next pitch, but stays alive by fouling it off. 1-2. He lays off the next one outside, looked like Stras was trying to get him to chase there but nothing doing. 2-2. Big pitch. And Springer comes through with a double. That\u2019s runners on second and third with just one out and Strasburg is officially in a jam here as the Astros can tie this game up on an out. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 5th Josh Reddick comes out hacking and fouls off a 80 mph curve for strike one. Meanwhile the camera shows a shot of Brad Peacock in the Houston bullpen. Verlander might not be in this game much longer. Strasburg\u2019s next pitch is outside but Reddick gets fooled by his next changeup. 1-2. Reddick manages to just tap in the next pitch for a single. So now it\u2019s one-on and one-out and there\u2019s George Springer. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 5th Chirinos takes a strike from Strasburg and then watches one bounce. 1-1. Chirinos pokes the next pitch foul. 1-2. Strasburg nearly clips Chirinos with the next offering. 2-2. Chirinos fouls one back and then swings and misses. That\u2019s Stephen\u2019s fourth k. It\u2019s not been the most dramatic of series until right around now-ish, in other words. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 5th Kendrick hits a long foul ball to end the inning, but Washington has a lead all of a sudden. Now, can Strasburg have the shutdown inning he couldn\u2019t pull off in the first inning? Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 5th Soto takes two balls that are way out of the zone and then hits a foul ball that hits the roof. 2-1. Verlander\u2019s pitch misses the upper corner. 3-1. And THE NEXT ONE GOES DEEP INTO THE STANDS. He keeps the bat with him to first base, imitating what Bregman did in his first inning home run trot. The Nationals have the lead! Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Rendon decides that he\u2019s going to be swinging here too, but both of his attempts are foul (and he\u2019s lucky that the second one makes the stands). He\u2019s down 0-2 here, but he takes a Verlander pitch outside. 1-2. And he pops the next one up. That\u2019s two down in the inning. Nationals 2-2 Astros, top 5th Eaton looks at a strike down the middle. 0-1. AND THEN HE CRUSHES ONE. This is a tied game! This is an actual game! Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 5th Trea Turner looks at a strike and fouls out to Gurriel. One dwn. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 4th Strasburg\u2019s next pitch is inside. 1-0. And the next one\u2019s way off. He just keeps missing his spots. 2-0. Correa is thinking he\u2019s going to get a meatball here and he swings and misses. Strasburg will take the mighty but empty cut. 2-1. And then he finally makes his pitch for strike number two to even the count. And the next pitch is outside of the zone but Correa can\u2019t lay it off. That\u2019s the inning, and we\u2019re heading to the fifth! Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 4th Alvarez takes a ball. 1-0. And another. 2-0. And yet another. 3-0. That\u2019s a bit worrisome, if you\u2019re Washington. Now Strasburg has to hope Alvarez gets himself out. He does not, he takes Ball Four on pitch four and that\u2019s two straight walks and Carlos Correa is coming. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 4th For whatever reason, Gurriel feels like the most dangerous hitter in this Series although I know that the numbers won\u2019t support this. Strasburg starts of the at-bat as if he is, at least, as his first two pitches are outside before he gets a called strike. 2-1. Gurriel doesn\u2019t chase the next pitch. 3-1. The next pitch is outside, and there\u2019s Strasburg\u2019s first walk. Alvarez is up next and Joe Buck starts talking about \u201cFriday Night Smack Down\u201d which is objectively hilarious. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 4th Bregman pops up on the infield. Two down. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 4th Brantley grounds out to Zimmerman at first. Meanwhile, in Washington, they\u2019re ready to be heartbroken. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 4th Yan Gomes hits what looks like it would either be an extra base hit or a foul home run but it somehow stays in the park and Brantley catches it for the third out. If Washington doesn\u2019t get another chance that\u2019s going to be the lasting image it feels like. The Astros stay up front. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 4th Robles takes a slider for a strike. 0-1. Robles then extends himself with a swing that doesn\u2019t connect with anything for a second strike. 0-2. He then can\u2019t hold up his swing on a ball that\u2019s underneath his bat. Oof, the Nationals would like that plate appearance back. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 4th Ryan Zimmerman takes a monster cut on Verlander\u2019s first pitch and, man, was he fooled. 0-1. Zimmerman foul-tips the next one. 0-2. This would be a key strikeout right here. Verlander\u2019s next pitch takes a hop. 1-2. And the next needs to be smothered by Chirinos to keep Kendrick at first. 2-2. The next pitch is right around Zimmerman\u2019s head. Just like that, it\u2019s a full count. Zimmerman fouls the next pitch off. (That\u2019s Verlander\u2019s 70th of the night, which may or may not come into play as the game gets longer.) And the next pitch? That\u2019s outside as well. There\u2019s now two on and just one out. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 4th Cabrera takes Verlander\u2019s first two pitches for balls before fouling off pitch three. On the fourth pitch, he pops up to the catcher in foul ground. One away. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 4th Kendrick is up and instantly falls into a 0-2 count. He takes the next pitch for a ball. On 1-2, Kendrick gets a solid base hit for a leadoff single. Looks like Verlander will have some work to do for the second straight inning. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd The diminutive but powerful Altuve stands in with two out and nobody on. He fouls off a fastball. Strasburg\u2019s next pitch almost nails Altuve who hops out of the way. 1-1. Altuve skies the next pitch up and Cabrera makes the catch. Strasburg looks settled down, now he just needs his team to score more than one run in a game. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Springer barely avoids striking out on a 1-2 pitch outside before not swinging at all on a 2-2 pitch outside. On 3-2, Springer hits a grounder for the second out of the inning. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 3rd Josh Reddick is up to bat next and he strikes out on a changeup that doesn\u2019t touch the strike zone. Well, it\u2019s a lot more normal now that Minute Maid Park no longer has a random hill with a freaking flag pole in the field of play. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Considering Washington\u2019s problems scoring in the last three games, this feels like a key at-bat. Soto immediately lunges at the first pitch. 0-1. The next pitch is outside. 1-1. Verlander throws a ridiculous curve for the next pitch, that\u2019s just a remarkable strike right there. 1-2. Soto swings and the ball is right at Altuve. Verlander escapes the jam but the Nationals made him sweat. Let\u2019s see if that comes back to help them. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Rendon is up next with Eaton on first, he takes a ball up and in. 1-0. Verlander\u2019s pitch is a called strike. 1-1. Rendon reaches and fouls the next pitch off. 1-2. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is down in the strike zone and slightly away. 2-2. Verlander tosses over to Eaton, worried about a potential steal. Rendon stays alive on the next pitch, fouling it off. Still 2-2. Rendon fouls off another pitch. STILL 2-2. A great at-bat could be brewing here. Verlander\u2019s seventh pitch of the at-bat is way up high. 3-2. Rendon fouls the next one off. Still 3-2, Eaton retreats to first. The ninth pitch? That\u2019s also foul, Eaton heads back to first. (He\u2019s going to be exhausted if this keeps going on.) And the tenth pitch is a ball outside. That\u2019s back-to-back walks. Juan Soto is up to the plate. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Adam Eaton takes a strike and then a ball. On 1-1, he fouls off a pitch. This makes it already the most patient at-bat of the inning. He fouls the next one off. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is a ball. It\u2019s a 2-2 count now. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is outside and we have a full count. Not a lot of those so far in the game, not that this blogger is complaining. And the next pitch is outside and Eaton takes his base. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Trea Turner flies out to centerfield. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 3rd Yan Gomes is up and he grounds out to Altuve just like that. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Robinson Chirinos, who has had a decent World Series, is up next to see if he can salvage something in the inning after the first two outs. He can\u2019t, he grounds out to Turner. Strasburg definitely looked a lot more Strasburgian there. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Carlos Correa takes a ball and then a quality curveball for a strike. On the next pitch, Correa grounds out to Rendon. That\u2019s another fast out for Strasburg. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 2nd Yordan Alvarez is up now. How Strasburg adjusts in this second inning could end up being the game. He gets Alvarez to ground out, which is a solid start to things. The Gurriel flyball out looked even scarier than the actual Bregman home run. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 2nd Victor Robles takes one high for a ball and then a slightly lower pitch that\u2019s still a ball. He\u2019s in a 2-0 count but he takes a massive cut on a pitch in exactly the same spot. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is also out of the zone, but Robles swings again. He\u2019s getting plenty of deception here and, in fact, he gets Robles to get himself out on the next pitch for another swinging strikeout. That was a classic Verlander inning. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 2nd Ryan Zimmerman takes a borderline strike and then a less-borderline ball. 1-1 before flying out. That\u2019s two quick outs for Verlander. Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 2nd Well, Washington are already down. Asdrubal Cabrera is up and he strikes out on four pitches for the Verlander \u201ck.\u201d Can\u2019t say that there haven\u2019t been early twists in this one. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 1st Yuli Gurriel hits a monster flyball out that just barely stays in the park. Soto makes the catch, but he might have hurt himself in the process. It certainly looks like the Astros are ready to end this thing. Nationals 1-2 Astros, bottom 1st Alex Bregman is up with the bases empty and two out. He takes two straight balls and then hits a mammoth home run. The Astros have the lead and the train at Minute Maid Park goes off. Nationals 1-1 Astros, bottom 1st Let\u2019s see how Strasburg reacts after that early hiccup. Well, he gets Michael Brantley looking on a 2-2 count (although the pitch is clearly outside). Nationals 1-1 Astros, bottom 1st Altuve drives Springer in with a sacrifice fly, that\u2019s a morale killer right there. It would have been better off if Springer had just hit a home run. Nationals 1-0 Astros, bottom 1st And here\u2019s Jose Altuve. Strasburg\u2019s first pitch to him gets away from Gomes, that\u2019s a wild pitch and Springer immediately makes it to third with nobody out. Things are getting bad for Washington ridiculously quick. Nationals 1-0 Astros, bottom 1st The George Springer Show is leading off against Strasburg and he immediately rips a double to start of the inning. Houston gets very loud immediately. Email from Sammy Lopez Metta Bexar: Howdy from 130 miles west of Houston! Noting that nothing much seems to have happened so far, I thought I\u2019d correct an earlier comment and say \u201cNo Gationals! Ouston Hastros in six!\u201d Because standards. This is becoming a thing, I see. Nationals 1-0 Astros, top 1st The venerable Howie Kendrick takes a strike to start his at-bat. 0-1. Verlander\u2019s next pitch loops up and over the strike zone for a ball but he gets Kendrick to pop up to Josh Reddick. Still, Stephen Strasburg is going to be pitching with an early lead, which is good news for the Nationals. Nationals 1-0 Astros, top 1st Here comes Juan Soto with Rendon on first and still just one out\u2026 but Soto skies one to Michael Brantley in the outfield. That\u2019s two down. Nationals 1-0 Astros, top 1st Anthony Rendon takes a pitch and then fouls off the next pitch. 1-1. Rendon checks his swing on the next Verlander pitcher, but it\u2019s a strike so that\u2019s all for naught. 1-2. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is way outside, blocked by the catcher Chirinos. 2-2. Rendon takes a solid cut on the next pitch and fouls it off. Still 2-2. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is outside. 3-2. On the next pitch Rendon slaps a single through the infield and the Nationals get on the board first. Home field disadvantage continues? Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Adam Eaton is up next for the Nationals with Turner on first and nobody out. Eaton bunts Turner over, which goes as a sacrifice. Washington wants to score first here very much. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Turner fouls the next pitch off and then swings and misses. Verlander\u2019s next pitch is a ball, even though the Astros crowd was already roaring for Verlander to get things started with a strikeout. Verlander gets Turner to ground out to Bregman\u2026 but it looks like Bregman actually beat it out. And he did. It\u2019s reversed. Infield hit for Turner. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Justin Verlander is up facing Trea Turner. His first pitch is way upstairs for a ball and Game 6 has begun! Possibly relevant: by all accounts Max Scherzer is ready to go for tomorrow\u2019s Game 7 if there happens to be a Game 7. The FOX analysts are desperately trying to will a Nationals victory tonight by hyping up Strasburg and talking up Scherzer\u2019s availability. Okay, except David Ortiz who would rather not cancel his plans. While this goes against my earlier prediciton, I do want to re-use some of my earlier content here just because I think this would be hilarious: Clay Walker performs a tasteful, country rendition of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d I dug it, but I just watched the whole Ken Burns \u201cCountry Music\u201d miniseries so I\u2019m in the right state of mind for it. 8/10. Email from Roger Kirkby: I never get how they come up with viewing figures, having lived in America for over twenty years my experience is the World Series is on in every bar, restaurant, airport lounge, prison, bus station , old folks home and sports fans house. How they come up with a figure of only 12 million watching is beyond me. Now people can watch on mobile devices the figures are even more unbelievable P.S. I only know about prisons from watching movies. And it\u2019s even more complicated in the streaming era, I imagine. Tough, but fair. Email from Neil Zimmerman: After listening to the latest Ringer MLB podcast I am well and truly rooting for the Nationals after hearing the full story in relation to the Brandon Taubman issue and the Astros \u201cattempt\u201d at a response. Thanks for the coverage. You are very much not alone in this sentiment. It should be noted that Astros owner Jim Cramer eventually apologizes for the organization\u2019s attempt to defame Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein for breaking that particular story.

The Nationals had a golden opportunity to win this series and they blew it and now it\u2019s Houston\u2019s time to put them out of misery. The only hope left is that there\u2019s at least some drama here today before the postseason comes to a close. I predict that Washington will find a way to score of Verlander and take a lead into the late innings before the bullpen, which manager Dave Martinez has been attempting to avoid using (to a fault) finally blows things late. Look for this one to be decided on a Houston home run hit by an unexpected player on an 0-2 count with two out in the inning. Astros 6, Nationals 5. Final. Agree, disagree, just want to vent or gloat about how the series has gone so far? Send us your thoughts via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (to @HunterFelt). Not great news for the MLB So far, it\u2019s looking like this could be the least watched World Series of all time. It\u2019s not hard to imagine why: neither the Astros or the Nationals have national interest, the sport has taken a noticeable dip in popularity over the last few years and (perhaps most importantly) the games themselves have mostly been dreadful. With the exception of the dramatics of Game 1, most of these games have been decided around 2/3rds of the way in and have ended up being blowouts one way or another. Perhaps the MLB needs some drama today and a potential Game 7. Maybe casual and potential fans don\u2019t care one way or another. Oh well, we\u2019ll always remember the \u201clock him up\u201d chants at least. Let\u2019s not mince words. The Washington Nationals blew it and now they\u2019re a game away from being eliminated. The Nationals beat the Houston Astros on the road in the first two games of the series, scoring victories despite the fact the other team started Gerrit Cole and then Justin Verlander. They had their next three games at home at Nationals Park where all they had to do was take two out of the next three to win the 2019 World Series. Instead the Washington offense faltered badly. The Nationals couldn\u2019t even get their scoring going in what was supposed to be a Bullpen Game (which ended up becoming the Jose Urquidy Game). Then Max Scherzer was scratched from his Game 5 start, not that it mattered much since the Nationals hitters were absolutely stymied by Cole in what ended up being a 7-1 loss. So, now the Nationals are a game away from elimination. The good news is that they have Stephen Strasburg, who has gone 4-0 with a 1.93 ERA in the postseason, on the mound for Game 6. Meanwhile, the Astros can\u2019t be 100% certain about what they will get from Verlander, who has been less than stellar ever since Houston tried pitching him on short rest earlier in the postseason. There\u2019s no real need to manufacture drama here. This is an elimination game, which means the MLB season either ends right here and now or we get a dramatic Game 7. The stakes don\u2019t get any higher. So, will the Astros close things out or will the World Series \u201chome field disadvantage\u201d trend continue? We\u2019ll find out in a few hours. This also means it could be your last chance to contribute to a World Series liveblog this year, so get in your thoughts, questions or jokes if you have them. You can either email them to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt. It\u2019s Game 6 of the 2019 World Series featuring the Washington Nationals against the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park. First pitch is scheduled at 8:08pm EST but we\u2019ll be back well before then with all sorts of updates, predictions and random trivia. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s what happened when the President turned up to Sunday\u2019s Game 5:",

On Saturday night, England delighted fans in both camps when players arranged themselves to face the All Blacks. The V \u2013 which many inside New Zealand took to stand for \u201cvictory\u201d \u2013 was widely praised by New Zealanders, many of whom commented on the dignified and low-key response of the English side to what can be a confronting and emotional experience. Numerous haka experts in New Zealand have attested that England\u2019s move to confront the haka was in no way offensive to the All Blacks side, and did not violate M\u0101ori cultural protocol, known as tikanga. The All Blacks themselves dismissed the significance of the incident at the time, with their scrum-half Aaron Smith also revealing English captain Owen Farrell was winking at him during the performance. However, World Rugby regulations state opponents must not cross the halfway line while the Maori war dance is being performed and six England players could be seen in breach of that rule. It is believed England have been fined a four-figure sum but less than the \u00a32,500 France had to pay when they adopted a similar formation before the 2011 World Cup final. On that occasion, almost all of the squad advanced beyond the halfway line. Tapeta Wehi, a haka expert from Rotorua in the North Island, praised the English side\u2019s bold move and said he wished more teams would respond to the haka with such panache. Wehi said the haka was widely misunderstood and was intended as a challenge to the opponents \u2013 and any side that met the challenge deserved respect \u2013 not a fine. \u201cA haka is laying down the challenge and they were challenging the All Blacks back \u2013 so no problem with that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a regulation problem about whether they were allowed to cross that line but that\u2019s got nothing to do with our culture.

Ioera Simon, who works at the front desk of the hotel where the crew were being detained in Tarawa, said immigration officials showed up at the hotel on Wednesday morning and two officials were stationed outside the rooms where the crew were staying. The group were allowed to leave their rooms, but not the grounds of the hotel, she said. \u201cThey are allowed to leave [their rooms] for food,\u201d said Simon. \u201cThey are kept in the hotel. \u201cThey seem all right,\u201d Simon said. \u201cA bit upset, but OK.\u201d A Kiribati immigration official said the group had been asked to remain in their hotel after they arrived in the country without appropriate media permits and had made false declarations on their arrival cards, saying they were in the country for \u201cmeetings\u201d.

Brown, the veteran producer Steven Rice, cameraman Ben Williamson and sound recordist David Ballment were arrested while attempting to help the Australian woman Sally Faulkner recover her children from her estranged husband. Foreign journalists who come to Kiribati must receive permits from the government to report. The Kiribati president, Taneti Maamau, restricted the criteria for media permits after a ferry sank off the country last year, killing 95 people, due to a litany of failings, including overcrowding on the boat. A team of New Zealand journalists from Newshub were detained last year upon arrival in the country to report on the ferry\u2019s sinking. The Pacific Islands News Association, the leading regional news organisation, issued a statement saying it was \u201cconcerned\u201d by reports of the detention of the Australian crew and were carrying out an investigation through its own media partners on the ground in Kirbati. \u201cWe have tried to contact the 60 Minutes crew at their hotel in Tarawa but have been informed that they are not allowed incoming or outgoing calls, as per their detention order,\u201d said a spokesperson for PINA.",

      "bodyText": "A decorated army officer and the top Ukraine expert on the national security council has reportedly told House impeachment investigators that the White House transcript of a call between the presidents of the US and Ukraine left out important words and phrases. The New York Times cited three sources familiar with Alexander Vindman\u2019s testimony on Tuesday who said the omissions included Donald Trump making reference to recordings of the former vice-president Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy making reference to Burisma, the company for which Biden\u2019s son Hunter worked. Lt Col Vindman tried to edit the White House reconstruction of the call to correct the omissions, but some of his edits were not incorporated into the transcript, according to the report. The arrival of Vindman tipped Republicans into a spiral of internal conflict over how far to go \u2013 and what lines were unacceptable to cross \u2013 in defending the US president. Vindman appeared on Capitol Hill wearing his US army dress uniform, which bore a combat infantry badge and a Purple Heart medal, bestowed when he was wounded by an improvised explosive device in Iraq. Like prior testimony in the month-old impeachment process, Vindman\u2019s opening statement, published the night before, had the potential to be extraordinarily damaging for Trump. A top Ukraine expert, Vindman, 44, described his alarm at witnessing Trump and others attempting to force Ukraine into a charade designed to harm Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden and sow doubts about Russian tampering in the 2016 US election. That alleged conduct is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, which could result in charges against Trump of abuse of power and other offenses. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman testified. Top Democrats later said his testimony was \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and called him \u201cvery credible\u201d. Trump\u2019s defenders zeroed in on the fact that Vindman was born in Ukraine, having left the Soviet Union in the 1970s with his family when he was three \u2013 a story celebrated in news reports at the time as a quintessential tale of American promise. After joining the army, serving in multiple overseas deployments, and earning a master\u2019s degree from Harvard in Russian, Eastern Europe and Central Asian studies, Vindman worked for the White House.

That did not stop Trump\u2019s defenders in the media from attacking Vindman as disloyal. \u201cHere we have a US national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d said Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d Her guest, John Yoo, a former George W Bush administration lawyer infamous for drafting a framework for torture, agreed. \u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d Yoo said. But the backlash in the Republican ranks, rare where Trump is involved, was unusually harsh. \u201cThat guy\u2019s a Purple Heart. I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,\u201d John Thune, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, told Politico. \u201cYou can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t go after him personally. He\u2019s a patriot.\u201d Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former vice-presidentDick Cheney, and a member of the House Republican leadership, echoed Thune in a press conference. \u201cWe need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in this process.\u201d As news of Vindman\u2019s testimony leaked, it emerged that he had kept his own set of notes about the 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d and repeatedly brought up Biden, a leading Democratic candidate in the 2020 election. Vindman\u2019s remarks were \u201cextremely, extremely, extremely disturbing\u201d, the acting House oversight committee chair, Carolyn Maloney, later told NBC News. The committee member Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, said Vindman was a \u201cvery credible\u201d witness. Pressure on Trump is mounting rapidly. House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would vote Thursday on a resolution to move the proceedings out of closed-door depositions and into open hearings. On Tuesday afternoon, the text of the resolution to be voted on was made public, noting that the House intelligence committee would lead planning of the public hearings. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a prominent Trump defender, has called the House proceedings a \u201csham\u201d. But with each witness, Trump\u2019s defense has weakened. He insists he was only interested in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, denied a political motive for seeking investigations of Biden, denied that military aid for Ukraine was withheld for inappropriate leverage, and denied that any of his conduct was untoward. The only defense left on Tuesday was to attack the messenger. But the attacks appear to have bounced off the medals on Vindman\u2019s chest. Julia Carrie Wong contributed reporting",

      "bodyText": "Tom Calma has urged Indigenous Australians to get behind the process of co-designing a voice to parliament, and says it is possible the Morrison government could countenance constitutional recognition after a model is resolved. Calma, the chancellor of the University of Canberra and a previous race discrimination commissioner, has been appointed with fellow prominent academic Marcia Langton to lead a new round of consultations on the voice \u2013 a First Nations representative body proposed in the Uluru statement. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Calma said: \u201cWe know that the prime minister at this stage has ruled out constitutionally enshrining the voice, in part because there is no model. What would the government be putting to a referendum?\u201d Calma said while he couldn\u2019t say what Scott Morrison and the government might or might not do in the future, it was possible \u201cthey might be minded\u201d to consider enshrining the representative body in the constitution down the track. He argued that \u201cwould be the pragmatic way to go\u201d. He said it was analogous to the native title debate, where there was \u201chue and cry\u201d about people losing their backyards to land claims from traditional owners, and \u201cthose concerns weren\u2019t there\u201d. \u201cI would like to get the opportunity to establish the bodies and the process and look at all the models and how they might work, and then at a future time look at \u2013 and this is the government\u2019s role \u2013 to look at constitutional enshrinement or whatever.\u201d He encouraged Indigenous communities to focus on the here and now. \u201cThere are big dangers in trying to conflate issues.\u201d With an announcement imminent about the next phase of consultations about the voice, the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Linda Burney, speculated last week the government might countenance a two-stage process where \u201cperhaps [Scott Morrison] would look at enshrinement down the track\u201d. Morrison ruled out constitutional enshrinement of the voice shortly after the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, used Naidoc week to reopen a national conversation about recognising First Nations people in the constitution and establishing a voice to parliament. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Contention broke out within the government immediately after Wyatt\u2019s signal that the government would look at pursuing both of these issues during the current term, with conservatives resisting the representative body even if the voice sat outside the constitution. One outspoken government MP, Craig Kelly, declared that setting up separate structures, even if the representative model was legislated rather than enshrined in the constitution, risked creating \u201ca reverse form of what South Africa was a few years ago\u201d. While Morrison would clearly struggle to convince his own MPs to sign up to a two-stage process, groups such as the Central Land Council have flatly rejected the government\u2019s proposal to legislate the voice rather than enshrine it in the constitution. CLC delegates met near Uluru on Tuesday and passed a resolution opposing symbolic recognition. \u201cWe want to be part of designing the voice to parliament,\u201d the resolution said. \u201cWe demand that it be protected in the constitution.\u201d Calma\u2019s co-chair, Langton, is already on the public record supporting constitutional enshrinement of the voice. Langton has previously cited the abolition of Atsic as the reason why the voice needs to be enshrined in the constitution, as per the Uluru statement recommendation. She is yet to comment on her new role. Calma said it was important for the parliament to rally behind the current process so that Indigenous Australians would have confidence that a representative body would not be abolished or defunded by the government of the day. \u201cFor a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the National Congress of Australia\u2019s First People was the voice,\u201d Calma said. \u201cIt was something we constructed. We elected the membership. We had over 10,000 members and over 180 peak bodies \u2013 that is a very, very representative voice. \u201cThat is now in receivership because of a lack of support by government and that was one minister. We have to look at mechanisms to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen. This has got to go beyond the government, the parliament has to get behind this. Bodies that are constructed have to last. \u201cI want to encourage people to have an open mind and give this process a chance to go. We are so fortunate to have Ken Wyatt, an Indigenous person in the portfolio, who enjoys the support of the prime minister. \u201cLabor has concerns but they\u2019ve expressed support for a process. These windows don\u2019t open all that often, and we have got to take advantage of that. \u201cThere\u2019s a time frame. They are in government for a defined period, and we should take advantage of that while we can.\u201d",

Neil Punchard, the senior constable who leaked the woman\u2019s details to her violent former husband, was this month convicted of nine counts of computer hacking and sentenced to a suspended prison term. Separate from the criminal case, the victim, Julie*, has been attempting to access compensation from the police service to cover the cost of having to twice relocate her family in fear. In March, the Queensland civil and administrative tribunal (QCAT) found in her favour and ruled that the police service had breached the state\u2019s information privacy principles, and could be held liable for the breach. Police then lodged an appeal \u2013 submitted more than 28 days after the decision \u2013 and the case has been stalled for eight months awaiting a new hearing date from the tribunal, which has not yet decided whether the appeal should be accepted.

Ryan told Eaves that he would approach the commissioner, Katarina Carroll, about the matter when she returned from leave, but would not commit to a meeting with Julie. It is understood police have pursued the case partly because the ruling could have broader implications, amid concerns Julie and others represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of police data misuse.

On Tuesday, Alexander Vindman, a former army colonel and diplomat, told House investigators that he listened to the Trump-Zelenskiy call and escalated his concerns. \u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman said, according to written testimony obtained by the Associated Press. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d Top Democrats later said his testimony was \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and called him \u201cvery credible\u201d. The impeachment inquiry up to this point has largely consisted of closed-door interviews, led by the House intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees. Under the process proposed by the resolution, the intelligence committee will take control, leading any public hearings. The president and his allies have complained that the inquiry so far has been too secretive and denied Trump any chance to defend himself. The White House made clear that the resolution had not changed its opinion; a statement from the press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, called it a \u201cscam\u201d and complained that the Trump administration was being denied \u201cbasic due process rights\u201d. House Republicans are unlikely to support the resolution. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle,\u201d the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, told the Washington Post on Tuesday. \u201cDue process starts from the beginning.\u201d The House rules committees is expected to consider and possibly amend the impeachment resolution tomorrow afternoon, with a vote on the proposal still set for Thursday. The impeachment resolution notes that, at the beginning of public hearings, the chairman and ranking member of the House intelligence committee \u2013 Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Devin Nunes \u2013 can ask witnesses questions for up to 45 minutes each before proceeding to other committee members. (They may also defer to a committee staffer.) The resolution also allows for the public release of transcripts from interviews so far, \u201cwith appropriate redactions to protect classified and other sensitive information\u201d. According to the resolution, the House intelligence committee will take the lead on planning public hearings as the inquiry advances. The resolution also establishes that Republicans may ask to hear testimony from certain witnesses, but those requests will be declined or approved by Schiff. This procedure is in line with the rules for the minority party during the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, according to the Washington Post. In a statement, House committee leaders said: \u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election. \u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct.\u201d Pressure on Trump in the impeachment inquiry is mounting rapidly. And when the hearings become public, many Americans will for the first time encounter the damaging accusations against Trump from the witnesses making them. A recent poll found that a majority of people now support the investigation. Tom McCarthy and agencies contributed reporting",

I\u2019ll come back to the science part shortly, but let\u2019s take a close look at all the other words first.</p> <p>Everyone knows that economists are into efficiency, but not everyone knows what economists mean by \u201cefficient\u201d. That\u2019s because not only do economists disagree about the need for a budget deficit, but economists disagree about what efficient means too. Take building a new house, for example.</p> <p>Is it efficient to knock down an old house, cart the rubble away and quickly build a new, prefabricated house? Is it more efficient to use the bricks from the old house in the construction of the new one? Or is it efficient to work with the structure that\u2019s already there and modify it as little as possible? The answer depends on how we value waste disposal, time, transport costs and aesthetics. Would you trust an economist to have the final word on what constitutes an \u201cefficient\u201d house?</p> <p>What about when something breaks? Is it more \u201cefficient\u201d to repair it, or replace it? The answer depends on whether you are talking about the efficient use of your time, natural resources, or money. And if you think economics is all about money, then how come governments say it is \u201cinefficient\u201d to spend more money on preventive health, crime prevention and even preventing climate change? How can spending a little bit today to save a lot in the future be \u201cinefficient\u201d?</p> <p>And now to \u201callocation\u201d. To allocate means to distribute, share or divide up. Which means economics, by its own definition, is all about sharing and distribution. Who knew! Economists and politicians often suggest that economics is about \u201cgrowing the pie\u201d and that questions of distribution are best left for others, or left until later, or ... just left out altogether. But if economics is about \u201cefficient allocation\u201d and we can\u2019t be sure what \u201cefficient\u201d means, then it becomes impossible to separate conversations about economics from conversations about equity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m not alone among economists in believing that distributional issues are at the heart of economics. These days, even the World Bank publicly argues that reducing the gap between rich and poor is not just fair but good for the economy. And these days, even the IMF argues that taxing polluters and reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be good for the economy. Trying to separate distribution from economics is like trying to separate sound from music or votes from democracy.</p> <p>How about \u201cscarce\u201d? Surely, I hear you sigh, economists can agree on what scarce means. Nope. Some economists think that old-growth forests in Tasmania and the Amazonian rain forests are scarce because their complex ecosystems are literally irreplaceable. Other economists think that trees are trees, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with chopping them down in one place and planting them in another.</p> <p>Like everything else in economics, the definition of scarce is contestable, and it revolves around what thing you think can substitute for another. Some people think that Pepsi is a substitute for Coke. And some people \u2013 but not many koalas \u2013 think that that tree plantations are substitutes for old-growth forests. And some people refuse to believe that renewable electricity is a substitute for coal-fired electricity. Like everything else in economics, there is no right answer. Intriguingly, economists usually call things like fish and forests \u201crenewable resources\u201d and things like iron and copper \u201cfinite resources\u201d even though the solar system is full of asteroids and planets made of metal and we are yet to find evidence of fish or forests anywhere else in the universe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/oct/20/this-government-has-abandoned-economic-logic-and-no-one-seems-willing-to-call-them-on-it\">This government has abandoned economic logic \u2013 and no one seems willing to call them on it | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And finally, there is the definition of \u201cresources\u201d. By now you have probably guessed that economists can\u2019t agree on what constitutes a resource either. Are retired racehorses a resource for the pet-food industry or proud animals deserving of dignity? Is asbestos a resource for making cheap brake pads or a dangerous pollutant best left in the ground? How about the air we breathe? A <a href=\"http://www.whirledbank.org/ourwords/summers.html\">former </a><a href=\"http://www.whirledbank.org/ourwords/summers.html\">chief </a><a href=\"http://www.whirledbank.org/ourwords/summers.html\">economist at the World Bank</a> once referred to Africa as having too much fresh air and suffering from \u201cUNDER-pollution\u201d. For him, the atmosphere was nothing more than a low-cost (\u201cefficient\u201d?) dumping ground for industrial pollutants.</p> <p>Which brings me back to the question of whether economics is a science.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s top two economic advisers are in stark disagreement about something straightforward: whether the Australian economy would benefit from a bigger budget deficit or not. The governor of the Reserve Bank says he is running out of room to cut interest rates any more, and that some government spending would help stimulate the economy. The secretary of treasury says no such stimulus is necessary. Who to believe? If economics is a science then you would think that two advisers to the same government, giving advice about the same economy at the same point in time, might be able to agree on the answer. If physicists can agree on how to make an object move and physiologists can agree on how to resuscitate a heart that\u2019s stopped beating, why can\u2019t economists agree on how to boost Australia\u2019s flagging wage and GDP growth? Economics defines itself as \u201cthe science of the efficient allocation of scarce resources\u201d. I\u2019ll come back to the science part shortly, but let\u2019s take a close look at all the other words first. Everyone knows that economists are into efficiency, but not everyone knows what economists mean by \u201cefficient\u201d. That\u2019s because not only do economists disagree about the need for a budget deficit, but economists disagree about what efficient means too. Take building a new house, for example. Is it efficient to knock down an old house, cart the rubble away and quickly build a new, prefabricated house? Is it more efficient to use the bricks from the old house in the construction of the new one? Or is it efficient to work with the structure that\u2019s already there and modify it as little as possible? The answer depends on how we value waste disposal, time, transport costs and aesthetics. Would you trust an economist to have the final word on what constitutes an \u201cefficient\u201d house? What about when something breaks? Is it more \u201cefficient\u201d to repair it, or replace it? The answer depends on whether you are talking about the efficient use of your time, natural resources, or money. And if you think economics is all about money, then how come governments say it is \u201cinefficient\u201d to spend more money on preventive health, crime prevention and even preventing climate change? How can spending a little bit today to save a lot in the future be \u201cinefficient\u201d? And now to \u201callocation\u201d. To allocate means to distribute, share or divide up. Which means economics, by its own definition, is all about sharing and distribution. Who knew! Economists and politicians often suggest that economics is about \u201cgrowing the pie\u201d and that questions of distribution are best left for others, or left until later, or ... just left out altogether. But if economics is about \u201cefficient allocation\u201d and we can\u2019t be sure what \u201cefficient\u201d means, then it becomes impossible to separate conversations about economics from conversations about equity. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning I\u2019m not alone among economists in believing that distributional issues are at the heart of economics. These days, even the World Bank publicly argues that reducing the gap between rich and poor is not just fair but good for the economy. And these days, even the IMF argues that taxing polluters and reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be good for the economy. Trying to separate distribution from economics is like trying to separate sound from music or votes from democracy. How about \u201cscarce\u201d? Surely, I hear you sigh, economists can agree on what scarce means. Nope. Some economists think that old-growth forests in Tasmania and the Amazonian rain forests are scarce because their complex ecosystems are literally irreplaceable. Other economists think that trees are trees, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with chopping them down in one place and planting them in another. Like everything else in economics, the definition of scarce is contestable, and it revolves around what thing you think can substitute for another. Some people think that Pepsi is a substitute for Coke. And some people \u2013 but not many koalas \u2013 think that that tree plantations are substitutes for old-growth forests. And some people refuse to believe that renewable electricity is a substitute for coal-fired electricity. Like everything else in economics, there is no right answer. Intriguingly, economists usually call things like fish and forests \u201crenewable resources\u201d and things like iron and copper \u201cfinite resources\u201d even though the solar system is full of asteroids and planets made of metal and we are yet to find evidence of fish or forests anywhere else in the universe. And finally, there is the definition of \u201cresources\u201d. By now you have probably guessed that economists can\u2019t agree on what constitutes a resource either. Are retired racehorses a resource for the pet-food industry or proud animals deserving of dignity? Is asbestos a resource for making cheap brake pads or a dangerous pollutant best left in the ground? How about the air we breathe? A former chief economist at the World Bank once referred to Africa as having too much fresh air and suffering from \u201cUNDER-pollution\u201d. For him, the atmosphere was nothing more than a low-cost (\u201cefficient\u201d?) dumping ground for industrial pollutants. Which brings me back to the question of whether economics is a science. There is no doubt that economists can sometimes use scientific methods to develop some conclusions to some questions, based on replicable and repeatable methods. But there is also no doubt that most of the big questions that we collectively face are simply not able to be answered with reference to rigorous experimental evidence. The reason that the government\u2019s two most senior economic advisers disagree about macroeconomic policy is that neither of them have ever seen an economy with wage growth as low as ours, low productivity, low GDP growth and record low interest rates. Their instincts and advice should be taken seriously, but neither of them has any experience managing an economy like the one the Coalition has created, and neither of them know what will happen next, even if their advice were to be followed. Similarly, when it comes to decisions about increasing unemployment benefits or reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is absurd and unhelpful to suggest that an economist \u2013 or any economic model \u2013 can determine what we \u201cshould\u201d do. The meaning of the words: efficient, allocation, scarce and resource are all contestable. One person\u2019s trash is another\u2019s treasure and one woman\u2019s call to close the gender pay gap is another man\u2019s loss of privilege. I like economics and I think it has something to offer any democracy that must make hard choices. Economics can help identify trade-offs and develop policy solutions. But no economist can tell us what kind of society we want to live in, how much of our natural environment we want to protect or even what kind of house we should live in. Economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Values are entirely up to us. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

The utility would send out alerts to prepare for possible shutoffs, and then the power would go off without official word. Some people would check the power shutoff map and see that they were in the affected zone - but then when the time came, they wouldn\u2019t lose power. Then the next time they got an alert to prepare for a possible shutoff, they wouldn\u2019t, to their detriment.</p> \n  <p>And then PG&amp;E\u2019s website and power outage maps kept crashing during the first two major power shutoffs. <br></p> \n  <p>Keep in mind it takes a lot of time and energy to prepare for a possible shutoff. You have to make sure you have the resources to get you through the blackout period. You have to take care of your perishable items for when your refridgerator and freezer goes down. You have to remember to charge your electronics ahead of time, get your car out of the garage, make sure you have enough water if your water pump runs on electricity. Some have to plan a different way to get to work. And if you\u2019re medically fragile, you have even more work to do. </p> \n  <p>So all these starts and stops for possible shutoffs are more than just minor inconveniences.

The 43-year-old\u2019s parents, who live in nearby Sebastopol, were evacuated as the Kincade fire spread and are now staying at her Castro Valley home, which has no power due to the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric shutoffs. </p> \n  <p>Roa said the wedding was ultimately a success but that it was a surreal experience to go through it while the fires were raging in the region: \u201cThe joy won out, it was a happy wedding ... But all of us were caught in that dichotomy of joy and sorrow. As a photographer, it\u2019s easy for me to get lost in the moment and feel the joy of the couple.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She said she hoped the viral image would help people outside of California understand the suffering in the region: \u201cIt\u2019s helping to bring light to the crisis and destruction going on here.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are people who are still having major life events, and it\u2019s happening right in the middle of a firestorm,\u201d she added. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T18:07:08.800Z\">at 6.07pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db8777e8f08c428d8932cbe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T17:34:00.343Z\">5.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New round of PG&amp;E shutoffs begins</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has started shutting off power to parts of Marin county north of San Francisco, even before expected restorations of power from a previous shut-off had been completed, the AP reports. </p> \n  <p>Virtually all customers of the wealthier suburb on the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge lost power 26 October as part of planned blackouts by PG&amp;E to prevent the fires.

      "bodyText": "Investigators believe they know what caused the Getty fire: video shows a eucalyptus branch falling on a power line operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. As a reminder, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power DOES NOT shut off power during heavy wind events like Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. Officials downgraded a mandatory evacuation order issued to a small portion affected by the Kincade fire to just an evacuation warning. The National Weather Service issued a new warning today: the Extreme Red Flag Warning, for a high-wind event taking place in much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Thursday evening. Earlier today, the Los Angeles Times reported that investigators were looking at utility lines near where the Getty fire began as the possible cause of the blaze. Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that video shows a eucalyptus tree branch breaking and falling on a power line operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, sparking the flames. As a reminder, the Department of Water and Power does not shut off power during high wind events because of its \u201clocation in a highly urbanized area with far fewer wildfire prone areas\u201d. Quick update from the Getty Museum in the midst of the Getty fire: Speaking of utility companies causing wildfires, the Los Angeles Times is reporting that Southern California Edison believes its equipment will likely be found at fault for causing the Woolsey fire in 2018: \u201cWhile SCE did not find evidence of downed electrical wires on the ground in the suspected area of origin, it observed a pole support wire in proximity to an electrical wire that was energized prior to the outage,\u201d the utility wrote in its quarterly earnings report. \u201cWhether the November 8, 2018, outage was related to contact being made between the support wire and the electrical wire has not been determined. SCE believes that its equipment could be found to have been associated with the ignition of the Woolsey Fire.\u201d The Woolsey fire killed three people and burned up nearly 97,000 acres. A small portion of the area that was issued a mandatory evacuation order because of the Kincade fire has been downgraded to an evacuation warning. Good news, but doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re in the clear yet. The Getty fire forced the evacuation of NBA star LeBron James and his family when it broke out early Monday, and he clearly has not forgotten who is keeping his home safe: Ah, time for my favorite Californian past time: dunking on clueless East Coast media trying to report on the best coast. Here is Time magazine with a video of firefighters facing \u201cmassive flames in San Francisco.\u201d Except this is not San Francisco. We don\u2019t actually know where this is. But as someone who lives in San Francisco and is currently working across the bay in Oakland, I can safely (literally and figuratively) tell you that this fiery hellscape of burning trees is NOT San Francisco. If you look at the left-hand corner of the video, you\u2019ll see where the mistake originated: video courtesy of San Francisco Firefighters 798\u2019s Twitter feed. According to this engine\u2019s account, they are battling the Kincade fire in the Sonoma county wine region of northern California. In disasters like this, it\u2019s not unusual for counties and state agencies to call in mutual aid from surrounding areas. That\u2019s what the San Francisco firefighters are doing - providing mutual aid to their neighbors in the north - NOT battling a wildland fire in their own city. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that investigators are examining utility lines near where the Getty fire began as the possible cause of the blaze. As of now, it\u2019s unclear which utility operates the power line. If you\u2019ll recall, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the state\u2019s largest utility, has a history of sparking wildfires. However, so does Southern California Edison, which covers a lot of territory in southern California. This year, both utilities began shutting off power during wind events to prevent wildfires, but not the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. \u201cDue to our location in a highly urbanized area with far fewer wildfire prone areas, we do not face the same threat of wildfire as many of the rural counties located in other service areas served by the larger investor-owned utilities,\u201d the utility wrote in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThis is because our service area within the City of LA is highly urbanized with extensive fire suppression infrastructure in place and a Class 1 rated LA Fire Department. This is quite different than many of the remote or more rural areas served by investor-owned utilities such as PG&amp;E and SCE.\u201d Up north, firefighters battling the Kincade fire discovered what appeared to be a broken jumper by a PG&amp;E transmission tower that had lost power. PG&amp;E had shut off power to the area as part of planned shutoff, the transmission lines remained energized. While the cause of the Kincade fire is still under investigation, the utility has submitted a report to state regulators. PG&amp;E also submitted a report regarding two fires that broke out in northeast of San Francisco on Sunday afternoon. Firefighters believed that contact betwen a power line and a communication line may have been the cause of the blaze that forced evacuations and burned down a tennis club, CNBC is reporting. At a second fire nearby, fire personnel were investigating the site of a fallen pole and transformer as a potential ignition source. It appears we\u2019re heading into new vocabulary territory in California, folks. We\u2019ve been in Red Flag Warning weather throughout the state on and off these past few weeks, which means conditions are high for fire - low humidity, high temperatures, swift winds. The National Weather Service has now issued an Extreme Red Flag Warning for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, starting late Tuesday and into Thursday evening. From the National Weather Service: A strong Santa Ana wind event is expected tonight through Thursday, and could be one of the strongest of recent memory. Damaging wind gusts between 50 and 70 mph are expected over most of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, with isolated gusts to around 80 mph likely. Although the air is cold, humidities will lower to the single digits nearly everywhere by Wednesday or Thursday, and down to 1 or 2 percent in the driest windiest locations. Overnight recoveries Wednesday night will be near zero. This all adds up to an extreme fire weather threat. Use extreme caution with any potential ignition sources, and residents in high fire risk areas should be ready and set to evacuate if emergency officials say so. So, if you\u2019re just tuning into our hellish Californian reality, a whole lot of people are very peeved at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. The country\u2019s largest utility is behind the massive power shutoffs happening across the state - in part because PG&amp;E has a history of sparking deadly wildfires. There are many reasons why people are mad at PG&amp;E. Corporate greed! Death and destruction! Massive blackouts that disproportionately affect the medically vulnerable and low-income! There are also people who support these power shutoffs and are willing to do whatever it takes to prevent more deadly wildfires. But in these power shutoffs, one of PG&amp;E\u2019s most egregious failures has been the utility\u2019s ability to communicate. I\u2019ve talked to people caught completely by surprise when the power went out because they kept getting conflicting messages from the utility and from authorities. The utility would send out alerts to prepare for possible shutoffs, and then the power would go off without official word. Some people would check the power shutoff map and see that they were in the affected zone - but then when the time came, they wouldn\u2019t lose power. Then the next time they got an alert to prepare for a possible shutoff, they wouldn\u2019t, to their detriment. And then PG&amp;E\u2019s website and power outage maps kept crashing during the first two major power shutoffs. Keep in mind it takes a lot of time and energy to prepare for a possible shutoff. You have to make sure you have the resources to get you through the blackout period. You have to take care of your perishable items for when your refridgerator and freezer goes down. You have to remember to charge your electronics ahead of time, get your car out of the garage, make sure you have enough water if your water pump runs on electricity. Some have to plan a different way to get to work. And if you\u2019re medically fragile, you have even more work to do. So all these starts and stops for possible shutoffs are more than just minor inconveniences. In this day and age, electricity is no longer a luxury - it\u2019s part of our daily lives. Going without it - and planning when and how to go without it - is tough. Bad communication from the utility responsible for it makes it all the worse. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Sam Levin. It appears that power still has not been regained at Salinas Valley State Prison, according to the Sacramento Bee. And since power has been out since Saturday, conditions has become rough for inmates. My colleague in Oakland, Vivian Ho, will be taking over our live coverage. For now, here\u2019s the latest on the power shutdowns, via the AP: California\u2019s largest utility says 1 million people remain without power after a weekend shutoff to try to prevent wildfires left nearly 2.7 million people without electricity. Some of those still in the dark are unlikely to get their power restored as PG&amp;E initiates another round of blackouts Tuesday in northern California because of dry, strong winds. PG&amp;E spokeswoman Monica Tell said the utility started cutting power to customers at 5 am Tuesday in the Sierra Nevada foothills. More from the Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran in San Rafael: Traffic in San Rafael has slowed to a stop-and-go crawl since the power outage. Some downtown street lights were back on but others had been replaced with temporary stop signs. Colonial Liquor, across from the downtown transit center and one of the few businesses with lights on, had just opened its doors after two days without power, said the man behind the counter, who declined to give his name. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to work for sixth months straight to make up what I lost,\u201d he said. The situation wasn\u2019t quite as dire for Bill Horton, who works for the This Week in Tech podcast, but it was still disruptive. Horton relies on the local Smart train to get to his office in Petaluma, but the power outage grounded the transit system. This morning, he stood by the bus terminal and saw that the bus he needed would be delayed. \u201cIt will be another hour,\u201d he said. Horton\u2019s nearby home has been without power since Saturday, he said. \u201cOh it\u2019s been great,\u201d he joked. \u201cLast night I ate spaghetti-ohs out of a can. I guess you could look at it as a kind of adventure. But it\u2019s a good reminder of how bad we need to get our shit together before we hit a true emergency, like an earthquake.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut so many of the people you see here riding public transit, they live paycheck to paycheck. They fight over those hours. They can\u2019t afford to lose several days wages.\u201d A photo of a bride and groom wearing protective masks at their destination wedding in wine country has gone viral after the massive Kincade fire forced guests to evacuate. The image of newlyweds Katie and Curtis Ferland shows them standing outside at their Chateau St Jean winery wedding in Sonoma county, not far from the massive wildfire that has burned more than 75,000 acres and destroyed 123 structures. The couple from Chicago had been planning the wedding for a year, and their 80 guests had mostly traveled from out of state for the ceremony, the photographer Karna Roa told the Guardian. The fires forced some guests to evacuate from their Airbnb rentals, and the air quality got so bad that many of the wedding events had to be moved indoors. But the wedding ultimately went forward, and the couple held the actual ceremony outside despite the hazards. While taking a few photos in the vineyard, the couple thought they might as well capture some images with the protective masks, which people across the region have been wearing due to the toxic air. \u201cI looked at them and I thought, is this the new normal for wine country in October?\u201d said Roa, who lives in Castro Valley, south of Sonoma county and regularly shoots wine country weddings. The moment the couple put the masks on, it reminded Roa of the famous American Gothic 1930 painting, she said. This is Roa\u2019s fourth wedding in the last three years that has been evacuated or disrupted by wildfires. The 43-year-old\u2019s parents, who live in nearby Sebastopol, were evacuated as the Kincade fire spread and are now staying at her Castro Valley home, which has no power due to the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric shutoffs. Roa said the wedding was ultimately a success but that it was a surreal experience to go through it while the fires were raging in the region: \u201cThe joy won out, it was a happy wedding ... But all of us were caught in that dichotomy of joy and sorrow. As a photographer, it\u2019s easy for me to get lost in the moment and feel the joy of the couple.\u201d She said she hoped the viral image would help people outside of California understand the suffering in the region: \u201cIt\u2019s helping to bring light to the crisis and destruction going on here.\u201d \u201cThere are people who are still having major life events, and it\u2019s happening right in the middle of a firestorm,\u201d she added. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has started shutting off power to parts of Marin county north of San Francisco, even before expected restorations of power from a previous shut-off had been completed, the AP reports. Virtually all customers of the wealthier suburb on the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge lost power 26 October as part of planned blackouts by PG&amp;E to prevent the fires. The county has about 260,000 people, and some have been without power since Saturday afternoon. PG&amp;E spokeswoman Deanna Contreras said the new round of shut-offs started around 8am Tuesday, earlier than estimated because of weather and \u201cimpacts on our transmission system\u201d from a fire in wine country. The PG&amp;E power shut-offs Tuesday are the third in a week and the fourth in one month. My colleague Mario Koran is now in San Rafael, a city just north of San Francisco affected by the power shutdowns: Downtown San Rafael is blinking to life after several days without power, but the progress is slow \u2013 a few traffic lights and a handful of stores are the only ones with power. The trains aren\u2019t running, either because they run on electricity or because the power is out on the railroad crossings, stalling the commute for workers. Eddie, who would only give his first name, has been out of work for four days since PG&amp;E cut the lights at the restaurant where he works. He said he was worried about the loss of wages. \u201cIf you don\u2019t work in San Francisco or certain parts of Marin [county], you\u2019re out of luck,\u201d he said. He hasn\u2019t been able to go to the grocery store because the lights have been out at, and the nearest market is too far for public transit. In LA, homeowners evacuating from the Getty fire did not alert their housekeepers and domestic workers about the hazards, leading some of them to show up to work as the fire spread. Thanks to LA Times reporter Brittny Mejia, there\u2019s been growing attention in the last 24 hours about the impacts that the fires can have on more vulnerable residents. While reporting in evacuation zones, Mejia encountered housekeepers and gardeners trying to go work whose bosses said they forgot to alert them: Some local lawmakers are now talking about the subject: In my recent reporting on how LA is coping with the fires and bad air quality, the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California, a not-for-profit that assists immigrant workers, said domestic workers and day laborers are suffering from a number of health problems and other issues that arrives when fires hit their employers\u2019 homes: For day laborers and domestic workers, many of whom are undocumented and don\u2019t have health insurance, the fires can mean lost work, untreated illness, or hazardous jobs, said Maegan Ortiz, director of a not-for-profit that has assisted immigrant workers affected by the fires. Some workers tend to houses in wealthy neighborhoods after their employers have evacuated, she said: \u201cWe hear about these persistent coughs that won\u2019t go away, tightness in the chest, not feeling like you can breathe deeply.\u201d More here: My colleague Katharine Gammon has written about the Getty Center\u2019s plan to protect its art from fires. The blaze is far enough away that officials said it was not currently at risk. But if the fire got closer, the center was ready. Katharine reports: The Getty Center, which comprises a museum, research institutes and a foundation, is home to a vast collection of paintings and photography. But in wildfire-prone California, a museum has to have a plan \u2013 and officials say they\u2019ve been preparing for this moment and are now putting that plan to the test. The Center is designed to be impervious to fire and smoke, with materials such as travertine stone, an extremely fire resistant type of limestone, as well as cement and steel. The rooftops are crushed stone, so embers have no chance to ignite. The museum\u2019s landscaping is designed to be fire retardant, and maintenance workers do extensive brush clearance all around the property in order to eliminate fuel for the fire. Underneath the trees and grasses is a network of pipes, connected to a million-gallon water tank. Sprinklers can activate as soon as fire touches the ground. \u201cWe can use it for our own fire prevention,\u201d spokesperson Lisa Lapin said. Read the full story here, which includes details of the center\u2019s earthquake plan: The fires have created bad air quality in northern and southern California, though in some areas there have been improvements today. Around Santa Rosa and in Sonoma county by the Kincade fire, officials say the air remains at unhealthy levels, which means people should try and stay inside when possible. In many parts of the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Oakland, the air quality is now at \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d levels. In Los Angeles, a smoke advisory was in effect through this morning, though the air seems to be improving now. Some tips: Authorities are finishing a press conference in Santa Rosa in Sonoma county. Here are some highlights: The fire is at 75,000 acres: \u201cIt grew a little bit overnight.\u201d Currently, 90,000 structures remained threatened, and 124 structures have been destroyed. The National Weather Service says it is expecting a \u201cchallenging afternoon and evening\u201d ahead with strong, dry offshore winds: \u201cWe\u2019re in this critical 24-hour window.\u201d After 24 hours, NWS expecting a more favorable forecast for the subsequent five to seven days, but no rain is projected. Given the strong winds, many evacuees will likely be unable to return home today, authorities said: \u201cToday\u2019s probably not a going to be a good day to talk about repopulation ... We understand people want to get back to their neighborhoods.\u201d Authorities urged people to continue to be vigilant about fire hazards, with one law enforcement official noting that he had to stop someone who had thrown a cigarette butt on the highway. Here\u2019s my colleague Susie Cagle\u2019s recent dispatch from Sonoma county: Good morning and welcome to our continued live coverage of the wildfires and blackouts impacting millions across California. I\u2019m writing from Los Angeles, where a major fire near the Getty museum has burned more than 650 acres. Here\u2019s where things stand as of Monday morning, and what we\u2019re watching today: In northern California, violent winds of up to 100mph caused the Kincade fire, currently the largest in the state, to double in size over the weekend. As of this morning, the Kincade fire has burned more than 75,000 acres and is only 15% contained. The Kincade fire has destroyed more than 123 structures and has forced an unprecedented evacuation of more than 185,000 in Sonoma county and the surrounding area Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corporation (PG&amp;E) said its latest blackout will start early today and affect about 1.5 million people. The announcement came even before the last blackout had ended, which shut off power to more than 2.5m people. Strong winds are expected to complicate firefighting efforts today: \u201cThe worst of this is coming later today and tonight,\u201d Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center, said early today. Until at least Wednesday in the wine country area, winds are expected to hit up to 65mph in the mountain areas and 35mph in the valleys and coast. In the Getty fire in LA, eight residences have been destroyed. Southern California Edison had cut off power to about 800 people as of Monday night and warned that it was considering disconnecting about 400,000 more as winds return midweek.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for the live blog today. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The House rules committee released its resolution outlining next steps on impeachment, which established that Adam Schiff\u2019s intelligence committee would take the lead on public hearings. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, testified behind closed doors to impeachment investigators. According to his opening statement, Vindman intended to testify that he had concerns after listening to Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The president attacked Vindman as a \u201cnever Trumper,\u201d while some conservative commentators suggested that the Purple Heart recipient may not be entirely loyal to the United States because he was born in the Soviet Union. (Some commentators later walked back those comments following intense criticism.) British MPs approved Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to hold a general election on December 12, giving voters another chance to weigh in on Brexit after the prime minister failed to withdraw the UK from the EU by his set deadline of October 31. The House voted to recognize the Armenian Genocide for the first time in 35 years, in a rebuke of Turkey. Hours after publishing an op-ed arguing that Facebook should not \u201cdecide which claims by politicians are acceptable\u201d, Facebook has apparently decided to decide which politicians are acceptable. CNN is reporting that Adriel Hampton, who registered to run for California governor in order to exploit Facebook\u2019s policy allowing politicians to advertise false statements, will not be allowed to run those ads by Facebook. Hampton tells CNN that he is now considering filing a lawsuit against Facebook. The House resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide passed with 405 yes votes, making the no and \u201cpresent\u201d votes stand out. According to CNN reporter Haley Byrd, the 11 no votes and three present votes (an abstention) came from the following representatives: Ilhan Omar, who is one of the first two Muslim congresswomen to serve in the House, and who has been a target of intense criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, explained her abstention in a statement to CNN: She subsequently tweeted at MSNBC host Chris Hayes: \u201cMy issue was not with the substance of this resolution. *Of course* we should acknowledge the Genocide. My issue was with the timing and context. I think we should demand accountability for human rights abuses consistently, not simply when it suits our political goals. My focus has and will always be to make sure our foreign policy is consistent, coherent and my votes will as well.\u201d Facebook has published another op-ed defending its decision to exempt politicians from its policy banning misinformation and false claims from paid advertising. \u201cAnyone who thinks Facebook should decide which claims by politicians are acceptable might ask themselves this question: Why do you want us to have so much power?\u201d wrote Katie Harbath and Nell McCarthy in the piece, which was published in USA Today. \u201cIn our view, the only thing worse than Facebook not making these calls is for Facebook to make these calls.\u201d Harbath is Facebook\u2019s public policy director for global elections. McCarthy is the director of policy management. Their argument is unlikely to persuade critics in the US, who continue to push Facebook to reconsider the policy. Last night, senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg urging him to change his mind. Hundreds of Facebook employees also disagree with the policy, as my colleague Kari Paul reported yesterday. Like many Republican lawmakers, North Carolina senator Richard Burr has taken Grover Norquist\u2019s \u201cTaxpayer Protection Pledge\u201d, committing himself to vote against new or increased taxes. So it was surprising to see Burr propose a new tax on Twitter on Tuesday. Burr is currently on the wrong side of what\u2019s known on Twitter as \u201cbeing ratioed\u201d. His missive has been retweeted about 800 times, but users have responded (mostly angrily) nearly 14,000 times. As CNBC pointed out, scholarships are already taxed as income. College sports have been incredibly lucrative in the US for universities, coaches, broadcasters, sports apparel companies \u2013 pretty much everyone involved except the athletes themselves. My colleague Mario Koran wrote about a California law that might change everything earlier this month. George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign adviser who served 14 days in prison after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators, has announced plans to run for the House seat recently vacated by Katie Hill. Papadopoulos lied to investigators about his contacts with a Kremlin-linked professor who claimed that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton while he was working for the Trump campaign. Hill was freshman congresswoman and rising Democratic star who resigned Monday amid allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with a staffer and following the non-consensual release and publication of nude photographs. I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide what the symbolism of the scope view is on Papadopoulos\u2019s campaign website. One result of his candidacy? He\u2019ll now be allowed to promote misinformation in paid advertisements on Facebook. White House aide Robert Blair is expected to testify before a closed session of the House impeachment inquiry on Friday, Reuters reports, citing an official on the impeachment probe. Blair is one of the officials who listened in on the phone conversation between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that led to the whistleblower complaint and subsequent impeachment investigation, according to CNN. His current title is assistant to the president and senior adviser to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Prior to working in the White House, he was associate director for national security programs in the Office of Management and Budget, where he also served under Mulvaney. The US House of Representatives just voted overwhelmingly to recognize the Armenian Genocide, with 405 yes votes and 11 noes. The non-binding resolution marks the first time in 35 years that either branch of Congress recognized the early 20th century slaughter of up to 1.5m Armenians by the Ottoman Empire as a genocide, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Turkish government has long refused to acknowledge the genocide, creating a diplomatic bind for its allies. But Turkey\u2019s recent actions against Kurds near its border with Syria created a political opening for the resolution\u2019s passage. \u201cGiven that the Turks are once again involved in ethnic cleansing the population\u2014 this time the Kurds who live along the Turkish-Syrian border\u2014 it seemed all the more appropriate to bring up a resolution about the Ottoman efforts to annihilate an entire people in the Armenian genocide,\u201d representative Adam Schiff, who sponsored the resolution, said to the LA Times. Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in (thus far, thankfully) wildfire-free Oakland, California, picking up the blog for the rest of the day. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has responded to the House resolution on impeachment by calling it a \u201cscam\u201d and complaining that the Trump administration is being denied \u201cbasic due process rights\u201d. The full statement reads: The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote. It continues this scam by allowing Chairman Schiff, who repeatedly lies to the American people, to hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the President. The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House\u2019s rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written. This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House rules committee released its resolution outlining next steps on impeachment, which established that Adam Schiff\u2019s intelligence committee would take the lead on public hearings. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, testified behind closed doors to impeachment investigators. According to his opening statement, Vindman intended to testify that he had concerns after listening to Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The president attacked Vindman as a \u201cnever Trumper,\u201d while some conservative commentators suggested that the Purple Heart recipient may not be entirely loyal to the United States because he was born in the Soviet Union. (Some commentators later walked back those comments following intense criticism.) British MPs approved Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to hold a general election on December 12, giving voters another chance to weigh in on Brexit after the prime minister failed to withdraw the UK from the EU by his set deadline of October 31. Follow the UK politics live blog for more updates. Julia will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Representative Bradley Byrne said he would not drop out of the Alabama Senate race, even if Jeff Sessions launched a bid to reclaim the seat he held for two decades. Reports have emerged that Sessions, Trump\u2019s former attorney general who had a falling out with the president over the Russia investigation, is seriously considering a Senate bid. Politico reports: Sessions would scramble the already crowded field of Republicans seeking to take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a 2017 special election to fill the remainder of Sessions\u2019 term and is widely viewed as the most vulnerable senator on the ballot next year. ... Five Republicans are already in the race: Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court judge who lost the special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Sessions has some high-profile allies pushing him to run for his old seat, including the conservative Club for Growth. Boris Johnson appears to have won his battle to hold a general election on December 12 after the British prime minister failed to withdraw the UK from the EU by his set deadline of October 31. MPs voted 438 to 20 to take the UK to the polls in about six weeks. The election will be the first held in December since 1923 and will provide the British public a chance to once again weigh in on Brexit as the EU separation looms.

The opening statement of Alexander Vindman, who is now testifying before impeachment investigators, has led at least one House Democrat to accuse Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, of perjuring himself before the committees. Politico has more context on the Sondland controversy: Testimony from other witnesses has put the credibility of Trump\u2019s most favorable witness into serious doubt as the White House struggles to define a response to the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry beyond simply refusing to cooperate with it. Democrats have cited Sondland\u2019s repeated memory lapses pertaining to central events surrounding Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Joe Biden. They raised similar questions about Sondland\u2019s truthfulness following the testimony last week of acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who said Sondland had conveyed to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the release of U.S. military assistance aid was predicated upon Zelensky publicly committing to the investigations Trump demanded. But it was the opening statement made public late Monday by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Trump\u2019s top National Security Council adviser on Ukraine, that had Democrats questioning Sondland\u2019s testimony most pointedly. The House rules committees is expected to consider and possibly amend the impeachment resolution tomorrow afternoon, with a vote on the proposal still set for Thursday. Meanwhile, the White House made clear that the resolution has not changed its opinion of the inquiry at all, dismissing the whole process as a \u201csham.\u201d A Politico reporter noted that most of the newly released impeachment resolution is in line with current House rules about public hearings. The Democratic chairs of four House committees \u2013 intelligence, judiciary, foreign affairs and oversight \u2013 have released a statement saying that the newly released resolution will provide a \u201cpathway forward\u201d on impeachment. The chairs said: \u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a President who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election. \u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President\u2019s misconduct.\u201d In a fact sheet on the newly released resolution, Democrats told their members that the outlined impeachment procedures would help to ensure \u201ctransparency\u201d and give Trump \u201copportunities to participate.\u201d The president and his allies have complained that the inquiry so far has been too secretive and denied Trump any chance to defend himself, but House Republicans are unlikely to support the resolution. The impeachment resolution notes that, at the beginning of public hearings, the chairman and ranking member of the House intelligence committee \u2013 Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Devin Nunes \u2013 can ask witnesses questions for up to 45 minutes each before proceeding to other committee members. (They may also defer to a committee staffer.) The resolution also allows for the public release of transcripts from interviews so far, \u201cwith appropriate redactions to protect classified and other sensitive information.\u201d The impeachment resolution also establishes that the House intelligence committee, which will handle public hearings in the inquiry, will issue a report on its findings and then transmit its records to the House judiciary committee. The judiciary committee will then refer any potential articles of impeachment to the full House for a vote. Democrats plan to vote on the resolution on Thursday, and it is likely to pass given the high level of support for the inquiry in the House Democratic caucus. The Democratic chairman of the House rules committee has filed the resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry against Trump. According to the resolution, the House intelligence committee will take the lead on planning public hearings as the inquiry advances. The resolution also establishes that Republicans may ask to hear testimony from certain witnesses, but those requests will be declined or approved by Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee. Mitch McConnell said he would not \u201cquestion the patriotism\u201d of any witnesses in the impeachment inquiry after some conservative commentators suggested Alexander Vindman may not be entirely loyal to the United States. Some commentators are now walking back their comments about Vindman, a national security council official and a Purple Heart recipient. Two conservative commentators who questioned the character of Alexander Vindman, the national security council official who is testifying in the impeachment inquiry, have walked back their comments. Former Republican congressman Sean Duffy, who was criticized for suggesting that Vindman may have an \u201caffinity for the Ukraine,\u201d called the Purple Heart recipient \u201can American war hero\u201d in a tweet. John Yoo, a former DOJ official who served under George W Bush, appeared to indicate last night that Vindman may have participated in espionage. However, Yoo said in a statement today: \u201cI did not accuse Lt. Col. Vindman of committing the crime of espionage. I have tremendous respect for a decorated officer of the U.S. Army and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d The Democratic chairman of the House rules committee said he hopes to release the text of the impeachment resolution by 3 p.m. E.T. That announcement comes as even the chairs of the committees leading the impeachment inquiry have voiced conflicting ideas about who will handle public hearings once the investigation advances to that stage. The resolution, which is currently scheduled for a Thursday vote, will hopefully clear up any confusion around those next steps. Although the text of the impeachment resolution has not yet been released, at least one House Democrat, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, is already voicing his likely opposition to it. Van Drew has been vocal about his decision not to support the impeachment inquiry, telling reporters that he will be on the \u201cright side of history.\u201d However, the freshman House member acknowledged that \u201cnot too many\u201d of his Democratic colleagues were likely to join him in opposing the resolution. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic member of the House judiciary committee, said she expected witnesses in the impeachment inquiry to re-testify publicly once the resolution formalizing procedures is approved. The Washington Democrat added that transcripts from the closed-door interviews would likely be publicly released at that point, too. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, has just entered a secure area in the Capitol as he works with other senior House Democrats to finalize a resolution on impeachment procedures. House Republicans have been demanding a chamber-wide vote on the impeachment inquiry since Nancy Pelosi announced its formal launch late last month. However, some of Trump\u2019s top congressional allies are now accusing Democrats of trying to \u201cretroactively legitimize their illegitimate impeachment inquiry,\u201d seemingly reversing their position. There appears to be some confusion among House Democrats about which committee (or committees) will lead the public impeachment hearings once the inquiry advances to that stage. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has suggested his panel would handle the hearings, but other chairs have cast doubt upon that. This confusion may be part of the reason why House majority leader Steny Hoyer voiced skepticism this morning about voting on the impeachment resolution on Thursday. Hoyer said he and other Democrat members have not yet seen the text of the resolution, which is supposed to outline the procedures surrounding next steps of the inquiry. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, is testifying behind closed doors to impeachment investigators. A draft of Vindman\u2019s opening statement indicated he had serious concerns about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, which he listened in on. The president dismissed Vindman, who has served under administrations of both parties and received a Purple Heart after an IED attack in Iraq, as a \u201cnever Trumper.\u201d A senior House Democrat voiced skepticism about holding a Thursday vote on the impeachment resolution, but Nancy Pelosi said the vote would take place as scheduled. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House Democrats who are participating in the deposition of Alexander Vindman accused Republicans of using their questions to try to unmask the identity of the whistleblower who first filed a complaint about the Ukraine call. Republicans denied this allegation, arguing that they had no means of outing the whistleblower because they don\u2019t know who the person is. Senator Mitt Romney slammed attacks on the character of Lt Col Alexander Vindman as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cway off the mark\u201d. Some conservative commentators suggested Vindman, who is testifying about the Ukraine call to impeachment investigators, may not have complete loyalty to the United States because he was born in the Soviet Union and has become an expert on Ukraine. However, the national security council official has also served in Iraq and received a Purple Heart after he was injured in an IED attack. Representative Ted Yoho said this morning that he has chosen not to sit in on depositions in the impeachment inquiry against Trump, even though the Republican lawmaker is entitled to attend as a member of the House foreign affairs committee. The Florida Republican told CNN: \u201cI see this as a sideshow.\u201d He claimed the inquiry was not valid because Democratic leadership has not held a formal vote to launch it, echoing arguments from the president. Pressed by the CNN anchor Poppy Harlow on how he could criticize officials\u2019 testimony without being present for it, Yoho said he intended to intended to attend Alexander Vindman\u2019s deposition and had questions to ask the national security council official. However, it is worth noting that, even as Republicans slam the inquiry for not being transparent and accessible to the GOP caucus, some of those members who could attend the depositions are choosing not to participate. Nancy Pelosi confirmed that the vote on the impeachment resolution was still planned for Thursday, despite her deputy raising doubts about that timeline. House majority leader Steny Hoyer told reporters this morning that he and other Democratic members have not yet seen the text of the resolution and appeared skeptical of plans to hold a vote on it in just two days. A new poll from New Hampshire shows Bernie Sanders leading the Democratic presidential primary in the early voting state. Sanders, who defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary, is attracting the support of 21 percent of the state\u2019s Democratic voters, according to the CNN poll. Elizabeth Warren is closely behind him with 18 percent, while Joe Biden has slightly slipped to 15 percent. Pete Buttigieg has held steady at 10 percent, and no other candidate attracts double-digit levels of support. However, the most surprising part of the poll might be the three candidates hitting 5 percent: representative Tulsi Gabbard, senator Amy Kobuchar and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. The results give Gabbard another qualifying poll for the November debate, but she still needs two more to make the stage. The poll also indicates the race remains very fluid in the early voting state. Alexander Vindman reportedly told impeachment investigators that he took notes during Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and made recommendations to the White House memo on the conversation. If the national security council official still possesses notes on the call that kicked off the formal inquiry, House Democrats may try to subpoena them. Steny Hoyer\u2019s suggestion that the impeachment resolution may not be ready for the planned Thursday vote raises the possibility that the proceedings\u2019 entire timeline could be slightly delayed. However, one Democratic aide said the resolution would be ready for a vote by Thursday because the chairs of the committees leading the inquiry are pushing for it. Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, voiced skepticism that the resolution authorizing impeachment procedures would be ready for a Thursday vote. The Maryland Democrat told reporters on Capitol Hill that he and the rest of the caucus have not yet read the resolution. The text of the proposal was originally set to be revealed today, but Hoyer appeared skeptical of that timeline. The questions over Democrats\u2019 impeachment resolution threatened to take attention away from the testimony of Alexander Vindman, who reportedly intended to tell House investigators that he was concerned after listening to Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The Washington Post has uncovered footage of Lt Col Alexander Vindman, whose family emigrated from the Soviet Union when he was a child, appearing alongside his twin brother in Ken Burns\u2019 documentary series America for a segment on the Statue of Liberty. The segment explores the statue\u2019s power as a symbol to immigrants, like the Vindmans, who have adopted America as their home. According to a draft of his opening statement, Vindman intended to tell impeachment investigators today: \u201cMy family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old ... In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream. \u201cI have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\u201d All of this seems to contradict some conservative commentators\u2019 doubts about Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the United States because he was born in the Soviet Union and has become an expert on Ukraine. Representative Justin Amash, a congressman who left the Republican party over opposition to Trump, cleverly mocked the president\u2019s typo in a tweet claiming Democrats would suffer electoral losses because of the impeachment inquiry. Trump is still tweeting away, arguing that the House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry have a \u201cDeath Wish\u201d when it comes to next year\u2019s elections. However, a number of House Republicans have announced plans to retire or seek higher office in recent months, suggesting that the GOP caucus is the one with doubts about their 2020 prospects. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, declined to attack the integrity of Lt Col Alexander Vindman but still questioned the official\u2019s reported concerns about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. The California Republican told reporters on Capitol Hill: \u201cI thank him for his service ... but he is wrong.\u201d McCarthy also dismissed any notion that Republicans are flip-flopping by voicing opposition to House Democrats\u2019 resolution to authorize impeachment procedures even though GOP lawmakers have been calling for a formal, chamber-wide vote for weeks. However, at least one House Republican, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, is criticizing the commentators questioning the patriotism of Lt Col Alexnader Vindman as he testifies to impeachment investigators. Some Republicans and conservative commentators have questioned the patriotism of Lt Col Alexander Vindman amid reports that the national security council official intends to testify he had concerns about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. A Washington correspondent for the Economist lashed out against those voicing doubts about Vindman, who served in Iraq and received a Purple Heart after being injured in an IED attack. As Alexander Vindman testifies to impeachment investigators about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, Republican lawmakers are struggling to answer a question about whether it would be acceptable for a commander-in-chief to ask foreign countries to investigate their political rivals. Democrats are already rushing to defend Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman after the president dismissed the national security council official as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d Vindman also reportedly intends to tell impeachment investigators in his opening statement: \u201cFor over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations.\u201d Vindman, who served in Iraq and received a Purple Heart after being wounded by an IED, plans to tell the congressional committees that Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president made him concerned the White House was jeopardizing US alliances by trying to advance its political interests. Lt Col Alexander Vindman has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify to the committees leading House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump. The national security council official reportedly intends to tell impeachment investigators about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president and his concerns about the commander-in-chief seeking an investigation into his political rival, Joe Biden. Trump has now weighed in on the looming testimony of Alexander Vindman, the national security council official who reportedly intends to tell impeachment investigators that the president\u2019s Ukraine call made him worried the White House was jeopardizing foreign policy to advance its political interests. Without mentioning Vindman\u2019s name, the president dismissed the official, who has served in Iraq and received a Purple Heart after being wounded in an IED attack, as a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d. It\u2019s notable how Trump keeps moving the goalposts on what constitutes impeachable testimony. He previously said witnesses who testified to an alleged quid pro quo should be discredited because they did not personally hear the call. Now, faced with someone who did personally hear the call, Trump is saying that the impeachment investigators should instead refer to the White House \u201ctranscript\u201d of the call. However, the \u201ctranscript\u201d is actually a White House memo summarizing the call that appeared to cut out much of Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Vindman will probably ill in many of the gaps left by that memo in his testimony today. Good morning, live blog readers! It appears that Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as an illegitimate \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d based on \u201chearsay\u201d testimony is unraveling before our eyes. Lt Col Alexander S. Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the national security council, reportedly intends to tell the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry that Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine made him deeply concerned the president was jeopardizing key foreign policy in the hope of triggering an investigation into his political rival, Joe Biden. Vindman will be the first witness to provide impeachment investigators with a first-hand account of the controversial phone call that kicked off the formal inquiry. According to a draft of his opening statement first obtained by the New York Times, the national security official will tell the House committees this morning: \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d Vindman\u2019s testimony will be the second major blow to Trump\u2019s impeachment defense in less than 24 hours. Nancy Pelosi announced yesterday that House Democrats would introduce a resolution to formalize impeachment procedures, marking the first chamber-wide vote on the inquiry. For weeks, Trump and his allies have derided the impeachment investigation by arguing that the inquiry is an illegitimate scam because the House never formally voted to launch the proceedings. Trump has also dismissed all of the testimony of an alleged quid pro quo as baseless hearsay. It appears that both of those points will be addressed this week. So how will Trump now defend himself against the investigation? And what else will Vindman have to say? Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will have lunch with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and meet the 2019 recipients of the Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking. He will later address donors at his Washington hotel. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, will continue his Middle East trip with meetings in Israel and Saudi Arabia. Game six of the World Series will take place in Houston, where the Astros have a chance to win the championship against the Washington Nationals. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned.",

University technical colleges (UTCs), a type of free school focusing on teaching students who are usually aged between 14 and 19, were also less likely to be rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted, a report by the National Audit Office said. The UTC programme has cost \u00a3792m since it was launched in 2010 with the aim of employers and universities working together to provide technical education, according to the NAO report. Designed by Lord Baker, a minister under Margaret Thatcher, they were intended to give 14-year-olds the option of a technical, artistic and creative education, or an academic education.

Seven years later, he conceded in an article for the Times that they had failed. \u201cThere comes a point when the evidence has accumulated and the verdict is clear and even the most optimistic of us has to acknowledge that Godot won\u2019t arrive, the base metal won\u2019t turn into gold and the emperor really is in the altogether,\u201d Gove wrote. Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, said: \u201cThis report provides further evidence as to why the Department for Education is my top department of concern.\u201d Baker, who founded the Baker Dearing Educational Trust to promote UTCs, said: \u201cThis report records the price of everything and the value of nothing. UTCs should be judged by the success of their students becoming apprentices, studying STEM subjects at a university and getting a job as a technician or an engineer.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \u201cWe have been clear that the department is committed to ensuring people have access to high-quality technical education across the country. UTCs are helping to deliver on that, with 21% of pupils progressing into apprenticeships after completing their post-16 education, more than double the national average. \u201cAs this report recognises, we have taken significant action to support and raise the profile of UTCs to make sure they continue to play a role in our diverse education system and provide the skills that employers need.\u201d",
