      "bodyText": "Northern Scotland registered a \u201cremarkable\u201d overnight temperature of 16.8C (62.2F) in the early hours of Sunday \u2013 a record high for this time of year. North-eastern England and northern Wales were also unusually warm, with 13.3C recorded in Chillingham Barns, Northumberland, and 11.5C in Rhyl. The Scottish figure, recorded by the Met Office at 3am on Sunday in Cassley in Sutherland, is the highest on record for 29, 30 or 31 December. Forecasters have attributed the unseasonably warm weather to a meteorological pattern called the Foehn Effect. It occurs in mountainous areas, creating wet and cold conditions on one side of a mountain and warm and dry conditions on the other. The phenomenon occurs when humid air is pushed over high ground by strong winds. As the moisture-filled air rises, it cools and condenses, resulting in clouds and rain. This then releases dry air, which moves down the mountain\u2019s other side, heating up and raising ground level temperatures as it travels. The effect coincided with gusts of warm air arriving from the southern Atlantic, which have resulted in Britain being warmer than Athens and Rome. This pattern is usually seen in eastern Scotland, north-eastern Wales and north-eastern England. Alex Burkill, a meteorologist for the Met Office, said it was extremely rare to see such high temperatures overnight this late in the year. \u201cGetting temperatures of 16 or 17 degrees in December isn\u2019t all that unusual but it\u2019s remarkable that this was during the night,\u201d he told the BBC. The rest of the UK also experienced mild overnight conditions, but temperatures are expected to drop in the new year. The current record for the highest daytime maximum temperature in December in the UK is 18.3C, registered in Achnashellach in the Scottish Highlands on 2 December 1948.",

No cause of death has been given.</p> <p>Oliver, born in 1957, grew up in County Durham and studied graphic design at Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic. \u201cI was a working class lad from a dull town,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/design/interview-with-graphic-designer-vaughan-oliver-12-19-2014/\">in 2014</a>. \u201cThere was no real culture, my parents were not really interested in anything unusual \u2013 everything I was getting was through record sleeves. It was a democratic way of discovering art.\u201d</p> <p>He moved to London and in 1982 became the first employee for the record label 4AD. As their in-house designer, he created artwork that helped define them as purveyors of dark and complex alt-rock music; with their clashing fonts and boldly allusive but mysterious symbolism, his sleeves became some of the most revered in modern pop. \u201cI like to elevate the banal through surrealism,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cMystery and ambiguity are important weapons in a designer\u2019s arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>4AD paid tribute on their website, <a href=\"https://4ad.com/news/29/12/2019/vaughanoliver19572019\">writing</a>: \u201cThere was no one else like him. Without Vaughan, 4AD would not be 4AD and it\u2019s no understatement to say that his style also helped to shape graphic design in the late 20th century \u2026 he gave both us as a label and our musicians an identity and a voice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/perpetua/status/1211293391444750341\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">RIP Vaughan Oliver, one of the greatest album cover designers ever <a href=\"https://t.co/KqxbkoxZy2\">pic.twitter.com/KqxbkoxZy2</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Perpetua (@perpetua) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/perpetua/status/1211293391444750341?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 29, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>His most famous 4AD designs include Doolittle and Surfer Rosa by Pixies, Treasure by Cocteau Twins and The Drift by Scott Walker; he also designed album covers for artists outside the label, such as Bush\u2019s 1996 US No 1 album Razorblade Suitcase, and Crazy Clown Time, the 2011 album by film director David Lynch.</p> <p>4AD band the Breeders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebreeders/status/1211337398312931328\">wrote</a> \u201cyou will be missed\u201d and posted concept artwork for their single Cannonball, featuring the image: \u201cMan\u2019s testicle alone (pushed through a piece of card to ensure its loneliness)\u201d.</p> <p>Oliver also designed for commercial clients including L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the 2012 London Olympics Games, and directed TV adverts for Microsoft, Sony and Harrods.

Adrian Shaughnessy, a graphic designer who had worked with Oliver, announced the news on Instagram, saying Oliver had died with his partner Lee by his side. No cause of death has been given. Oliver, born in 1957, grew up in County Durham and studied graphic design at Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic. \u201cI was a working class lad from a dull town,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cThere was no real culture, my parents were not really interested in anything unusual \u2013 everything I was getting was through record sleeves. It was a democratic way of discovering art.\u201d He moved to London and in 1982 became the first employee for the record label 4AD. As their in-house designer, he created artwork that helped define them as purveyors of dark and complex alt-rock music; with their clashing fonts and boldly allusive but mysterious symbolism, his sleeves became some of the most revered in modern pop. \u201cI like to elevate the banal through surrealism,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cMystery and ambiguity are important weapons in a designer\u2019s arsenal.\u201d 4AD paid tribute on their website, writing: \u201cThere was no one else like him. Without Vaughan, 4AD would not be 4AD and it\u2019s no understatement to say that his style also helped to shape graphic design in the late 20th century \u2026 he gave both us as a label and our musicians an identity and a voice.\u201d His most famous 4AD designs include Doolittle and Surfer Rosa by Pixies, Treasure by Cocteau Twins and The Drift by Scott Walker; he also designed album covers for artists outside the label, such as Bush\u2019s 1996 US No 1 album Razorblade Suitcase, and Crazy Clown Time, the 2011 album by film director David Lynch. 4AD band the Breeders wrote \u201cyou will be missed\u201d and posted concept artwork for their single Cannonball, featuring the image: \u201cMan\u2019s testicle alone (pushed through a piece of card to ensure its loneliness)\u201d. Oliver also designed for commercial clients including L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the 2012 London Olympics Games, and directed TV adverts for Microsoft, Sony and Harrods. A book collecting his work, Vaughan Oliver: Archive, was published in 2018.",

      "bodyText": "Manchester City could thank the referee, Chris Kavanagh, for his unwitting help in Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s opener in a match in which they struggled yet again. It was a moment of farce that turned the contest, upset Sheffield United, who lost for the first time away this season, and which, in these VAR-troubled times, could not be reviewed as the rules do not allow for an official inadvertently being in the way in the build-up to a goal. A disgruntled Chris Wilder said Kavanagh had not touched the ball so he could not, under the recent rule, award a drop ball. But the Sheffield United manager hinted that Kavanagh told him he wished he could have. \u201cIt is definitely a gamechanger. I\u2019ve been to see the referee and he has been honest,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cWe had a private conversation. Whether the PGMOL say anything that\u2019s up to them.

But since winter hit this year, around six weeks ago, the situation feels like we are simply firefighting. Many days I come on shift to find there are no beds in [our] region and the patients referred to us end up in Southampton, Sheffield, Oxford and other centres far away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/20/doctors-told-to-use-least-unsafe-option-in-norwich-hospital\">Doctors told to use 'least unsafe' option in Norwich hospital</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe PICU network is overstretched. There aren\u2019t enough beds, nurses or skilled doctors.\u201d</p> <p>A PICU doctor in London said: \u201cThis winter has so far been mild and yet pressure on beds from children with respiratory disease or respiratory vulnerability seems recognisably worse than previous years.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no beds to accept patients with invasive pneumonia who need surgical resource, and we are stepping children down from intensive care to the main wards earlier than we would like to make way for the relentless influx of newer, sicker patients. The system is at breaking point.\u201d</p> <p>A consultant at another major London hospital said: \u201cAt one point over a weekend in December there were 11 intubated newborns or babies awaiting PICU beds, with none available anywhere. One of our patients went to Cambridge and another two were transferred out of London too. [This is] dangerous and rotten for the families.\u201d</p> <p>Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge said on 23 December: \u201cSo far this month we have been able to accommodate 32 transfers into our paediatric intensive care unit and paediatric high dependency units, of which four would normally go to London hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>A message sent between PICU doctors in the capital on 17 December said: \u201cThere are no PICU beds in London and three ventilated patients awaiting a bed across London.\u201d</p> <p>Another message shared by PICU doctors on 20 December, seeking a bed for a child at Whipps Cross hospital in London with bronchiolitis, showed that there were no beds at St George\u2019s or King\u2019s College hospitals in south London or in the NHS\u2019s entire North Thames region, which covers east, central and north London and Cambridge.</p> <p>Dr Peter-Marc Fortune, the president of the Paediatric Intensive Care Society, confirmed that early winter circulation of bugs was leading to children being transferred.</p> <p>\u201cAt this time of year things are always very, very busy. We run right at the edge of capacity every year. Everyone feels very buried and that they are working to their limit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Dr Julia Patterson, a spokeswoman for EveryDoctor, a network of grassroots NHS doctors, said: \u201cPaediatric intensive care exists to treat some of the most vulnerable members of our society. After nine years of planned NHS austerity cuts by the government, it is not surprising that the end-point is a lack of safe care for the most vulnerable. But it is a situation which is utterly shocking and totally unacceptable to the UK doctors at the frontline, caring for these patients every day, and we are therefore moved to speak up.</p> <p>\u201cThis situation is being allowed to happen by politicians who have the power to inject emergency funds and turn the situation around.

      "bodyText": "Critically ill children are being rushed from one part of England to another because NHS hospitals are running short of intensive care beds in which to treat them, the Guardian can reveal. An increase in severe breathing problems in children driven by winter viruses and infections, including flu, means some are having to be transferred sometimes many miles from their home area because there are not enough paediatric intensive care (PICU) beds locally. Specialist doctors who staff the units say the situation is \u201cdangerous and rotten for the families\u201d involved and that staff are firefighting to handle the number of children needing sometimes life-saving care, many of whom are on a ventilator to help them breathe. In the past few weeks, young patients have been sent from the Midlands to Sheffield, from London to Cambridge, and from one side of the Pennines to the other in order to get them a place in a PICU. One doctor at a PICU in the Midlands said: \u201cPICU beds are always in high demand. But since winter hit this year, around six weeks ago, the situation feels like we are simply firefighting. Many days I come on shift to find there are no beds in [our] region and the patients referred to us end up in Southampton, Sheffield, Oxford and other centres far away. \u201cThe PICU network is overstretched. There aren\u2019t enough beds, nurses or skilled doctors.\u201d A PICU doctor in London said: \u201cThis winter has so far been mild and yet pressure on beds from children with respiratory disease or respiratory vulnerability seems recognisably worse than previous years. \u201cWe have no beds to accept patients with invasive pneumonia who need surgical resource, and we are stepping children down from intensive care to the main wards earlier than we would like to make way for the relentless influx of newer, sicker patients. The system is at breaking point.\u201d A consultant at another major London hospital said: \u201cAt one point over a weekend in December there were 11 intubated newborns or babies awaiting PICU beds, with none available anywhere. One of our patients went to Cambridge and another two were transferred out of London too. [This is] dangerous and rotten for the families.\u201d Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge said on 23 December: \u201cSo far this month we have been able to accommodate 32 transfers into our paediatric intensive care unit and paediatric high dependency units, of which four would normally go to London hospitals.\u201d A message sent between PICU doctors in the capital on 17 December said: \u201cThere are no PICU beds in London and three ventilated patients awaiting a bed across London.\u201d Another message shared by PICU doctors on 20 December, seeking a bed for a child at Whipps Cross hospital in London with bronchiolitis, showed that there were no beds at St George\u2019s or King\u2019s College hospitals in south London or in the NHS\u2019s entire North Thames region, which covers east, central and north London and Cambridge. Dr Peter-Marc Fortune, the president of the Paediatric Intensive Care Society, confirmed that early winter circulation of bugs was leading to children being transferred. \u201cAt this time of year things are always very, very busy. We run right at the edge of capacity every year. Everyone feels very buried and that they are working to their limit,\u201d he said. Dr Julia Patterson, a spokeswoman for EveryDoctor, a network of grassroots NHS doctors, said: \u201cPaediatric intensive care exists to treat some of the most vulnerable members of our society. After nine years of planned NHS austerity cuts by the government, it is not surprising that the end-point is a lack of safe care for the most vulnerable. But it is a situation which is utterly shocking and totally unacceptable to the UK doctors at the frontline, caring for these patients every day, and we are therefore moved to speak up. \u201cThis situation is being allowed to happen by politicians who have the power to inject emergency funds and turn the situation around. Sick children\u2019s lives are at risk. How can we call ourselves a civilised society when our children\u2019s lives are being wantonly placed at risk?\u201d Disclosure of the acute shortages of PICU beds comes after intensive care doctors said that pressure on beds in the units where they work is worse than official NHS figures show. In an unusual move, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) raised concerns about the accuracy of official NHS \u201csitreps\u201d data. The figures, published weekly by NHS England during winter, detail bed occupancy across the country in intensive care units for adults, paediatric intensive care units for children and neonatal intensive care units for newborns. The most recent data, showing that units in England had been on average 83% full so far this winter, were deceptive and underestimated the true extent of the pressures being felt, the FICM said. Dr Alison Pittard, the FICM\u2019s dean, told the Health Service Journal that many units had been 100% full in December and that its members were concerned that one in four hospitals \u201cdid not recognise their unit\u2019s sitreps data\u201d. NHS England did not respond in detail to the claims but said the figures were submitted by hospitals themselves. It emerged last month that the number of hospital beds available in England has fallen to its lowest ever level because 17,230 beds have been cut since 2010. Many hospitals have opened extra beds to help them cope this winter. In other evidence of the mounting pressures winter is putting on NHS services: The Countess of Chester hospital in Chester has installed three portable buildings in its grounds and is using them as temporary \u201cmodular wards\u201d to give it extra capacity to treat patients. Leicester Royal Infirmary has opened a nine-bed \u201cinterim ambulance handover facility\u201d in a portable building in which patients who are not seriously ill are looked after rather than having to stay with East Midlands ambulance service personnel until A&amp;E staff can accept them. In an unusual move, the East of England ambulance service recently asked its staff if they would work in the A&amp;E units of hospitals in Norwich, King\u2019s Lynn and Gorleston. The Guardian revealed recently that the Norwich and Norfolk hospital in Norwich had come under such strain that doctors had been told to use \u201cthe least unsafe option\u201d when treating patients. It later said the \u201chastily worded email\u201d was sent when it was \u201cunder extreme pressure\u201d. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cSeasonal increases in respiratory illness and other conditions mean there is often higher demand for paediatric intensive care during the Christmas and winter period and as the NHS responds to this extra demand, it is regular practice for local services to work together to provide safe, appropriate and timely care to families.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alasdairgray\" title=\"\">Alasdair Gray</a>, who has died aged 85, was the father figure of the renaissance in Scottish literature and art which began in the penultimate decade of the 20th century. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5jj1yJSJtdM8VL8Bmg036lM/alasdair-gray-at-80-the-liberation-of-lanark\" title=\"\">Gray\u2019s great novel Lanark</a> (1981) was an almost preposterously ambitious concoction of thinly disguised autobiography, science fiction, formal playfulness (the four-part story opened at Book Three) and graphic design by the author on a monumental scale. Scottish fiction, which had lain in a depressed state for years, suddenly took off in unexpected directions.</p> <p>Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner, AL Kennedy and Janice Galloway, among others, were all Gray\u2019s bairns. Authors invited Gray to illustrate their books. Little magazines sported his self-portraits and cursive designs on their covers. A graphic artist known locally for his eccentric appearance and behaviour became, at the age of nearly 50, a central figure of the literary world.</p> <p>Born in Riddrie, in the east of Glasgow, Alasdair was the son of working-class parents with an inclination towards \u201cFabian, non-revolutionary socialism\u201d. His mother Amy (nee Fleming) worked in a clothing warehouse, but nurtured a love of music, particularly opera. His father, Alexander, who ended his working life as a builder\u2019s labourer, sought consolation in the countryside, and was a founder member of the Scottish Youth Hostels Association.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca15b9379fd7ff06790f11e264ce7713915abf83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca15b9379fd7ff06790f11e264ce7713915abf83/0_293_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alasdair Gray at Oran Mor, the arts and leisure centre in a converted church in Kelvinside, Glasgow, where he painted the ceiling and murals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alasdair Gray at Oran Mor, the arts and leisure centre in a converted church in Kelvinside, Glasgow, where he painted the ceiling and murals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their efforts to hold to a life of imagination or adventure, while bound to the necessities of raising a family in an imposing industrial city, infused Gray\u2019s own artistic vision and political instinct. He was a lifelong socialist and Scottish nationalist, who lived in the city of his birth all his life, save for a four-year spell during the second world war, when the family moved to Yorkshire.</p> <p>The publication in 2010 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/23/alasdair-gray-my-life-in-pictures\" title=\"\">A Life in Pictures</a>, a combined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2010/oct/22/alasdair-gray-paintings-gallery\" title=\"\">visual and verbal autobiography</a> and an essential companion to Lanark, revealed not only how much of Gray\u2019s novel was straightforwardly personal, but that the formative events of his life took place in a relatively brief period of his late teens. His mother died in 1952, before he turned 18. In the same year, he was admitted to Glasgow College of Art, despite lacking the necessary paper qualifications. There, he immediately impressed both his teachers and fellow students with fantastic, even visionary, projects; but his artistic stature was cruelly undermined by social failures, particularly involving the opposite sex.</p> <p>Gray suffered from chronic eczema and an accompanying shyness which gave rise to unpredictable outbursts and an excitable delivery that remained characteristic all through his life. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/fiction.alasdairgray\" title=\"\">Lanark</a>, like later novels including <a href=\"https://canongate.co.uk/books/373-1982-janine/\" title=\"\">1982, Janine</a> (1984) and <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-394-58963-3\" title=\"\">Something Leather</a> (1990), is blistering with sexual frustration. Romantic proposals are rejected with misplaced kindliness; healthy erotic wishes are twisted into ugly shapes. The realistic portion of Lanark ends with a prostitute recoiling at the sight of the hero\u2019s reptilian skin, which precipitates his descent to perdition.</p> <p>Some of the pictures he painted at art school were still being exhibited many years later. One was <a href=\"http://www.sorchadallas.com/works/2091/images\" title=\"\">Night Street Self Portrait</a> (1953), which depicts a brooding figure in half-darkness against a background of kissing lovers and happy families. A black cat depicted nine times suggests that life is draining away.

He did several other murals: in Belleisle Street synagogue, in Greenbank church, on the walls of private houses, among other places. Among the last he carried out (2012) was the 40ft <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/alasdair-gray-asks-to-change-hillhead-station-mural-1-3141318\" title=\"\">mural for the entrance hall of Hillhead subway station</a> in the West End of Glasgow.

While at art school, he began a novel called Portrait of the Artist as a Young Scot, which contained the seed that grew into Lanark, almost 30 years later. In the 1960s and 70s, he wrote plays for radio, television and the stage, including some which would later be converted into novels. The Fall of Kelvin Walker (1985), his third novel, began life as a TV play in 1968. McGrotty and Ludmilla (1990) and Mavis Belfrage (1996) had similar origins. Some 20 of these plays were later collected in A Gray Play Book (2009). It included The Cave of Polyphemus, written in 1944, when he was nine.</p> <p>Many writers have had subsidiary careers at the easel, just as artists have written books. What set Gray apart was a determination to integrate the different skills in the process of bookmaking. A words-only version of Lanark, without the elaborate plates, would be tantamount to an abridged edition. His collection of tales, Unlikely Stories, Mostly (1983), was likewise lavishly decorated. In these and other instances, Gray employed motifs and images which became recognisable staples of his design: amazonian women; biblically bearded men; a foetus inside a skull; self-portraits (often showing the subject drawing the artist); doves and dogs; and always an impish figure at the end holding a sign saying \u201cGoodbye\u201d.</p> <p>Another recurring habit was to introduce portraits of friends into his work, including the church murals. The Scottish writers James Kelman, Tom Leonard, Liz Lochhead, among many others, have found themselves immortalised in this way. When I asked Gray to sign a copy of his book Old Men in Love (2007), he took it and drew my portrait on the endpaper (handing it back with \u201cHmmm. Not very flattering\u201d).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNXMBvj3ew\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wbNXMBvj3ew?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alasdair Gray: Magnificent Citizen, a video profile by National Galleries Scotland about the artist\u2019s relationship with his native Glasgow</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 1961, Gray married Inge S\u00f8rensen, a Danish nurse then in her teens.

He and Inge had a son, Andrew, the subject of many affectionate portraits. The couple separated after eight years and later divorced.

      "bodyText": "Alasdair Gray, who has died aged 85, was the father figure of the renaissance in Scottish literature and art which began in the penultimate decade of the 20th century. Gray\u2019s great novel Lanark (1981) was an almost preposterously ambitious concoction of thinly disguised autobiography, science fiction, formal playfulness (the four-part story opened at Book Three) and graphic design by the author on a monumental scale. Scottish fiction, which had lain in a depressed state for years, suddenly took off in unexpected directions. Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner, AL Kennedy and Janice Galloway, among others, were all Gray\u2019s bairns. Authors invited Gray to illustrate their books. Little magazines sported his self-portraits and cursive designs on their covers. A graphic artist known locally for his eccentric appearance and behaviour became, at the age of nearly 50, a central figure of the literary world. Born in Riddrie, in the east of Glasgow, Alasdair was the son of working-class parents with an inclination towards \u201cFabian, non-revolutionary socialism\u201d. His mother Amy (nee Fleming) worked in a clothing warehouse, but nurtured a love of music, particularly opera. His father, Alexander, who ended his working life as a builder\u2019s labourer, sought consolation in the countryside, and was a founder member of the Scottish Youth Hostels Association. Their efforts to hold to a life of imagination or adventure, while bound to the necessities of raising a family in an imposing industrial city, infused Gray\u2019s own artistic vision and political instinct. He was a lifelong socialist and Scottish nationalist, who lived in the city of his birth all his life, save for a four-year spell during the second world war, when the family moved to Yorkshire. The publication in 2010 of A Life in Pictures, a combined visual and verbal autobiography and an essential companion to Lanark, revealed not only how much of Gray\u2019s novel was straightforwardly personal, but that the formative events of his life took place in a relatively brief period of his late teens. His mother died in 1952, before he turned 18. In the same year, he was admitted to Glasgow College of Art, despite lacking the necessary paper qualifications. There, he immediately impressed both his teachers and fellow students with fantastic, even visionary, projects; but his artistic stature was cruelly undermined by social failures, particularly involving the opposite sex. Gray suffered from chronic eczema and an accompanying shyness which gave rise to unpredictable outbursts and an excitable delivery that remained characteristic all through his life. Lanark, like later novels including 1982, Janine (1984) and Something Leather (1990), is blistering with sexual frustration. Romantic proposals are rejected with misplaced kindliness; healthy erotic wishes are twisted into ugly shapes. The realistic portion of Lanark ends with a prostitute recoiling at the sight of the hero\u2019s reptilian skin, which precipitates his descent to perdition. Some of the pictures he painted at art school were still being exhibited many years later. One was Night Street Self Portrait (1953), which depicts a brooding figure in half-darkness against a background of kissing lovers and happy families. A black cat depicted nine times suggests that life is draining away. During the same period, Gray drew a remarkable Marriage Feast at Cana, in which the faces of the disciples are modelled on travellers on the Glasgow underground railway. The picture exists only in reproduction, the original having been lost after having been \u201cleft too long with a photocopying shop. When I went to collect it the firm no longer existed.\u201d Immediately after leaving art school, in 1958, Gray received a commission (unpaid, apart from expenses) to paint a set of murals on the subject of the Creation, in Greenhead Church of Scotland church in Glasgow. \u201cI showed God as the third sentence of Genesis says,\u201d Gray wrote in A Life in Pictures, \u201cmoving over the waters, not like a dove as sometimes depicted, but more like Superman.\u201d The building was neglected over the following decade, and was demolished in 1970, leading to the loss of what Gray called \u201cmy best and biggest mural painting\u201d. He did several other murals: in Belleisle Street synagogue, in Greenbank church, on the walls of private houses, among other places. Among the last he carried out (2012) was the 40ft mural for the entrance hall of Hillhead subway station in the West End of Glasgow. In addition to local landmarks, including the university, it has a section devoted to \u201cAll kinds of folk\u201d \u2013 \u201chard workers\u201d, \u201chead cases\u201d, \u201cqueer fishes\u201d and so on, all represented in Gray\u2019s typical witty and accessible style.

      "bodyText": "Borussia Dortmund have signed the highly rated striker Erling Braut Haaland from RB Salzburg, paying the release clause of \u20ac22.5m with the 19-year-old\u2019s advisor, Mino Raiola, receiving a \u20ac10m payment on top of that. The much-hyped teenager, who has recently been linked with a host of top clubs in the Premier League and around Europe, has signed a contract until 30 June 2024 while Salzburg will receive a percentage of any future sale. Manchester United were interested in the striker, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and the player working together for two seasons at Molde in 2017 and 2018. United have scouted the 19-year-old on several occasions but they and Juventus faced competition from, among others, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Manchester City, Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Chelsea, all of whom had scouted him. In total more than 20 clubs have watched the young Norwegian before Dortmund made their move. It is understood United cooled their interest in the player in the end because of the demands made by Raiola and Alf-Inge H\u00e5land, the player\u2019s father, when it came to the share of any future transfer fee as well as the new buyout clause. In a press release issued by Dortmund, CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said: \u201cDespite interest from many other top clubs in Europe, Erling Haaland has opted for the sporting challenge that BVB is able to offer as well as the opportunities we presented him with. Our persistence has paid off.\u201d The club\u2019s sporting director, Michael Zorc, added: \u201cWe can all look forward to welcoming an ambitious, athletic and physically strong centre forward who has a nose for goal as well as impressive pace. We want to improve him as a player at Dortmund. At 19 years of age, he is of course still at the beginning of what will hopefully be a glittering career!\u201d Haaland scored 17 goals in just 16 league appearances for Salzburg after joining from Molde in January \u2013 as well as eight goals in six Champions League matches. The son of former Nottingham Forest, Leeds and Norway midfielder Alf-Inge, the teenager was born in Leeds. He said: \u201cI had the feeling that I definitely wanted to transfer to this club, take this path and play in the incredible atmosphere that Dortmund provides in front of more than 80,000 spectators.

Your email intrusion is truly not welcome.\u201d So far, 84 jurisdictions in Australia covering about a quarter of the population \u2013 mostly cities and local government areas \u2013 have declared a climate emergency. The first elected body in the world to act, Darebin council in Victoria, is credited with starting a movement that is now supported by governments representing 800 million people worldwide, including the European Union and Bangladesh. In Australia, as ever when it comes to climate policy, the process has been polarising and frustrating. The leaders of one town might have recognised the climate crisis and committed to developing adaptation measures to help the community deal with the impacts of global heating. The next town over might have decided that climate change has nothing to do with local government business such as carting rubbish or fixing potholes. \u201cWe went from talking about the climate emergency, to now all of a sudden we\u2019re living in it,\u201d says Sarah Mollard, a general practitioner from the coastal NSW town of Port Macquarie. \u201cIt was incredibly unsettling to experience the sky going from blue to red in the space of a few hours.

Wellington says the incidents were a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the need to adapt the council\u2019s plans and operations for a changed climate. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware the impacts of climate change will resonate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe costs of not preparing are far greater than doing something now.\u201d \u2018I respect your view to have an opinion on the theory \u2026\u2019 Conservative Wagga Wagga, home of the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, earlier this year declared a climate emergency. A few weeks later, after an increasingly nasty debate, councillors rescinded that declaration. Outraged councillors would later demand the mayor, Greg Conkey, drive an electric vehicle to Sydney and back. He did and has said the journey was a success. Beck had been instrumental in building local support in Wagga Wagga, and in July, while the city was locked in debate about the declaration, she contacted other council areas soliciting support. \u201cNo way!\u201d replied the Tenterfield deputy mayor, Don Forbes. When Beck responded by referring to the water security issues facing the Tenterfield community, which have got worse in the months since, Forbes asked not to receive further emails. When the same email reached Wollondilly shire councillor Simon Landow, a former candidate for Liberal preselection, he replied to say it was not the council\u2019s role. \u201cThe term \u2018climate emergancy\u2019 (sic) \u2026 is very misleading to my residents of Wollondilly,\u201d Landow wrote. \u201cI respect your view to have an opinion on the theory that man is causing catastrophic global warming. \u201cI would like you to respect my view that there is none, and I won\u2019t be deviating from a stance thats is filled with so may (sic) flaws and misconceptions.\u201d Another councillor, Murray Thomas from the Bland Shire, said in response that climatic changes had no relationship to carbon dioxide and would soon be proved to be caused naturally. \u201cHow do you propose explaining that [to] hordes of angry rorted,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously made your choice, suggest you reconsider while you have the opportunity. Just tell \u2019em you were experimenting with psychotic drug samples \u2026 or in a moment of stress you fell victim to carbon rort hype.\u201d",

They were left with little beyond the clothes on their backs and the land they had so carefully built their house on. Even their shoes melted as they ran from the fire. Justin spoke to Guardian Australia while helping to unload another semi-trailer of donations for the village on Saturday. \u201cThe generosity of strangers is overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it comes in waves. You sit down and think OK, I\u2019m OK, and then something else pops up. It ebbs and flows, the intensity of what happens.\u201d They are hoping to have the electricity turned back on at their block so they can live in a caravan while they rebuild, but the meters have all been burned. There is no water or functioning sewerage system. \u201cYou kind of expect [the challenges], but when it\u2019s one after another after another, you just think: just stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,\u201d Justin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the grind of the processes. You\u2019re not sleeping well, you\u2019re not eating well, you look at food and you\u2019re hungry but you can\u2019t eat it.\u201d He said Gabriel\u2019s friends in the choir were \u201cdoing more for us than Wingecaribee council\u201d. \u201cWhat the kids are doing is for the community, that\u2019s the important bit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really chuffed. We\u2019re just bursting at the seams with how proud we are of these kids.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nuno is less than happy. Right, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for all the emails. As a reward, here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s match report from Anfield: Here\u2019s Virgil van Dijk talking to Sky: \u201cIt was always going to be difficult against them \u2013 they\u2019re a fantastic side.\u201d And here\u2019s Sadio Mane on his VAR-delayed goal: \u201cI was not panicked. I knew it was a goal.\u201d Van Dijk, by the way, says he can\u2019t remember if he handballed early in the buildup to Liverpool\u2019s goal. A few replays suggest the ball may have brushed his arm as he controlled it. As for Wolves, they\u2019ll feel aggrieved by the offside decision that ruled out their \u201cgoal\u201d in the first half and they had a flurry of half-chances late on, at least one of which they really needed to take advantage of. So far from a vintage Liverpool performance but just about good enough to see off a much-changed Wolves lineup. At the halfway stage of the season, Klopp\u2019s side have won 18 of 19 games, drawing the other. It\u2019s a quite extraordinary effort. Peep! PEEP!! PEEEEEEP!!! Van Dijk gets his head to the corner, nods it away and that is that. Liverpool go 13 points clear at the summit. 90+4 min: Traore shimmies into space and shoots from 20 yards out \u2013 deflected \u2013 corner \u2026 90+3 min: Moutinho ponders a spectacular effort from 30-odd yards out but instead opts to pop the ball over the back four and out for a goal kick. 90+2 min: Vinagre gets on the end of another lofted pass, Alexander-Arnold tripping over his legs as he chase, but the wing-back blasts the ball high and wide. 90 min: A minimum of four minutes of added time to be played. 89 min: Again the ball is worked really well by Wolves down the left. Jimenez lays the ball back to the edge of the box but once more the effort disappears high into the stands, with Saiss the guilty man this time. Liverpool are hanging on a bit here. 88 min: Chance! Traore takes down a cross-field ball and chips his cross to the back post. Neto nods down smartly for Moutinho on the edge of the box \u2026 but he larrups his volley miles over the bar. 87 min: Robertson crosses low across the face of goal but there\u2019s no red shirt on the end of it. 86 min: Liverpool make changes. Wijnaldum off, Milner on. And Firmino is replaced by Origi. 85 min: Neat buildup play from Liverpool and Robertson curls a cross in from the angle but it curls into the arms of Patricio. 83 min: Jimenez uses his strength to hold off Alexander-Arnold and brings down a long ball before swatting his shot over the bar. Probably for the best \u2013 he might have used his arm to control the ball and there was a hint of a toe offside. 82 min: Milner is preparing to come on for Liverpool as Wolves look to apply some pressure. 79 min: Traore looks for a trademark barrelling run across the Liverpool box but is loose with his control and all of a sudden Liverpool have a four on three break. Firmino\u2019s pass to Salah, though, is not quite good enough and the Egyptian can\u2019t bring the ball properly under his spell. A bit of a let-off for Wolves that. 77 min: Liverpool have the ball exactly where they want it, deep in Wolves territory. They\u2019ve been in fairly complete control since that Van Dijk error. 75 min: Kilman takes a whack and there\u2019s a moment of worry for Wolves, who have used all their subs. He looks OK to hobble on though. 73 min: Traore smartly works some space on the right and looks to clip a cross in with his left but it\u2019s overhit and out for a goal kick. 72 min: Raul Jimenez enters the fray, with Jota the man to make way. 71 min: Pass, pass, pass from Liverpool. Pass, passpasspasspass. 70 min: OK into the last 20 minutes. No more VAR chat. There\u2019s a game on here and Wolves are by no means out of it. 67 min: Alisson gets Van Dijk off the hook with a decent save from Jota, who had just pickpocketed the Dutch defender as he looked to bring the ball out. From the corner, Saiss heads wide. 66 min: Liverpool make their first change: Ke\u00efta comes on for Lallana, who had a pretty bright game. 64 min: Jonny gets back to nick the ball of Man\u00e9\u2019s toe as the Liverpool man prepares to strike at goal. The Kop howls for a penalty but it was a flop of hope rather than expectation from Man\u00e9. 63 min: \u201cIn one sense I\u2019m disappointed the offside goal wasn\u2019t given, but once you allow technology in at all, there\u2019s no way you can allow \u2018slightly wrong\u2019 decisions to stand and only overturn \u2018downright out of order\u2019 decisions,\u201d writes Nick Parish, who is correct. \u201cYou have to get all decisions right. So the only alternative is not to allow VAR at all, which means allowing wrong decisions that could have been corrected. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an optimal outcome, although making VAR decisions quicker would certainly be a start.\u201d 61 min: Firmino turns on a sixpence on the edge of the box, but his half volley is well over the bar. 60 min: Traore gets his first chance to run with the ball but Lallana is quickly on the scene to end the break. 58 min: Wolves subs: Dendoncker off, Traore on. Neves off, Saiss on. Nuno rolls the dice. 57 min: Neto works himself some space just outside the box but can\u2019t direct his effort on target. 56 min: Jota chests down at the back post and flashes a shot across goal and narrowly wide. The linesman flag was up but what does that really mean any more? 54 min: Another corner for Liverpool, another Wolves clearance. For all Alexander-Arnold\u2019s quality, his set piece delivery hasn\u2019t been great today. 52 min: Wijnaldum climbs highest but his header flicks off a defender. Another corner \u2026 but Wolves stand firm and Robertson hoofs the ball out for a goal kick. 51 min: Alexander-Arnold whips in a dangerous cross and forces a corner \u2026 48 min: \u201cI\u2019m not sure the offside lunacy can be fixed once you get into the world of freeze frames,\u201d writes Tom Hopkins. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve dived into VAR like we dive into all new technology - because the people touting it told us it was inevitable and without any consideration of unintended consequences. Might be an idea to stop doing that?\u201d You mean they were so obsessed with whether they could that they didn\u2019t stop to think whether they should? I do think if they\u2019re going to stick with it we need some sort of rule change where the benefit goes to the attacker in situations where it\u2019s so close to level that there\u2019s clearly no real world advantage. But, once you start unpicking it \u2026 46 min: Moutinho bobbles a volley at goal as Wolves start the second period on the front foot. Peep! Off we go again. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen the offside, here\u2019s a screengrab: The offside? Well, we can rehash all the arguments from yesterday and on multiple weekends throughout the season. For me, that\u2019s not offside in any version of the game I want to watch. Rather than make the whole spectacle slicker and smarter, offside VAR has introduced a new level of stupidity to the game. So shall we dissect those decisions? The Liverpool goal? I guess a positive use of VAR \u2013 an incorrect refereeing decision was corrected by the technology. The problem is the delay \u2013 which was far, far, far too long \u2013 and the fact that it was fortuitous that Taylor had not blown his whistle before the ball crossed the line. If he\u2019d blown half a second earlier VAR wouldn\u2019t have been able to fix the decision. So do referees now need to officiate on a three-second delay? Well, well, well. A very eventful end to a half that at times drifted along a little sleepily. And again it\u2019s VAR in the spotlight. Joy. Remember all those pointlessly close VAR offside calls yesterday? This is another. Jonny had a toe offside in the buildup. Nuno is predictably furious (and picked up a booking before that decision even came through). Or is it? Neto sweeps home but there could be one of those offside calls. 45+2 min: Moutinho takes it short and makes a right old pig\u2019s ear of it. He\u2019s a little fortunate to win another which is this time swung in and cleared. 45 min: Lallana gets a booking and Neves gets to line up a dangerous free-kick \u2026 which is deflected away for a corner. 44 min: Lallana flicked on Van Dijk\u2019s long pass and Man\u00e9 swept home just as Taylor blew his whistle. Apparently over at Stockley Park they were looking both at the handball decision and whether the referee had blown the whistle before the ball had crossed the line (which he apparently had not). And it\u2019s given! I think it\u2019s probably the right decision. 42 min: It does look like it came off Lallana\u2019s shoulder to me \u2026 41 min: Man\u00e9 has the ball in the net but the referee Anthony Taylor blows for handball against Lallana \u2013 VAR is having a look and I think this might end up being given. Let\u2019s see. 40 min: Wolves have grown into this a touch \u2013 Liverpool haven\u2019t really created anything for 10 minutes or so. 39 min: Jonny skitters into the box onto the end of Dendoncker\u2019s pass but the Liverpool defence cope with his cross with little fuss. 37 min: Vinagre horribly misjudges Van Dijk\u2019s diagonal ball but Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross (with his left this time) is miserably miscued. 35 min: Jota does brilliantly down the Wolves left to get his team on the front foot. He pulls the ball back to Neto but again the support just isn\u2019t there and the attack breaks down. 33 min: Neves and Lallana collide in midfield, the Wolves man taking a painful whack in the lower ribs. He\u2019ll be OK to continue though. 31 min: \u2026 which is met by Firmino and nodded just wide. I\u2019m not much of an xG expert but I imagine Liverpool are hovering around \u201cSome\u201d while Wolves are very much sitting on \u201cNone\u201d. 30 min: Liverpool get a lucky bobble over on the right, Henderson feeds Man\u00e9 and it takes a good block from Bennett to deny him. Corner \u2026 28 min: Mane just fails to get on the end of another sumptuous Trent Alexander-Arnold cross. 26 min: A bit of a lull. 25 min: Wolves are really lacking a presence up front \u2013 fair to day that Jimenez is being missed at the moment. 23 min: A lovely turn from Firmino in the box but he can\u2019t find Man\u00e9 with his pass. 22 min: A bit of 80s Wimbledon vintage from Liverpool: Van Dijk pings a long ball onto the head of Man\u00e9. He nods down to Salah, who connects well with his volley but it\u2019s straight at Patricio. 20 min: Jota does well to hold up the ball in the Liverpool area but the visitors are struggling to get numbers forward. 19 min: A Wolves attack founders and Salah slaloms away with defenders trying to keep pace. He squares to Firmino, who cuts inside but his effort is deflected into the grateful hands of Rui Patricio. 17 min: Firmino seems to be playing a little deeper than usual with Salah and Mane narrower and further forward than usual. 15 min: Salah pressures Vinagre into conceding a corner. It\u2019s taken quickly and drops very nicely to Wijnaldum, but the Dutch midfielder hammers his effort well over the bar. Decent chance that. 14 min: Vinagre gets in the way of Lallana\u2019s cross as he and Salah look to create something down the right again. 12 min: Salah gets in behind after a one-two with Lallana and Wolves bodies are flung in the way as he skitters across and attempts to shoot. The flag is up anyway and Wolves get the chance to clear. 10 min: Already there\u2019s that sense that it\u2019s not if but when for Liverpool. Though in fairness that Salah chance is all they really have to show for the opening 10 minutes. 8 min: The corner comes to nought. 7 min: Neto gets his foot on the ball for the first time and looks to run past Gomez. The defender gets across but can only concede a corner \u2026 5 min: Alexander-Arnold\u2019s ball forward is nodded away by Coady, who came through at Anfield before heading off in search of first-team football. 4 min: It should be 1-0! Alexander-Arnold is fed by Lallana on the right. He has oceans of space and crosses low to Salah, who diverts the ball over the bar from close range. 2 min: Salah gets some space on the left of the Wolves box and dinks a cross towards the back post. Alexander-Arnold, thundering in, makes a decent contact but it\u2019s straight into the nearest defender. Confident start from the home side, though, as you\u2019d expect. 1 min: \u201cChampions of the world!\u201d sing the home fans as the Liverpool back four stroke the ball between them. PEEP! Off we go then, Wolves kicking towards the Kop in the firs half. By the by, the visitors have had to make a late change on the bench: Cutrone is ill so 21-year-old Danish defender Oskar Buur is among the subs in his stead. Handshakes all round and we\u2019re about to get under way. Click-clack, click-clack \u2026 the players are in the tunnel, Liverpool with their new golden World Club Champions badge proudly on their chests. Here\u2019s some pre-match managerial thoughts on the lineups: Jurgen Klopp: \u201cWe thought about changes but it was not really possible. Shaq would have started but he was not available.\u201d Nuno on the four changes he has made: \u201cNo matter who is inside the pitch we are always confident we can compete with the best.\u201d History is against an upset this afternoon: Chelsea\u2019s late comeback win over Arsenal is a bit of a blow for Wolves \u2013 had the score stayed as it was at 82 minutes Nuno\u2019s team could\u2019ve gone fourth with an unlikely victory this evening. Some pre-match reading: And, nothing to do with this game, but I want also to draw your attention to David Hills\u2019s brilliant alternative sports awards: Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Adrian, Milner, Keita, Origi, Jones, Elliott, Williams. Wolves: Patricio; Bennett, Coady, Kilman; Jonny, Neves, Dendoncker, Moutinho, Vinagre; Jota, Neto. Subs: Ruddy, Doherty, Jimenez, Cutrone, Saiss, Traore, Otasowie. So it looks like four changes and 3-5-2 for Wolves. Hello all. And welcome to coverage of an awkward junction on Liverpool\u2019s not-particularly-busy four-lane motorway to the title. But such is Liverpool\u2019s lead now at the top of the table that the championship almost isn\u2019t the issue any more. Can Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side can they go through the season unbeaten? Can they set a record points tally? And, this afternoon, can Wolves take a step towards crashing the Champions League party? Kick off is 4.30pm GMT and the team news is so close you can almost touch it.",

This sounds paradoxical but, once you\u2019ve watched a club like this for long enough, reading the early signs of calamity becomes a sort of sixth sense, an almost shamanic instinct, like being able to see tomorrow\u2019s weather in the pattern of a leaf.

      "body": "<p>The church has become home to the flower-arranging few. The local high street is losing its appeal. But the disappearance of the British pub feels like it represents something more profound about the ebbing away of community. Hence it is good news that after a decade of decline the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/11/british-pub-numbers-grow-for-first-time-in-decade\" title=\"\">pubs is rising</a>. The reason that one in four of them had gone since 2008 is down perhaps in part to social conditions. Drink driving is not just unlawful but culturally unacceptable. Smoking is banned. A younger generation of drinkers has different tastes and different lifestyles: why go out when you have Netflix and a fridge full of hand-picked beers? More and more young adults are teetotallers.</p> <p>There is also less money about, and the pub\u2019s image was perhaps not helped by Nigel Farage\u2019s obvious joy at being inside one. While there are now fewer pubs than a decade ago, they are better run \u2013 offering higher-quality food served from bigger kitchens. Revenue per venue <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcdc2b06-f163-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f\" title=\"\">increased</a> by 13% between 2008 and 2016. Our immoderation has probably also helped: drinkers in the UK get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/15/britons-get-drunk-more-often-than-35-other-nations-survey-finds\" title=\"\">drunk</a> more than those in any other nation in the world, though not necessarily in pubs.</p> <p>While getting the finances sorted is important, it is the fact that they are the beating heart of many places that makes them stand out. Little wonder that <a href=\"https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/2019/03/10/700835354/it-takes-a-village-to-save-a-british-pub?t=1576794184560\" title=\"\">community groups</a> have sprung up to rescue local watering holes. In Scotland there are women-only clubs to provide a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/best-in-edinburgh/whats-on-news/meet-edinburghs-women-only-beer-16130862\" title=\"\">safe space</a>\u201d to discover the world of craft beer. The inn, tavern and public house represent a solid link to the past in a world that appears indifferent to tradition. History was made in them.

      "bodyText": "The church has become home to the flower-arranging few. The local high street is losing its appeal. But the disappearance of the British pub feels like it represents something more profound about the ebbing away of community. Hence it is good news that after a decade of decline the number of pubs is rising. The reason that one in four of them had gone since 2008 is down perhaps in part to social conditions. Drink driving is not just unlawful but culturally unacceptable. Smoking is banned. A younger generation of drinkers has different tastes and different lifestyles: why go out when you have Netflix and a fridge full of hand-picked beers? More and more young adults are teetotallers. There is also less money about, and the pub\u2019s image was perhaps not helped by Nigel Farage\u2019s obvious joy at being inside one. While there are now fewer pubs than a decade ago, they are better run \u2013 offering higher-quality food served from bigger kitchens. Revenue per venue increased by 13% between 2008 and 2016. Our immoderation has probably also helped: drinkers in the UK get drunk more than those in any other nation in the world, though not necessarily in pubs. While getting the finances sorted is important, it is the fact that they are the beating heart of many places that makes them stand out. Little wonder that community groups have sprung up to rescue local watering holes. In Scotland there are women-only clubs to provide a \u201csafe space\u201d to discover the world of craft beer. The inn, tavern and public house represent a solid link to the past in a world that appears indifferent to tradition. History was made in them.

The 31-year-old has spent the past hour riding prone on a soft-top board at the Wave in Bristol, a new artificial surfing lagoon that caters for people of all abilities and needs.</p> <p>Paralysed from the chest down since she fell from a balcony when she was 22, she credits her passion for water sports and snow sports with fuelling her physical and mental rehabilitation. Yet Elwes, who lives in London, had never before tried surfing.</p> <p>\u201cI love stuff when it\u2019s \u2018on\u2019 the water \u2013 it\u2019s my happy place,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first [after the accident] I was very wobbly but skiing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/05/healthandwellbeing.features2\">wakeboarding</a> has given me strength. Most of all it\u2019s helped me mentally, emotionally and with confidence. Having these kinds of experiences is a total gift.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thewave.com/\">The Wave</a> was conceived by Nick Hounsfield, a former osteopath who is also the director of British Surfing.

It\u2019s like the messages to the muscles have started working,\u201d she says. Furthermore, regular surfing has a profoundly positive impact on his behaviour and happiness.</p> <p>Academic evidence to support water-based healthcare \u2013 so-called blue health \u2013 is growing, according to Dr Easkey Britton, a marine social scientist who <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapro/advance-article/doi/10.1093/heapro/day103/5252008#127801041\">collated the findings</a> of 33 studies featuring more than 2,000 people. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something about [being on, in or near] water that benefits how we feel in our bodies,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of a physical disability, it\u2019s the sense of freedom from gravity which takes the pressure off joints.

      "bodyText": "Fresh from her first ever surf, Sophie Elwes looks chilly but energised. The 31-year-old has spent the past hour riding prone on a soft-top board at the Wave in Bristol, a new artificial surfing lagoon that caters for people of all abilities and needs. Paralysed from the chest down since she fell from a balcony when she was 22, she credits her passion for water sports and snow sports with fuelling her physical and mental rehabilitation. Yet Elwes, who lives in London, had never before tried surfing. \u201cI love stuff when it\u2019s \u2018on\u2019 the water \u2013 it\u2019s my happy place,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first [after the accident] I was very wobbly but skiing and wakeboarding has given me strength. Most of all it\u2019s helped me mentally, emotionally and with confidence. Having these kinds of experiences is a total gift.\u201d The Wave was conceived by Nick Hounsfield, a former osteopath who is also the director of British Surfing. Opened in October, it is the first wave pool in the UK painstakingly crafted with people with disabilities in mind: smooth access ramps, dedicated changing facilities, beach wheelchairs and specially trained surf coaches are among its features. \u201cFrom day one, our aim was to make sure the space was accessible physically and in terms of culture, to make sure that all people have the same opportunities on site as each other and to normalise being around people who have got physical or mental health issues,\u201d Hounsfield says. By coincidence, half a dozen experienced adaptive surfers, among them men and women with physical, visual and learning impediments, also arrive to surf on the same day as Elwes. Louis Sutton, a 19-year-old who has autism, cerebral atrophy, cerebral palsy and dyspraxia, has come with his mother, Suzanne. Sutton\u2019s combination of illnesses makes it difficult for him to navigate social situations, Suzanne explains, and he lacks the balance and coordination to play sports such as basketball and football. But he surfs with enviable poise and style, carving down the green faces of waves in the advanced section of the lagoon. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why, we don\u2019t know how; all we know is that his physiotherapist has said surfing is now officially part of his treatment. It\u2019s like the messages to the muscles have started working,\u201d she says. Furthermore, regular surfing has a profoundly positive impact on his behaviour and happiness. Academic evidence to support water-based healthcare \u2013 so-called blue health \u2013 is growing, according to Dr Easkey Britton, a marine social scientist who collated the findings of 33 studies featuring more than 2,000 people. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something about [being on, in or near] water that benefits how we feel in our bodies,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the context of a physical disability, it\u2019s the sense of freedom from gravity which takes the pressure off joints. For some amputees it really reduces the dependency on narcotics and pain medication. And mentally, psychologically, it has this huge effect on mood and wellbeing.\u201d Britton ascribes this to the soothing sensation of water over the body and says three publications due out next year will further support the evidence in relation to adaptive surfing, in particular. Cornwall is already ahead of the curve: since 2010, NHS doctors have been prescribing surfing for children who are vulnerable to mental health issues. For Bruno Hansen, a yachtsman and four-time adaptive surfing world champion, the logic is simple: \u201cWe come from a womb where we\u2019re in water and we\u2019re made up of, what, [up to] 75% water? So I think we\u2019re water creatures deep down.\u201d Watching Elwes surf, Hansen recalls how he was paralysed in 1998 in a carjacking in South Africa and, a few years later, paddled into the ocean to drown himself. Instead, he says, he inadvertently caught a wave that \u201crebooted\u201d him. \u201cWhen I broke my back I thought: I can\u2019t surf, I\u2019ve got no job, I can\u2019t captain a boat, and no girl\u2019s ever going to want me \u2013 what\u2019s the point of life?\u201d he says. \u201cBut that all got wiped away by catching one little wave, like these beginner waves. So, to me, the healing power of surfing is way beyond what people realise.\u201d The problem in Britain is that surfing is often inaccessible. Ethan Jolosa, 14, and his mother, Leah, frequently make a three-hour round trip to the Gower Peninsula in Wales, where Ethan learned to surf with supervision from the charity Surfability. \u201cWhen you go to the beach, sometimes they have massive steps, it\u2019s uneven, the shore is a long way away,\u201d Leah says. \u201cBut here [at the Wave] it\u2019s very flat and calm and accessible. They have four lifeguards for each group, they have slipways into the water; they\u2019ve really thought about people\u2019s adaptive needs.\u201d Elwes describes a feeling of empowerment after her surf: she was offered a choice of boards before being safely propelled into whitewater waves by a team of three coaches, who swiftly came to her aid on the sole occasion she wiped out. \u201cIt was truly an inclusive experience,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish the whole world was designed [accessibly] like this.\u201d After two hours in the water, Sutton offers the most telling verdict yet. \u201cIt was good,\u201d he says \u2013 three words that delight his mother because he is usually reluctant to talk to strangers. \u201cSurfing gives him something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes him feel, I don\u2019t know, maybe part of life.\u201d",

Leeds stormed into a two-goal lead after strikes from H\u00e9lder Costa and Jack Harrison but a calm finish from 16-year-old Jude Bellingham was followed by Lukas Jutkiewicz\u2019s scrambled header to make it 2-2. Luke Ayling\u2019s dipping volley put Leeds back ahead only for Jeremy Bela\u2019s header in the 83rd minute following goalkeeper\u2019s Kiko Casilla\u2019s misjudgement. Under 60 seconds later, Stuart Dallas scored his second late strike of the festive period to make it 4-3 to Leeds. Then came Jutkiewicz\u2019s sliding finish at the far post, and Harding\u2019s crucial mistake, forced by a fierce cross from the excellent Ayling.

      "bodyText": "As AFLW star Erin Phillips fell to the ground clutching her knee on 31 March 2019, the record crowd of 53,034 held their breath. She was taken off the field on a stretcher, and the crowd rose as one to applaud her, while teammates and opponents alike flocked to give her their well wishes. It seems every year there is huge growth in women\u2019s sport. Each new year brings bigger crowd figures, new competitions, increased television coverage and new records being set. But as the nation took to social media to share in the emotion of Phillips\u2019 anterior cruciate ligament injury, it was clear there was another, less quantifiable, factor at play. Earlier this month, journalist Isabelle Westbury faced backlash on Twitter when she was critical of the criteria for Britain\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year award. \u201cBen Stokes should win based on the criteria (athlete whose 2019 actions have most captured UK public\u2019s imagination),\u201d Westbury tweeted. \u201cBut I think the criteria need to be changed because I think it\u2019s fundamentally disadvantageous towards women.\u201d Westbury argued athletes can\u2019t capture the public\u2019s imagination if they\u2019re not in the public eye. While this is undoubtedly true in the UK, women\u2019s sport in Australia in 2019 made huge strides towards breaking down these barriers. From the AFLW grand final, to the Matildas embarking on their World Cup campaign where, despite a disappointing round of 16 finish, the footballers were again named the team to whom Australians feel the strongest emotional connection. Matildas\u2019 striker Sam Kerr broke records of her own, signing a deal with Chelsea that made her the world\u2019s most expensive female footballer, before being named the best female footballer on the planet by the Guardian\u2019s panel of judges. Kerr was just one of an elite group of Australian female athletes who took the world by storm and led the charge to push women\u2019s sport to the top of the nation\u2019s sporting agenda. Ashleigh Barty joined her with a breakthrough grand slam win at the French Open. The win sparked Australia\u2019s renewed interest in the women\u2019s competition at Wimbledon and although Barty couldn\u2019t repeat her Roland Garros heroics, she finished the year ranked No1 and cemented her place in Australia\u2019s sporting elite. Unlike Barty, Hannah Green appeared to come from nowhere when she took out the women\u2019s PGA championship at Hazeltine and became the first Australian woman to win a golf major since Karrie Webb in 2006. Green\u2019s win dragged women\u2019s golf back into the spotlight and thrust her into the hearts and minds of the Australian public. With the Australian men\u2019s cricket team still emerging from the wreckage of sandpaper-gate, the women\u2019s team were more than ready to pick up the pieces of the public\u2019s broken hearts and give them something to celebrate. The complete dominance of the team in the 2019 Ashes series paved the way for a home summer that started with Alyssa Healy\u2019s world-record 148 in a T20 international against Sri Lanka. Healy later won the ICC\u2019s women\u2019s T20 cricketer of the year award, with teammate Ellyse Perry taking out the top honour of international women\u2019s cricketer of the year. From there, the first standalone Women\u2019s Big Bash League season brought a 25% increase in television viewers with over 375,000 viewers tuning in to watch Healy and Perry\u2019s Sydney Sixers take on crosstown rivals Sydney Thunder in the season opener. Staging the season as a series of carnival weekends around the country proved a hit with fans and players alike as the competition introduced the public to an earlier start to the cricket season. With the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final looking to break world-record crowd figures for the final at the MCG in March, Australia\u2019s women\u2019s cricketers have shown they are more than up to the task of drawing big numbers and building a deep connection with their fans. Netball has long been the frontrunner in Australian women\u2019s sport and despite inroads being made by many others, it continues to set the standard in professionalism and high-performance culture. This was backed up by a strong Super Netball season with over 900,000 people tuning in to watch the NSW Swifts win their first title since 2008 and a total of 5.939m viewers on television across the season. The Diamonds\u2019 one-goal loss to New Zealand in July\u2019s Netball World Cup only increased the public\u2019s hunger for the old rivalry; huge crowds flocked to the Constellation Cup games in Sydney and Perth to see Australia retain the trophy by the slimmest of margins. While there is still a long way to go in dismantling the systemic barriers that have prevented women\u2019s sport from taking its place in the Australian sporting landscape, 2019 will go down as the year that Australia\u2019s female athletes shone so brightly that the public had no choice but to consider their imaginations well and truly captured.",

In total the pair played against each other 10 times during their playing careers, with Arteta winning three, Lampard two and the other five matches being drawn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f98c85f3d714df5842bf053968fbfef92730ad0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f98c85f3d714df5842bf053968fbfef92730ad0d/0_9_3367_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lampard tackles Danny Welbeck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lampard tackles Danny Welbeck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T13:26:32.554Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e08a50b8f08c39722641d5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T13:10:57.807Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Team news news: </strong>Granit Xhaka misses out through a mysterious illness, 48 hours on from his agent saying that the midfielder was dead keen on a move to Hertha Berlin.

      "bodyText": "Read David Hytner\u2019s match report: Do join John Ashdown for more fun and games: A reminder Rangers won the Old Firm derby earlier: And that Erling Braut Haaland is now a Dortmund player: Some Chelsea reaction. \u201cI give credit to the boys, credit to Jorginho,\u201d says Tammy Abraham, towering alongside the Italian. \u201cIn the first 30 minutes they dominated the ball, they were popping us in midfield and then this man comes on and it\u2019s a whole different ball game. Him coming on lifted us as a team.\u201d What a turnaround by Frank Lampard\u2019s side, and what a task ahead for Mikel Arteta after Arsenal lose four successive home games for the first time in 60 years. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring but a dreadful mistake by Bernd Leno gifted Chelsea a route back in before Tammy Abraham struck the winner with three minutes left on the clock. With more than half the season gone, Arsenal are closer to the relegation zone than they are to Chelsea \u2013 they are six points above Aston Villa and 11 off fourth place \u2013 after a run of one win in 12 league matches. As for Chelsea, they trail third-placed Manchester City by three points. 90+4 min: Torreira stabs a volley well wide after Aubameyang did brilliantly to hook the ball into his path inside the box. That Abraham strike has shot Arsenal to pieces. Leno is still shaking his head in fury. 90+3 min: Abraham tries and fails to put the icing on the cake after galloping into the Arsenal box unchallenged. Mustafi kept backing off. 90 min: Ainsley Maitland-Niles is booked as the fourth official indicates there will be seven added minutes. Up in the directors\u2019 box, Edu grimaces. Arsenal have made a mess of this. A killer counterattack is ruthlessly rounded off by Tammy Abraham. Chelsea clear an Arsenal cross and break upfield, with Willian fleeing to the byline before cutting a ball back for Abraham, who takes an age to steady himself before swivelling and burying a shot into the corner of Leno\u2019s goal. Lampard bounces down the touchline and Arteta tries to rally the troops. 86 min: Arteta seeks change, with Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 replacing Reiss Nelson. It was the kind of goalkeeping error that may find its way on to the end-of-year bloopers reel. An absolute howler by Leno. A Christmas gift by Leno allows Jorginho to tap in at the back post. The Arsenal goalkeeper punches thin air as he tries to clear Mount\u2019s cross, allowing the lurking Chelsea midfielder to stroke home unmarked. A head-in-hands moment for Arteta. There was a VAR check for offside but there is no reprieve for Leno. 82 min: Lacazette is penalised down the Chelsea left and the visitors win an opportunity to swing a cross in, 25 yards from goal ... 80 min: Chelsea have Arsenal as good as penned in. Lampard is urging his side forward from the touchline, with Willian and Hudson-Odoi leading the charge. Abraham has been too isolated for Lampard\u2019s liking. 77 min: This game is beginning to open up once more. 76 min: Craig Pawson has booked Lacazette for dissent after Jorginho, who is on a yellow card, clashes with Guendouzi on halfway, stopping the Arsenal midfielder in his tracks. Jorginho can count himself lucky. 75 min: Mesut \u00d6zil feels the love from the Arsenal support, soaking up the applause before being replaced by Joe Willock. 74 min: Abraham, Willian and Mount combine and Chelsea carve open the Arsenal back line, with David Luiz whacking Mount\u2019s cross in search of Abraham clear for a corner. It was an incisive exchange between the Chelsea trio. The resulting corner leads to Abraham towering above his marker, only to nod straight at Bernd Leno. 73 min: Another booking, this time for Torreira for tugging on Mount\u2019s shirt. Arsenal have moved deeper, Chelsea are going the other way. 72 min: Lacazette buys Arsenal a free-kick after a challenge by Jorginho. Some much-needed respite for Arteta\u2019s side, who have begun to fade. 70 min: Hudson-Odoi replaces Kovacic, who has had better games. 69 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi has been given a pep talk by Joe Edwards, the Chelsea assistant first-team coach. Lampard is not hanging around; he will feel Hudson-Odoi can hurt an Arsenal defence that have kept just three clean sheets in the league all season. 66 min: Lamptey shoots infield before slipping Abraham in inside the box. Abraham delays taking the shot on, subsequently allowing David Luiz to bite back at his man. In the end Abraham\u2019s shot is blocked and the chance dissipates. 65 min: Chelsea are patiently probing, seemingly waiting to strike. Frank Lampard\u2019s side are in the ascendency. Can Arsenal turn the tide back in their favour? They have not had too much to shout about in this half. 62 min: Mustafi and R\u00fcdiger are back on their feet and moving. Good news. Back to the action, then. And Kant\u00e9\u2019s influence seems to be growing. Arsenal\u2019s grasp on this game is not as tight as it was. 60 min: A lengthy stoppage \u2013 both players are continuing to receive treatment for that clash of heads \u2013 allows Chelsea to make a change. Fikayo Tomori, who has struggled at right-back, is replaced by the 19-year-old defender Tariq Lamptey, who is on for his Premier League debut. Among those up in the posh seats are George Graham, Petr Cech and the England assistant Steve Holland. 57 min: Chelsea are beginning to put a few building blocks together. They win a corner through Kant\u00e9 and the Frenchman ends up whipping a dangerous ball into the box after Willian rolled the ball into his feet. Leno punches Kant\u00e9\u2019s cross clear and then there is a stoppage after a clash of heads between Mustafi and R\u00fcdiger. Mustafi had done brilliantly to make life difficult. 55 min: Lacazette is riled after breezing beyond Jorginho, who then tugs at the Arsenal forward\u2019s shirt. Pawson has no choice but to book the Italy midfielder, who is desperate to stay out of further trouble. As he lays on the floor, a mini melee ensues but it is all relatively tame and the fire soon goes out. 54 min: N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 robs \u00d6zil on the edge of the Chelsea box before driving upfield and freeing Willian. In the end Chelsea make a hash of it and the move breaks down but Chelsea are at least asking questions of an Arsenal team that were untroubled in the first half. And now things are spicing up ... 52 min: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a particularly rancorous game, but it would be amazing if there isn\u2019t a red card before the end \u2013 and Mustafi hasn\u2019t even committed a bad tackle yet,\u201d emails Charles Antaki. \u201cPlenty of time.\u201d 50 min: Arteta is livid as Nelson is upended by Zouma after ghosting past Jorginho. Nelson is adamant it is a foul but Craig Pawson is unmoved. 48 min: Chelsea have arguably played better in the opening three minutes of this second half than the entire first 45 minutes. Another ball in to Abraham causes panic in the Arsenal box before David Luiz ushers it back to Leno. Chelsea\u2019s tails are up and Arsenal could do with extinguishing the visitors\u2019 newfound optimism. 47 min: David Luiz is booked for a clumsy foul on Willian. Cue a hearty rendition of \u2018Chelsea reject\u2019 chants from the pocket of away supporters. The visitors earn a chance to fizz a ball into the box, 30 yards from goal. Mount plays a looping ball towards the back post and it is headed back across goal, before dropping to Kant\u00e9, who volleys wide. A decent chance. 46 min: Lacazette rolls the ball to Aubameyang and, just like that, Arsenal get the second half started at the Emirates Stadium. Half-time encouragement for Arsenal, courtesy of Opta: this is the 16th time Arsenal have led Chelsea at half-time in a Premier League tie \u2013 they have never lost against them from this position, winning 12 games and drawing three ... More on that Erling Braut Haaland news: Borussia Dortmund have pulled off a coup to land the Norway striker on a deal until 2024. The 19-year-old has scored 16 goals in 14 appearances in the Austrian top division this season: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s 13th goal of the season is the difference at the interval and, in truth, Arsenal have been far superior to Chelsea from start to finish. As a result, Frank Lampard goes jogging down the tunnel as soon as Craig Pawson blows his whistle. In the final minute of first-half stoppage-time Aubameyang proved he is happy to do the dirty work, too, making a fine block to deny Fikayo Tomori a clean shot at goal. So far, so good for Mikel Arteta, whose side could have doubled their advantage through Lacazette. 45 min: There will be five added minutes. 44 min: David Luiz goes flying through on N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 after beating the Chelsea midfielder to the ball. Kant\u00e9 looks despairingly at Craig Pawson, who presumably did not see David Luiz\u2019s stupidity. It was silly, more than anything. 43 min: Aubameyang rattles the side netting! Saka slides the forward in inside the box and the Arsenal skipper opts to take the shot on early. And why not? He has 13 goals for the season, after all. He darts into plenty of space between the Chelsea defenders but his shot zooms into the side netting. 42 min: Tomori does well to intervene just as Saka seemed to be making hay down the left. Arsenal are probing in search of a second after going a little cold following the arrival of Jorginho, who has brought a sense of calm to Chelsea. 40 min: A nugget of breaking news hundreds of miles from the Emirates Stadium ... Erling Braut Haaland has signed for Borussia Dortmund. The 19-year-old joins from RB Salzburg. 36 min: Chelsea should equalise! They win a corner after upping the ante, with Abraham driving at the Arsenal backline and, when the inswinger comes in, Azpilicueta flicks it on and it drops kindly at the back post for Kurt Zouma but he cannot make a connection. Chelsea have been vastly improved since Jorginho stepped on to the field and since switching to a 4-3-3. In the buildup to that corner, Abraham was adamant Guendouzi fouled him inside the box \u2013 the Arsenal midfielder tugged at his shirt \u2013 but the contact was relatively tame. The VAR was having none of it, anyway. 34 min: Here comes Jorginho. Emerson Palmieri is the player sacrificed; he has endured a forgettable half-hour or so. Lampard looks a picture of calm but the Chelsea manager must be seething inside. His side have been second best in every department. Arsenal have been lapping it up. 33 min: Antonio R\u00fcdiger is booked for a crude challenge on Torreira. Azpilicueta escaped without a yellow card for that tackle a moment ago but Chelsea have been keeping the referee Craig Pawson busy. 32 min: C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta is the latest Chelsea player to be pulled up for a foul, this time on Lacazette after neat buildup play by Aubameyang. Chelsea cannot get near Arsenal, who have been unusually assured. Arteta will be delighted. Saying that, they still only have a one-goal buffer despite their dominance. 30 min: And now N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 picks up a yellow card for manhandling Lucas Torreira. Chelsea have been shocking, so much so that it seems Lampard, Jody Morris and Joe Edwards are seeking changes. Jorginho looks ready for action. 29 min: Mount is booked for a late challenge on Maitland-Niles. 28 min: Has this been Arsenal\u2019s best 28 minutes of the season? They have been dynamic, organised and aggressive. Chelsea, on the other hand .. 25 min: Chelsea still haven\u2019t started. 22 min: Chambers limps off without the need for a stretcher \u2013 but his game is over. Mustafi replaces the Arsenal defender. 21 min: Shkodran Mustafi is stripped to come on ... 20 min: Calum Chambers is in trouble. The Arsenal defender is not going to be able to carry on after landing awkwardly in an innocuous challenge with Abraham. Chambers requires treatment, which will allow Chelsea some respite. They have been under the cosh from the get-go. 17 min: Arsenal almost double their lead! Nelson does brilliantly down the right flank, bending a wonderful cross towards the back post, where Aubameyang nonchalantly lays a divine ball off for Lacazette. The striker dawdles ever so slightly and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is able to make life difficult. It would have capped a gorgeous attacking Arsenal move. And it came moments after Lacazette lost his footing on the edge of the box under pressure from Kurt Zouma. At one point the referee Craig Pawson looked set to blow his whistle but Lacazette soldiered on before eventually surrendering possession. Arsenal twice had Chelsea on the ropes. 16 min: Arteta asked for aggression from his Arsenal side and it is a case of so far so good. They\u2019re on the front foot. Chelsea are wilting. They\u2019re all over the place. Blue shirts must have had only a handful of touches. 15 min: Tammy Abraham catches Lucas Torreira on halfway, and ends up injuring himself in the process. Torreira is also momentarily down. Both are soon up and moving, though. Chelsea are struggling to thread passes together. They\u2019re struggling. Who else? Aubameyang heads home after Chambers diverted an \u00d6zil corner towards the back post, where the Arsenal skipper was lurking. Arteta punches the air. Arsenal reap the rewards after an early, convincing swell of pressure. Aubameyang has scored half of Arsenal\u2019s 26 league goals this season. Not bad going. 11 min: Willian rolls the ball to Mount, who wellies it at goal! Quick thinking by Chelsea and the Arsenal goalkeeper Leno gets a little good fortune after failing to take all of the sting out of Mount\u2019s strike. It bounces to safety and Arsenal aim to fly forward down the other end through Maitland-Niles. 10 min: Guendouzi picks up a booking. A clumsy foul on Willian, just as the Chelsea midfielder was bouncing towards the box. Chelsea win a free-kick on the edge of the 18-yard box. Willian and Mount are stood over it. It\u2019s way out on the left flank. Presumably one of them will lift it into the box ... 8 min: David Luiz powers a free-kick at Kepa from 25 yards! It\u2019s a routine save for the Chelsea goalkeeper but another positive tick in the box for Arsenal, who have made a brilliant start in Arteta\u2019s first home game in charge. The free-kick stemmed from Tomori clobbering a freewheeling Mesut \u00d6zil. 7 min: Big news out of Hertha Berlin ... Salomon Kalou has been excused from training so that he can find a new club. As for Granit Xhaka, who is absent at the Emirates this afternoon, the Bundesliga club are mightily keen on completing a deal. Let\u2019s watch this space on that one. His omission makes a January departure seem inevitable. Back to the football ... 5 min: David Luiz goes for an overhead kick! A wondrous, spectacular attempt ... but it doesn\u2019t come off for the Arsenal defender against his former club. The Brazilian tried to hook the ball goalwards from a corner under pressure from R\u00fcdiger. It bobbles wide and Chelsea earn some early respite. 3 min: Tomori is over-exuberant in the challenge on Reiss Nelson after the winger latches on to a neat flick by Mesut \u00d6zil. The subsequent free-kick is floated in from the right but Chelsea head it clear. Lampard\u2019s side are yet to settle. Arsenal will be happy with this high-tempo start, that\u2019s for sure. 2 min: Arsenal are hogging the ball in the early stages. Chelsea are yet to get a whiff. A reminder this a meeting between the division\u2019s youngest managers (Arteta is 37 and Lampard 41). Arsenal surge down the right ... 1 min: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looks pumped. David Luiz nudges the ball out of defence and the Arsenal captain skips a couple of challenges before trying to breeze beyond Antonio R\u00fcdiger. Encouraging start, and one that has whipped up the home faithful, just as Mikel Arteta wanted. Chelsea get things started. Mount rolls the ball to Kovacic. Here come the teams at the Emirates ... Lampard speaks. \u201cWe have been better away from home recently but every game you start again,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect anything just because we had a good [away] result last week. We have to park the home form because the next two games we are away from home and then we will deal with that. It is part of the process and we cannot be inconsistent if we want to get to where we want to be. Every game is different, Arsenal are slightly unpredictable with a new manager coming in, who I\u2019m sure is very keen to imprint his ideas on how they play.\u201d \u201c\u00d6zil played very well v Bournemouth, and with a few finishes from Lacazette, Arsenal could have had another win on the road,\u201d emails Kim Doyle from Maryland. \u201cA performance by \u00d6zil, keeping the ball in the final third of the pitch is crucial for Arsenal. As he goes, so goes the Gunners on the offensive. The defence has to avoid mistakes, especially in the first 20 minutes.\u201d Indeed, Arteta stopped short of waxing lyrical of \u00d6zil but was let it be known he was impressed with his display. \u201cHe worked and could have been the difference; we could have scored three or four goals from his balls through,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cTo be fair his attitude in training since the day I walked into the building has been incredible. I said I was going to give a clean slate.\u201d Across London, some news: David Moyes is set to make an unlikely return to West Ham United, who have asked the Scot to save them from relegation for the second time in three seasons after firing Manuel Pellegrini. Mario Husillos, a close Pellegrini ally, has also left his role as director of football after a series of mistakes in the transfer market. Read David Hytner\u2019s big match preview: Do not make David Luiz angry. It is rarely a good idea, as Chelsea have discovered to their cost, and Frank Lampard looked as though he could see the value in treading carefully as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s derby, when he will come up against his one-time teammate and the player he sold in August. Essential pre-match reading: The last time Arteta duelled with Lampard? 13 September 2014. Sort of. Arteta was a stoppage-time substitute at the Emirates Stadium, where Lampard made his long-awaited City debut \u2013 but it only lasted 45 minutes with the midfielder, then on loan from New York City, booked and then hooked in favour of Samir Nasri at the interval. The game finished 2-2, with Jack Wilshere and Alexis S\u00e1nchez on scoresheet for Arsenal and Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Mart\u00edn Demichelis coming up with the goods for City. In total the pair played against each other 10 times during their playing careers, with Arteta winning three, Lampard two and the other five matches being drawn. Team news news: Granit Xhaka misses out through a mysterious illness, 48 hours on from his agent saying that the midfielder was dead keen on a move to Hertha Berlin. A \u20ac25m deal has been mooted by the Bundesliga club. Arteta makes two changes from the draw at Bournemouth on Boxing Day, with Guendouzi starting alongside Torreira in midfeild, while Calum Chambers is preferred to Sokratis. The 18-year-old forward Tyreece John-Jules is on the Arsenal bench. Meanwhile Lampard drops Callum Hudson-Odoi and Jorginho to the bench, with Kovacic and Mount recalled to action. The 19-year-old defender Tariq Lamptey makes the bench. Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Leno; Maitland-Niles, Chambers, David Luiz, Saka; Torreira, Guendouzi; Nelson, \u00d6zil, Aubameyang; Lacazette Subs: Mart\u00ednez, Mustafi, Sokratis, Willock, Smith-Rowe, P\u00e9p\u00e9, John-Jules Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Arrizabalaga; R\u00fcdiger, Zouma, Tomori, Azpilicueta; Kant\u00e9, Kovacic; Emerson, Willian, Mount; Abraham Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Batshuayi, Barkley, Hudson-Odoi, Lamptey, Jorginho Referee: Craig Pawson Mikel Arteta touched on the importance of getting the Arsenal fans back onside after yielding a point from his first game in charge and there is no better occasion to rejuvenate and re-energise an alarming swell of apathetic supporters than with victory over Chelsea. An encouraging performance at Bournemouth on Boxing Day provided an immediate boost but Arteta and Arsenal require sufficiently more. They are 13th in the table and on a miserable run of one win in 14 matches; they can ill afford for things to further sour as they hover six points above the relegation zone. It does not bear thinking about but defeat for Arsenal would spell a fourth successive home loss for the first time in 60 years and extend their winless run at the Emirates Stadium to seven matches. \u201cI don\u2019t look at the games [coming up] against Chelsea or [Manchester] United \u2013 it\u2019s now. At the moment the urgency is now.\u201d Frank Lampard also has much work to do. After a blistering start to life back at Stamford Bridge \u2013 Chelsea won seven games on the bounce between September and October \u2013 they have lost five of their last seven league matches, including scarring home defeats to Southampton, Bournemouth and West Ham. Another slip could prove damaging for a Chelsea side already clinging on to fourth place, with a cluster of teams from Manchester United to Sheffield United ready to usurp them in the table. Mateo Kovacic is expected to return to the starting lineup following suspension, while Christian Pulisic is also poised to return. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be brutal with ourselves and say \u2018it\u2019s all well and good beating Tottenham [2-0 last Sunday] and feeling on top of the world but we need to reproduce in different ways and against different opposition\u2019.\u201d Kick-off: 2pm (GMT)",

In the landmark legal action which could lead to a multi-million pound payout hundreds of families could be awarded compensation after police kept relatives\u2019 organs without their consent, long after investigations into their deaths ended. Bereaved mother Janine Aldridge, whose newborn baby, Leah, was murdered in 2002 by the child\u2019s father, Andrew Ashurst, is the first to take legal action and is suing Greater Manchester police (GMP). Aldridge, 32, had to hold three separate burials for her five-week-old daughter after new body parts were discovered. The mother of three from Atherton in Greater Manchester said: \u201cFor years I was tormented by the images of parts of my little girl on dusty shelves in forgotten laboratories. I felt as though she was lost. I had to live through the trauma of losing my daughter to her own dad, then had to relive the nightmare over and over again at her funerals. \u201cBut my primary concern is this should never happen to any other family.

Her body was returned to the family for burial but in 2017 Aldridge discovered that all of her internal organs and some other parts of her body were missing through Freedom of Information requests and postmortem papers. Aldridge is among at least four families taking legal action against GMP. The case could lead to legal action being taken against forces across the UK. Victims involved in the scandal include those of serial killers Harold Shipman and the Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. The family of Pauline Reade, who was murdered by Brady and Hindley in July 1963, buried her in Gorton in 1987 following the discovery of her body during a three-month search of Saddleworth Moors. However, an audit staged after the death of Brady in May 2017 revealed that some of her remains were housed at the University of Leeds on behalf of GMP. GMP contacted Jackie, Reade\u2019s niece, before they returned a wooden coffin including her jaw bone and hair samples to the family\u2019s solicitors. Experts say the families could be awarded \u00a35,000 each \u2013 the same amount given to the victims of the baby organ scandal at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool. GMP said: \u201cOne family have made a complaint and this is subject to an investigation by GMP\u2019s Professional Standards Branch. \u201cOfficers continue to maintain regular contact with Janine Aldridge. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage.\u201d In 2012 an official investigation found that police forces have stored almost 500 major body parts, including organs, unnecessarily without telling the victims\u2019 families. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) says the human tissue samples were from murder investigations or cases involving other suspicious deaths that date back as far as the 1960s. An Acpo audit found that the 492 body parts retained by police forces in England and Wales included brains, hearts and limbs. Police say there is a legal requirement for them to retain human body tissue samples after a postmortem in murder cases and those where a coroner believes there were suspicious circumstances. The body parts can be stored \u201cuntil the convicted prisoner has served his sentence\u201d but it is thought that the samples uncovered by the Acpo audit relate to cases no longer subject to investigation. The audit did not include samples from current criminal investigations or cases that were still subject to appeal.",

One question is whether vegans can plan their diet well enough over many years to avoid developing deficiencies. There have been two population studies that have monitored vegans over time, one following <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4191896/\" title=\"\">Seventh Day Adventists in the US and Canada</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.epic-oxford.org/oxford-vegetarian-study/\" title=\"\">EPIC-Oxford study, which </a><a href=\"http://www.epic-oxford.org/oxford-vegetarian-study/\" title=\"\">tracked the health of nearly 50,000 meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans</a> across the UK. Scientists involved in the latter have found that while consuming vegetables rich in calcium, such as kale and broccoli, can protect bones, in reality many vegans don\u2019t actually meet their calcium requirements. As a result, they have found a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17299475\" title=\"\">30% increased risk</a> of fracture in vegans compared to vegetarians and meat eaters.</p> <p>\u201cMore research is still needed to understand possible differences in fracture risks and whether any differences are related to diet or other factors,\u201d says Tong. \u201cFor example, low BMI has also been linked to higher risks of some fractures and in some studies vegans exhibit lower BMI and bone-mineral density than do vegetarians.\u201d</p> <p>Because of these concerns, some research groups have begun comparing veganism to other diets rich in plant-based foods, which are associated with many of the same benefits, such as the Mediterranean and New Nordic diets. Earlier this year, researchers at Sheffield Hallam University conducted a <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1897\" title=\"\">pilot study comparing</a> a Mediterranean and vegan diet over a short-term period, with intriguing results. While both diets appeared to offer similar positives in terms of weight-loss and reduced cholesterol, evidence was much stronger for a Mediterranean diet when it came to improving blood-vessel health.</p> <p>\u201cOur findings suggested that the Mediterranean diet improved the way that the endothelium of the small veins work,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www4.shu.ac.uk/mediacentre/dr-markos-klonizakis-1\">Markos Klonizakis</a>, who led the study. \u201cThis might not sound important, but it is. This becomes dysfunctional over time so it is crucial for cardiovascular health. The magic of the family of Mediterranean diets is that they are tested and proved over a very long period of time, in a relatively large area of the globe. For example, we know that traditionally people in Crete lived long and had low rates of diabetes and cancer.\u201d</p> <p>So what next for veganism? Scientists across the board agree that we don\u2019t yet know enough to decide conclusively one way or another, but as many point out, the success of any diet ultimately comes down to the eating habits of the individual.</p> <p>\u201cThe success of a vegan diet will rest on the conscientiousness of the individual undertaking it,\u201d says Rogerson. \u201cIt\u2019s restrictive and unless we pay attention to the elements of the diet that it excludes, then we might be putting ourselves at risk of developing deficiency-related problems. It has become easier to follow with vegan-friendly food products in supermarkets, which are fortified with nutrients that can be absent from the diet.</p> <p>\u201cAnother point is that people who choose to adopt a vegan diet might be more inclined to adopt health-related behaviours than the norm. Such groups might be more inclined to exercise and be aware of the nutritional adequacy of the foods they eat. We need to look at this further.\u201d</p>",

The year was 2003 and veganism was a long way from the current boom, which has established it as one of the most in-vogue dietary trends. But Wirnitzer, a sports scientist at the University of Innsbruck, had become intrigued by the resurgence of ancient theories linking plant-based diets with improved athletic performance. \u201cThe first athletes on strict plant-based diets were gladiators,\u201d she says. \u201cRoman scripts report that all fighters adhered to gladiatoriam saginam, which was based on plant foods, including large amounts of legumes, pulses and grains, and contained little or no animal protein.\u201d Now, almost two millennia later, Wirnitzer is one of a handful of researchers trying to get to the bottom of whether veganism could enhance an athlete\u2019s chances of sporting success. Over the past decade, she has led the NURMI study, the broadest initiative so far investigating the effects of a vegan diet in high-performance, ultra-endurance sports. NURMI is particularly timely because veganism\u2019s association with various health benefits \u2013 from weight loss to decreased risk of inflammatory disease \u2013 has seen the diet soar in popularity in recent years, both amongst the general public and elite sportsmen. The most recent survey by the Vegan Society estimates that there are around 600,000 vegans in the UK \u2013 a fourfold increase over the past five years \u2013 while high-profile athletes from Lewis Hamilton to Jermain Defoe have begun experimenting with veganism. However, despite the boom in veganism, even the most optimistic scientists caution that there is still much we do not understand about the diet. In particular, little is known about the long-term consequences of veganism and whether it does hold significant advantages over an omnivorous or vegetarian diet. Portrayals of the diet can be partisan: the recent blockbuster Netflix documentary The Game Changers has since been tainted by revelations that the executive producers are cofounders of a vegan food company and that much of the evidence presented in the film is selective, low-quality and anecdotal. Moreover, as with so many dietary interventions, the search for the truth about veganism is often clouded by the potential financial gains \u2013 with predictions that the global vegan food market will be worth $24.3bn by 2026. This is perhaps unsurprising. Whether it be the trendy city bars offering vegan wine, or the array of new products launching in supermarkets and health food stores, veganism is the wellness industry\u2019s new cash cow. Market-research experts have already predicted that the value of the global vegan food market will reach $24.3bn by 2026. Vegan cheese alone is expected to develop into an industry worth nearly $4bn within the next five years. So what do we really know about veganism and what it can do for our health? The quest to reduce cardiovascular disease At Sheffield Hallam University, David Rogerson has spent the past decade studying the effects of dietary interventions on physical health. He says that one reason veganism could be good for you is because it can protect against cardiosvascular diseases, by reducing obesity and lowering cholesterol. These chronic illnesses cost the UK around \u00a39bn a year; veganism may be the solution. \u201cThere\u2019s growing evidence that reduced consumption of animal products, coupled with an increase in plant-based foods, seems to be good for our health,\u201d says Rogerson. \u201cThis is perhaps due to these foods containing lot of antioxidant phytonutrients and nitrates, while some animal products contain lots of pro-inflammatory fats and lead to the production of a metabolite called TMAO, which has been linked to cardiovascular problems.\u201d The anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based foods is thought to be the reason why vegan diets appear to relieve symptoms of some auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The tennis player Venus Williams, who suffers from Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, credits turning vegan with mitigating the extreme fatigue associated with the condition, and with enabling her to continue competing at the highest level.

This becomes dysfunctional over time so it is crucial for cardiovascular health. The magic of the family of Mediterranean diets is that they are tested and proved over a very long period of time, in a relatively large area of the globe. For example, we know that traditionally people in Crete lived long and had low rates of diabetes and cancer.\u201d So what next for veganism? Scientists across the board agree that we don\u2019t yet know enough to decide conclusively one way or another, but as many point out, the success of any diet ultimately comes down to the eating habits of the individual. \u201cThe success of a vegan diet will rest on the conscientiousness of the individual undertaking it,\u201d says Rogerson. \u201cIt\u2019s restrictive and unless we pay attention to the elements of the diet that it excludes, then we might be putting ourselves at risk of developing deficiency-related problems. It has become easier to follow with vegan-friendly food products in supermarkets, which are fortified with nutrients that can be absent from the diet. \u201cAnother point is that people who choose to adopt a vegan diet might be more inclined to adopt health-related behaviours than the norm. Such groups might be more inclined to exercise and be aware of the nutritional adequacy of the foods they eat. We need to look at this further.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re the first generation to know that we are destroying the world and the last that can do something about it,\u201d says Tanya Steele, WWF UK\u2019s first female chief executive.</p> <p>A well-worn soundbite perhaps, but it cuts through the noise of an already saturated climate agenda and explains why the world\u2019s largest conservation charity is broadening its remit.</p> <p>Rooted in the protection of iconic species, the 58-year-old non-profit organisation is committed to habitat restoration, promoting sustainable lifestyles and tackling climate change. It has banged the drum on the latter for decades, but only now are people are really listening. WWF UK\u2019s support base grew by 23% last year, a momentum fuelled in part by Extinction Rebellion and the force that is Greta Thunberg.</p> <p>\u201cI believe this awareness is something [WWF] has contributed to but now it is about how we capitalise on the awareness and pressure in terms of what we need to achieve,\u201d says Steele, a 50-year-old Macclesfield native.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44eed0f72d14b5d8b7e5d9f409940a6da31f0005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44eed0f72d14b5d8b7e5d9f409940a6da31f0005/0_235_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A giant panda at the Chengdu Research Base in China\u2019s Sichuan province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A giant panda at the Chengdu Research Base in China\u2019s Sichuan province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s getting businesses on a net-zero pathway, consumers thinking about their own footprint or pushing for government investment in areas such as green technology, we are unequivocal in our mission.\u201d</p> <p>It is undoubtedly some mission: decarbonising the world, ending deforestation and reforming a food system that is sucking up natural resources. WWF\u2019s activities are led by 7,662 staff across 83 offices globally in roles spanning advocacy and campaigning, science research, fundraising and communication. It has about 3,000 projects under way at any one time.</p> <p>At the UK headquarters in Woking, Surrey, Steele\u2019s base since 2017, the endeavour is clear from oxygen-boosting fig trees planted by Sir David Attenborough to a carpet made from recycled fishing nets. Rolling footage showing rainforest logging and melting polar ice caps compete for wall space while in a glass cabinet, 100 panda money boxes \u2013 like a panda version of the Terracotta Army \u2013 rotate intermittently.</p> <p>It was while working in Zimbabwe as managing director of Save the Children that Steele first saw the devastation caused by climate change, and it fuelled a passion for the environment. She describes herself as part humanitarian and part environmentalist, but grounded in an efficient commercial mindset honed in the telecoms sector through stints at Siemens and BT.</p> <p>\u201cIt gave me global perspective at least in an economic sense,\u201d Steele says of her commercial work. \u201cMany of the skills, from knowing how to read a P&amp;L [profit and loss sheet] to taking new propositions to new markets, are directly transferable to this sector.\u201d</p> <p>Measuring targets as vast as climate change presents a different challenge. The plan is to achieve zero extinction of species, cut the loss of natural habitats and greenhouse gases and halve the ecological footprint of production and consumption by 2030, all targets that are harder to quantify than a rise or fall in profit or market share.</p> <p>\u201cOur work can seem very complex so we have to be clear with our board in terms of the basis on which we will contribute to a major goal, whether that\u2019s working governmentally or putting forward advice and policy position at something like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-25-un-climate-change-conference\">COP25 climate conference in Madrid </a>to hopefully influence on that decision-making,\u201d Steele says. \u201cWe still have to show milestones or it could be disheartening, but undoubtedly we will tend to measure outcomes over many years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de9ecc2ba0f9507ba2feb139beeed7d1087aff82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de9ecc2ba0f9507ba2feb139beeed7d1087aff82/0_700_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mountain gorilla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mountain gorilla. Their numbers have risen to 1,000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Foltz/WWF/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Notable gains bear this out. Conservation efforts spanning four decades have come to fruition in the last year as <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/spring-2019/articles/wild-mountain-gorilla-numbers-grow-to-more-than-1-000\">the wild mountain gorilla population grew to 1,000</a> and the species came off the critical endangered list, and the black rhino population in Kenya doubled to 800 since 1993.</p> <p>The significance of partnerships is underlying theme, be it government lobbying, connecting with consumers to drive behavioural change or perhaps most visibly, collaborating with business to promote best practice and fund project work. WWF added Tesco to its portfolio of commercial partners this year, the supermarket joining Sodexo, Coca-Cola , Knorr and others. The mission, to halve the environmental footprint of the average shopper\u2019s basket, is a major piece of work in terms of the supply chains involved, says Steele, and one that has been chosen as much for Tesco\u2019s footprint and reach as its wallet.</p> <p>Other partnerships include reducing the environmental impacts of fishing with John West and a sustainable cotton initiative with Marks &amp; Spencer. The convergence of charity and commerce can still jar though. WWF has long faced criticism for working with companies whose practices can seem at odds with its mission. One notable example is Coca-Cola and the sustainability of the company\u2019s use of water drawn from the river basins WWF aims to protect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2016/jul/27/is-there-any-tuna-thats-to-eat-tesco\">Is there any tuna that it\u2019s OK to eat?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the battle for funding and visibility it is a tricky balance to negotiate. WWF UK spent \u00a354.5m on charitable activities this year. Membership and donations provide \u00a334.9m of its \u00a366.3m income, but corporate donations and sponsorship are now worth \u00a39.4m.</p> <p>Steele, who is clinical in side-stepping contentious areas, says WWF\u2019s focus is on helping to shape a business\u2019s future practice rather than expecting them to already be the finished article. She stresses the scope and reach of longstanding partners such as Sky. <a href=\"http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/skygroup-sky-static/documents/bigger-picture/rainforest-rescue/brochure.pdf\">Its \u00a35m investment in a rainforest restoration project</a> has protected parts of the Amazon and communicated the message to millions of Sky viewers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about doing the right thing,\u201d she says. \u201cFundamentally this is about protecting both these businesses\u2019 supply chains in the future and much of the planet beyond their lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>Working on a global challenge means regular international travel, and India, China, Brazil, Colombia, Kenya and Myanmar are all on Steele\u2019s horizon in the new year. For a charity committed to reducing carbon footprints, adding to it through its endeavours can be a moot point. WWF UK produced 365 tonnes of C0<sub>2</sub> from business travel in 2019, 12 tonnes over budget. Air travel accounted for 85% of the total.</p> <p>Steele says much European travel is taken by rail, but a global mission demands a presence to the countries affected. \u201cThe density of biodiversity in the Amazon is the greatest on this planet and if we fail in Brazil, Indian and China then we fail environmentally across the world, so I do need to go there.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it can be easy to just step on a plane and we are now having to think much more carefully about how we work. Everything is under more scrutiny and rightly so; the sector has professionalised and I can\u2019t imagine a more important time than this to sharpen up what we are doing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019re the first generation to know that we are destroying the world and the last that can do something about it,\u201d says Tanya Steele, WWF UK\u2019s first female chief executive. A well-worn soundbite perhaps, but it cuts through the noise of an already saturated climate agenda and explains why the world\u2019s largest conservation charity is broadening its remit. Rooted in the protection of iconic species, the 58-year-old non-profit organisation is committed to habitat restoration, promoting sustainable lifestyles and tackling climate change. It has banged the drum on the latter for decades, but only now are people are really listening. WWF UK\u2019s support base grew by 23% last year, a momentum fuelled in part by Extinction Rebellion and the force that is Greta Thunberg. \u201cI believe this awareness is something [WWF] has contributed to but now it is about how we capitalise on the awareness and pressure in terms of what we need to achieve,\u201d says Steele, a 50-year-old Macclesfield native. \u201cWhether it\u2019s getting businesses on a net-zero pathway, consumers thinking about their own footprint or pushing for government investment in areas such as green technology, we are unequivocal in our mission.\u201d It is undoubtedly some mission: decarbonising the world, ending deforestation and reforming a food system that is sucking up natural resources. WWF\u2019s activities are led by 7,662 staff across 83 offices globally in roles spanning advocacy and campaigning, science research, fundraising and communication. It has about 3,000 projects under way at any one time. At the UK headquarters in Woking, Surrey, Steele\u2019s base since 2017, the endeavour is clear from oxygen-boosting fig trees planted by Sir David Attenborough to a carpet made from recycled fishing nets. Rolling footage showing rainforest logging and melting polar ice caps compete for wall space while in a glass cabinet, 100 panda money boxes \u2013 like a panda version of the Terracotta Army \u2013 rotate intermittently. It was while working in Zimbabwe as managing director of Save the Children that Steele first saw the devastation caused by climate change, and it fuelled a passion for the environment. She describes herself as part humanitarian and part environmentalist, but grounded in an efficient commercial mindset honed in the telecoms sector through stints at Siemens and BT. \u201cIt gave me global perspective at least in an economic sense,\u201d Steele says of her commercial work. \u201cMany of the skills, from knowing how to read a P&amp;L [profit and loss sheet] to taking new propositions to new markets, are directly transferable to this sector.\u201d Measuring targets as vast as climate change presents a different challenge. The plan is to achieve zero extinction of species, cut the loss of natural habitats and greenhouse gases and halve the ecological footprint of production and consumption by 2030, all targets that are harder to quantify than a rise or fall in profit or market share. \u201cOur work can seem very complex so we have to be clear with our board in terms of the basis on which we will contribute to a major goal, whether that\u2019s working governmentally or putting forward advice and policy position at something like the COP25 climate conference in Madrid to hopefully influence on that decision-making,\u201d Steele says. \u201cWe still have to show milestones or it could be disheartening, but undoubtedly we will tend to measure outcomes over many years.\u201d Notable gains bear this out. Conservation efforts spanning four decades have come to fruition in the last year as the wild mountain gorilla population grew to 1,000 and the species came off the critical endangered list, and the black rhino population in Kenya doubled to 800 since 1993. The significance of partnerships is underlying theme, be it government lobbying, connecting with consumers to drive behavioural change or perhaps most visibly, collaborating with business to promote best practice and fund project work. WWF added Tesco to its portfolio of commercial partners this year, the supermarket joining Sodexo, Coca-Cola , Knorr and others. The mission, to halve the environmental footprint of the average shopper\u2019s basket, is a major piece of work in terms of the supply chains involved, says Steele, and one that has been chosen as much for Tesco\u2019s footprint and reach as its wallet. Other partnerships include reducing the environmental impacts of fishing with John West and a sustainable cotton initiative with Marks &amp; Spencer. The convergence of charity and commerce can still jar though. WWF has long faced criticism for working with companies whose practices can seem at odds with its mission. One notable example is Coca-Cola and the sustainability of the company\u2019s use of water drawn from the river basins WWF aims to protect. In the battle for funding and visibility it is a tricky balance to negotiate. WWF UK spent \u00a354.5m on charitable activities this year. Membership and donations provide \u00a334.9m of its \u00a366.3m income, but corporate donations and sponsorship are now worth \u00a39.4m. Steele, who is clinical in side-stepping contentious areas, says WWF\u2019s focus is on helping to shape a business\u2019s future practice rather than expecting them to already be the finished article. She stresses the scope and reach of longstanding partners such as Sky. Its \u00a35m investment in a rainforest restoration project has protected parts of the Amazon and communicated the message to millions of Sky viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about doing the right thing,\u201d she says. \u201cFundamentally this is about protecting both these businesses\u2019 supply chains in the future and much of the planet beyond their lifetime.\u201d Working on a global challenge means regular international travel, and India, China, Brazil, Colombia, Kenya and Myanmar are all on Steele\u2019s horizon in the new year. For a charity committed to reducing carbon footprints, adding to it through its endeavours can be a moot point. WWF UK produced 365 tonnes of C02 from business travel in 2019, 12 tonnes over budget. Air travel accounted for 85% of the total. Steele says much European travel is taken by rail, but a global mission demands a presence to the countries affected. \u201cThe density of biodiversity in the Amazon is the greatest on this planet and if we fail in Brazil, Indian and China then we fail environmentally across the world, so I do need to go there. \u201cHowever, it can be easy to just step on a plane and we are now having to think much more carefully about how we work. Everything is under more scrutiny and rightly so; the sector has professionalised and I can\u2019t imagine a more important time than this to sharpen up what we are doing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me. Here\u2019s our match report: Stats! Steven Davis to Sky: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive step forward. I thought we were excellent.\u201d And man-of-match Borna Barisic: \u201cWe had a lot of confidence and we totally deserved this win.\u201d From our very own Ewan Murray: So Rangers close to within two points of Celtic at the summit and they have a game in hand. The three points were fully deserved \u2013 they were the better side throughout. Morelos\u2019s ridiculous 85th-minute and 95th-minute yellow cards were both so, so needless but his sending off is a minor blow in the grand scheme of things. Fair to say, Steven Gerrard is very happy. I think the TV broadcasters had to keep muting their mics as he let loose a few Bad Words Of Joy. It\u2019s all over! But the title race is just starting. Morelos dives hilariously in the Celtic box and gets deservedly booked. He\u2019s off. A Rangers official also gets his marching orders for complaining. 90+4 min: Katic blocks Edouard\u2019s shot. Corner. Cleared. And that should be that. 90+3 min: \u2026 and it\u2019s nodded wide by Jullien at the near post. It looks like it should be another corner but the officials award a goal kick. 90+2 min: Ntcham smashes the ball boxwards and Davis just gets his head on it to divert it away for a corner \u2026 90+1 min: Jack and McGregor collide and the Rangers man goes down clutching his shin. Celtic free-kick though and home side launch forward. 90 min: Four minutes of added time to be played. And Rangers have a corner, which Morelos blasts against McGregor and out for a throw in. Tick tock \u2026 89 min: Morelos wins the cheapest of free-kicks from Bolingoli as Ajer and Jullien get themselves into a pickle on halfway. Rangers will run it into the corner \u2026 88 min: Bolingoli gets a free header at the back post but can\u2019t pick out Griffiths in the middle. Another few seconds tumble from the clock \u2026 87 min: Can Celtic muster a grandstand finish? Ajer overlaps down the left but the threat is smothered. Rangers can\u2019t get out of their half though \u2026 85 min: Morelos goes into the book for a little nudge on Brown. 84 min: Morelos and Jullien tangle on the edge of the box with the ball bouncing through \u2026 and the free-kick goes Celtic\u2019s way. That was a heart-in-mouth moment for the home fans. 83 min: \u2026 Griffiths goes for goal from the free-kick but it\u2019s well over the bar. 82 min: Arfield\u2019s first act is a loose touch that ends a dangerous Rangers break and sets Celtic on the counter. Barisic hauls down Frimpong on the corner of the area to pick up a booking \u2026 81 min: Arfield replaces Kamara for Rangers. And for Celtic, Christie makes way for Griffiths. 80 min: \u2026 and there\u2019s a foul as the ball comes in. 79 min: Aribo forces a corner from Jullien. And Barisic taaaakkkessss hiiiiisss ttiiimmmmee getting over there to take it \u2026 77 min: Celtic have switched to a back three which has helped them with width but has definitely opened them up defensively. Bitton gives the ball away cheaply (not for the first time) but Aribo can only lash wide from the angle. 76 min: Jullien has a big baseball swing as a corner drops again to him but can\u2019t make a clean contact with the volley. 75 min: Celtic build nicely down the right, with Frimpong again to the fore. Brown\u2019s eventual cross is nodded away by Goldson under pressure from Edouard. 74 min: \u2026 it comes to nothing. 73 min: Kent mugs Bitton on halfway and scutters forward. Rangers corner \u2026 72 min: Bolingoli goes into the book after pulling back Tavernier in midfield. 70 min: Kamara is booked for a foul on Frimpong, who has come into the game markedly in the last 10 minutes. It\u2019s feels a little like Lennon has taken the shackles off his side and they\u2019re certainly making the most of it. 69 min: Christie whips in a corner so vicious it mutters about chianti and fava beans but no one can get a clean contact. Then Ajer fizzes the ball into the danger area and again there\u2019s no touch. It\u2019s all Celtic now. 68 min: Subs for Celtic and it\u2019s the two wide men who are replaced. Bitton comes on for Johnstone and Ntcham replaces Forrest. 67 min: Rangers have just gone into their shell a little here and they\u2019re grateful to McGregor for tipping away Edouard\u2019s nicely-struck effort from the edge of the box. 65 min: Off the line! Jullien gets on the end of a corner and his header is past McGregor but Davis is there to nod off the line for the second time in the game. 64 min: Forrest, who has struggled to get into the game against Barisic (who is a decent contender for MOTM), can\u2019t squeeze his pass through to Edouard. Celtic need an injection of impetus from somewhere. 62 min: Kent rather cynically trips Frimpong and is a little fortunate to escape a booking. 61 min: Barisic, who has two assists to his name already today, this time swings in a slightly miscued effort and Celtic claim a free-kick of their own. 60 min: Morelos goes down under pressure from Christie and wins a free-kick much to the chagrin of the home fans. 58 min: Now then. Can Rangers maintain their intensity and keep Celtic out of the game? And Rangers have the lead they deserve! Barisic\u2019s corner is perfect and Katic climbs high above Ajer to power his header past Forster. 56 min: \u2026 and Goldson should score. The ball was cleared but lofted back in, Barisic flicked on and Goldson couldn\u2019t react in time. 55 min: Tavernier is upended by Johnstone has he looks to skip forward, winning Rangers a free-kick on the touchline, 30-odd yards from goal \u2026 53 min: \u2026 Christie\u2019s outswinger is just too high for Jullien. And when the ball is fired back in by Edouard there\u2019s no hooped shirt on the end of it. 52 min: Pass, pass, pass from Celtic but this half has started in much the same vein as the first, with Rangers well on top. That said, the home side have forced a corner \u2026 50 min: What a chance! Goldson\u2019s wonderful diagonal ball from the back finds Kent clear on the left. He sends in the perfect low ball across goal but Morelos can only send his sliding effort soaring over the bar from six yards out. 49 min: Christie picks up a needless booking after bundling into Morelos on halfway. 48 min: And, oddly enough, Frimpong charges forward for pretty much the first time this afternoon, though the attack comes to nought. 47 min: Celtic\u2019s wide players really haven\u2019t got into the game \u2013 their full-backs especially have been stuck in reverse all afternoon. A bit more from them could make all the difference. Peep! Off we go again. Celtic, who surely can\u2019t be as shaky this half, get us under way once more. The players are back out. Half II: Return Of The Football is imminent. Peep! PEEP! And that\u2019s that for the first period at Celtic Park. Rangers will be fuming that they go into the break level. 45 min: Two minutes of added time to play at the end of an enthralling first half. 44 min: McGregor gets some magic sponge action after finding himself on the wrong end of Jack\u2019s boot. 43 min: Fair to say that VAR would have disallowed that I think, though Edouard didn\u2019t know anything about it. Celtic are level within minutes! Jack\u2019s attempted tackle on Edouard bobbles through to McGregor, who takes a touch and unleashes an effort at goal. It strikes Edouard on the hand and deflects past the utterly wrongfooted goalkeeper. 40 min: Edouard has the chance to let fly from the edge of the box but dallies for just a second and finds Davis snapping at his heels to snatch the ball away. The last 15 minutes here have been absolutely breathless. 38 min: Brown goes into the referee\u2019s Little Book Of Quite Naughty Men after clattering Kamara in midfield. Generally Old Firm referees might as well book Brown at the pre-match handshakes but that looked a bit harsh. Rangers have dominated for all of the game but somehow this has come against the run of play. Barisic\u2019s low pass into the box from the left picks out Ryan Kent and he sweeps a first-time effort in off the post with the Celtic defence statuesque. 36 min: Tavernier does well to keep pace with McGregor and make a challenge as Celtic keep their foot on the accelerator. 34 min: All of a sudden it\u2019s all Celtic. Davis heads off the line after Jullien connects well with Christie\u2019s corner. the penalty, by the way, was given for Katic\u2019s pull on Jullien. The Rangers man was booked and it was probably a fair decision. McGregor, though, came to the rescue. What a save this is! McGregor leaps to his left and claws away Christie\u2019s fizzing effort. Nice height maybe but it was struck well. 32 min: \u2026 there\u2019s grappling in the box and Kevin Clancy has spotted something. He points at the spot! 31 min: Goldson has to come across and make a fine tackle on Christie, who is sent galloping forward by Jack\u2019s mistake. Celtic corner \u2026 30 min: Edouard tries to get on the ball but eventually gets crowded out by Rangers defenders. 27 min: Johnstone crosses from the left \u2013 it\u2019s behind Christie but he gets a kind of backheel scorpion kick on it and makes a reasonable contact. The ball flies over. It was an attempt at something a little like this: 25 min: \u2026 another scramble, this time Forster saves with his feet from Davis. You feel Rangers have to take advantage of their dominance here \u2013 Celtic are all over the place defensively but surely they\u2019ll sort themselves out at some point. 24 min: Goldson flicks on, Morelos shoots, blocked, another corner \u2026 23 min: The rattled Jullien gives away a soft, soft free-kick on Morelos. Another chance for a dangerous ball into the box \u2026 it\u2019s deflected away for a corner. 22 min: McGregor and Christie can\u2019t take advantage of Kamara\u2019s error inside his own half. Cue a couple of thumping challenges as Rangers look to break. 20 min: As Blur once (nearly) sang, there\u2019s Pressure On Jullien, who gives away another free-kick. Rangers can\u2019t make anything of it though. 19 min: Christie gets a yard of space 30 yards out and thinks \u2018why not?\u2019 The Celtic fans behind the goal who have to throw the ball back give him his answer. 18 min: \u2026 whipped in by Tavernier, who has impressed in these opening exchanges, the loose ball falls to Morelos and worked back out to the right-back but this time his ball into the box is gathered by Forster. 17 min: Morelos wins a free-kick over on the Rangers right, close to the corner quadrant \u2026 16 min: Morelos lets fly from distance but again it\u2019s straight down Forster\u2019s throat. 15 min: Johnstones pulls the ball back to an onrushing McGregor as Celtic get on the front foot for the first time. He\u2019s tackled immediately but Celtic will feel a bit better just for being down at the Rangers end. 13 min: Morelos squeezes a shot away from the edge of the box but Forster gathers with ease. 12 min: Morelos, who moments ago had \u201ca coming together\u201d with Scott Brown, now fouls Jullien. The Morelos Rage-o-meter creeps up a couple of points \u2026 11 min: Tavernier\u2019s long pass finds Morelos scampering in behind the two Celtic centre-halves but he can\u2019t find Aribo, who is arriving in support. 10 min: Forster drops on Aribo\u2019s low pass across the six-yard box. Celtic really need to get a foothold here. 9 min: Some great intricate interplay gets Rangers going once more and it takes a stretching Jullian header to avert the danger before Tavernier blasts well over. The home side look a little nervy at the moment. 8 min: Barisic curls a free-kick into the Celtic area but Forster comes out confidently to claim. 7 min: Jullien is incredibly lucky on the edge of his own area after seeing his pass blocked by Aribo. Morelos can\u2019t quite get hold of the loose ball. 6 min: Brown\u2019s turn to lose possession in his own half which allows Aribo to trundle forward. He can\u2019t quite get his feet sorted out and Brown gets back to challenge. 4 min: Rangers look to build an attack on the right as Bolingoli gives the ball away cheaply. Davis\u2019s ball into the box is then headed away by Frimpong. Rangers making the brighter opening \u2026 3 min: Johnstone gives away a free-kick midway in the Rangers half and there\u2019s an early signal of intent from the visitors as McGregor jogs out of his area to launch it long. No risks early on. 1 min: A couple of loose passes early on as the sides compete to see who can give the ball away in the worst possible position. Peep! Referee Kevin Clancy blows his whistle and Rangers get things under way. Before kick-off there\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for the former Celtic captain Duncan MacKay, who died on Boxing Day at the age of 82. Click-clack, click-clack \u2026 out they come into a packed Celtic Park, half of which is bathed in winter sunshine. The players are in the tunnel \u2026 Manager chat Here\u2019s Neil Lennon: \u201cIt\u2019s the end of a tumultuous month, we\u2019ve been brilliant, and I want us to go into the break on a high.\u201d And here\u2019s Steven Gerrard: \u201cThis is a fresh game, another 90 minutes, we\u2019ve got to find that [cup final] level.\u201d To while away the stressful minutes before kick-off, why not read Ewan Murray\u2019s preview of today\u2019s game: A fixture bogged down by over\u2011the-top tribalism has a wider, useful value. Both halves of Glasgow\u2019s big two have players capable of operating at a higher level. \u00c9douard and Alfredo Morelos are widely heralded as blue-chip players but others \u2013 Ryan Christie, Callum McGregor, Ryan Jack and Glen Kamara \u2013 should relish the chance to demonstrate their abilities to a broader audience than is customary. Celtic: Forster; Frimpong, Jullien, Ajer, Bolingoli; Brown, McGregor; Forrest, Christie, Johnston; Edouard. Subs: Gordon, Hayes, Bauer, Bitton, Rogic, Ntcham, Griffiths. Rangers: McGregor; Tavernier, Goldson, Katic, Barisic; Jack, Kamara; Davis Aribo, Kent; Morelos. Subs: Foderingham, Flanagan, Edmundson, Arfield, Ojo, Barker, Defoe. Hello all and welcome to live coverage of (quick tally-up) the third Old Firm derby of the season. And it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s a big \u2018un. Celtic are five points clear at the top of the Premiership, though Rangers have a game in hand. After this game the sides both go into hibernation for their three-week winter break. Today\u2019s result could well set the tone for the second half of the campaign. If Rangers are to close that gap at the top they\u2019re going to have to break a trend. They have not won at Celtic Park since October 2010, nine years and 10 visits ago. And funnily enough, that season was also the last time Rangers won the league title. Kick-off is at 12.30pm GMT. And the team news is imminent.",

Ronald Reagan was horrible, and his regime launched the reversal of decades of progress towards economic equality and security in the United States. But beyond and all around, the 1980s saw remarkable activism with immediate consequences \u2013 the overthrow of the Marcos regime in the Philippines through people power in 1986, the overthrow of the South Korean military dictatorship in 1987, the toppling of the whole eastern bloc of Soviet states in 1989, the beginning of the end of the apartheid era in South Africa (and powerful but unsuccessful uprisings in Burma and China).</p> <p>But a lot of groundwork was also laid for what was to come, with feminism, Aids activism and queer rights organising, and the beginning of a profound shift toward recognising racial and social issues in the environmental movement.

      "bodyText": "An attacker armed with a long knife or machete stabbed five people during Hanukah festivities at a rabbi\u2019s home in New York state in what Governor Andrew Cuomo has called \u201can act of domestic terrorism\u201d. The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council said an attacker wearing a scarf fled after stabbing the victims at a house in Monsey, Rockland county, about 30 miles north of New York City, on Saturday night. All five victims were taken to hospital, the council said, and two were in critical condition with one of them stabbed at least six times. The rabbi\u2019s son was reported to be among the injured. The suspect, Grafton Thomas, 38, from nearby Greenwood Lake, escaped the scene in a vehicle and drove to Manhattan, where he was later arrested in Harlem. He was reportedly covered in blood when apprehended. Thomas was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. At his arraignment on Sunday morning, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. The stabbings came after a string of incidents targeting Jews in the region, including a deadly antisemitic shooting at a kosher grocery store in the neighboring state of New Jersey earlier this month. New York City increased its police presence in some Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Jewish populations after a series of antisemitic incidents last week. The attack took place at the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, who leads the adjacent synagogue. Dozens of people were reportedly in the house for a candle lighting ceremony on the seventh day of Hanukah. \u201cI was praying for my life,\u201d Aron Kohn, 65, who was inside the house when the attack took place, told the New York Times. \u201cHe started attacking people right away as soon as he came in the door. We didn\u2019t have time to react at all.\u201d \u201cWe saw him pull a knife out of a case,\u201d Kohn added. \u201cIt was about the size of a broomstick.\u201d Yisroel Kraus, a 26-year-old teacher who escaped out the back, told the Washington Post the house had been emptying when the attacker arrived. \u201cIf he had come 10 minutes earlier, the place would have been packed,\u201d he said. \u201cNo way to move; no way to run. It was a miracle. It was a Hanukah miracle.\u201d Visiting Monsey on Sunday morning, New York governor Cuomo said the attack was \u201cabout the thirteenth incident of antisemitism\u201d in the state of New York over recent weeks, and described the climate of intolerance as \u201can American cancer in the body politic\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is violence spurred by hate. It is mass violence and I consider this an act of domestic terrorism. Let\u2019s call it what it is.\u201d In a statement overnight, he said: \u201cLet me be clear: antisemitism and bigotry of any kind are repugnant to our values of inclusion and diversity and we have absolutely zero tolerance for such acts of hate.\u201d The New York attorney general, Letitia James, said she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the situation in Monsey. \u201cThere is zero tolerance for acts of hate of any kind and we will continue to monitor this horrific situation.\u201d Donald Trump, who has stoked intolerance during his time in the White House, was at his golf club in Florida on Sunday. He wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe anti-Semitic attack in Monsey, New York, on the 7th night of Hanukkah last night is horrific. We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism. Melania and I wish the victims a quick and full recovery.\u201d His daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump, tweeted: \u201cThe vicious attack of a rabbi in Monsey, NY last night was an act of pure evil. As we pray for the victims, may the candles of Chanukah burn bright through this darkness.\u201d The NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau said it was closely monitoring the situation and Jewish organisation the Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey said it was sending someone to the scene. About a third of the population of Rockland county is Jewish, including a large enclave of Orthodox Jews who live in secluded communities. Jewish communities have been on heightened alert following the 10 December shooting rampage at a northern New Jersey kosher market. Six people died including the two killers, a police officer and three people who had been inside the store. The New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, said the attack was driven by hatred of Jews and law enforcement.

He is likely to express sympathy for the many people whose travel plans have been disrupted, acknowledge the constitutional right to strike and call for dialogue.</p> <p>On a trip to West Africa before Christmas, he simply urged transport unions to call a truce over the festive season, which they ignored, leaving rail services severely disrupted.</p> <p>Macron is unlikely, however, to enter into the complex technical details of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/france-french-pm-reveals-details-of-fairer-pension-reforms\">pension changes</a> in his new year address, instead arguing that, after overhauling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/22/macron-takes-page-from-trump-change-france-labour-laws\">labour rules</a> and the unemployment benefit system, changes to pensions are vital to his plans to deliver what he has called the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the second world war.</p> <p>The government insists it will be fairer to create a single, universal points-based system for all \u2013 instead of dozens of different systems for workers in different sectors. It also says it will be able to balance the pension budget by incentivising workers to stay in the labour force until 64 in order to take home a full pension, instead of leaving at the official retirement age of 62. The unions, however, fear people will be made to work longer for lower pensions. Even moderate unions are angry at any effective change to the retirement age.</p> <p>Macron is under pressure to make concessions to unions and strikers, but he has built his political identity on a promise never to cave in to street protests. Nor can he risk alienating his support base, which currently includes voters from the traditional right, by being seen to concede too much. He also faces a growing distrust of politicians in France. Polls have shown that many French voters want pension reform, but they do not trust the government to do it fairly.</p> <p>The nationwide transport strike entered its 25th day on Sunday and looks likely to continue for at least another two weeks, potentially spreading in January when teachers are back at school and could join in. Government negotiations will resume on 7 January before a nationwide day of protest scheduled for 9 January. The longest previous transport strike in France lasted 28 days, also over Christmas in 1986 and early 1987.</p> <p>Rail workers, some of whom have already lost considerable income from the strike, said they wanted government concessions. Other professions have had their pension proposals tweaked in recent days. After striking ballet dancers at the Paris Opera performed Swan Lake in the street before Christmas in what protesters called the most beautiful picket line Paris had seen, the culture minister offered to make the reforms apply only to dancers who join after 2022. Other concessions will apply to airline pilots and flight attendants, as well as police and firefighters.</p> <p>Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, the junior transport minister, <a href=\"https://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/jean-baptiste-djebbari-sur-la-greve-les-francais-ne-sont-pas-dupes-de-la-politisation-de-la-cgt-3939978\">accused</a> the leftwing CGT union on Sunday of \u201csystematically opposing all reforms\u201d and said it often engaged in intimidation. Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT, shot back that the government was \u201corganising chaos\u201d and deliberately allowing the conflict to worsen.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s new year\u2019s speech will not be the first he has given with the country in the throes of social crisis. His gave his address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/31/macrons-year-of-national-cohesion-ends-in-tatters\">last year</a> after weeks of anti-government <em>gilets jaunes</em> protests and called on the nation to unite and stop \u201chateful\u201d attacks.</p>",

Macron is unlikely, however, to enter into the complex technical details of the pension changes in his new year address, instead arguing that, after overhauling labour rules and the unemployment benefit system, changes to pensions are vital to his plans to deliver what he has called the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the second world war. The government insists it will be fairer to create a single, universal points-based system for all \u2013 instead of dozens of different systems for workers in different sectors. It also says it will be able to balance the pension budget by incentivising workers to stay in the labour force until 64 in order to take home a full pension, instead of leaving at the official retirement age of 62. The unions, however, fear people will be made to work longer for lower pensions. Even moderate unions are angry at any effective change to the retirement age. Macron is under pressure to make concessions to unions and strikers, but he has built his political identity on a promise never to cave in to street protests. Nor can he risk alienating his support base, which currently includes voters from the traditional right, by being seen to concede too much. He also faces a growing distrust of politicians in France. Polls have shown that many French voters want pension reform, but they do not trust the government to do it fairly. The nationwide transport strike entered its 25th day on Sunday and looks likely to continue for at least another two weeks, potentially spreading in January when teachers are back at school and could join in. Government negotiations will resume on 7 January before a nationwide day of protest scheduled for 9 January. The longest previous transport strike in France lasted 28 days, also over Christmas in 1986 and early 1987. Rail workers, some of whom have already lost considerable income from the strike, said they wanted government concessions. Other professions have had their pension proposals tweaked in recent days. After striking ballet dancers at the Paris Opera performed Swan Lake in the street before Christmas in what protesters called the most beautiful picket line Paris had seen, the culture minister offered to make the reforms apply only to dancers who join after 2022. Other concessions will apply to airline pilots and flight attendants, as well as police and firefighters. Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, the junior transport minister, accused the leftwing CGT union on Sunday of \u201csystematically opposing all reforms\u201d and said it often engaged in intimidation. Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT, shot back that the government was \u201corganising chaos\u201d and deliberately allowing the conflict to worsen. Macron\u2019s new year\u2019s speech will not be the first he has given with the country in the throes of social crisis. His gave his address last year after weeks of anti-government gilets jaunes protests and called on the nation to unite and stop \u201chateful\u201d attacks.",

Shortly after La Cage opened, Herman had met Marty Finkelstein, with whom he restored, developed and sold property in Key West, Florida \u2013 he felt his time in theatre was over \u2013 before nursing him through his final illness.

      "bodyText": "The composite image of a Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman, who has died aged 88, is of a glamorous woman bedecked in pearls and feathers sashaying down a staircase to deliver a big take-home number surrounded by a deferential male chorus line of waiters, or valets, or drag queens. The three big Herman shows that many people know are Hello, Dolly! (1964), starring Carol Channing as the widowed matchmaker Dolly Levi (Barbra Streisand in the 1969 film directed by Gene Kelly); Mame (1966), star- ring Angela Lansbury as another widowed matchmaker with a nephew in tow (Lucille Ball in the 1974 film directed by Gene Saks); and La Cage aux Folles (1983), starring George Hearn as a nightclub entertainer, Zsa Zsa, declaring himself vindictively \u201cout\u201d as he throws off his wig and melodically bellows I Am What I Am. Dolly and Mame signalled the high point, and last hurrah, of the American musical as an agent of delirious combustion, emotional uplift and rousing self-assertion, and they owed everything to the example of Irving Berlin\u2019s musical Annie Get Your Gun (1946) which Herman saw, aged 14, and played from memory on the piano the instant he got home. The die was cast. This was his mission. His natural talent for songwriting \u2013 he usually wrote words and music simultaneously \u2013 was allied to a gift, and a penchant, for placing the numbers in a dramatic framework. When he could not find that structure, his shows flopped, but his style, more flashy and strutting than Berlin\u2019s, was rooted in the cakewalk, the big build and then the firework display. Many of his quieter numbers, however, have a lyrical finesse and beauty that have been tellingly exploited by singers such as Eydie Gorm\u00e9, who transformed one of the many superb songs in Mame, If He Walked Into My Life, into a glorious, mellow, slowed down torch song. With La Cage, Herman, together with his book writer, Harvey Fierstein, and director, Arthur Laurents, hit pay dirt for the third and last time by almost nonchalantly adapting a delicious 1978 French film into a musical love story of two middle-aged men in the south of France. Albin (aka Zsa Zsa) forces the sexual/gender identity issue when his partner\u2019s biological son from a former life comes home to announce his engagement to the daughter of a homophobic politician. This was Broadway\u2019s first mainstream gay musical. Crusading critics, and even Fierstein himself, felt the \u201cqueerness\u201d was compromised by the decision to have non-queeny actors in the leading two roles. Laurents said that if they had kissed on stage, the audience would have got up and left. Instead they stayed. And got to their feet only at the end, when they roared their approval. This was something. At the same time, the social moment was captured in the show\u2019s rousing item The Best of Times, as Aids spread through New York and indeed the cast of the show. Shortly after La Cage opened, Herman had met Marty Finkelstein, with whom he restored, developed and sold property in Key West, Florida \u2013 he felt his time in theatre was over \u2013 before nursing him through his final illness. Then he himself discovered he had the HIV virus and lived with it on medication for the rest of his life in Florida and Palm Springs. Herman was born in Manhattan in a hospital near the Winter Garden theatre (where Mame would be produced), the only child of Harry Herman, a gym instructor, and his wife, Ruth Sachs, a piano teacher. They lived in Jersey City, and Harry and Ruth ran a summer camp in upstate New York, where Jerry made costumes, painted scenery and wrote revues. Ruth got him an introduction to Frank Loesser, the composer of Guys and Dolls, who liked his songs and declared he had a future in the musical theatre. At this crucial point Jerry transferred from the Parsons School of Design in New York to the University of Miami, where he majored in drama in 1953 and wrote more revues. After a couple of off-Broadway revues, he was commissioned to write his first Broadway musical, Milk and Honey (1961), as a Jewish theatre party special; after visiting Israel with his librettist, David Appell, he wrote a score of Jewish harmonies and American idioms for a tale of middle-aged romance blossoming for a party of widows in the desert. This led to an audition with the fearsome producer David Merrick to write Hello, Dolly!, which opened two months after the assassination of John F Kennedy and, winning 10 Tony awards, became the longest running Broadway musical until eventually overtaken by Fiddler on the Roof, which had opened in the same year. Ethel Merman had turned down the leading role. Channing was succeeded by Ginger Rogers, Betty Grable, Phyllis Diller, Pearl Bailey \u2013 who later led an all-black revival with Cab Calloway \u2013 and Merman herself. After Mame, which was basically Hello, Dolly! mark two (with Mary Martin following Merman in turning down the lead but taking it much later in the run), Herman ran into a brick wall with Dear World (1969), another vehicle for Lansbury that was based on Jean Giraudoux\u2019s The Madwoman of Chaillot. He fared little better with Mack and Mabel (1974) \u2013although it has an excellent score and was indeed Herman\u2019s favourite of all his \u201cchildren\u201d \u2013 which starred Robert Preston as the silent film-maker Mack Sennett and Bernadette Peters (her breakthrough role) as his tragic muse Mabel Normand, nor with The Grand Tour (1979), about an antisemitic Polish colonel and a Polish Jew (Joel Grey) escaping together from occupied France, derived from earlier plays by SN Behrman and Franz Werfel. Herman\u2019s big three shows are constantly revived \u2013 in London, the Menier Chocolate Factory\u2019s 2007 revival of La Cage was a small-scale revelation with Douglas Hodge, then Graham Norton and Roger Allam as Albin; Imelda Staunton is slated as Dolly Levi at the Adelphi in August 2020 \u2013 and the British theatre refuses to give up on Mack and Mabel, which flopped in the West End in 1995 but won legions of new fans in a pocket-sized production at the Watermill, Newbury, in 2005, transferring to the West End with David Soul and Janie Dee. It also surfaced more extravagantly once more at the Chichester Festival theatre in 2015, Michael Ball paired with the American singer and songwriter Rebecca LaChance. The Grand Tour, however, remains a lost voyage \u2013 Grey was never thought to have the humanity or humour of Danny Kaye in a 1958 film from the same source material \u2013 while Dear World, directed by Gillian Lynne with Betty Buckley at the Charing Cross theatre in 2013, proved to have a quirky charm but not a lot more. Herman kept an eye on all major revivals and collaborated on revues such as Jerry\u2019s Girls (1985), starring, on Broadway, a peerless trio of Dorothy Loudon, Chita Rivera and Leslie Uggams. His last Broadway show was An Evening with Jerry Herman (1998), and he wrote a TV musical for Lansbury, Mrs Santa Claus (1996).

Even by this country\u2019s quirky standards, some memorable heights have been hit and some 90s-esque depths have been hinted at. And South Africa thoroughly deserve to take a series lead to Cape Town; they bowled with more discipline and better plans, they seized what opportunities they had with the bat in conditions that weren\u2019t always easy, and generally did stuff that England failed to do. The first-innings batting was sloppy, and even after a better effort second time around, there was little sense that they\u2019d be able to dig in for an improbable win. The toss choice and team choice still suggest a lack of conviction in strategy and personnel. Both teams are in kind-of new eras though, all of which makes the rest of this series intriguing.</p> <p>And with that, and Vic Marks\u2019s match report below, I\u2019ll wish you the happiest of new years on behalf of all of us in OBO Towers.

The openers gave us a chance \u2013 I know Dom [Sibley] was disappointed to get out on 29 and he was part and parcel of that partnership that had us here today with a hope of winning.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we got here the wicket was a bit damp and it did something most of the day, and we thought day two and three would be the best days to bat, and day three was.\u201d On Test selections for Cape Town: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to see how Leach recovers [from illness], we\u2019ve got Parky [Matt Parkinson] here, Bess here, we have some good spinners here so we\u2019ll see.</p> <p>On the bowlers\u2019 loss of control yesterday: \u201cThe plan was to hit top of off as often as possible, tyough obviously we strayed away from that a bit before lunch yesterday. [With Jofra Archer] we\u2019re getting there to be honest, I was in the middle again with him this morning working on use of the crease. First-innings runs is something we have to work on, we didn\u2019t think it would be as difficult on day two as it was. Illness has been very tough but we can\u2019t use that as an excuse.</p> <p>\u201cOverton and Bess will remain in the squad, on the advice of the medical squad, and they\u2019ll travel to Cape Town with us.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e08a37d8f085eda5c10f296\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T13:18:10.564Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Joe Root speaks:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s been a really tough week off the field \u2013 10 guys going down ill, but credit to everyone; they\u2019ve stood up, and tried to put in the best performance possible. It\u2019s not been long since we\u2019ve seen similar chases from a similar group of players. We were in a good position at lunch with me and Ben there, and needed to negotiate new ball afterwards. But the game was won and lost with the seven for 39 collapse in the first innings, though good to bounce back and bat better in the second innings.</p> <p>\u201cThe toss was a 50-50 call, you get a side 111-5 and you think you\u2019ve got ahead of the game, but credit to them, they played very well. Archer is a huge talent, still at the start of his Test career, and responded well after a difficult tour of New Zealand, where he had a lot thrown at him.</p> <p>Faf du Plessis is up next: \u201cThe last couple of months has been tough for us, we\u2019ve worked very hard, this was a good Test, two teams fighting all the way. Today\u2019s effort was incredible, from the start, and the wickets came eventually. It\u2019s the start of a new chapter for us and we want to make sure we\u2019re improving and move up again, it\u2019s going to be a long journey to get there. Philander was phenomenal, day one and two was best for bowlers, yesterday the best day to bat, and even today, was better for batting. We did the basics really well, and kept it tight. </p> <p>De Kock is man of the match: \u201cThey bowled very well on the first day, but it was nice to get out there and contribute some runs in a tough situation,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be honest when I was out [batting in the first innings] there I thought I had to leave well, my mind was doing all sorts of things, but I needed to get a good rhythm and take it from there.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e08a2588f085eda5c10f28a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T12:57:30.628Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some feedback, inevitably; some Bairstow and Foakes chat, inevitably</strong>: Maybe we should look at the England wicketkeeper issue like a school exam multipule choice question,\u201d writes Dan Hunt. \u201cPick one of the following three to bat at No 7 for England in a Test series. Your selection will also keep wicket for the side: A) An experienced professional with a test career of two halves. His early appearances were successful and productive. His later performances offered diminishing returns as the inadvertent price of becoming the world\u2019s best ODI opener.B) An experienced white ball cricketer with a level head on his shoulders and the ability to regular transform limited overs games. His red ball record is minimal but has shown some glimpses of the destructive prowess he so regularly shows in other formats.C) A first class regular although a few years younger than the other other two choices. Widely acknowledged as the best wicketkeeper in England his batting, he has, on his limited international appearances so far has tended to over deliver against expectations. Seems to me like we should be moving on to option C....\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e08a19f8f08c39722641d44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T12:55:14.820Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Who\u2019ll be man of the match then</strong>?

Both are talented batsmen and fielders, Jimmy perhaps only second to Stokes in the slips. Both unfortunately give the impression that batting is no more than a hinderence and their place on the fielding team is where they are least likely to see the ball. This from a man with a proper test ton and another with plenty of evidence of talent, and they should be batting 8 and 10 in this side, not leaving Archer to cop the critisism for the failing tail, and taking pressure off Curran to simply bat without expectations.</p> <p>Nobody since Strauss has really been strong enough with the pair, so it was refreshing to see Stokes laying down the law at Broad yesterday.

I\u2019m just not sure where their equivalent is here. Buttler becalmed just doesn\u2019t work out, and for all his talent Curran is a counterpuncher, who you\u2019d never expect a gritty 120 from 270 balls. The tail also feels longish. Root and Stokes must wonder where that team\u2019s legacy went. But when you\u2019re struggling for wins, as we are now, it\u2019s much harder to pick players and let them fail before they come good. Burns\u2019 success should be a reason to keep Sibley, because also, if not him, then who?\u201d</p> <p>I think this team has a pretty similar structure to the Flower team, certainly after Collingwood\u2019s retirement \u2013 three new-ball blunters at the top and then a load of strokemakers. They just aren\u2019t as good. As you say, though, Flower\u2019s team had a much better tail, possibly England\u2019s best ever. I agree about Sibley, who should be given at least this series and the one in Sri Lanka.

Denly continues to impress both in attack and defence; he has 27 from 70 balls.</p> <p>\u201cI rate the chances an England victory as 20 times more likely to happen than Ben Foakes being called up as cover as \u2018our boys\u2019 continue to turn into human Catherine wheels,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cSo, about 1 in 100.\u201d </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T08:57:14.246Z\">at 8.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e08685d8f085eda5c10f183\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T08:51:32.951Z\">8.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>52nd over: England 139-2 (Denly 21, Root 0) </strong>Joe Root, the new batsman, survives a pretty big LBW appeal first ball.

      "bodyText": "So farewell 2019, a never-uneventful year for cricket in general and English cricket in particular. Even by this country\u2019s quirky standards, some memorable heights have been hit and some 90s-esque depths have been hinted at. And South Africa thoroughly deserve to take a series lead to Cape Town; they bowled with more discipline and better plans, they seized what opportunities they had with the bat in conditions that weren\u2019t always easy, and generally did stuff that England failed to do. The first-innings batting was sloppy, and even after a better effort second time around, there was little sense that they\u2019d be able to dig in for an improbable win. The toss choice and team choice still suggest a lack of conviction in strategy and personnel. Both teams are in kind-of new eras though, all of which makes the rest of this series intriguing. And with that, and Vic Marks\u2019s match report below, I\u2019ll wish you the happiest of new years on behalf of all of us in OBO Towers. Thanks for your emails and company. Bye. Some thoughts from Chris Silverwood: \u201cIt was a difficult challenge, we did have high hopes, we didn\u2019t score many runs. The openers gave us a chance \u2013 I know Dom [Sibley] was disappointed to get out on 29 and he was part and parcel of that partnership that had us here today with a hope of winning. \u201cWhen we got here the wicket was a bit damp and it did something most of the day, and we thought day two and three would be the best days to bat, and day three was.\u201d On Test selections for Cape Town: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to see how Leach recovers [from illness], we\u2019ve got Parky [Matt Parkinson] here, Bess here, we have some good spinners here so we\u2019ll see. On the bowlers\u2019 loss of control yesterday: \u201cThe plan was to hit top of off as often as possible, tyough obviously we strayed away from that a bit before lunch yesterday. [With Jofra Archer] we\u2019re getting there to be honest, I was in the middle again with him this morning working on use of the crease. First-innings runs is something we have to work on, we didn\u2019t think it would be as difficult on day two as it was. Illness has been very tough but we can\u2019t use that as an excuse. \u201cOverton and Bess will remain in the squad, on the advice of the medical squad, and they\u2019ll travel to Cape Town with us.\u201d Joe Root speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s been a really tough week off the field \u2013 10 guys going down ill, but credit to everyone; they\u2019ve stood up, and tried to put in the best performance possible. It\u2019s not been long since we\u2019ve seen similar chases from a similar group of players. We were in a good position at lunch with me and Ben there, and needed to negotiate new ball afterwards. But the game was won and lost with the seven for 39 collapse in the first innings, though good to bounce back and bat better in the second innings. \u201cThe toss was a 50-50 call, you get a side 111-5 and you think you\u2019ve got ahead of the game, but credit to them, they played very well. Archer is a huge talent, still at the start of his Test career, and responded well after a difficult tour of New Zealand, where he had a lot thrown at him. Faf du Plessis is up next: \u201cThe last couple of months has been tough for us, we\u2019ve worked very hard, this was a good Test, two teams fighting all the way. Today\u2019s effort was incredible, from the start, and the wickets came eventually. It\u2019s the start of a new chapter for us and we want to make sure we\u2019re improving and move up again, it\u2019s going to be a long journey to get there. Philander was phenomenal, day one and two was best for bowlers, yesterday the best day to bat, and even today, was better for batting. We did the basics really well, and kept it tight. De Kock is man of the match: \u201cThey bowled very well on the first day, but it was nice to get out there and contribute some runs in a tough situation,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be honest when I was out [batting in the first innings] there I thought I had to leave well, my mind was doing all sorts of things, but I needed to get a good rhythm and take it from there. Some feedback, inevitably; some Bairstow and Foakes chat, inevitably: Maybe we should look at the England wicketkeeper issue like a school exam multipule choice question,\u201d writes Dan Hunt. \u201cPick one of the following three to bat at No 7 for England in a Test series. Your selection will also keep wicket for the side: A) An experienced professional with a test career of two halves. His early appearances were successful and productive. His later performances offered diminishing returns as the inadvertent price of becoming the world\u2019s best ODI opener.B) An experienced white ball cricketer with a level head on his shoulders and the ability to regular transform limited overs games. His red ball record is minimal but has shown some glimpses of the destructive prowess he so regularly shows in other formats.C) A first class regular although a few years younger than the other other two choices. Widely acknowledged as the best wicketkeeper in England his batting, he has, on his limited international appearances so far has tended to over deliver against expectations. Seems to me like we should be moving on to option C....\u201d Who\u2019ll be man of the match then? De Kock for his catches and decisive first-innings rescue act? Rabada for his seven wickets? Philander for his metronomic precision? Nortje and Petersen also played key roles in what was a fine all-round team effort. England, meanwhile, end 2019 having won only four Tests, one of which was a dead rubber, another being an almost-dead one, and one of the others being one of the greatest things that has ever happened in any sporting arena ever. Typical England. The South African players are high-fiving each other gleefully here, and why not: this win brings some much-needed feelgood glow to South African cricket after a pretty horrendous 2019, on and off the pitch. Graeme Smith, Mark Boucher and co might contribute to that, after a fine first Test overseeing things. And they\u2019ve been on top of England ever since that second-afternoon collapse. It was a poor decision to bowl first, but their lack of all-round longevity as a Test batting unit makes them hard to rely on whatever the circumstances. 93rd over: England 268 (Anderson 0), target 376 Buttler has only one option now \u2013 hit, and hit hard, which he does to spectacular effect off the first ball of Rabada\u2019s over, belting it high over long-on and into the grass banks for SIX, but it doesn\u2019t last because he\u2019s caught in the deep next ball. Broad hoiks the next, shortish ball for two to get off the mark, and promptly inside-edges for another couple. England aren\u2019t going to die wondering anyway, as Broad then spoons up another chance that just eludes a diving Maharaj on the offside, before he\u2019s clean bowled to clean up the match Buttler has decided an attacking frenzy is the only route to a miracle, and clouts the first ball of Rabada\u2019s over for six, but perishes trying the same thing next ball, skying up in the air for Pretorius to take a steepler at long-on. 92nd over: England 256-8 (Buttler 16, Broad 0), target 376 Archer expresses his confidence in Archer by running a single off the first ball of Nortje\u2019s over. But it\u2019s not repaid as the No 9 is done for pace and can only edge to slip. Nortje has three wickets, and deservedly so \u2013 his introduction has turned this game decisively in South Africa\u2019s direction, though it was inching that way in any case. Four wickets with the new ball have removed all doubt. Archer flicks a too-quick delivery to first slip, where Van der Dussen this time takes the catch. 91st over: England 255-7 Buttler 15, Archer 4), target 376 Curran offers a hint of what he and Buttler\u2019s victory strategy would have been if he hadn\u2019t edged behind a delivery after slashing Rabada over backward point for four off the first ball of the over. Archer, much-maligned as a batsman and by some even as a bowler of late, is off the mark with a four first ball. So have that. Curran is done like a kipper by one that\u2019s slanted across then straightens, takes his edge, and that\u2019s him gone. Along with the game. 90th over: England 247-6 Buttler 15, Curran 5), target 376 Because he\u2019s the sort of cricketer he is, Sam Curran flays and edges Nortje \u2013 and it flashes through the third slip area for four. Buttler then ups the ante and plays the second classy off-drive for four of his innings, though he\u2019s then almost caught at short leg next ball but the fielder can\u2019t quite scramble there in time. No matter, because the next ball is casually swung for SIX \u2013 in the way only Buttler can \u2013 over the square leg boundary. 89th over: England 232-6 Buttler 5, Curran 0), target 376 Buttler flicks at a wide one from Rabada down leg \u2013 it brushes his pads but a diving De Kock can only parry it. He\u2019s then bothered by one that jags right back into his left thigh, off both seam and pitch-crack. England aren\u2019t going to survive this. Has any cricketer been discussed in a match he\u2019s not playing in more than Ben Foakes has here? Here\u2019s some more on that subject from Neil Brock: \u201cBy the end of this tour with South Africa I get the feeling Ben Foakes stock will never be higher. Bairstow is under huge pressure to score and massively out of form whilst Buttler still appears shoehorned in to make up for the failings of the rest of England\u2019s batting line-up. Despite Foakes only averaging 26 at County level last season his glovework and the fact he hasn\u2019t failed internationally mean his name will keep coming up. Even with the circumstances around it, Pope having to keep wicket against New Zealand was a bit of a travesty and one which falls on the selectors making another short-sighted decision. At least I hope Foakes has enjoyed having his feet up over Christmas!\u201d 88th over: England 232-6 Buttler 5, Curran 0), target 376 Nortje replaces Philander, and Du Plessis\u2019 bowling change is swiftly vindicated by Root\u2019s dismissal, his one slightly loose shot of the session, his footwork static, though it was just the sort of ball that tempts even the finest of batsmen. Nortje comes round the wicket at the new man in, the left-handed Curran, making him play and completing a wicket maiden. \u201cAs a dyed in the wool tyke,\u201d writes Nick Smith (is there any other type?), \u201cI feel obliged to defend YJB somewhat - during his and Buttler\u2019s 100-odd tests, how often have they come in after the openers have yet again failed?\u201d Yeah, like I said, the whole Test strategy and team has been confused. Nortje comes on and strikes second ball of his spell, just as Rabada did a few overs back, and it\u2019s a big one, a perfectly pitched out-nibbler in the corridor that the England captain edges behind. That should be South Africa\u2019s Test now. 87th over: England 232-5 (Root 48, Buttler 5), target 376 Root cuts loose, literally, top-handing past backward point for four, again benefiting from playing late. He\u2019s able to flick a single to leg too as batting begins to look a little easier. If these two can get to tea unscathed then \u2026 nah, forget it, I\u2019m not going there. In a random development, a couple of England fans appear to be singing Sheffield United\u2019s \u201cgreasy chip butty\u201d song 86th over: England 227-5 (Root 43, Buttler 5), target 376 A short extra-cover is brought in for Buttler, but he\u2019s able to see out the over, judiciously leaving well at this point, and Philander\u2019s swing too easy to pick to be tempted by. And it\u2019s rounded off with a sumptuous, coaching-manual cover drive for four. 85th over: England 223-5 (Root 43, Buttler 1), target 376 Some more variable bounce from Rabada, including the first proper bouncer with the new ball, which Root gets under comfortably enough. He\u2019s doing the right things here, the England captain, seeing the ball late onto the bat, and judging his lines and lengths well, until the last ball of the over, which zips past him at pace and low bounce and is too close for him to cut. Rabada the better of the two opening bowlers at this point. 84th over: England 223-5 (Root 43, Buttler 1), target 376 Philander doesn\u2019t make Buttler play enough in this over, granting the batsman some handy leaving practice. Another maiden. Their presence is more a reflection of England\u2019s confused strategy towards Test cricket for the past four years, and a lack of an obvious first-choice red-ball XI during that time. Moeen\u2019s loss of form feels a big part of this. 83rd over: England 223-5 (Root 43, Buttler 1), target 376 Rabada is discomforting England here, though Buttler manages to squeeze a single to get himself off the mark. Root, at least, is batting sensibly though, getting himself out of the way of the trickiest stuff. The Bairstow chat begins: \u201cI count myself a huge admirer of Jonny,\u201d enumerates Tim Sanders, \u201cand I thought it was a fair call to drop him for Tests with the requirement to rediscover his technique for first-class cricket. What then seemed daft was to recall him as soon as someone else got ill or injured. If the judgement is that he has work to do, then how does another player\u2019s fitness change that?\u201d He\u2019s certainly now at that stage of his Test career where every failure will be considered damning rather than an aberration. He\u2019s not looked Test-standard here, certainly. 82nd over: England 222-5 (Root 43, Buttler 0), target 376 Philander returns from the Pavilion End. He\u2019s into that perfect offside-corridor groove straight away, and has Root driving and missing with a teasing away swinger. This could be a hell of a contest. A maiden. 81st over: England 222-5 (Root 43, Buttler 0), target 376 Rabada takes the new ball and his first delivery is overpitched, and Bairstow cashes in joyously, flicking through midwicket for four. But the joy doesn\u2019t last, and YJB goes next ball \u2013 he has failed again, and at a pivotal time. Buttler is well beaten with an excellent couple of inswingers first up. This is a massive innings for him too, now, and he\u2019s had a proper working over already with his first four deliveries faced. Given how England fell away at five down in the first innings, South Africa are emphatic favourites now. Rabada strikes with the second ball with the new nut! Bairstow had clipped the first for four but then edges a tempting wide away-swinger to third slip, where Hamza takes a good sharp catch on the rise. 80th over: England 218-4 (Root 43, Bairstow 5), target 376 Pretorius doesn\u2019t look particularly threatening at this point, and Root flicks him away for two towards square leg, before Root is well beaten and struck on the pad with the final ball with the old ball, but it\u2019s outside the line, and Du Plessis declines the review. There\u2019s no inside edge either, invalidating gully\u2019s attempt to claim the catch, which bounced just before him in any case. Now is the decisive time. New ball up next. 79th over: England 216-4 (Root 41, Bairstow 5), target 376 Root eases Maharaj away for a single at the start of the spinner\u2019s final over before the new ball is due. He has a silly point in for Bairstow, who is necessarily watchful against some accurate bowling, however much his instincts might want him to clout him over the top. 78th over: England 215-4 (Root 40, Bairstow 5), target 376 Bairstow gets to face the seamers for the first time, coping comfortably with what Pretorius has to offer but without scoring. Some South Africa team news: Aiden Markram\u2019s self-inflicted hand injury (how many more times must cricketers be told that a man can\u2019t win a fight with a locker) means the uncapped Keegan Petersen has been called into their squad for the second Test. 77th over: England 215-4 (Root 40, Bairstow 5), target 376 Another so-so over from Maharaj brings two singles. Meanwhile Abhijato Sensarma has a seasonal rhyme for us, which may or may not jinx things, depending on your affiliations: No jokes, Ben Stokes was the biggest of England\u2019s hopes The spinner has tried to be the dream killer and make them hang onto their last ropes \u2019Once a year is enough\u2019 - the Proteas must be musing about their Durban choke But England have an affinity for tragedy as well as comedy, that\u2019s no joke The new batsman should be nowhere near the Test side, but here he is instead of Ollie Pope Criticism, omission and straight balls are things with which he cannot cope But the man also has a point to prove like his skipper, so naysayers - lie low If there\u2019s an unlikely Christmas hero the world deserves, it\u2019s Jonny Bairstow 76th over: England 213-4 (Root 39, Bairstow 4), target 376 Pretorius comes on for Nortje, but can\u2019t find the same venom as his predecessor from that end, though he does have a shout for lbw against Root, shuffling across his stump, but it still looks to be going down leg, and too high, and the umpires are rightly haveing none of it. 75th over: England 212-4 (Root 39, Bairstow 4), target 376 Bairstow is gifted another Maharaj loosener from which to get off the mark, and the cut is emphatic and bound for the ropes. An easy four. There\u2019s plenty in the pitch for the spinner, as you\u2019d expect at this stage of the game, but he\u2019s not quite found the control needed. Yet he\u2019s still changed the mood with a key wicket, and deserves to continue until the new ball. 74th over: England 208-4 (Root 39, Bairstow 0), target 376 South Africa\u2019s dander is suddenly up, and Root\u2019s mood is scarcely improved by, first, a grubber that he can get nowhere near from Nortje; second, another that spits off the surface and straight into his sensitive regions, and third a more orthodox away-swinger that beats him all ends up. But he survives them, and then flicks a stray ball down legside backward of square which beats the man on the boundary to bring four more. A tremendous over of Test match cricket, that. 73rd over: England 204-4 (Root 35, Bairstow 0), target 376 I\u2019d just typed that Maharaj isn\u2019t on top of things at all yet, after another short and loose one was worked away easily by Root for a single, before he only goes and bowls Stokes with one that turns in sharply at the left-hander. That\u2019ll learn me for banging on about Headingley and Perera. So now, let the YJB arguments begin! Which is what we\u2019re all here for after all. Maharaj brings one back into Stokes, who drags it onto his stumps. That came from nowhere. 72nd over: England 203-3 (Root 34, Stokes 14), target 376 Just as England may be buoyed by talk of Headingley as they go after this large target, you wonder if South Africa are haunted by their own fourth-innings nightmare this year, at the hands of Kusal Perera. Stokes flicks Nortje away for a well-run two and sees out the rest of the over comfortably enough. 71st over: England 201-3 (Root 34, Stokes 12), target 376 Philander is dragged from that end, and replaced by Maharaj as Du Plessis seeks some spin magic with the old ball. Stokes is after him from the off though, sweeping his first ball to the square leg boundary for four and clouting the fourth through the covers for another boundary. The first real sign of cutting loose from the newly gonged all-rounder. Root rounds off a highly productive over with an effortless cut for four more to take England past 200. England need \u201conly\u201d 175 more now. 70th over: England 188-3 (Root 30, Stokes 4), target 376 Nortje continues to get some brutish bounce from the pitch, rapping Root in the wrist with a short one speared down the onside. A fuller delivery enables the captain to add two runs, followed by a classy flick through midwicket for four. Dare I say it, but this has been an encouraging start to the afternoon for England. 69th over: England 182-3 (Root 24, Stokes 4), target 376 The magic mallet comes out again to bang down a divot by the crease at the bowler\u2019s end, before Philander\u2019s first ball \u2013 a real loosener, short and wide \u2013 is cut emphatically for four by Root, who scampers a single next ball. Philander is not looking so menacing from this end. \u201cI\u2019ve read every BTL comment on every cricket article since about 2005, and it hasn\u2019t done me any harm,\u201d writes James Debens, from behind a 14-year-old pile of washing up and pizza boxes, before ruining my gag with a pay-off of his own. \u201cIn fact, the wondrous insights, perspicacity and clear thinking of the BTL community have helped the years fly by, here at Rampton.\u201d 68th over: England 177-3 (Root 19, Stokes 4), target 376 The impressive Nortje returns from the Pavilion End. Root glides a shortish ball elegantly down to third man for a single \u2013 he\u2019s looking Ok for a sick bloke \u2013 before Nortje torments Stokes from round the wicket again, ripping an absolute zinger away from his outside edge. This is going to be a tricky challenge for Stokes. 67th over: England 176-3 (Root 18, Stokes 4), target 376 The excellent Philander starts off the session, but from the opposite end to that from which he operated this morning. He relishes bowling at Root, though he\u2019ll need a breather before the second new ball. He concedes a four though, Root timing an on-drive exquisitely past mid-on. There\u2019s a bit of uneven bounce again, though I thought this pitch would be much more unplayable by now at the end of day two. Before we return to the action, one more sage suggestion from Adrian Goldman: \u201cI suggest Pasta-pesto with a salad. Dead simple, avoids all the hated food groups and - if you make your own pesto - you can add enough garlic to make sure that people leave soon after lunch. Problem sorted. Adrian (I am contributing content so moving the dial\u2026)\u201d Personally, I would say the internet contains more content than consumption. Has anyone who has ever contributed to a 1,578-comment long debate actually read the previous 1,577 for example? Face it, people \u2013 we\u2019re all howling into the void. Mike Waters has some more serious cricketing thoughts to offer: hi Rob, I have had the mixed fortune to be able to watch every ball from my recliner and also have empathy with the virus stricken by catching what may be the same affliction being suffered by the sqaud. Having had to drag myself into work for Christmas day to cover a preareanged shift, fortunately spent mainly alone in an office, I have to commend anyone who has even managed to put whites on, never mind be involved on 90mph bowling in any capacity while fighting the most debiliating bug I can recall in my life. Looking at the batting to come, it struck me just how little Branderson appear to contribute to the team when not bowling these days. Both are talented batsmen and fielders, Jimmy perhaps only second to Stokes in the slips. Both unfortunately give the impression that batting is no more than a hinderence and their place on the fielding team is where they are least likely to see the ball. This from a man with a proper test ton and another with plenty of evidence of talent, and they should be batting 8 and 10 in this side, not leaving Archer to cop the critisism for the failing tail, and taking pressure off Curran to simply bat without expectations. Nobody since Strauss has really been strong enough with the pair, so it was refreshing to see Stokes laying down the law at Broad yesterday. Perhaps the leadership to get the best from the old stagers is there, just in the wrong role at the moment. Broad\u2019s batting has long been a frustrating thing, even before the Varun Aaron blow that so jolted his form. But yeah, England\u2019s frail tail has joined the long list of Things Wrong With England\u2019s Test Team. And responsibility needs to be taken. Some lunchtime emails: \u201cI thought I should come in peace before the (not so) YJB arrives at the crease and risks dividing us again,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cThink your Pareto-like odds assessment of 80:20 SA:Eng was fair at the off, but I wonder whether the fall of wickets and the recent balls to Root might have us heading towards the 89:10:1 (SA:Eng:tie) ratio which apparently is the internet lurkers principle - 89% just consume, 9% edit and only 1% actively create new content. Makes you wonder how this applies to OBO community?\u201d As many as nine per cent edit?! Can\u2019t say as I\u2019ve noticed that being a particular feature of the interweb. Meanwhile, Kim Thonger has a familiar culinary dilemma: \u201cWe have family arriving for lunch and I\u2019m cooking risotto to break the culinary monotony of the last week. However in attendance are one vegetarian daughter, another daughter who hates mushrooms, an aunt who is allergic to prawns and two grandchildren who are appalled by rice. I can now empathise with the England selectors whose intractable problems appear to be of a similar size. We may scrap the risotto entirely and just have afters, a solution akin to cancelling all red ball cricket and focusing on The Hundred.\u201d Nice analogy. The Hundred really is the butterscotch Angel Delight of cricketing competitions. Anyway, can\u2019t mushroom-averse daughters usually be placated with fish fingers, and beans? They can when they\u2019re younger anyhow. Thanks Rob, and morning/afternoon everyone. So England need 205 in five sessions, and my inner Fred Boycott would love to see them drag this chase deep into the final day and give tomorrow\u2019s OBOers some serious work to do. And given the sluggish rate England were forced to inch along at this morning, thanks to some excellent South African bowling, this all could still happen. Or England could be all out for 208 by half-eleven. Anyway, all to play for Lunchtime reading 66th over: England 171-3 (Root 13, Stokes 4) Root repels Rabada\u2019s final over before lunch without alarm. It\u2019s been South Africa\u2019s morning, with England scoring 50 from 25 overs for the loss of the two overnight batsmen. England need another 205 runs for a record-breaking victory. South Africa have a new ball available in 14 overs\u2019 time, and I suspect that will be decisive. Tom Davies will be with you for the afternoon session - you can email him here. I\u2019ll see you after tea, unless England fall over in a heap. 65th over: England 170-3 (Root 12, Stokes 4) Keshav Maharaj comes into the attack. That\u2019s a good move from Faf du Plessis, just to tempt Stokes into bringing out the long handle. He slog-swept Maharaj for consecutive sixes in the first innings, and hit him for four in six balls at the Oval in 2017. This time, with the ball spitting out of rough and lunch only a few minutes away, he treats him with caution. 64th over: England 169-3 (Root 11, Stokes 4) Rabada replaces Nortje, with just over 10 minutes remaining before lunch. Stokes checks a drive back towards Rabada, who can\u2019t quite change direction in his follow-through to take the catch. The ball dipped as well, so it was probably a one-in-20 chance. England need the lunch break. If they lose another wicket now, it\u2019s done. \u201cI don\u2019t want to send in relentlessly negative missives, Rob, but it\u2019s tiring supporting England when you\u2019re witnessing a near constant rearguard,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cBack when we were Flowering teams slowly into the dust, we had a great top five, but you also knew we could dig in, especially with Prior and Collingwood having the ability to stick at the crease. I\u2019m just not sure where their equivalent is here. Buttler becalmed just doesn\u2019t work out, and for all his talent Curran is a counterpuncher, who you\u2019d never expect a gritty 120 from 270 balls. The tail also feels longish. Root and Stokes must wonder where that team\u2019s legacy went. But when you\u2019re struggling for wins, as we are now, it\u2019s much harder to pick players and let them fail before they come good. Burns\u2019 success should be a reason to keep Sibley, because also, if not him, then who?\u201d I think this team has a pretty similar structure to the Flower team, certainly after Collingwood\u2019s retirement \u2013 three new-ball blunters at the top and then a load of strokemakers. They just aren\u2019t as good. As you say, though, Flower\u2019s team had a much better tail, possibly England\u2019s best ever. I agree about Sibley, who should be given at least this series and the one in Sri Lanka. Yesterday\u2019s innings was encouraging. 63rd over: England 168-3 (Root 10, Stokes 4) Stokes is beaten, flirting outside off stump at Pretorius. South Africa have been really impressive this morning. They have kept their nerve and their discipline, which in turn has allowed them keep control. England have scored 47 runs in 22 overs today, and 12 of those came from two Denly pull strokes. 62nd over: England 168-3 (Root 10, Stokes 4) Root gloves another malevolent delivery from Nortje round the corner, runs through for a single without his bat and then calls for treatment. He seems okay. When play resumes, Stokes edges short of du Plessis at second slip. \u201cGiven the condition of the pitch, why would you choose to bowl first?\u201d says Dan Ebanks. \u201cI know hindsight is 20:20, but is this another example of a captain trying too hard?\u201d It was a mistake, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll privately acknowledge that. I suspect it was a confused decision, because of the grass on the pitch and the decision to pick five seamers. They probably thought the pitch would be much better for batting on the second day. The apparent lack of awareness of the typical deterioration of pitches at Centurion doesn\u2019t look great. 61st over: England 166-3 (Root 9, Stokes 3) 60th over: England 164-3 (Root 9, Stokes 1) Stokes gets off the mark from his 12th delivery, working Nortje into the leg side for a single. Then a short ball flies away for four byes. Every little helps, especially when you\u2019re chasing 376. 59th over: England 158-3 (Root 8, Stokes 0) A maiden from Pretorius to the hitherto strokeless Stokes. 58th over: England 158-3 (Root 8, Stokes 0) Root inside-edges Nortje just wide of leg stump. England cannot afford to lose another wicket before lunch. Root is then smashed on the bottom hand by a nasty delivery. The uneven bounce is now happening off the straight, which is great news for South Africa. 57th over: England 158-3 (Root 8, Stokes 0) That was another impressive little innings from Denly, though he\u2019ll be frustrated by the way he got out. South Africa are in an excellent position now. They have bowled superbly this morning. That\u2019s out! Denly whips around a straight one from Pretorius and is given out LBW. The non-striker Root encourages Denly to review, but replays show it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call and that\u2019s good enough for South Africa. 56th over: England 158-2 (Denly 31, Root 8) A crap delivery from Nortje is cut through the covers for four by Root. Meanwhile, this is great, and includes plenty of cricket. 55th over: England 153-2 (Denly 31, Root 4) Dwaine Pretorius comes on to replace Kagiso Rabada, and Denly pulls his fourth ball disdainfully through midwicket for four. He\u2019s such an elegant puller and hooker, which is one of the reasons he has been able to make runs against such quality pace attacks in the last year. He\u2019s the Pretty Boy Who Went to War! Pretorius responds by getting one to spit from a length and rap Denly on the glove. Though he is the fourth seamer in this team, his height and tight line could make him a real threat on this uneven pitch. 54th over: England 149-2 (Denly 27, Root 4) Nortje has been really impressive in this game. He\u2019s not just a big, strapping fast bowler, as he showed with that smart spell around the wicket to the left-handers in the first innings. At the moment he has Root in his sights and is pounding a length just outside off stump. Root seems okay physically, though it\u2019s hard to be sure when you\u2019re 8,871 miles away. He gets off the mark with a familiar steer between slip and gully for four. Risk, meet reward. That\u2019s drinks. 53rd over: England 145-2 (Denly 27, Root 0) Denly hooks Rabada for his second six of the morning. It was a strange incident, because Nortje at deep backward square lost sight of the ball and started to cower as his team-mates screamed at him. I don\u2019t think it made any difference, though, as the ball sailed into the crowd. Denly continues to impress both in attack and defence; he has 27 from 70 balls. \u201cI rate the chances an England victory as 20 times more likely to happen than Ben Foakes being called up as cover as \u2018our boys\u2019 continue to turn into human Catherine wheels,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cSo, about 1 in 100.\u201d 52nd over: England 139-2 (Denly 21, Root 0) Joe Root, the new batsman, survives a pretty big LBW appeal first ball. I say pretty big: Nortje was interested, the cordon less so. It looked too high and Faf du Plessis declined a review. He is beaten later in the over by another one that keeps low. So far, happily for England, all the uneven bounce has been wide of off stump. But I suspect at least one batsman will receive a stump-busting grubber at some stage. Well that escalated quickly. Rory Burns, having played perfectly for 45 minutes, has suddenly given his wicket away. He tried to hook the new bowler Anrich Nortje, but it was too wide for him to control the shot and he top-edged it straight to Rabada at mid-on. That\u2019s a big wicket for South Africa. Burns, fuming with himself, started to walk long before the ball reached Rabada. A split-second misjudgement has cost him his wicket. 51st over: England 139-1 (Burns 84, Denly 21) This has been a fine start from England, with both batsmen showing excellent don\u2019t say game management, Smyth, please don\u2019t say game management, this isn\u2019t a wildlife reserve awareness of the match situation. And it\u2019s South Africa\u2019s bowlers who have blinked first. Rabada twice goes too straight to Burns, who puts him away for two and three runs respectively. \u201cHitting a six in a Test match?\u201d sniffs Ian Copestake. \u201cWhat the heck is this Denly man playing at. He can park that shot along with his bloody ego. Upstart.\u201d 50th over: England 134-1 (Burns 79, Denly 21) Philander continues to test Burns\u2019 patience and judgement outside off stump. Eventually he goes a bit too straight and is worked off the pads for a single. That\u2019s Burns\u2019 first run off 30 deliveries from Philander this morning. \u201cBut did you notice Rob that he actually also started banging the pitch as much as six inches in front of the crease?\u201d says Steve D. \u201cSneaky I think.\u201d I didn\u2019t see that. I\u2019ll try to have a look at the drinks break, but I wouldn\u2019t worry too much \u2013 I\u2019m sure the commentators would have said something had anything untoward occurred. 49th over: England 133-1 (Burns 78, Denly 21) Another unpleasant lifter from Rabada to Denly is well saved by de Kock. Rabada goes a bit straighter, in the hope for something similar, but the bounce is even and Denly works a single off the pads. That\u2019s the first rotation of strike this morning - and almost the end of Burns. He overbalanced as he turned Rabada to backward short leg, where the substitute Rudi Second reacted brilliantly to grab the ball on the bounce and fling it at the stumps. It missed by a whisker with Burns out of his ground. 48th over: England 131-1 (Burns 77, Denly 20) Burns hasn\u2019t scored a run this morning, mainly because he has been stuck at Philander\u2019s end. It\u2019s an intriguing game of patience between the two: four overs, four maidens. 47th over: England 131-1 (Burns 77, Denly 20) Madon, what a shot from Joe Denly! Rabada\u2019s first ball was a fraction short, and Denly launched into a majestic swivel-pull for six. Ricky Ponting could hardly have played that better. Rabada\u2019s next ball lifts grotesquely outside off stump, with de Kock leaping to save four byes. That uneven bounce is a concern for lovers of England miracles. \u201cI cannot believe that what has just happened is legal!\u201d says Steve D. \u201cA man came on with a hammer and proceeded to smash to pitch around and in front of the crease line!! Does that not constitute changing the pitch conditions?\u201d If he did it on a good length, there would be an international incident, but he was just doing it to improve the bowlers\u2019 foothold. Any delivery that pitches there will be a yorker, so it doesn\u2019t matter what state the pitch is in. 46th over: England 125-1 (Burns 77, Denly 14) Philander continues to Burns. Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip: a maiden. This is excellent stuff from South Africa, though England\u2019s batsmen have so far played with the requisite patience. As Mike Atherton says on Sky, they just have to \u201csuck it up\u201d for a while. \u201cI just noticed that there are two little white lines a few metres up the edge of the track from the crease,\u201d says Garry Sharp. \u201cWhat are they for?\u201d Robbie Fowler tribute celebrations? I have no idea I\u2019m afraid. I can\u2019t even see them. Do you the mean the ones by the slip cordon? I assume that\u2019s where the wicketkeeper de Kock wants to stand for each bowler. 45th over: England 125-1 (Burns 77, Denly 14) Rabada has an optimistic LBW appeal against Denly turned down by Paul Reiffel. Missing leg. Denly is then beaten by a delivery that keeps very low. There have been early signs of uneven bounce at Rabada\u2019s end. South Africa will be pleased with the accuracy and intensity of their start - England have scored only four runs in four overs, and they came from an involuntary edge. \u201cMy plan to recuperate with an Ally Pally hangover revolves around me staying on the sofa with cricket, football and darts for company,\u201d says John Dalby. \u201cIts success hinges on England batting through until tea. What are my chances?\u201d Touch and go, I\u2019d say, but at a push you can always watch a repeat of Luke Humphries v Jermaine Wattimena from earlier in the tournament. Or just go back to bed. 44th over: England 125-1 (Burns 77, Denly 14) Philander seams a beauty past Burns\u2019 defensive push. He has started immaculately and remains the biggest threat to England. Burns, that play and miss aside, is leaving him well outside off stump, which is not easy against a relentless line bowler like Philander. Excellent stuff so far. \u201cGood morning, Rob,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cIf the TV cameras do seek out \u2018the beautiful, the famous or the wacky\u2019 (The Spirit of Cricket, Rob Smyth) they may stumble across the latter in the form of an actual friend of mine who it turns out is a member of the Barmy Army. He is at the ground and may well lead some singing, and if his girlfriend has brought her ukulele then she might get upgraded to famous.\u201d Crikey, did I write that? I have no memory of that whatsoever. Then again, I can barely remember what I wrote in the 42nd over. And it\u2019s all downhill from here! 43rd over: England 125-1 (Burns 77, Denly 14) Kagiso Rabada starts at the other end to Denly, who gets a thick edge to third man for four. The previous delivery popped nastily outside off stump, a reminder that this pitch hasn\u2019t completely gone to sleep. The next 37 overs, before the second new ball is available, are so important. I reckon England can afford to lose no more than two wickets in that time. 42nd over: England 121-1 (Burns 77, Denly 10) Philander doesn\u2019t do looseners. His first ball is right on the money and defended by Burns, and his first over is a maiden. \u201cGood morning Rob from bright and frosty Piedmont,\u201d says Finbar Anslow. \u201cLast night the South Piedmontese Christmas film appreciation society watched It\u2019s a Wonderful Life and I can confirm it\u2019s still up there as one of the best festive feelgood movies; now if only England had a couple of George Baileys (and maybe a Clarence would be useful).\u201d It\u2019s time for some cricket. Vernon Philander will open the bowling to Rory Burns. \u201cGood morning, Rob,\u201d says Eva Maaten. \u201cAfter attending to family obligations in Europe we made it back to SA in time for day four of this exciting Test - I\u2019m very grateful to Burns for ensuring there is still some cricket to be played today. Overcast and cooler today; what do you think that means for the pitch and England\u2019s chances? We seemed to have ended up in the middle of a touring group of England fans with some very enthusiastic looking SA supporters just across the aisle - this should be a fun day!\u201d The Sky Sports pundits all think the cool weather is good for England because it should delay the deterioration of the pitch. I still think South Africa are strong favourites, though I\u2019m in a minority: most reckon it\u2019s 60/40 in their favour. I\u2019d make it 80/20. Joe Root and Jos Buttler are at the ground and apparently feeling better. It\u2019s on! Pre-play reading Hello. The secret of eternal youth is not yoga, serums, goji berries or even a generous swig of Cognac every morning. It\u2019s being an England cricket fan. You heard. Never mind all that facial stuff: if you want to feel truly alive, and experience the kind of extreme emotions usually reserved for teens and twentysomethings, just support this team. Ecstasy, anxiety, mirth, bewilderment, rage: you get them all with England - often in the same match, sometimes in the same day. The last 12 months have possibly been the most rejuvenating of the lot. Today should be England\u2019s last day of cricket in 2019 \u2013 a year that has included a World Cup victory in whateverthehellthatfinalwas, a Headingley miracle, Test match scores of 67, 77 and 85 all out, the emergence of Jofra Archer and so much more. I suppose it\u2019s only fair that they put us through this addictive wringer one last time. All things being equal, this match will end in one of three ways for England: miserable defeat, noble defeat or astonishing victory. (Don\u2019t mention the tie.) They will resume on 121 for one, needing a further 255 runs for victory on a strange pitch that behaved far better yesterday than on the second day. South Africa are still healthy favourites \u2013 I\u2019d give England a one in five chance \u2013 but both sides will be conscious of recent history: England at Headingley in August and South Africa against Kusal Perera in February. Whatever happens, there will be moments today when we\u2019ll all feel alive, and there won\u2019t be a serum in sight. We might need the Cognac, though.",

      "body": "<p>The European commission has been accused of seeking to cut EU funding for the continent\u2019s poorest people by 50% to secure post-Brexit cost savings and extra funds for defence projects.</p> <p>Jacques Vandenschrik, the president of the European Food Banks Federation, said the EU executive\u2019s proposed spending plans for the next seven years posed a risk not only to the most vulnerable but to the stability of wider society.</p> <p>EU institutions are currently hammering out the details of the bloc\u2019s long-term budget, known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF). The UK\u2019s withdrawal will leave a large hole to plug. Senior EU officials have described the negotiations over the commission\u2019s proposed \u20ac1,135bn (\u00a3970bn) in spending commitments as the most difficult ever undertaken.</p> <p>The current budget ending in 2020 contained a \u20ac3.8bn fund for European aid to the most deprived (FEAD) to help EU member states provide people with food and basic supplies such as clothing, shoes, soap and shampoo.</p> <p>Under the proposed 2021-27 budget there would be no such dedicated fund but member states would be asked to devote a minimum of \u20ac2bn in total to food and basic material assistance. The commission has said it hopes member states will allocate twice that minimum amount \u2013 but there would not be any obligation.</p> <p>Vandenschrik, whose organisation helps food banks across Europe to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/18/less-than-1-of-surplus-food-from-farms-and-manufacturers-used-to-feed-hungry\">distribute surplus produce</a> to where it is most needed with the assistance of cash from FEAD, said the commission\u2019s proposal was a \u201cfalse economy\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI think we must do better for the poorest of the poor. We cannot accept that we must deliver half or 60% of the food that they receive now. The explanation is that the overall budget of Europe needs to be tightened up. Brexit is one of the arguments.

      "bodyText": "The European commission has been accused of seeking to cut EU funding for the continent\u2019s poorest people by 50% to secure post-Brexit cost savings and extra funds for defence projects. Jacques Vandenschrik, the president of the European Food Banks Federation, said the EU executive\u2019s proposed spending plans for the next seven years posed a risk not only to the most vulnerable but to the stability of wider society. EU institutions are currently hammering out the details of the bloc\u2019s long-term budget, known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF). The UK\u2019s withdrawal will leave a large hole to plug. Senior EU officials have described the negotiations over the commission\u2019s proposed \u20ac1,135bn (\u00a3970bn) in spending commitments as the most difficult ever undertaken. The current budget ending in 2020 contained a \u20ac3.8bn fund for European aid to the most deprived (FEAD) to help EU member states provide people with food and basic supplies such as clothing, shoes, soap and shampoo. Under the proposed 2021-27 budget there would be no such dedicated fund but member states would be asked to devote a minimum of \u20ac2bn in total to food and basic material assistance. The commission has said it hopes member states will allocate twice that minimum amount \u2013 but there would not be any obligation. Vandenschrik, whose organisation helps food banks across Europe to distribute surplus produce to where it is most needed with the assistance of cash from FEAD, said the commission\u2019s proposal was a \u201cfalse economy\u201d. He said: \u201cI think we must do better for the poorest of the poor. We cannot accept that we must deliver half or 60% of the food that they receive now. The explanation is that the overall budget of Europe needs to be tightened up. Brexit is one of the arguments. The other is the need for the strengthening of the defence of Europe. But this will have an impact on health and social cohesion. It is a false economy to save on the poor. \u201cIt is far better to increase their purchase power by giving them food so that the little money they don\u2019t spend on food they can spend on the economy.\u201d The commission wants to spend \u20ac13bn on a European defence fund to coordinate research and investment after calls from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for greater EU military independence from the US. The UK paid about \u00a315.5bn into the EU budget in 2018. Food banks represented by Vandenschrik\u2019s umbrella organisation fed 9.5 million people in 2018 and distributed 781,00 tonnes of food, equating to 4.3m meals a day. Vandenschrik said the poorest people in eastern European member states would probably be hit hardest by the commission\u2019s proposals. About 33.1 million people or 6.6% of the EU population are estimated to be living in severe material deprivation. Vandenschrik said: \u201cThe consequences will be an increase in instability and incivility. If people and their children are hungry, they will make plans. And this might not be very nice for society. We cannot make progress by leaving the poor on the side. This is not the way to make our society better.\u201d A commission spokeswoman said it would be \u201cvigilant\u201d in encouraging member states to hit the target of spending \u20ac4bn on the most deprived. She said: \u201cFollowing an impact assessment, the commission proposed to merge the fund for European aid to the most deprived into the new European social fund plus for the EU\u2019s budget of 2021-2027 to ensure better synergies between the two funds. \u201cThe commission has proposed an EU-level target of 4% of the European social fund plus\u2019s budget of \u20ac100bn in shared management to address material deprivation, which would mean the amount is similar to the current FEAD budget [of \u20ac3.8bn]. The commission is confident that this target amount of funding will be programmed by member states and the commission will be vigilant in ensuring this.\u201d The spokeswoman added: \u201cMember states experience different degrees of poverty and social exclusion, and several member states are expected to maintain more than 5% of funds available for the support to the most deprived.

Weiss set up Glossier when she was just 29, and in its short lifetime \u2013 she is now 34 \u2013 the brand has become culturally pertinent and financially impressive. In March 2019, Glossier was valued at $1.2bn, turning Weiss into one of the rare female founders and CEOs of a unicorn company. The majority of Glossier sales are digital and its business thrives on its devoted online community, but it has two permanent stores, in Los Angeles and New York, where it has its HQ, and it occasionally opens hype-inducing temporary pop-ups, like the one we are in now. In the soft-corporate language that hangs around like fragrant perfume, we are not in a shop, but having an \u201cexperience\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ec5eac5ac908612dd5fa6e2de120a8459766fab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ec5eac5ac908612dd5fa6e2de120a8459766fab/0_0_5340_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We think about hospitality rather than traditional sales\u2019: customers trying on makeup crowd a Glossier pop-up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We think about hospitality rather than traditional sales\u2019: customers trying on makeup crowd a Glossier pop-up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the visitors have gone, I sit down with Weiss in a corner of the room, encased in yellow flowers. She is erudite and thoughtful, and very good at talking, particularly when it comes to the brand she built up from four products to this. She points out that there are still only 36 Glossier products. Its minimalism is a canny part of its identity, making everything seem essential. \u201cIf you look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/sephora-to-shut-us-stores-for-diversity-training-after-sza-racial-profiling-claim\" title=\"\">Sephora</a>, for example, they have 12,000,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cThis is a different kind of beauty experience. You don\u2019t need a store this big for 36 products. We could do this in a vending machine.\u201d</p> <p>So why do it at all?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more about the beauty of coming in here and having it sound a certain way, smell a certain way, having an interaction with an editor who\u2019s fun or engaging,\u201d she says. Glossier staff are known as \u201coffline editors\u201d, and sport utilitarian pink boiler suits, wearing their gender pronouns on badges. \u201cOr it\u2019s about meeting someone in line waiting outside, who uses the same products or is from the same town or has the same hair and you talk about where you get it cut. It\u2019s really about bringing people together.\u201d</p> <p>People are the key to Weiss\u2019s vision, which has disrupted the traditional cosmetics industry business model and has set a new blueprint for success. She often talks about the \u201cdemocratisation\u201d of beauty, about how Glossier came up with its products by asking women what they wanted, rather than telling women what they needed. She built awareness through word-of-mouth on social media, and the community that lives for its famous pink bubblewrap bags, chic design and solid, functional basics is deeply loyal. The official Glossier account has 2.4m Instagram followers, but there are unofficial spinoffs, like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dogsofglossier/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Dogs of Glossier</a> (the shops are pet-friendly) and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glossierboyfriends/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Glossier Boyfriends</a> (bored partners posing with face creams). \u201cWe think a lot about hospitality rather than traditional sales,\u201d says Weiss. Her goal is for \u201cpeople to leave here and go to brunch the next day and be like, oh my God, I went to Glossier yesterday.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9c58bf4f0409bf8cd1a1b0c11944befac296af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c58bf4f0409bf8cd1a1b0c11944befac296af9/83_74_517_633/408.png\" alt=\"Simple pleasures: the less-is-more packaging of a Glossier mascara.\" width=\"408\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simple pleasures: the less-is-more packaging of a Glossier mascara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glossier</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though it may sound corny in theory, the strategy is clearly working. I thought my own expertise in cosmetics extended to which supermarket moisturiser doesn\u2019t give me spots, yet the cleverness of the brand is to insist that everyone is its target audience, even me. It is almost subliminal; it turns out I have plenty of Glossier in my makeup bag. A friend recently reminded me that the only beauty product she\u2019d ever heard me talk about was Glossier\u2019s Boy Brow, a sort of pomade that plumps the eyebrows. I ask Weiss how she made that happen, without me even realising? She looks both pleased and patient. \u201cWith something like Boy Brow, we don\u2019t build the hype, we build the product,\u201d she insists. \u201cWe built the product based on listening.\u201d</p> <p>When she created Glossier,<em><strong> </strong></em>Weiss was running a cult beauty blog, <a href=\"https://intothegloss.com/\" title=\"\">Into the Gloss</a>, which she had set up while she was working as assistant to Elissa Santisi, the then style director at <em>US Vogue</em>. On Into the Gloss, Weiss regularly asked women to show her their beauty routines for The Top Shelf (a precursor to the now common <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/shelfie/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#shelfie</a>). She used the insights from hundreds of interviews \u2013 \u201cfrom Kim Kardashian to the girl with pink hair who worked at a coffee shop and had cool style\u201d \u2013 to build up an idea of what women might want from a cosmetics brand. She had noticed, in the case of Boy Brow, that women liked to style their eyebrows, but often found that brow gel was too crunchy. \u201cI\u2019m like, what if there were a product that deposited some colour, but wasn\u2019t crunchy, wasn\u2019t flaky, didn\u2019t separate your hairs so that you could see skin through it so much, beefed up your brows, made them look a little feathery?\u201d Last year, they sold a Boy Brow every 32 seconds.</p> <p>When Weiss was rummaging through bathroom cabinets, she recognised that all the women she met shared a certain sense of shame when it came to their beauty routines. \u201cI realised how sheepish otherwise very confident women were about beauty,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s indicative of some sort of societal conditioning and beliefs that admitting to liking beauty must mean you\u2019re frivolous or not very bright or can\u2019t be taken seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Does she really think that attitude still persists? \u201cFor sure. You can look to someone like Kim Kardashian, and look at how much people will dismiss her as a business person, probably in part because \u2013 does she wear a blazer, and show up as a business person?\u201d Weiss is wearing a blazer, with big, stompy biker boots; she looks like a business person, but also like you\u2019re meeting an extremely well put-together friend for lunch. \u201cSo I think that the standards and the norms are changing, but there are still a lot of micro-judgments passed on women, based on how they look.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2132acd9bc64852cc9dc4f6824d946875dc8b632\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2132acd9bc64852cc9dc4f6824d946875dc8b632/0_177_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flower power: a Glossier store in London\u2019s Covent Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flower power: a Glossier store in London\u2019s Covent Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Veerle Evens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At <em>Vogue</em>, Weiss noticed something else while backstage at shoots and fashion shows. \u201cOne of the things I realised really early was that at every makeup artist\u2019s table, they\u2019d lay out all their products from their kit, and almost half of the stuff was skincare.\u201d She passed this on to her friends and Into the Gloss readers. \u201cIn order for your makeup to look better, start with a skincare routine. Even my friends were like, \u2018Oh if I want to look good, I\u2019ll just put on a bunch of makeup.\u2019 I really wanted to help people understand that that was a way to start a step earlier.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Weiss if she thinks Glossier is responsible for the rise of no-makeup makeup, the barely-there look. \u201cI think some of that might be from what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d she says, carefully. \u201cI also think that\u2019s the way the world is moving. People are spending more time on making social media content, and less time doing full faces of makeup, because there\u2019s a new filter every day that can give you a new look.\u201d Makeup sales, she says, have flatlined in the US, while skincare sales are rising. Glossier, with its early focus on skincare and its positive, you-look-good affirmations, is already in the perfect place.</p> <p>Weiss grew up in Connecticut, within commuter distance of New York City; her father was in business, her mother a stay-at-home mum. \u201cI have always really liked fashion, but it was totally inaccessible for me. I didn\u2019t grow up with money to go buy designer clothes,\u201d she says. She babysat for a neighbour who worked for Ralph Lauren, and when she was 15, asked if she could intern at the company.</p> <p>Later, she studied art at New York University, interned at Chanel, then at <em>Teen Vogue</em>. She appeared on a couple of episodes of early reality show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/08/the-hills-10-years-on-reality-tv-hollywood-towie-made-in-chelsea-kardashians\" title=\"\">The Hills</a></em>. When she graduated she became a fashion assistant at <em>W </em>magazine, then went to <em>Vogue</em>. She was still at <em>Vogue</em> when Into the Gloss began to look like a success. She was running the site between 4am and 8am and eventually had a choice to make.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a real fork-in-the-road moment where I just couldn\u2019t do both,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI felt like I just had to take a leap.\u201d Was that scary? \u201cNot really,\u201d she shrugs.</p> <p>I wonder how much the $1.2bn valuation of Glossier, which now employs 200 people, changed things for Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but the responsibility is to our customers and our community,\u201d she says, impeccably on message. She admits it\u2019s different to how it was just five years ago, when they were 10 people in an office, preparing to press go on the early Glossier site, which had just four products to sell. \u201cWe had no idea if anyone would even care. So here you are sitting with a year\u2019s worth of work and products and, you know, heart and soul and sweat and tears. How are the stakes any less high than that?\u201d</p> <p>Is she good under pressure? \u201cI think so. I have a very normal everyday life. I hang out with friends from college and we go on vacation together.\u201d My knowledge of life as a CEO is drawn almost exclusively from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/10/breath-of-fresh-heir-how-succession-became-the-must-watch-tv-of-the-year\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em> and those \u201chow I do it\u201d diaries where executives talk of moon dust smoothies and 3am workouts, but Weiss says it\u2019s not like that at all. \u201cOn Fridays I go to my friend\u2019s apartment and we make pizzas with her two-year-old. I\u2019m in my mid-30s, so I make sure I\u2019m taking care of my body, but I\u2019m not a maniacal fitness person. That\u2019s never going to be me. I kind of just go to work and go home.\u201d</p> <p>A few days before we met, Weiss was named as one of <em>Time</em> magazine\u2019s Next 100; they called her \u201cone of her generation\u2019s great disruptors\u201d and she was asked to give a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcv6MUlIHDw\" title=\"\">speech</a>. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d she admits. She spoke about how the beauty industry had \u201chistorically made people, mostly women, feel they aren\u2019t enough\u201d, and spoke brightly of today\u2019s \u201ccourageous, resilient, unflappable\u201d teenage girls. \u201cTo girls everywhere, may you know how much power you have to change the world,\u201d she said, finishing her speech to great applause.</p> <p>The Emily Weiss I encounter today seems so unflappable that I assume she must have felt like a powerful teenage girl herself. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever asked me that.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI was not a popular kid. One of the things I\u2019m grateful to my parents for is that they always encouraged me to find my voice and didn\u2019t ever silence it. Even when teachers would say I was hyper,\u201d she laughs. \u201cOr, you know, kids would think I was too much.\u201d She seems momentarily reflective. \u201cWhat was your question? Did I feel powerful? I think I probably did, for those reasons, even when I felt like people, or society, were trying to keep that down.\u201d</p> <p>The Glossier aesthetic,<em><strong> </strong></em>if you could sum it up, is a dewy glow, a kind of low radiance, to look as if you\u2019ve just come in from a crisp winter\u2019s walk, or an afternoon in the sun. In her essay <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour\" title=\"\">Always be Optimizing</a></em>, the writer Jia Tolentino cites Glossier as an example of the way we \u201cidealise beauty that appears to require almost no intervention\u201d; in many ways, you can argue that the \u201cnatural\u201d look is harder to attain if one is not naturally beautiful to begin with.</p> <p>But Weiss is nothing if not ambitious; she wants to redefine the concept of beauty itself. She returns to the shame women felt when they were showing her their products for Into the Gloss. \u201cThere is judgment or narrow-mindedness about beauty, and what that word even means. I don\u2019t think beauty is something anyone should feel ashamed about appreciating or acknowledging or demonstrating or embodying, and it has very little to do with looks at all. I think it has to do with your lived experience.\u201d</p> <p>As the days pass, more and more of my friends who live and work in the city start to mention they\u2019ve been to the pop-up. They have diverted long runs to pass by, or sent in boyfriends for gifts, or spent their lunch breaks queuing, just to see what it\u2019s like inside. They all want to have the experience. They all want to feel that they look good.</p>",

People are spending more time on making social media content, and less time doing full faces of makeup, because there\u2019s a new filter every day that can give you a new look.\u201d Makeup sales, she says, have flatlined in the US, while skincare sales are rising. Glossier, with its early focus on skincare and its positive, you-look-good affirmations, is already in the perfect place. Weiss grew up in Connecticut, within commuter distance of New York City; her father was in business, her mother a stay-at-home mum. \u201cI have always really liked fashion, but it was totally inaccessible for me. I didn\u2019t grow up with money to go buy designer clothes,\u201d she says. She babysat for a neighbour who worked for Ralph Lauren, and when she was 15, asked if she could intern at the company. Later, she studied art at New York University, interned at Chanel, then at Teen Vogue. She appeared on a couple of episodes of early reality show The Hills. When she graduated she became a fashion assistant at W magazine, then went to Vogue. She was still at Vogue when Into the Gloss began to look like a success. She was running the site between 4am and 8am and eventually had a choice to make. \u201cThere was a real fork-in-the-road moment where I just couldn\u2019t do both,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI felt like I just had to take a leap.\u201d Was that scary? \u201cNot really,\u201d she shrugs. I wonder how much the $1.2bn valuation of Glossier, which now employs 200 people, changed things for Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but the responsibility is to our customers and our community,\u201d she says, impeccably on message. She admits it\u2019s different to how it was just five years ago, when they were 10 people in an office, preparing to press go on the early Glossier site, which had just four products to sell. \u201cWe had no idea if anyone would even care. So here you are sitting with a year\u2019s worth of work and products and, you know, heart and soul and sweat and tears. How are the stakes any less high than that?\u201d Is she good under pressure? \u201cI think so. I have a very normal everyday life. I hang out with friends from college and we go on vacation together.\u201d My knowledge of life as a CEO is drawn almost exclusively from Succession and those \u201chow I do it\u201d diaries where executives talk of moon dust smoothies and 3am workouts, but Weiss says it\u2019s not like that at all. \u201cOn Fridays I go to my friend\u2019s apartment and we make pizzas with her two-year-old. I\u2019m in my mid-30s, so I make sure I\u2019m taking care of my body, but I\u2019m not a maniacal fitness person. That\u2019s never going to be me. I kind of just go to work and go home.\u201d A few days before we met, Weiss was named as one of Time magazine\u2019s Next 100; they called her \u201cone of her generation\u2019s great disruptors\u201d and she was asked to give a speech. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d she admits. She spoke about how the beauty industry had \u201chistorically made people, mostly women, feel they aren\u2019t enough\u201d, and spoke brightly of today\u2019s \u201ccourageous, resilient, unflappable\u201d teenage girls. \u201cTo girls everywhere, may you know how much power you have to change the world,\u201d she said, finishing her speech to great applause. The Emily Weiss I encounter today seems so unflappable that I assume she must have felt like a powerful teenage girl herself. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever asked me that.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI was not a popular kid. One of the things I\u2019m grateful to my parents for is that they always encouraged me to find my voice and didn\u2019t ever silence it. Even when teachers would say I was hyper,\u201d she laughs. \u201cOr, you know, kids would think I was too much.\u201d She seems momentarily reflective. \u201cWhat was your question? Did I feel powerful? I think I probably did, for those reasons, even when I felt like people, or society, were trying to keep that down.\u201d The Glossier aesthetic, if you could sum it up, is a dewy glow, a kind of low radiance, to look as if you\u2019ve just come in from a crisp winter\u2019s walk, or an afternoon in the sun. In her essay Always be Optimizing, the writer Jia Tolentino cites Glossier as an example of the way we \u201cidealise beauty that appears to require almost no intervention\u201d; in many ways, you can argue that the \u201cnatural\u201d look is harder to attain if one is not naturally beautiful to begin with. But Weiss is nothing if not ambitious; she wants to redefine the concept of beauty itself. She returns to the shame women felt when they were showing her their products for Into the Gloss. \u201cThere is judgment or narrow-mindedness about beauty, and what that word even means. I don\u2019t think beauty is something anyone should feel ashamed about appreciating or acknowledging or demonstrating or embodying, and it has very little to do with looks at all. I think it has to do with your lived experience.\u201d As the days pass, more and more of my friends who live and work in the city start to mention they\u2019ve been to the pop-up. They have diverted long runs to pass by, or sent in boyfriends for gifts, or spent their lunch breaks queuing, just to see what it\u2019s like inside. They all want to have the experience. They all want to feel that they look good.",

Conservatoires and specialist music schools have come under scrutiny. Individuals at every level have been reprimanded, including top opera stars, starting \u2013 amid great upset \u2013 with the veteran tenor-turned-baritone Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. His long and glorious career is over in the States, but European houses still welcome him, wanting more proof to substantiate allegations. He is still due to sing at the Royal Opera House in 2020, where the 42-year-old Italian star tenor Vittorio Grigolo has been suspended following an incident on tour with the company in Japan. This is an unfolding story of endemic sexual abuse across the industry, and how to establish a way forward. Artistically, the Royal Opera has had a gilded year, with a string of triumphs: K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1, Agrippina, Death in Venice among them. So too have our regional companies: Welsh National Opera\u2019s ambitious Freedom season provoked thought.

English Touring Opera, doing sterling work on the tightest budget, encouraged singers from around the country to join them in Kurt Weill\u2019s The Silver Lake, paired with deft and lively Mozart (The Seraglio). English National Opera raised hopes for the future with the appointment of Annilese Miskimmon as artistic director. Companies away from the mainstream continue to make inroads: east London\u2019s Grimeborn festival, based at the Arcola theatre, had a bumper season. Shadwell Opera made a mark with Eight Songs for a Mad King. The Manchester Collective showed how streamlined musicians can bring adventure to concert life.

He suggested the climate could be changing because of a shift in Earth\u2019s axis.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody really knows the causes of climate change, at least global climate change,\u201d he said, adding that people should nevertheless make their \u201cbest efforts to prevent dramatic changes in the climate\u201d.</p>",

Light flurries have fallen in Moscow and its parks are dusted white, but most of the snow in the city centre has melted. The country virtually shuts down for more than a week after the new year, as Russians eat and drink their way through early January with ample time to recover before returning to work. This year, Moscow has closed down central avenues near the Kremlin and is erecting large soundstages for concerts during the holiday. The warm temperatures have kept Russians off cross-country skis and skating ponds, with children playing football in the courtyard rinks that usually host hockey matches at this time of year. One popular meme showed cupfuls of snow being sold for 50 rubles, or 62p. Alexei Navalny, an opposition politician, wrote that he thought it was a joke when he heard about the deliveries of snow. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with [bringing in snow],\u201d said Alexander, who was dressed up as Ded Moroz, or Father Frost, in robes of radiant indigo and a flowing white beard. \u201c[The government] is doing what it has to in order for people to have a nice celebration. I think they did the right thing.\u201d At an ice skating show just off of Tverskaya Street, Elena Karavayeva, 45, said she couldn\u2019t remember a year when there had been no snow at all before the new year. \u201cIt will be a sad new year without it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d plan to take the kids to the park, and let them play on their sleds, but I guess we\u2019ll have to come up with something else.\u201d City officials said the artificial snow had been brought in for a snowboarding demonstration that will begin on New Year\u2019s Day. The snow was produced by cutting ice for a local skating rink, said Alexei Nemeryuk, the head of Moscow\u2019s trade and services department. \u201cThe machines are cutting snow anyway and some remains. It is usually melted down, but in this case we have used it again,\u201d he told the Govorit Moskva radio station. Russia is a signatory to the Paris agreement to combat global heating, and Vladimir Putin said during a televised press conference last week that the crisis was a direct threat to Russia. The country was warming 2.5 times faster than the average for the planet, he noted. At the same time, Russia recently abandoned plans to set greenhouse-gas emissions targets for business after lobbying by a powerful Russian industry association. In his remarks, Putin cast doubt on the science, however, and omitted any discussion of greenhouse gases. He suggested the climate could be changing because of a shift in Earth\u2019s axis. \u201cNobody really knows the causes of climate change, at least global climate change,\u201d he said, adding that people should nevertheless make their \u201cbest efforts to prevent dramatic changes in the climate\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Will 2019 be remembered as the year in which climate change denial was defeated? The <a href=\"https://globalclimatestrike.net/\">global climate strike</a>, Greta Thunberg\u2019s meteoric rise to <a href=\"https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/\">international prominence</a>, as well as several high-profile international <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/cop25\">conferences</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/\">reports</a> \u2013 all contributed in putting climate skeptics on the back foot.</p> <p>Even Donald Trump, who previously claimed that the climate crisis was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/12/trump-climate-timeline/\">hoax</a>\u201d invented by China to hold back American industry, has recently begun to <a href=\"https://time.com/5622374/donald-trump-climate-change-hoax-event/\">brag</a> about all his administration has done to address it. Following suit, the rest of his party is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/climate/republicans-climate-change-policies.html\">scrambling</a> to develop a coherent environmental platform, more in line with their electoral base\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-poll-republicans/surge-in-young-republicans-worried-about-the-environment-survey-idUSKCN1VJ17V\">shifting views</a>.</p> <p>But the next steps in the global fight against the climate crisis remain far from clear. In the speech she delivered to US Congress in September, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2019/09/22/no-one-seemed-to-notice-greta-thunbergs-critique-of-the-green-new-deal/#dc7454938dae\">Thunberg</a> maintained: \u201cNo matter how political the background to this crisis may be, we must not allow it to become a partisan political question. The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics. And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents. Our main enemy is physics.\u201d</p> <p>While Thunberg\u2019s intention was evidently to preserve the environmental movement\u2019s unity and common resolve, this may paradoxically soon start to look like a new form of climate denial. As the issue rises to the top of everyone\u2019s agenda, several difficult questions which were previously kept in the background \u2013 or indeed actively suppressed \u2013 by the environmental movement are becoming impossible to ignore.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The environmental movement is going to have to become more, not less, politicized, to keep up the momentum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For one, no one seems quite clear what is the <em>ultimate</em> <em>goal</em> of the global fight against the climate crisis. Is it merely to enable constant economic growth in a sustainable way, or is it about imposing limits on humanity\u2019s ambitions, in pursuit of a more harmonious relationship with nature?</p> <p>Even assuming that question can be settled, it remains to be determined what is the relationship \u2013 and whether there are any tradeoffs \u2013 between environmentalism\u2019s overarching goal(s) and other potentially desirable ends, such as personal freedom, distributive justice and respect for established traditions and ways of life.</p> <p>Then there is the issue of <em>means</em>. Whether humanity chooses to fight the climate crisis through centralized, state-based efforts, decentralized market mechanisms, or individual and community-level changes in lifestyle has profound political and distributional consequences. So, it matters what decisions are made in this respect.</p> <p>Finally, even the relevant temporal horizon remains open to disagreement. Should we care about what happens in 10,000 years? A few generations? Or the immediate 20 years?</p> <p>Far from having straightforward answers, all these questions are inherently political, since they point to deep conflicts in values and interests. They delineate the contours of a new \u201cpolitics of environmentalism\u201d that is beginning to take shape as climate change rises to the top of humanity\u2019s present concerns.</p> <p>We already see this new politics taking shape in emergent debates over competing proposals for addressing the climate crisis. Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\u2019s respective versions of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/climate/green-new-deal-questions-answers.html\">Green New Deal</a> are very different from the proposal for a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a> recently put forward by the new president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen.</p> <p>The first approach wants to connect the issue of the climate crisis with social justice, and advocates for a massive expansion in the role of the state to manage the transition to renewable energy. The second approach treats the issue of the climate crisis in isolation from other social and political issues, and proposes market rather than state mechanisms to address it.</p> <p>Nor are these the only two options on the table. Another prominent strand of contemporary environmentalism is the one heralded by Pope Francis in the 2015 encyclical letter <em><a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">Laudato Si</a></em>, which folds the struggle against the climate crisis into a broader critique of the \u201cmodern myth of unlimited material progress\u201d on the basis of a religiously inspired conception of the inherent rights of the \u201cnatural order\u201d.</p> <p>While this chimes with radical ecology\u2019s longstanding commitment to the idea of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.degrowth.info/en/catalogue-entry/deep-ecology-as-a-philosophical-basis-of-degrowth/\">de-growth</a>\u201d, it is also compatible with classical conservatism\u2019s critique of modernity, which has traditionally stigmatized the hubris in humanity\u2019s dream of complete domination over nature. Several ideas contained in the pope\u2019s encyclical have in fact been taken up by more conservatively minded political and religious organizations, in an attempt to give greater resonance to the conceptual affinity between political conservatism and natural <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/435615-conservation-remains-a-core-conservative-principle\">conservation</a>.</p> <p>Even some strands of the nativist far right have begun to develop their own brand of environmentalism. The French <em>Rassemblement National</em>\u2019s leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/french-national-front-launches-nationalist-environmental-movement\">Marine Le Pen</a>, has sought to connect the problem of environmental degradation with her party\u2019s broader opposition to globalization and immigration. This translates into a form of \u201c<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/green-nationalism-how-the-far-right-could-learn-to-love-the-environment-76035\">green nationalism</a>\u201d focused on the protection of local cultures, products and traditions.</p> <p>This growing diversification of environmental positions is a sign that the movement as a whole is maturing. Environmentalists of all stripes are realizing that there remain important political decisions to be made even after climate crisis denial has been defeated.</p> <p>These decisions cannot be taken by purely technical or scientific means. On the contrary, the fact that the environmental movement has so far remained the preserve of a small technocratic elite has done more to invite populist backlashes than to further its own goals.</p> <p>It is a good thing that all the available options are now being laid bare, in order to better assess their relative merits in an open and democratic way.

      "bodyText": "Will 2019 be remembered as the year in which climate change denial was defeated? The global climate strike, Greta Thunberg\u2019s meteoric rise to international prominence, as well as several high-profile international conferences and reports \u2013 all contributed in putting climate skeptics on the back foot. Even Donald Trump, who previously claimed that the climate crisis was a \u201choax\u201d invented by China to hold back American industry, has recently begun to brag about all his administration has done to address it. Following suit, the rest of his party is scrambling to develop a coherent environmental platform, more in line with their electoral base\u2019s shifting views. But the next steps in the global fight against the climate crisis remain far from clear. In the speech she delivered to US Congress in September, Thunberg maintained: \u201cNo matter how political the background to this crisis may be, we must not allow it to become a partisan political question. The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics. And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents. Our main enemy is physics.\u201d While Thunberg\u2019s intention was evidently to preserve the environmental movement\u2019s unity and common resolve, this may paradoxically soon start to look like a new form of climate denial. As the issue rises to the top of everyone\u2019s agenda, several difficult questions which were previously kept in the background \u2013 or indeed actively suppressed \u2013 by the environmental movement are becoming impossible to ignore. For one, no one seems quite clear what is the ultimate goal of the global fight against the climate crisis. Is it merely to enable constant economic growth in a sustainable way, or is it about imposing limits on humanity\u2019s ambitions, in pursuit of a more harmonious relationship with nature? Even assuming that question can be settled, it remains to be determined what is the relationship \u2013 and whether there are any tradeoffs \u2013 between environmentalism\u2019s overarching goal(s) and other potentially desirable ends, such as personal freedom, distributive justice and respect for established traditions and ways of life. Then there is the issue of means. Whether humanity chooses to fight the climate crisis through centralized, state-based efforts, decentralized market mechanisms, or individual and community-level changes in lifestyle has profound political and distributional consequences. So, it matters what decisions are made in this respect. Finally, even the relevant temporal horizon remains open to disagreement. Should we care about what happens in 10,000 years? A few generations? Or the immediate 20 years? Far from having straightforward answers, all these questions are inherently political, since they point to deep conflicts in values and interests. They delineate the contours of a new \u201cpolitics of environmentalism\u201d that is beginning to take shape as climate change rises to the top of humanity\u2019s present concerns. We already see this new politics taking shape in emergent debates over competing proposals for addressing the climate crisis. Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\u2019s respective versions of the Green New Deal are very different from the proposal for a European Green Deal recently put forward by the new president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The first approach wants to connect the issue of the climate crisis with social justice, and advocates for a massive expansion in the role of the state to manage the transition to renewable energy. The second approach treats the issue of the climate crisis in isolation from other social and political issues, and proposes market rather than state mechanisms to address it. Nor are these the only two options on the table. Another prominent strand of contemporary environmentalism is the one heralded by Pope Francis in the 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si, which folds the struggle against the climate crisis into a broader critique of the \u201cmodern myth of unlimited material progress\u201d on the basis of a religiously inspired conception of the inherent rights of the \u201cnatural order\u201d. While this chimes with radical ecology\u2019s longstanding commitment to the idea of \u201cde-growth\u201d, it is also compatible with classical conservatism\u2019s critique of modernity, which has traditionally stigmatized the hubris in humanity\u2019s dream of complete domination over nature. Several ideas contained in the pope\u2019s encyclical have in fact been taken up by more conservatively minded political and religious organizations, in an attempt to give greater resonance to the conceptual affinity between political conservatism and natural conservation. Even some strands of the nativist far right have begun to develop their own brand of environmentalism. The French Rassemblement National\u2019s leader, Marine Le Pen, has sought to connect the problem of environmental degradation with her party\u2019s broader opposition to globalization and immigration. This translates into a form of \u201cgreen nationalism\u201d focused on the protection of local cultures, products and traditions. This growing diversification of environmental positions is a sign that the movement as a whole is maturing. Environmentalists of all stripes are realizing that there remain important political decisions to be made even after climate crisis denial has been defeated. These decisions cannot be taken by purely technical or scientific means. On the contrary, the fact that the environmental movement has so far remained the preserve of a small technocratic elite has done more to invite populist backlashes than to further its own goals. It is a good thing that all the available options are now being laid bare, in order to better assess their relative merits in an open and democratic way. Whether we like it or not, the environmental movement is going to have to become more, not less, politicized, to keep up the momentum it has acquired so far.

He was a renaissance man. His generosity and brilliance in person \u2013 felt by everyone who knew him even a little \u2013 were a source of astonishing and liberating warmth. The few times I met him in life, he was all these things in a unique combination of polite, frank, detached (or maybe more truly differently attached), sanguine, many-voiced, wise, warm, kind, hilarious, acutely truth-telling, uncompromisingly articulate.\u201d</p> <p>Gray came to fiction late, publishing his first novel Lanark at the age of 46 in 1981. A experimental, pornographic fantasy \u2013 1982, Janine \u2013 followed three years later, with his rambunctious reworking of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Poor Things, appearing in 1992. As his literary reputation increased, winning both the Guardian fiction prize and the Whitbread novel award in 1992, the elaborate illustrations he created for his books began to draw attention to the pictorial art Gray had been producing all along. The stream of commissions for murals and portraits gradually increased, and he finished his career as one of Scotland\u2019s most admired and versatile artists.</p> <p>Born in the northeast of Glasgow in 1934, Gray was brought up on an estate the writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/20/art.fiction\">once described</a> as \u201cone of the earliest and most posh of the municipal housing schemes\u201d, remembering the schoolteachers, printers and local civil servants who lived in his close. He studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art, and worked as a muralist, part-time art teacher and theatrical scene painter while writing scripts for TV and radio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/14/alasdair-gray-hate-anybody-scottish-edinburgh-book-festival\">Alasdair Gray: 'I don't hate anybody'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1954, Gray began writing the novel that would occupy him on and off throughout the 1960s and 70s. Lanark divides the story of a life into four books, alternating between Glasgow and a shadowy version of the city called Unthank. The novel opens with book three, in which a young man finds himself in a dark metropolis filled with strange diseases, and then jumps back to fill in the story of Duncan Thaw, who grows up in Glasgow just before the second world war. The Guardian called it \u201cfluent, imaginative\u201d, a novel \u201cof undeniable quality, but rare, and not for all tastes, like an oyster, or a truffle\u201d.</p> <p>This truffle was soon compared to Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, and was the making both of the author and his independent publisher, Canongate. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/fiction.alasdairgray\">Writing 20 years later</a>, Janice Galloway remembered how the novel\u2019s \u201cexuberant, at times despairing, always vivid voice\u201d made her feel \u201cacknowledged, spoken to, listened for\u201d. As Thaw suggests in the novel, Glasgow\u2019s magnificence had remained unnoticed, because \u201cif a city hasn\u2019t been used by an artist, not even the inhabitants live there imaginatively\u201d. Writers such as Galloway, Ian Rankin, Irvine Welsh and Ali Smith woke up to find their own world given back to them in fiction, and Scotland\u2019s cultural confidence enlarged.</p> <p>Gray followed it with 1982, Janine \u2013 an intricate sadomasochistic fantasy so typographically complex that the author insisted his contract contained provision for up to six rounds of proofs \u2013 before turning to a more conventional realism for three novels exploring nationalism and power. Poor Things, a patchwork of Victorian fragments, returned to tricksier territory, charting Bella Baxter\u2019s rise from the creation of gifted surgeon Godwin Bysshe Baxter to become her own woman.

      "bodyText": "The writer and artist Alasdair Gray, who blazed a trail for contemporary Scottish fiction with his experimental novels, has died aged 85. Gray\u2019s publisher Canongate announced the news on Sunday, saying he died early in the morning after being hospitalised for a short illness in his home city of Glasgow. In a statement, Gray\u2019s family thanked his friends and hospital staff, calling him \u201can extraordinary person; very talented and, even more importantly, very humane\u201d. Among those to pay tribute were author Val McDermid, who credited Gray for having \u201ctransformed our expectations of what Scottish literature could be\u201d, and Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called him \u201cone of Scotland\u2019s literary giants, and a decent, principled human being.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be remembered best for the masterpiece that is Lanark, but everything he wrote reflected his brilliance,\u201d she added on Twitter. \u201cToday, we mourn the loss of a genius, and think of his family.\u201d The novelist Ali Smith called Gray \u201ca modern-day William Blake\u201d and said: \u201cHe was an artist in every form. He was a renaissance man. His generosity and brilliance in person \u2013 felt by everyone who knew him even a little \u2013 were a source of astonishing and liberating warmth. The few times I met him in life, he was all these things in a unique combination of polite, frank, detached (or maybe more truly differently attached), sanguine, many-voiced, wise, warm, kind, hilarious, acutely truth-telling, uncompromisingly articulate.\u201d Gray came to fiction late, publishing his first novel Lanark at the age of 46 in 1981. A experimental, pornographic fantasy \u2013 1982, Janine \u2013 followed three years later, with his rambunctious reworking of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Poor Things, appearing in 1992. As his literary reputation increased, winning both the Guardian fiction prize and the Whitbread novel award in 1992, the elaborate illustrations he created for his books began to draw attention to the pictorial art Gray had been producing all along. The stream of commissions for murals and portraits gradually increased, and he finished his career as one of Scotland\u2019s most admired and versatile artists. Born in the northeast of Glasgow in 1934, Gray was brought up on an estate the writer once described as \u201cone of the earliest and most posh of the municipal housing schemes\u201d, remembering the schoolteachers, printers and local civil servants who lived in his close. He studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art, and worked as a muralist, part-time art teacher and theatrical scene painter while writing scripts for TV and radio. In 1954, Gray began writing the novel that would occupy him on and off throughout the 1960s and 70s. Lanark divides the story of a life into four books, alternating between Glasgow and a shadowy version of the city called Unthank. The novel opens with book three, in which a young man finds himself in a dark metropolis filled with strange diseases, and then jumps back to fill in the story of Duncan Thaw, who grows up in Glasgow just before the second world war. The Guardian called it \u201cfluent, imaginative\u201d, a novel \u201cof undeniable quality, but rare, and not for all tastes, like an oyster, or a truffle\u201d. This truffle was soon compared to Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, and was the making both of the author and his independent publisher, Canongate. Writing 20 years later, Janice Galloway remembered how the novel\u2019s \u201cexuberant, at times despairing, always vivid voice\u201d made her feel \u201cacknowledged, spoken to, listened for\u201d. As Thaw suggests in the novel, Glasgow\u2019s magnificence had remained unnoticed, because \u201cif a city hasn\u2019t been used by an artist, not even the inhabitants live there imaginatively\u201d. Writers such as Galloway, Ian Rankin, Irvine Welsh and Ali Smith woke up to find their own world given back to them in fiction, and Scotland\u2019s cultural confidence enlarged. Gray followed it with 1982, Janine \u2013 an intricate sadomasochistic fantasy so typographically complex that the author insisted his contract contained provision for up to six rounds of proofs \u2013 before turning to a more conventional realism for three novels exploring nationalism and power. Poor Things, a patchwork of Victorian fragments, returned to tricksier territory, charting Bella Baxter\u2019s rise from the creation of gifted surgeon Godwin Bysshe Baxter to become her own woman. The Guardian hailed it as \u201ca bibliophile\u2019s paradise of postmodern precision\u201d and awarded Gray its 1992 fiction prize. As his public profile began to rise, Gray began to publicly support Scottish independence, publishing a short polemic called Why Scots Should Rule Scotland in time for the 1992 election. Devolution was never enough for the author, who agreed with Margaret Thatcher when she claimed Tony Blair as her greatest achievement. \u201cLike US citizens,\u201d Gray argued, \u201cthe UK electorate has no chance of voting for a party that will do anything to seriously tax our enlarged millionaire class that controls Westminster.\u201d The steady stream of novels, short stories and non-fiction continued, including an illustrated translation of Dante\u2019s Inferno published in 2018. But alongside his writing, Gray carried on painting. Speaking to the Guardian in 2010 as he published a survey of his visual art, the author explained that since his parents had given him crayons and paper even before he could read, painting was perhaps more natural than writing, but \u201cone is always a tremendous holiday from the other\u201d. \u201cI feel healthier painting than writing,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause when you\u2019ve been writing a lot and your head is full of words, you are still muscularly not exhausted, but you\u2019re nervously exhausted, so in order to sleep you go out and drink heavily, unless you\u2019re more disciplined than I am.\u201d Gray confessed himself sometimes rather surprised by his own productiveness, despite what he called \u201cmy alcoholism\u201d, reflecting ruefully on how his life might have been changed if he had found financial success a little earlier in his career. \u201cI think I would have painted much more than I did,\u201d he said.",

Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a British-Australian academic, started an open-ended hunger strike six days ago in protest at being sentenced to 10 years on espionage charges. She wants at minimum to be moved from solitary confinement. She has been held in solitary since October 2018. Just before Christmas she wrote to the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, pleading for ministers to do more to secure her release. A spokesman for Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, Abbas Mousavi, rejected the flurry of publicity over her case and said Iran would not submit to political games or propaganda.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already undertaken one hunger strike in solidarity with Moore-Gilbert and has said she will start another before New Year\u2019s Eve. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed four years ago. A third dual national, Fariba Adelkhah, a French-Iranian academic, is also on hunger strike. The French government has summoned the Iranian ambassador over her detention.

The Iranian government says both academics were found guilty of espionage and that any interference by foreign governments will not help their case. Mousavi said: \u201cThe statement by France\u2019s foreign ministry regarding an Iranian national is an act of interference and we see their request to have no legal basis. \u201cThe individual in question [Adelkhah] is an Iranian national and has been arrested over acts of espionage.\u201d He said her lawyer had knowledge about the details of the case, which was being investigated.

Whatever you\u2019re planning to wear to eat them, however, know they are very much worth making yourself before you get changed \u2013 those ready-made rubber frisbees are no way to celebrate.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min, plus cooling and proofing </strong><br>Cook <strong>4 min a batch</strong><br>Makes <strong>About 35</strong></p> <p><strong>150ml milk</strong><br><strong>70g buckwheat flour</strong><br><strong>70g strong white flour</strong><br><strong>1 tsp salt</strong><br><strong>2 tsp caraway seeds </strong>(optional)<br><strong>2 eggs</strong><br><strong>4g dried yeast</strong><br><strong>100g soured cream</strong><br><strong>25g butter</strong>, for frying</p> <h2><strong>1 Start making the batter</strong></h2> <p>Heat the milk in a small pan until it\u2019s just below the boil. While it\u2019s heating, in a large bowl whisk the two flours (buckwheat gives blinis their characteristic nutty flavour, while the white flour keeps them nice and light) with the salt and caraway seeds, if using. Separate the eggs, and put the yolks in a small bowl and the whites in a large one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20a88b5736eb07c16195d62de47b1cb134feb222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20a88b5736eb07c16195d62de47b1cb134feb222/0_0_7751_7760/999.jpg\" alt=\"While the milk is heating, mix the flours, salt and caraway in a bowl\" width=\"999\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While the milk is heating, mix the flours, salt and caraway in a bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>2 Leave the hot milk to cool</strong></h2> <p>As soon as the milk begins to bubble, turn off the heat and leave it to cool down to blood temperature. This scalding helps to denature the whey proteins in the milk, which will ultimately make your blini fluffier, but if the milk is still too hot when you add the yeast, it will die, and render your efforts pointless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b93996656c1b99e39e7b5e91fb697fb4e759e4e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b93996656c1b99e39e7b5e91fb697fb4e759e4e3/0_0_7455_7761/961.jpg\" alt=\"Scald the milk before whisking in the yeast and egg yolks\" width=\"961\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scald the milk before whisking in the yeast and egg yolks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3 Add the yeast and egg yolks</strong></h2> <p>Stir the yeast into the warm milk, then whisk in the egg yolks and soured cream, mixing vigorously until they\u2019re well combined. Pour the milk mixture into the flour bowl, stirring as you do so, until you have a fairly smooth paste. Be careful not to overwork it once it\u2019s mixed, though, or your blinis will be tough.</p> <h2><strong>4 Leave the batter to prove</strong></h2> <p>Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and leave in a fairly warm, or at least not draughty, place for an hour or so, or until it looks spongy (it won\u2019t rise dramatically, but the batter should have grown slightly in the bowl, and there ought to be a few bubbles visible on the top.</p> <h2><strong>5 Add the egg whites and prove again</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca053f28b64cd5b48605566f4baac9852d557ebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca053f28b64cd5b48605566f4baac9852d557ebb/0_0_7021_6997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Once the batter has proved, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then fold into the batter, cover and leave to prove again for two hours\" width=\"1000\" height=\"997\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Once the batter has proved, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then fold into the batter, cover and leave to prove again for two hours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gently fold them into the batter mixture using a large metal spoon or a rubber spatula, being mindful to keep as much air in the mix as possible. Once they\u2019ve been well combined, cover the bowl again and leave for another two hours.</p> <h2><strong>6 Cook the blinis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9427ad3b93ece3d39b39f00757d031ffd5cf624d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9427ad3b93ece3d39b39f00757d031ffd5cf624d/0_409_8124_6555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fry spoonfuls of the blini batter in butter until golden on both sides, then add your topping of choice and eat warm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"807\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fry spoonfuls of the blini batter in butter until golden on both sides, then add your topping of choice and eat warm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once it\u2019s hot, drop teaspoonfuls of batter in batches into the pan, and cook them until bubbles rise to the surface and golden brown underneath. Carefully flip over and cook for another minute or so, until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining batter.</p> <h2><strong>7 Eat warm</strong></h2> <p>Blinis are best eaten warm from the pan, otherwise they can go rather stodgy, so either serve them in batches as you make them, or store them in a warm oven, wrapped in a tea towel to keep them soft, until you\u2019ve used up all the batter. They can also be frozen once cooked: defrost and microwave briefly to reheat.</p> <h2><strong>8 Serving suggestions</strong></h2> <p>The simplest way to serve blinis is topped with a dollop of soured cream and a few fish eggs or a curl of smoked fish or cooked meat, and perhaps a pinch of chopped chives or some freshly ground black pepper. Smoked mackerel, kipper or salmon pat\u00e9, or chunks of pickled herring are even simpler options.</p> <h2><strong>9 Vegetarian options</strong></h2> <p>Make a Finnish egg butter: boil two eggs for eight minutes, then peel and finely chop. Beat into 80g softened butter and season generously, then spread on blinis and top with capers or chopped cornichons. Or, for a more colourful choice, make a beetroot puree: whizz up four cooked beetroot with 100ml soured cream, add horseradish sauce or black pepper to taste, and finish with a little chopped dill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bb64c90bf4bd360b50cf5f22ff5799e1e81f13d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bb64c90bf4bd360b50cf5f22ff5799e1e81f13d/0_0_8235_8301/992.jpg\" alt=\"Make a Finnish egg butter, then spread on blinis and top with capers or chopped cornichons.

This scalding helps to denature the whey proteins in the milk, which will ultimately make your blini fluffier, but if the milk is still too hot when you add the yeast, it will die, and render your efforts pointless. 3 Add the yeast and egg yolks Stir the yeast into the warm milk, then whisk in the egg yolks and soured cream, mixing vigorously until they\u2019re well combined. Pour the milk mixture into the flour bowl, stirring as you do so, until you have a fairly smooth paste. Be careful not to overwork it once it\u2019s mixed, though, or your blinis will be tough. 4 Leave the batter to prove Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and leave in a fairly warm, or at least not draughty, place for an hour or so, or until it looks spongy (it won\u2019t rise dramatically, but the batter should have grown slightly in the bowl, and there ought to be a few bubbles visible on the top. 5 Add the egg whites and prove again Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gently fold them into the batter mixture using a large metal spoon or a rubber spatula, being mindful to keep as much air in the mix as possible. Once they\u2019ve been well combined, cover the bowl again and leave for another two hours. 6 Cook the blinis Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once it\u2019s hot, drop teaspoonfuls of batter in batches into the pan, and cook them until bubbles rise to the surface and golden brown underneath. Carefully flip over and cook for another minute or so, until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining batter. 7 Eat warm Blinis are best eaten warm from the pan, otherwise they can go rather stodgy, so either serve them in batches as you make them, or store them in a warm oven, wrapped in a tea towel to keep them soft, until you\u2019ve used up all the batter. They can also be frozen once cooked: defrost and microwave briefly to reheat. 8 Serving suggestions The simplest way to serve blinis is topped with a dollop of soured cream and a few fish eggs or a curl of smoked fish or cooked meat, and perhaps a pinch of chopped chives or some freshly ground black pepper. Smoked mackerel, kipper or salmon pat\u00e9, or chunks of pickled herring are even simpler options. 9 Vegetarian options Make a Finnish egg butter: boil two eggs for eight minutes, then peel and finely chop. Beat into 80g softened butter and season generously, then spread on blinis and top with capers or chopped cornichons. Or, for a more colourful choice, make a beetroot puree: whizz up four cooked beetroot with 100ml soured cream, add horseradish sauce or black pepper to taste, and finish with a little chopped dill.",

MB * * * Five massively popular trends no one saw coming 1. The popularity of Ed Sheeran Everyone has to start somewhere but if, in 2010, you had met the guitar tech for Nizlopi (the one-hit wonders behind JCB Song), you would struggle to guess he would become the most streamed British artist of the decade. 2. True-crime podcasts In 2010 it seemed like podcasts were good for banal chit-chat but not much else. Then came blockbuster true-crime podcast Serial, and now everyone has given up on music to listen to rehashed US legal cases in a forensic level of detail. 3. The staying power of indie bands The death of guitar music has been prophesied consistently throughout the decade: but the Wombats\u2019 last three records have all gone Top 5 and the Kaiser Chiefs have a headline show at The O2 next year. Proof that if you continue releasing music and don\u2019t #MeToo anyone, your fanbase can just keep growing. 4. The Bake Off boom Imagine someone telling you at the decade\u2019s start that the most successful TV format of the decade would be a competitive baking show interspersed with dry history lessons about 17th-century boulangeries hosted by Mel and Sue from the 90s, and later by Vince Noir from the Mighty Boosh. 5. The \u201cyee-haw agenda\u201d An amorphous mix of memes, cultural theory and music videos about gay black cowboys that culminated in a Billy Ray Cyrus and Lil Nas X collaboration topping the charts for half of this year. SW * * * Five times famous people tried (and failed) to get down with grime 1. Mick Jagger gives Skepta a guest spot on England Lost Proof that if your godawful slice of harmonica blooze has lyrics that sound like sixth-form poetry, a guest verse from Skepta won\u2019t save it. It will make you sound a bit desperate. 2. Cher Lloyd ft Ghetts, Dot Rotten and Mic Righteous X Factor reject attempts genuine cred by hopping on to a shoddy EDM beat and paying Ghetts to spuriously rap: \u201cI swear, whoever came up with this idea: genius.\u201d X Factor reject fails. 3. Michael Gove quotes Stormzy When Gove echoed Stormzy\u2019s \u201cI set trends, dem man copy\u201d on Twitter in November, he did have a point. He did create a trend: mouthsicking. 4. Robbie Wiliams appears on Dizzee\u2019s Goin\u2019 Crazy The biggest loser from the hammy 2013 collaboration between Dizzee Rascal and Robbie Willliams? Dizzee. Farewell, grime authenticity. 5. Pizza Hut ft DJ Vectra The top grime DJ teamed up with Pizza Hut to show how a pizza box could be turned into a turntable. Not exactly what the genre kneaded. AD * * * Five things Ed Sheeran has ruined (not including music) 1. Tomato ketchup Heinz rebranded it Tomato Edchup after superfan Sheeran wrote in to offer to star in its advert. Pass the HP. 2. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Daniel Craig? Cool. Harry and Wills? Meh. Ed Sheeran as a Stormtrooper? Set blasters to kill. 3. Game of Thrones At least we found out in season eight that Sheeran was flamed alive by a dragon. 4. Property prices in Framlingham, Suffolk Sheeran bought out his neighbours for more than \u00a33m after they complained about planned works. 5. Drinking in Birmingham The Eagle n Tun, featured in Sheeran ft Stormzy\u2019s Take Me Back to London, is to be demolished in 2020. Coincidence? Doubt it. RP * * * Five cultural moments that meant too much 1. Fleabag It was tough enough for Fleabag to sort her life out, let alone shoulder arguments about priestly propriety, poshness and privilege. See also: Girls, a show literally about myopia that soon stood for absolutely everything. 2. Love Island Fit people. Beach. Shagging. A classic formula, complicated when ITV2\u2019s hit became a moral flashpoint. It prompted useful discussions on race, bisexuality and gaslighting, and some as overcooked as the Islanders\u2019 tans: the NYT called it a \u201criveting human rights violation\u201d and a reminder that there is \u201cno surveillance-free home to return to\u201d. 3. Sally Rooney Conversations With Friends and Ordinary People are marvels of nuance. The debate around them ... less so. Advance copies became Instagram status symbols; her stories were bluntly recast as DEFINING MILLENNIAL TRACTS. Bet the socialist, sharp Rooney was overjoyed. 4. The Kardashians Have you ever tried watching KUWTK? It\u2019s like a performance art study in tedium. And yet, they generated arguments about cultural appropriation, body image, business and politics, slowly scraping every remaining speck of meaning out of the decade\u2019s emptiest word: empowerment. 5. Joker It provoked \u201cincel\u201d violence, incited \u201cmeme tourism\u201d, plumped Gary Glitter\u2019s coffers; it was a dangerous depiction of mental illness \u2013 no, wait, it was great disability art. Banal, brilliant; basic, complex: Joker had his cake, ate it and smeared the jam all over his face. LS * * * Five times everyone got extremely angry about cooking 1. Bingate, The Great British Bake Off The measured response to one contestant rendering another\u2019s baked alaska bin-worthy by taking it out of the freezer? A 69-year-old grandmother getting hate tweets about meringue swans. 2. MasterChef\u2019s Chicken Rendang blunder MasterChef judges: \u201cYour chicken skin isn\u2019t crispy, it can\u2019t be eaten\u201d (even though rendang isn\u2019t meant to have crispy skin). Malaysian prime minister: \u201cWhitesplaining!\u201d Cue understandable internet furore. 3. Mary Berry puts cream in her spag bol It\u2019s controversial, but is it wrong? Twitter (very angrily) said \u201cyes!\u201d to this Mary Berry Everyday recipe. Or more accurately: \u201cdisgrace\u201d, \u201cshocking\u201d, \u201cruined\u201d. 4. Nigella roasts lettuce Want to anger a nation? Put leaves into an oven. \u201cShe\u2019s lost it!\u201d declared outraged internetters about this Simply Nigella caesar salad. 5. Custardgate, the Great British Bake Off One contestant nicks another\u2019s custard, Sue Perkins uses the word \u201cespionage\u201d and the internet explodes. A literal and figurative trifle. AD",

No US personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Christmas\u2019s elves and reindeer were killed with him. He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming. The toy workshop had been cleared by this time, with elves either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young elves were moved out of the workshop uninjured. The only ones remaining were Christmas in the tunnel, who had dragged three elves with him to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his beard, killing himself and the three elves. His body was mutilated by the blast, but test results gave certain and positive identification.\u201d</p> <p>It was difficult to explain to the children why Trump had decided that Santa had to die, as it involved complex ideas concerning economic interventionism and the values of the free market. But apparently Trump had been pleading with \u201cthat Christmas guy\u201d since he came to power in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news\" title=\"\">2016</a>, to abandon his traditional Christmas Eve practice of distributing free toys to all the children in the world.</p> <p>According to Trump, the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans were at risk, and there was a serious reduction of toy-generated retail revenue in the American economy because Christmas was undercutting everyone with \u201chis free toy bullshit\u201d. \u201cMr Christmas,\u201d Trump explained, \u201chas ignored my ultimatums and so this Christmas, if he tries his free toys crap again, we are going to neutralise him permanently, and I hope we can count on the cooperation and technological support of our allies worldwide in tracking him to his Christmas lair.\u201d</p> <p>My children were even more upset to find out that Britain was the only country to answer Trump\u2019s call. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, explained the government\u2019s position to a sympathetic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/17/tv-tonight-laura-kuenssberg-delves-inside-johnsons-government\" title=\"\">Laura Kuenssberg</a> and a group of unconvinced children attending a pantomime in central London.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, America is an important ally for us, and technically what Father Christmas has been doing every Christmas Eve for years now, with impunity, constitutes a socialist intervention in the market, artificially depressing the value of toymakers\u2019 labour and the value of their goods in the marketplace by the introduction into the equation of free toys at no cost to the consumer, courtesy of some mythic philanthropist who, while naively trying to bring children joy in the short term, seems willingly blind to the long-term unintended consequences of his actions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My children were even more upset to find out that Britain was the only country to answer Trump\u2019s call</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kuenssberg seemed delighted with Javid\u2019s answer and gave him a Christmas kiss before explaining to the viewer at home: \u201cThese children here are crying, but sooner or later they were going to stop believing in Father Christmas anyway, so in a way the government has helped them to grow up. Thank you, chancellor.\u201d</p> <p>On the <em>Today</em> programme, Dominic Raab justified the government\u2019s actions to a pointless Nick Robinson, explaining that though they had allowed the US to piggyback on to GCHQ systems to track Santa\u2019s journey home after his final delivery, in the islands of American Samoa, British forces were not involved in the assault on his workshop that left Father Christmas and many of his workers and livestock dead.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Nick Ferrari\u2019s LBC radio show, an evasive Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ Get-Brexit-Done Johnson would neither condone nor endorse the Santa attack.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever we had done, someone would have been offended these days,\u201d Turds explained. Nick Ferrari then said he hoped the prime minister had had a good Christmas and wished him a happy new year, before playing a recording of Trump further elaborating on the Christmas-killing operation: \u201cThe reach of America is long. Father Christmas died in a vicious and violent way, running and crying. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. God bless the United States of America!\u201d</p> <p>For me, Christmas had already died. It died about 10 days earlier, two days after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win\" title=\"\">election of Boris Johnson</a>. It died just at the west end of Oxford Street, when a group of Muslim women went for a day out at Hyde Park\u2019s Winter Wonderland funfair, as they have every right so to do, irrespective of their belief in a nonexistent God.</p> <p>Proving they had assimilated, the Muslim women had chosen to attend an event where all the ancient British yule traditions \u2013 eating takeaway Chinese food, zooming round and round on terrifying rides with German names, and drinking buckets of Coca-Cola \u2013 are celebrated. While the women were indulging in the festive act of taking a selfie, a group of men jumped into the frame and one shouted \u201cfucking letterbox cunts\u201d at them, an <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/real-life/winter-wonderland-london-hyde-park-muslim-women-letterbox-1344467\" title=\"\">unsophisticated response</a> to the complex debate surrounding the rights and wrongs of wearing the burqa.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not possible to prove that the prime minister\u2019s undoubted popularisation of the word \u201cletterbox\u201d as a way of insulting Muslim women is directly responsible for the tone of this incident, but it probably is obviously and, leading by example, Turds has certainly changed the rules on what sort of language is publicly acceptable.</p> <p>Luckily, the Conservative party have dropped, or \u201cbroadened the scope of\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/equalities-professor-to-head-tory-inquiry-into-discrimination-in-party\" title=\"\">independent inquiry into Islamophobia</a> in the party that Boris Johnson promised in one of his rare election debate appearances, as its conclusions may have landed rather too close to home.

According to Trump, the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans were at risk, and there was a serious reduction of toy-generated retail revenue in the American economy because Christmas was undercutting everyone with \u201chis free toy bullshit\u201d. \u201cMr Christmas,\u201d Trump explained, \u201chas ignored my ultimatums and so this Christmas, if he tries his free toys crap again, we are going to neutralise him permanently, and I hope we can count on the cooperation and technological support of our allies worldwide in tracking him to his Christmas lair.\u201d My children were even more upset to find out that Britain was the only country to answer Trump\u2019s call. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, explained the government\u2019s position to a sympathetic Laura Kuenssberg and a group of unconvinced children attending a pantomime in central London. \u201cObviously, America is an important ally for us, and technically what Father Christmas has been doing every Christmas Eve for years now, with impunity, constitutes a socialist intervention in the market, artificially depressing the value of toymakers\u2019 labour and the value of their goods in the marketplace by the introduction into the equation of free toys at no cost to the consumer, courtesy of some mythic philanthropist who, while naively trying to bring children joy in the short term, seems willingly blind to the long-term unintended consequences of his actions.\u201d Kuenssberg seemed delighted with Javid\u2019s answer and gave him a Christmas kiss before explaining to the viewer at home: \u201cThese children here are crying, but sooner or later they were going to stop believing in Father Christmas anyway, so in a way the government has helped them to grow up. Thank you, chancellor.\u201d On the Today programme, Dominic Raab justified the government\u2019s actions to a pointless Nick Robinson, explaining that though they had allowed the US to piggyback on to GCHQ systems to track Santa\u2019s journey home after his final delivery, in the islands of American Samoa, British forces were not involved in the assault on his workshop that left Father Christmas and many of his workers and livestock dead. Meanwhile, on Nick Ferrari\u2019s LBC radio show, an evasive Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ Get-Brexit-Done Johnson would neither condone nor endorse the Santa attack. \u201cWhatever we had done, someone would have been offended these days,\u201d Turds explained. Nick Ferrari then said he hoped the prime minister had had a good Christmas and wished him a happy new year, before playing a recording of Trump further elaborating on the Christmas-killing operation: \u201cThe reach of America is long. Father Christmas died in a vicious and violent way, running and crying. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. God bless the United States of America!\u201d For me, Christmas had already died. It died about 10 days earlier, two days after the election of Boris Johnson. It died just at the west end of Oxford Street, when a group of Muslim women went for a day out at Hyde Park\u2019s Winter Wonderland funfair, as they have every right so to do, irrespective of their belief in a nonexistent God. Proving they had assimilated, the Muslim women had chosen to attend an event where all the ancient British yule traditions \u2013 eating takeaway Chinese food, zooming round and round on terrifying rides with German names, and drinking buckets of Coca-Cola \u2013 are celebrated. While the women were indulging in the festive act of taking a selfie, a group of men jumped into the frame and one shouted \u201cfucking letterbox cunts\u201d at them, an unsophisticated response to the complex debate surrounding the rights and wrongs of wearing the burqa. Of course, it\u2019s not possible to prove that the prime minister\u2019s undoubted popularisation of the word \u201cletterbox\u201d as a way of insulting Muslim women is directly responsible for the tone of this incident, but it probably is obviously and, leading by example, Turds has certainly changed the rules on what sort of language is publicly acceptable. Luckily, the Conservative party have dropped, or \u201cbroadened the scope of\u201d, the independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party that Boris Johnson promised in one of his rare election debate appearances, as its conclusions may have landed rather too close to home. God bless us one and all! \u2022 Extra London dates of Stewart Lee\u2019s latest live show, Snowflake/Tornado, have just been announced at the South Bank Centre in June and July, and it tours nationally from January",

The woman, whose name is Elen, agrees to marry him; as her \u201cmaiden fee\u201d, she asks him to build three great forts for her, the largest of them at Caernarfon. \u201cAfter that,\u201d the story continues, \u201cElen decided to build great roads from one fort to the other across the island of Britain.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b378227e5a34b2eafb1cd5c5f8ad40c81371e344\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b378227e5a34b2eafb1cd5c5f8ad40c81371e344/0_105_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Gwydir Forest path passing moss and lichen-covered rocks and trees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Gwydir Forest path passing moss and lichen-covered rocks and trees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RA Kearton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so, the legends say, it was Elen who caused the \u201cRoman\u201d roads to be built.

Is that the premiership secured? A long way yet to run, and there\u2019s the not insignificant matter of the Asian Champions League to distract the reigning champions over the months ahead.</p> <p>But when it mattered most - reduced to ten men inside half an hour - the competition\u2019s form team showed themselves to be head and shoulders above their rivals. Former City man Luke Brattan pulled the strings for his new side, while Milos Ninkovic displayed another virtuoso cameo - winning a penalty, and attacking with twinkling toes, but also getting through a weight of work defensively.</p> <p>Former Victory striker Kosta Barbarouses haunting his erstwhile derby opponents with a goal late on to clinch it. Sydney FC nine points clear: who can run them down from here?</p> <p>Good wins for the Sydney FC women\u2019s team and the Matildas-led Brisbane Roar in the W-League, while Adelaide remain winless. And that\u2019s Sportwatch!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0875b78f08c39722641c7e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T09:48:56.568Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Big Bash - End of Innings: Strikers 6/155 (20)</strong></p> <p>They resort to seven different bowlers in the end, the Renegades, but you have to say, the Strikers have perhaps butchered that early platform, losing wickets steadily and failing to capitalise on Salt\u2019s fifty. Rashid Khan cleared the rope twice late on in a 16-ball 25-run cameo, but this is definitely a getable score for the Renegades.

To do that with 10 men.</p> <p>Only Wellington Phoenix have prevented Sydney from eight-straight wins since that shock derby loss in round two. It\u2019s a ninth consecutive home win for FC.</p> <p>Simply put - this team is head and shoulders above the rest.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0873138f087e8308e65831\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-29T09:38:12.109Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A-League: Sydney FC 2-1 Melbourne City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 + 3 min: </strong>City win themselves a corner, and the \u2018keeper Glover ambles up to join the fray!

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch on a night in which Sydney FC recorded a memorable and potentially decisive win in the A-League over their nearest and biggest rivals this season. Is that the premiership secured? A long way yet to run, and there\u2019s the not insignificant matter of the Asian Champions League to distract the reigning champions over the months ahead. But when it mattered most - reduced to ten men inside half an hour - the competition\u2019s form team showed themselves to be head and shoulders above their rivals. Former City man Luke Brattan pulled the strings for his new side, while Milos Ninkovic displayed another virtuoso cameo - winning a penalty, and attacking with twinkling toes, but also getting through a weight of work defensively. Former Victory striker Kosta Barbarouses haunting his erstwhile derby opponents with a goal late on to clinch it. Sydney FC nine points clear: who can run them down from here? Good wins for the Sydney FC women\u2019s team and the Matildas-led Brisbane Roar in the W-League, while Adelaide remain winless. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! Big Bash - End of Innings: Strikers 6/155 (20) They resort to seven different bowlers in the end, the Renegades, but you have to say, the Strikers have perhaps butchered that early platform, losing wickets steadily and failing to capitalise on Salt\u2019s fifty. Rashid Khan cleared the rope twice late on in a 16-ball 25-run cameo, but this is definitely a getable score for the Renegades. Over to you, Aaron Finch. It\u2019s an exuberant celebration from coach Steve Corica - has his side just secured the premiership?! It feels outrageous to even suggest such a thing, just 12 rounds into 29, but with City the nearest rivals, they\u2019ve sent a huge message tonight, the Sky Blues. To do that with 10 men. Only Wellington Phoenix have prevented Sydney from eight-straight wins since that shock derby loss in round two. It\u2019s a ninth consecutive home win for FC. Simply put - this team is head and shoulders above the rest. 90 + 3 min: City win themselves a corner, and the \u2018keeper Glover ambles up to join the fray! Last roll of the dice for the visitors. He ends up with ball at feet in a wide position, and he tries to drop the shoulder on McGowan, but the experienced defender has none of it - and plays the ball off the \u2018keeper to win the goalkick. Danger averted. And there\u2019s the whistle! The pretenders have been vanquished - Sydney FC are the real deal, and they go nine points clear at the top of the A-League ladder! 90 + 1 min: Four minutes is the official added time, and Sydney run the first of those down as King wins a clever foul from former Sky Blue star Brillante. 89 min: A fine cameo from Luke Brattan in the Sydney midfield. For youngsters wanting to learn how to control the tempo of a game, get a copy of that tape. Calm on the ball, scanning for options, finding the right pass to release pressure, and turn defence into attack. He\u2019s been excellent tonight the former City man. 87 min: Sydney FC contemplate a final change - it\u2019s an A-League debut for Patrick Flottmann, replacing the sharp-shooter Adam Le Fondre. Defender for attacker, it\u2019s officially shut-up-shop o\u2019clock for the table-toppers. A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 2-1 Melbourne City (Barbarouses) 84 min: You wouldn\u2019t say against the run of play, but they\u2019ve conjured something from nothing, Sydney FC! Caceres plays a decent ball out to Barbarouses who turns his former Phoenix teammate Scott Galloway inside out, to stride inside and fire a low shot across Glover! It nestles bottom corner - a superb finish. And incredibly: the 10 men Sydney FC have come from behind to take the lead! 83 min: The home fans bay for blood as Griffiths catches Le Fondre. He\u2019s already been booked the City skipper for the night, and it was on a break. There\u2019s no card though, to the dismay of the faithful. 81 min: Luna goes in the book for a series of minor fouls, and City look to play their last card off the bench in the former of Lachlan Wales. Cabrera with a superb double effort - the first a stunning first-time volley, but it\u2019s well blocked, and his follow-up effort rises just over the bar. It\u2019s his last contribution, as Wales takes his spot. A-League - 77 min: Sydney FC make their second switch, as Ninkovic makes way for youngster Harry van der Saag. He receives a huge ovation from the home fans - it\u2019s been another high-quality showing from the Serbian maestro in truth, whose earned penalty should have given Sydney the lead. Big Bash: Strikers 2/119 (15), Carey 36*, Wells 19* Down in Melbourne we are of course well into the Renegades v Strikers Big Bash clash. It\u2019s a decent start from the Strikers with Philip Salt smashing an impressive 54 off just 26 runs. With wickets in hand this could be a decent total if they can explode over the final five overs - especially with the skipper Carey at the crease. Watch this space. 72 min: Cabrera does well to pinch it from King, but Maclaren can\u2019t make the most of it centrally. Is he off tonight, the Socceroo? You hesitate to say so until the full 90 has gone, given his prodigious ability to make something from nothing. But in the battle of the sharp-shooters it\u2019s definitely been Le Fondre who\u2019s looked the more impressive tonight. 69 min: Sydney FC with a corner, but it\u2019s a poor delivery from Caceres that enables the \u2018keeper Glover to fire a fast release. He can\u2019t quite find Maclaren though, and the move peters out. City go to the bench again, Noone jogs off for the promising Ramy Najjarine. Can he etch his name in lights? 65 min: Surprisingly, despite their ten men, Sydney FC are enjoying almost 50% possession. Mombaerts has perhaps told his side to be wary of the Sydney transition attack. They\u2019re allowing the home side to dictate play a little though City, which with the man advantage they really shouldn\u2019t be doing. 61 min: Le Fondre tries to skip round Delbridge after a clever ball from the youngster Joel King, but the big Australian defender shuts down the chance well. It\u2019s nicely poised at this stage - City for their part starting to show a little bit more ambition, while Sydney look to hit in transition, as they have so brilliantly all season. 58 min: Cabrera picks out the new man Luna at the far post - he tries the spectacular overhead / horizontal minesweeper: but he can\u2019t get it on target! What a goal that could have been - the two Uruguayans combine nicely. 55 min: A first change from Melbourne City as the goalscorer Metcalfe makes way for Adrian Luna. It\u2019s a marginally more attacking change from Mombaerts - has he identified something in the Sydney FC midfield that the Uruguayan can exploit? 49 min: Now it\u2019s City earning a corner, as Ninkovic is forced to do some defensive work. Sydney FC eventually clear their lines, but can\u2019t spring the fast counter as Atkinson closes down Brattan. Noone fires in another dangerous effort from an acute angle. It\u2019s another terrific run - he deserves a goal, but again, having done the hardest bit, the finish itself is underwhelming. Second half! 45 min: We\u2019re back after the break. What words of wisdom have both coaches imparted? It\u2019s the ten men of Sydney FC who dominate the opening moments of possession, and they earn a first corner of the half. I can also confirm a half-time change: Anthony Caceres comes on for Alexander Baumjohann. Presumably that\u2019s a tactical switch, with the German not noted for his defensive workload. And for those of you who like those end of year awards malarkey, here\u2019s a pretty good \u201calternative\u201d awards selection from the Observer\u2019s David Hills: Two Aussie treasures flying the flag, you\u2019ll note: Bernard Tomic and Israel Folau pick up honorable mentions. Proud. So - your thoughts on that opening first 45? Plenty to digest and work through: fire us a tweet or email if you\u2019d like to set a topic for discussion. Who\u2019s looked the more likely? Who\u2019s winning the little battles? And can Sydney FC finish over the top, with just 10 men? 45 + 4 min: It\u2019s six minutes added on, given the lengthy head clash, VAR decisions and other miscellaneous delays. Maclaren seems caught in two minds when through on goal, while at the other end Kosta Barbarouses can\u2019t quite find his partner-in-crime Le Fondre. It\u2019s a pulsating first stanza: a red card, some niggle, two goals, a penalty missed. Are you not entertained? A-League - penalty saved! Sydney FC 1-1 Melbourne City 45 min: Blushes spared by Glover, given his role in the earlier Sydney FC goal, as Le Fondre looks to drive his penalty attempt hard and straight down the middle - but the former Tottenham junior just gets a leg to it and deflects clear! His teammates are delighted and rush to congratulate him. You have to say, I never thought Le Fondre would miss, the form that he\u2019s in - but credit the \u2018keeper. 44 min: It\u2019s a mercurial run from the re-signed Serbian, Ninkovic - and he\u2019s won Sydney FC a penalty! A slaloming run through the heart of the City defence, before he catches the leg of Delbridge. Could they go ahead, just before half-time?! 42 min: The loss of fullback Grant - remarkably his first red card in eleven seasons - has seen a tactical adjustment for the home side. The versatile Paulo Retre slots in at right back, and Luke Brattan drops to the solo anchor role, with Ninkovic and Baumjohhann coming a little more centrally. 38 min: And despite being reduced to 10 men, it\u2019s the home crowd in fine voice after that Le Fondre goal. Plenty more to cheer, as Craig Noone bursts through with just Andrew Redmayne to beat - and he\u2019s missed the target completely! It was a brilliant run, a give-and-go through the heart of the FC defence, including a nutmeg on Ryan McGowan, but City\u2019s Englishman could only curl his effort harmlessly wide! What a massive let off. 33 min: Not only has that goal drawn Sydney FC level, but it\u2019s also light a small fire in the dark beady eyes of Jamie Maclaren. The City striker in of course locked in his own personal battle with Sydney\u2019s ALF for the golden boot race. He won\u2019t have enjoyed seeing that one bobble the net. Maclaren: 10; Le Fondre: 12. A-League: Goal! Sydney FC 1-1 Melbourne City (Le Fondre) 28 min: Well, it\u2019s all happening now! It\u2019s the ten men in the Sky Blue (not City Blue TM) of Sydney who have a share of the lead. It\u2019s a freekick and the \u2018keeper Tom Glover doesn\u2019t claim or clear cleanly - but it\u2019s a terrific finish from the English sharp-shooter through a crowd of bodies. No danger of this one being a snore-fest. Game on! 24 min: Oh my, oh my. We could have some more VAR drama here. Rhyan Grant has gone in high on Nathaniel Atkinson - and despite an on-field yellow card being awarded, we go upstairs to deliberate if that\u2019s a tackle worthy of a straight red card. And the machine men say: yes! It\u2019s a red card for Rhyan Grant! It\u2019s a calamitous few minutes for Sydney FC. A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 0-1 Melbourne City (Metcalfe) 21 min: It\u2019s the short corner routine - and for seemingly the first time in the history of football - it\u2019s delivered a goal! A fine ball in from Craig Noone and it\u2019s the young midfielder from Newcastle who rises the highest. A terrific header, and it\u2019s City who get the first break! 16 min: This is starting to bubble a little, as Rostyn Griffiths is penalised for a foul on Milos Ninkovic. He gets the ball, the City captain for the day, but he does appear to go over the top and catches the Sydney FC playmaker on the ankle. A slight delay before Griffiths is handed a yellow card. If that\u2019s come from the VAR then we\u2019ve got some bracket creep from the video officials - it\u2019s either a yellow on the pitch, or by their own rules they\u2019re not allowed to get involved. There\u2019s the final whistle, and it is a much-needed, and you\u2019d have to say, on weight of chances - a well-deserved - win for the home side. Just too much attacking talent, despite the heroics in goal from Coelho. Roar march up the ladder, while the Jets threaten to be cut adrift, alongside Adelaide and the Sam Kerr-less Perth. 11 min: An early sight at goal from Connor Metcalfe - and his curling effort is just deflected wide for a corner! A real scare just outside the Sydney FC penalty box as Craig Noone\u2019s cutback broke kindly to the youngster and his first touch set himself up nicely, and his second was to thump it goalwards. Sydney defend back-to-back corners though, and eventually clear their lines. 8 min: A lively tempo to the start of this one - as you\u2019d expect between the top two sides in the A-League. So much attacking talent in both squads, and with City playing a much more proactive style of football under Erick Mombaerts you just sense there could be some goals today. Plenty of tasty match ups across the pitch, as well. Luke Brattan in Sydney FC colours and Josh Brillante in City\u2019s white? It\u2019s still something the eyes need to adjust to. A-League: Kick off! 3 min: It\u2019s an unfortunate beginning for two players as Rhyan Grant and Nathaniel Atkinson come together for a nasty clash of heads. Concern on both benches, but the players are up and on their feet - and the medical staff clear them for action. Let\u2019s move to our feature match of the round from the A-League where it\u2019s one v two - let\u2019s get some team news for you ASAP. Sydney fC: Melbourne City: W-League - 77 min: A big cheer from the home fans as on comes the returning Elise Kellond-Knight, Matildas and Roar stalwart after several seasons away from Queensland. Pana Petratos also comes on for the Jets as both coaches look to effect a last tactical roll of the die. W-League - Goal! Brisbane 2-1 Newcastle (Palmer) 68 min: Well, there was a sense of it being just a matter of time for the Roar, and finally, they breach the brave defence of Coelho. It was driven goalwards by Raso, but saved - then rattled back off the crossbar from Yallop, to the squeals of home fans, before the Young Matilda Hollie Palmer was finally able to turn home! There\u2019s the lead - and you can\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t coming. W-League - 65 min: And if you were in doubt about how this clash is unfolding, it\u2019s Roar with 13 shots on target to Newcastle\u2019s one. But what a one it was, given the scoreboard still reads 1-1. A nervy moment at the back for the Roar, that said, as Mackenzie Arnold miscontrols, and the \u2018keeper almost invites trouble - very much against the run of play. And here\u2019s the final day four report from the trans-Tasman Boxing Day Test. I for one would have loved to see a little more from the Black Caps. Fingers crossed for Sydney? W-League - 57 min: The Roar are starting to really besiege the Jets\u2019 goal as the Matildas trio of Katrina Gorry, Yallop and Raso combine to threaten once again - but the final ball is missing on this occasion. There\u2019s still plenty of experience in this Jets outfit, despite losing Emily van Egmond over the off-season, but they\u2019ll need their older heads like Gema Simon and Jenna Kingsley to stand tall here, if they\u2019re not to see one point evaporate into none. W-League - 50 min: We\u2019re back underway in the second half of Brisbane v Newcastle where there\u2019s considerable concern over the Jets\u2019 goalkeeper Claire Coelho after a heavy collision with an on-rushing Tameka Yallop. It\u2019s still 1-1, but it\u2019s the home side making all the running since the break with Hayley Raso and Yallop both with opportunities. And if you\u2019ve just joined us, the Boxing Day Test has just resolved - and alas it\u2019s a pretty comprehensive loss for the visitors New Zealand. Jonathan Howcroft has the latest there: And the big news coming from the cricket today - veteran quick Peter Siddle has announced he\u2019s hanging up his spurs. Competitive until the last - vale, you sweet workhorse. 221 international wickets is nothing to be sneezed at: And there\u2019s the full-time whistle! Another \u201cclose but no cigar\u201d mission for the Lady Reds. They rallied well late on, but a superb strike from Princess Ibini settled the nerves for home fans. Sydney FC bounce back from that heavy derby loss last weekend in the best possible way, while Adelaide slump to their sixth consecutive loss of the season. W-League: Brisbane Roar 1-1 Newcastle Jets - half-time And not quite in the shadow of half-time but there\u2019s been a crucial equaliser up in Queensland as well, as Clare Polkinghorne has pinned back the Jets after Tara Andrews\u2019 early goal. We head into the sheds all level therefore. W-League: Goal! Sydney FC 2-0 Adelaide United (Ibini) 90 + 1 min: Oh my. That\u2019s some strike from Princess Ibini! Adelaide allowed the Matilda too much space outside the box and she let fly from long range. No chance for Sarah Willacy in the Reds goal - and their stout resistance has finally been put to bed. Evening all! I hope this finds you well, between the (presumed) decadence of Christmas and the (presumed) restraint of New Years resolutions. We\u2019ve got two lots of live W-League that I want to get to straight away, where I can tell you we\u2019ve just had a late goal. Let\u2019s jump in. It\u2019s a feast of football with a sprinkling of Big Bash cricket for pudding, this Sportwatch. In the W-League winless Adelaide chase their first points against Sydney FC, while Brisbane Roar host Newcastle knowing a win can see them apply pressure to Canberra after their heavy loss to the Wanderers. In the A-League it\u2019s one v two: a mouthwatering match up of the competition\u2019s top two marksman as Jamie Maclaren and Adam Le Fondre go toe-to-toe. And then it\u2019s over to Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh to get the Renegades\u2019 shock 0-3 season up and running as Adelaide Strikers come to town. Enjoy.",

      "body": "<p>Abolishing the international development department would undermine Britain\u2019s reputation as a leader in overseas aid, Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, has warned.</p> <p>In the latest sign of concern over the future of the Department for International Development (DfID), Williams said that reducing its work to \u201ca subdivision of general foreign policy\u201d, which used foreign aid to assist Britain\u2019s security aims, would be a \u201cdamagingly short-term\u201d decision.

      "bodyText": "Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it\u2019s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There\u2019s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku\u2019s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family\u2019s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian caf\u00e9, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again. Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge\u2019s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan\u2019s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge\u2019s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It\u2019s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they\u2019re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed. Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously \u2013 threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future. Temperatures also reached record highs in Australia, triggering continent-wide bushfires, while in Africa, the Victoria Falls \u2013 one of the planet\u2019s greatest cascades of water \u2013 dried to a trickle in 2019. The Glasgow talks will take place against this grim, ecological background. Robin McKie Three to watch Greta Thunberg Can the activist maintain the momentum of the climate protest movement? Donald Trump He is pulling the US out of international climate agreements by 4 November, 2020. But if he loses next year\u2019s presidential election, on 3 November, and a Democrat wins, the US would rejoin talks in 2021. Claire Perry O\u2019Neill As president of COP26, it will be the principal job of the former Tory MP to ensure the talks are successful. Politics The UK\u2019s membership of the European Union will be terminated at the end of January, but that\u2019s not Brexit done.

Theatrical novelties waiting in the wings include the first stage production of Angela Carter\u2019s The Company of Wolves in May at the New Vic in Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire and a revival of Alan Bennett\u2019s much-loved Talking Heads at the Watford Palace Theatre in Watford, courtesy of Dead Ringers\u2019 Jan Ravens and co-star Julia Watson.

The Queen, who will be 94 in April, looks increasingly alone as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, leads a near solitary life on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew\u2019s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein\u2019s alleged victims\u2019 lawyers\u2019 relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father. Harry has launched legal proceedings against the owners of the Sun and the Daily Mirror in relation to alleged phone hacking.

Earlier in the year GM shut its giant assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 50,000 GM workers then staged the longest auto strike in 50 years. They won a few wage gains but didn\u2019t save any jobs. Meanwhile, GM\u2019s stock has performed so well that Barra earned $22m last year. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is another member of the Business Roundtable. Just weeks after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary, announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce. The annual saving to Amazon from this cost-cutting move is roughly what Bezos \u2013 whose net worth is $110bn \u2013 makes in two hours. (Bezos\u2019s nearly completed DC mansion will have 2 elevators, 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, and a movie theater.) GE\u2019s CEO Larry Culp is also a member of the Business Roundtable. Two months after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, General Electric froze the pensions of 20,000 workers in order to cut costs. Culp raked in $15m last year. Last week the Business Roundtable issued a widely advertised Christmas message. It asserted that the success of the American economy \u201cdepends on businesses investing in the economic security of their employees and the communities in which they operate\u201d. Sure. Just in time for the holidays, US Steel announced 1,545 layoffs at two plants in Michigan. Last year, five US Steel executives received an average compensation package of $4.8m, a 53% increase over 2017. Instead of a holiday bonus this year, Walmart offered its employees a 15% store discount. Oh, and did I say? Walmart saved $2.2bn this year from the Trump tax cut. The tax cut itself was a product of the Roundtable\u2019s extensive lobbying, lubricated by its generous campaign donations. Several of its member corporations, including Amazon and General Motors, wound up paying no federal income taxes at all last year. Not incidentally, the tax cut will result in less federal money for services on which Americans and their communities rely. The truth is, American corporations are sacrificing workers and communities as never before, in order to further boost record profits and unprecedented CEO pay. Americans know this. In the most recent Pew survey, a record 73% of US adults (including 62% of Republicans, and 71% of Republicans earning less than $30,000 a year) said they believed major corporations had too much power. And 65% believed they made too much profit. The only way to make corporations socially responsible is through laws requiring them to be \u2013 for example, giving workers a bigger voice in corporate decision-making, making corporations pay severance to communities they abandon, raising corporate taxes, busting up monopolies, and preventing dangerous products (including faulty airplanes) from ever seeing the light of day. If the Business Roundtable and other corporations were truly socially responsible, they\u2019d support such laws. Don\u2019t hold your breath. The only way to get such laws enacted is by reducing corporate power and getting big money out of politics. The first step is to see corporate social responsibility for the con it is.",

There was, hurrah, plenty of outrage and outrageousness in new work. Lucy Prebble\u2019s A Very Expensive Poison roared with unruly splendour out of the Old Vic\u2019s proscenium arch. At the Royal Court, Nic\u00f4le Lecky sizzled in Superhoe; Alice Birch dissected the criminal justice system in the Donmar\u2019s [Blank]; Robert Icke\u2019s production of The Doctor skewered identity politics at the Almeida. At the Young Vic, Nadia Latif\u2019s production of Jackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s Fairview skewered the attitudes of its audience. Adaptations were audacious. Arthur Miller\u2019s Death of a Salesman was re-illuminated when Marianne Elliott put an African American family at the centre. Jamie Lloyd\u2019s dynamic production of Cyrano de Bergerac revoiced the play, ticking to the rhythm of beatbox. I am looking forward to Lolita Chakrabarti\u2019s version of Life of Pi, praised by my colleague Clare Brennan in Sheffield, which transfers to London next summer. There was a seismic shift in the tussle for dominance between Chekhov and Ibsen. For the first time in the 20 years I have been the Observer\u2019s theatre critic, the Norwegian dramatist was in the ascendant. As society and ideas of identity fractured, the appetite for ironic lassitude seemed to wane; people reached for confrontation and harsh truth. Remodelled Ibsen was everywhere. David Hare dextrously updated wild Peer Gynt to make Peter Gynt. Ian Rickson\u2019s incandescent production of Rosmersholm had a terrific script by Duncan Macmillan, a transporting collaboration between Rae Smith (set and costumes) and Neil Austin (lighting), and Hayley Atwell giving the performance of her life. At Nottingham Playhouse, Rebecca Lenkiewicz\u2019s version of An Enemy of the People featured Alex Kingston in the title role, while at Chichester, Cordelia Lynn\u2019s Hedda Tesman ingeniously moved Ibsen\u2019s action into the present. Samuel Adamson\u2019s Wife riffed cleverly on A Doll\u2019s House at the Kiln, while in Rachel O\u2019Riordan\u2019s vibrant opening season as artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith, Tanika Gupta\u2019s adaptation whisked the play to Kolkata, with Anjana Vasan, skittish, shadowed and magnetic, as Niru. Sound design crackled into wider recognition. When, some 15 years ago on an Evening Standard panel, I proposed that the design award be given to a soundscape, a fellow panellist explained to the girl (me) that she didn\u2019t know what design meant: it had to be visual. Not any more. The brothers Ringham, Ben and Max, masters of sound design, provided a series of auditory revelations: in Ella Hickson\u2019s eerie Anna, when the audience, listening through headphones, heard only what the main character heard; in the exquisite detail (ah, that clink of a wedding ring against a glass) of Betrayal, which rounded up the marvellous Pinter at the Pinter season; and in the stealthy effects in Berberian Sound Studio at the Donmar. They prove that what we see in the theatre is changed by what we hear. There were sad extinguishings. Jonathan Miller, who brilliantly made the outlandish look like the natural truth, died at the end of the year. As did Nell Gifford, the circus enchanter who wove extraordinary feats into exuberant stories, and who rode around a series of West Country rings in the summer to a chorus of Thank You for the Days. There were new acting lights. Liv Hill made an astonishing stage debut \u2013 looming up like a monstrous toddler in a too-young dress \u2013 in the National\u2019s Top Girls. Two years out of drama school, Luke Thallon nimbly multitasked as geezer and toff in Pinter\u2019s Family Voices \u2013 and went on to be terrifyingly springy as an avid avant-garde dramatist in Present Laughter at the Old Vic. And in London there was promise from new (non-subsidised) theatre buildings: who would have expected that in this mostly barbaric climate for the arts? Nicholases Hytner and Starr announced that in 2021 they will open a 600-seat Haworth Tompkins-designed stage in King\u2019s Cross. Near Battersea Power Station, the Turbine started to thrum with musicals, while on the former site of Raymond Revuebar in Soho, the Boulevard opened with promising programming and an art deco bar. Speeding towards the opening show, I turned into what I thought was the open space of the foyer \u2013 and crashed into a glass pane. Turns out that days before, Joan Collins had done the same thing.

      "bodyText": "Deborah Williams and Dave Shaw first met as teenagers 35 years ago at school in Berkshire. Their paths crossed occasionally until the second year of university, when chance landed them in a shared house in London. \u201cWe fell very quickly in love and have been together ever since,\u201d said Williams. This week, after 31 years together and with no interest in getting married, the couple will become one of the first in the country to have a heterosexual civil partnership. From Tuesday, dozens of mixed-sex couples in England and Wales will enter into a civil union that will benefit from the same legal and financial protections offered to married couples. Theresa May, when she was prime minister, announced that the law on civil partnerships would be amended following Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan\u2019s win in the supreme court in June 2018 after a protracted campaign to be recognised as civil partners. Their legal victory has propelled a new movement. \u201cMarriage never felt relevant to us,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe were busy travelling, having a good time, living in London, and we prided ourselves on the fact that we were actively choosing to be together.\u201d The couple now live happily with their three dogs in Cornwall, where she is a psychologist and he is a web developer. Under the new legislation they registered their intent on 2 December and will sign their civil partnership on New Year\u2019s Eve. Their witnesses will include a lesbian couple who converted their own civil partnership to marriage. \u201cWe never married, because of the patriarchal, religious and conservative associations of traditional marriage,\u201d said Shaw, \u201cbut we have always felt that we should be entitled to the same legal and tax protections of married couples.\u201d Williams agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t judge other couples who go down the marriage route, we\u2019ve been to friends\u2019 weddings and enjoyed them and celebrated with them. This just suits our own political and social ideals.\u201d The government estimates that as many as 84,000 ceremonies will be conducted within the first year as couples take advantage of a right originally legislated for LGBTQI couples, who were unable to marry until the 2013 Marriage Act. Unlike couples who choose to cohabit rather than marry, civil partners are entitled to the same property, pension, inheritance, tax and next-of-kin rights as married couples. For Ben Piggott, 37, and Amy Grant, 35, who bought a house together in Walthamstow, east London, a couple of years ago, it was the administrative practicalities that prompted them to campaign for a civil union. The couple met working in publishing 12 years ago and have been together for seven, but marriage was never on the cards. \u201cWe were lucky we had similar views,\u201d said Grant. \u201cThe language around a civil partnership suits us and this feels like a completely modern and new way that is separate from the historical institution of marriage.\u201d Piggott said that, while they won\u2019t have any sort of ceremony at the register office and will simply sign the papers, they will host a low-key party for family and friends later that week. \u201cIt is a really specific and particular decision for us and it definitely came from a feminist perspective, but unlike a marriage this feels like a clean slate for us \u2013 we can decide what we want it to be.\u201d The couple have had to explain their decision several times to family and friends. \u201cA lot of people said \u2018we don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t just have a pared-back civil ceremony, what\u2019s the difference?\u2019\u201d said Piggott.

It is a legally recognised relationship between two people that offers the same benefits in terms of legal and tax protection as a conventional marriage. How does it work? Like marriages, couples must \u201cgive notice\u201d of their intention to form a civil partnership at a register office at least 29 days before the civil union. The event must take place within 12 months. Is there a ceremony? There must be a registrar and two witnesses to a couple signing their partnership, but the couple can choose whether or not to make a statement or vows to one another. How is it different to a marriage? There is little practical difference but civil partners believe that they are entering an egalitarian partnership that does not have religious or patriarchal associations.",

The title IX civil rights law governing equity in college athletics had expanded to include cases of harassment and sexual assault, and the media were taking the topic more seriously.</p> <p>In 2012 there was blanket coverage of the Jerry Sandusky trial, the assistant football coach at Penn State convicted of rape and child sexual abuse. In 2013, two high school football players were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, following global attention to the case. And in 2014 \u2013 the same year the Rolling Stone piece was published \u2013 Columbia undergraduate Emma Sulkowicz received national attention for carrying her mattress around campus after the school declined to take action against her alleged rapist.</p> <p>Such a climate gave rise to a new heightened journalistic awareness around the need to be respectful and not retraumatize a source. But such considerations may have tipped Erdely toward being overly deferential.</p> <p>As the holes in her reporting were revealed, conservative backlash took root. The Federalist ran a story entitled, \u201c<a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2014/12/02/leftist-media-show-how-not-to-defend-rolling-stone-uva-rape-story/\">Leftist Media Show How Not To Defend Rolling Stone UVA Rape Story</a>\u201d. The Daily Caller ran no fewer than 16 stories on what it termed the<a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/buzz/jackie-coakley\"> \u201cUVA rape hoax</a><a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/buzz/jackie-coakley\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Last year, during the confirmation hearings of supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Rolling Stone story was still being held up as a reason not to believe women. \u201cI\u2019m not saying<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChristineBlaseyFord?src=hashtag_click\"> #ChristineBlaseyFord</a> is lying, but to those parroting the inane \u2018What woman would lie about<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SexualAssault?src=hashtag_click\"> #SexualAssault</a>?\u2019 \u2013 line \u2026 Google any of these,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeaponizedWT/status/1045642135461138432\"> one person tweeted</a>, before listing Jackie\u2019s name in hashtag form. Another named Jackie<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MadisonProj/status/1047452376544624641\"> as a reason</a> to question Democrats who believe women\u2019s stories of abuse at all.</p> <p>Within the world of journalism, the UVA story has been instructive as a cautionary tale.</p> <p>\u201cThere was concern from some corners that showing the flaws in reporting would discourage victims from speaking to journalists,\u201d said Sheila Coronel, academic dean of Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and the lead author of<a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/investigation/rolling_stone_investigation.php\"> the postmortem report on the story</a> put out by the Columbia Journalism Review.</p> <p>Since then, Coronel told the Guardian, \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen much more rigorous reporting on sexual assault. We\u2019ve seen a lot of very persistent and admirable attempts to corroborate the accounts of women.\u201d</p> <p>Chief examples include reporting on Bill Cosby, as well as Pulitzer prize-winning investigations into Harvey Weinstein. And She Said \u2013 the book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on reporting out the Weinstein story for the New York Times \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/she-said-journalism-harvey-weinstein-investigation-book-2019-10\">helped crystalize reporting lessons</a>.</p> <p>But Coronel also noted that Erdely and her editors\u2019 mistakes should not be allowed to eclipse the larger problems the flawed story sought to illuminate. That also seemed to be a takeaway from an essay by Jia Tolentino in her debut book, Trick Mirror.</p> <p>In it, Tolentino \u2013 a UVA alum \u2013 seems to echo Coronel\u2019s point, delving into the nuances of what was, in fact, a pervasive and pernicious culture around sexual assault on campus, and one with a long history.</p> <p>Thirty years earlier, UVA student Liz Seccuro had been brutally gang-raped at Phi Psi. But when she finally brought her rapist to trial while Tolentino was still in school, Tolentino recalled little public reaction.</p> <p>Tolentino was among those convinced <em>something</em> happened to Jackie. Though the details of Jackie\u2019s account weren\u2019t accurate or reportable, perhaps, Tolentino reasoned, alterations she\u2019d made in the truth felt consistent with some level of injury she\u2019d endured.</p> <p>That might read like conjecture but the interpretation resonates with the experience of Tracy Tamborra, a professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven, who also worked for years as a director of a domestic violence services agency in New Jersey.</p> <p>Tamborra recalled to the Guardian how once, after a week of working with a client \u2013 a 19-year-old who\u2019d landed in the hospital having been visibly physically assaulted \u2013 she had sensed something was wrong with the story. After a frank conversation, the teenager admitted to having changed a key detail: she\u2019d been raped not by a neighbor, but by her stepfather.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t raped, it\u2019s that the details of the rape were too painful to recount at the time of the exact moment of the investigation,\u201d Tamborra said. Nevertheless, after that, the police were reluctant to deal with the teenager, given the false report on her record.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the norm, but I do have a couple of stories like that,\u201d Tamborra said of victims whose narratives evolve.</p> <p>The scholarly work of Rebecca Campbell about memory recall at the point of trauma, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/11/the-scientific-research-shows-reports-of-rape-are-often-murky-but-rarely-false/\">further supports</a> the observation.</p> <p>Victims very often can\u2019t recall specific information, according to Campbell, a professor of psychology at Michigan State University who studies sexual assault. Or they misremember things initially because of the way trauma affects the brain. In some cases, aspects of the story are so humiliating that stories are altered to fit a narrative that\u2019s more palatable either to the victim, a third party involved or the investigator.</p> <p>One bright spot of the cultural change though, is that the media, and in turn survivors themselves, are increasingly recognizing these complexities \u2013 as well as the spectrum of what constitutes sexual assault.</p> <p>That\u2019s according to Shana L Maier, a professor in Widener University\u2019s department of criminal justice whose research focuses on sexual assault and rape reporting.</p> <p>\u201cThe strength is awareness,\u201d Maier told the Guardian, \u201cencouraging victims to reach out for help and support and bringing awareness to the continuum of sexual violence. Victims thought it had to be the myth \u2013 the stranger jumping out of the bushes. And one of the benefits of the #MeToo movement is getting awareness out that there\u2019s a broad continuum for victimization.\u201d</p> <p>Not all of it is reportable.</p>",

Now five years later, in the aftermath of #Metoo, what was its legacy really? In a way the story presaged a wave of high-profile dedication to sexual assault reporting across news organizations, as well as attacks from many \u2013 including the president and his supporters \u2013 that the media are an enemy who can\u2019t be trusted. The story\u2019s trail of destruction was also significant for the people directly involved.

Shortly thereafter, the story of Rolling Stone\u2019s reporting failure would eclipse the larger problem of the systematic abuse and mistreatment of women across college fraternities and beyond \u2013 even as it would help inspire a new commitment to tenacious sexual assault reporting down the road. Not that anyone would have predicted that at the time of publication. When it first came out, the Rolling Stone piece sparked protests at UVA, and the school announced the suspension of all college Greek life. Nationally there were petitions, op-ed columns, cable news conversations and tweets from politicians and celebrities, calling out fraternity culture. It\u2019s easy to see why so many reacted so strongly early on. Erdely\u2019s writing was almost devoid of the journalistic qualifiers like \u201callegedly\u201d, leaving the reader with the impression the events described were undisputed facts. The dialogue was sensational \u2013 it read like something from a movie.

Jackie had called up friends on the night in question, but the account she had given them didn\u2019t match what she\u2019d told Rolling Stone. But the culture wasn\u2019t primed to look for such inconsistencies. The years leading up to the publication of the Rolling Stone story had been a period of growth for sexual assault reform. The title IX civil rights law governing equity in college athletics had expanded to include cases of harassment and sexual assault, and the media were taking the topic more seriously. In 2012 there was blanket coverage of the Jerry Sandusky trial, the assistant football coach at Penn State convicted of rape and child sexual abuse. In 2013, two high school football players were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, following global attention to the case. And in 2014 \u2013 the same year the Rolling Stone piece was published \u2013 Columbia undergraduate Emma Sulkowicz received national attention for carrying her mattress around campus after the school declined to take action against her alleged rapist. Such a climate gave rise to a new heightened journalistic awareness around the need to be respectful and not retraumatize a source. But such considerations may have tipped Erdely toward being overly deferential. As the holes in her reporting were revealed, conservative backlash took root. The Federalist ran a story entitled, \u201cLeftist Media Show How Not To Defend Rolling Stone UVA Rape Story\u201d. The Daily Caller ran no fewer than 16 stories on what it termed the \u201cUVA rape hoax\u201d. Last year, during the confirmation hearings of supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Rolling Stone story was still being held up as a reason not to believe women. \u201cI\u2019m not saying #ChristineBlaseyFord is lying, but to those parroting the inane \u2018What woman would lie about #SexualAssault?\u2019 \u2013 line \u2026 Google any of these,\u201d one person tweeted, before listing Jackie\u2019s name in hashtag form. Another named Jackie as a reason to question Democrats who believe women\u2019s stories of abuse at all. Within the world of journalism, the UVA story has been instructive as a cautionary tale. \u201cThere was concern from some corners that showing the flaws in reporting would discourage victims from speaking to journalists,\u201d said Sheila Coronel, academic dean of Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and the lead author of the postmortem report on the story put out by the Columbia Journalism Review. Since then, Coronel told the Guardian, \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen much more rigorous reporting on sexual assault. We\u2019ve seen a lot of very persistent and admirable attempts to corroborate the accounts of women.\u201d Chief examples include reporting on Bill Cosby, as well as Pulitzer prize-winning investigations into Harvey Weinstein. And She Said \u2013 the book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on reporting out the Weinstein story for the New York Times \u2013 helped crystalize reporting lessons. But Coronel also noted that Erdely and her editors\u2019 mistakes should not be allowed to eclipse the larger problems the flawed story sought to illuminate. That also seemed to be a takeaway from an essay by Jia Tolentino in her debut book, Trick Mirror. In it, Tolentino \u2013 a UVA alum \u2013 seems to echo Coronel\u2019s point, delving into the nuances of what was, in fact, a pervasive and pernicious culture around sexual assault on campus, and one with a long history. Thirty years earlier, UVA student Liz Seccuro had been brutally gang-raped at Phi Psi. But when she finally brought her rapist to trial while Tolentino was still in school, Tolentino recalled little public reaction. Tolentino was among those convinced something happened to Jackie. Though the details of Jackie\u2019s account weren\u2019t accurate or reportable, perhaps, Tolentino reasoned, alterations she\u2019d made in the truth felt consistent with some level of injury she\u2019d endured. That might read like conjecture but the interpretation resonates with the experience of Tracy Tamborra, a professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven, who also worked for years as a director of a domestic violence services agency in New Jersey. Tamborra recalled to the Guardian how once, after a week of working with a client \u2013 a 19-year-old who\u2019d landed in the hospital having been visibly physically assaulted \u2013 she had sensed something was wrong with the story. After a frank conversation, the teenager admitted to having changed a key detail: she\u2019d been raped not by a neighbor, but by her stepfather. \u201cThe issue wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t raped, it\u2019s that the details of the rape were too painful to recount at the time of the exact moment of the investigation,\u201d Tamborra said. Nevertheless, after that, the police were reluctant to deal with the teenager, given the false report on her record. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the norm, but I do have a couple of stories like that,\u201d Tamborra said of victims whose narratives evolve. The scholarly work of Rebecca Campbell about memory recall at the point of trauma, further supports the observation. Victims very often can\u2019t recall specific information, according to Campbell, a professor of psychology at Michigan State University who studies sexual assault. Or they misremember things initially because of the way trauma affects the brain. In some cases, aspects of the story are so humiliating that stories are altered to fit a narrative that\u2019s more palatable either to the victim, a third party involved or the investigator. One bright spot of the cultural change though, is that the media, and in turn survivors themselves, are increasingly recognizing these complexities \u2013 as well as the spectrum of what constitutes sexual assault. That\u2019s according to Shana L Maier, a professor in Widener University\u2019s department of criminal justice whose research focuses on sexual assault and rape reporting. \u201cThe strength is awareness,\u201d Maier told the Guardian, \u201cencouraging victims to reach out for help and support and bringing awareness to the continuum of sexual violence. Victims thought it had to be the myth \u2013 the stranger jumping out of the bushes. And one of the benefits of the #MeToo movement is getting awareness out that there\u2019s a broad continuum for victimization.\u201d Not all of it is reportable.",

      "body": "<p>A man is met by the devil at the gates of hell with a greeting: \u201cYou killed 30 succulents. Do you know how hard that is?\u201d When this viral meme floated across my timeline, I\u2019ll admit I cracked a smile, but to me it also highlights one of the great indoor gardening myths: the idea is that cacti and succulents are universally easy to grow. Trust me, under the right conditions killing cacti and succulents is really quite easy, at least eventually.</p> <p>Fortunately, getting it right with these plants is almost as easy as getting it wrong, as long as you understand a few basic facts about their native habitat and how to replicate this at home. So here are two incredibly simple tips for success with these beautiful, popular and surprisingly forgiving plants.</p> <p>Cacti and succulents are species that have evolved in the arid regions of the world. Millions of years of natural selection have bestowed on them the remarkable ability to handle searing UV radiation, unrelenting drought and huge fluctuations in temperature. However, the very modifications responsible for these \u201csuperhero\u201d abilities often make these plants susceptible to the opposite environmental stresses, such as very low light levels and excessive moisture at their roots. Sadly, in most living rooms it is precisely these latter conditions that they are most likely to be subjected to, exposing them to their horticultural kryptonite.</p> <p>Most spots in everyday homes have nowhere near enough light to fuel their growth, especially in winter, causing the plants to react by stretching out their stems or leaves in search of the sun. If your once beautifully compact, dark green plant is starting to get long, pale and lanky, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>The solution is to place the plant as close to a window as possible, preferably a sunny, south-facing one. If you don\u2019t know which way your windows face, just click on any \u201cMaps\u201d app on a smart phone to find out. And when I say \u201cclose\u2019\u201d I mean really close. A maximum of 1m away from the glass is almost certainly the only spot where cacti and succulents will be truly happy in the average home.</p> <p>Curiously, the most common cause of houseplant death is overwatering rather than underwatering.

      "bodyText": "A man is met by the devil at the gates of hell with a greeting: \u201cYou killed 30 succulents. Do you know how hard that is?\u201d When this viral meme floated across my timeline, I\u2019ll admit I cracked a smile, but to me it also highlights one of the great indoor gardening myths: the idea is that cacti and succulents are universally easy to grow. Trust me, under the right conditions killing cacti and succulents is really quite easy, at least eventually. Fortunately, getting it right with these plants is almost as easy as getting it wrong, as long as you understand a few basic facts about their native habitat and how to replicate this at home. So here are two incredibly simple tips for success with these beautiful, popular and surprisingly forgiving plants. Cacti and succulents are species that have evolved in the arid regions of the world. Millions of years of natural selection have bestowed on them the remarkable ability to handle searing UV radiation, unrelenting drought and huge fluctuations in temperature. However, the very modifications responsible for these \u201csuperhero\u201d abilities often make these plants susceptible to the opposite environmental stresses, such as very low light levels and excessive moisture at their roots. Sadly, in most living rooms it is precisely these latter conditions that they are most likely to be subjected to, exposing them to their horticultural kryptonite. Most spots in everyday homes have nowhere near enough light to fuel their growth, especially in winter, causing the plants to react by stretching out their stems or leaves in search of the sun. If your once beautifully compact, dark green plant is starting to get long, pale and lanky, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. The solution is to place the plant as close to a window as possible, preferably a sunny, south-facing one. If you don\u2019t know which way your windows face, just click on any \u201cMaps\u201d app on a smart phone to find out. And when I say \u201cclose\u2019\u201d I mean really close. A maximum of 1m away from the glass is almost certainly the only spot where cacti and succulents will be truly happy in the average home. Curiously, the most common cause of houseplant death is overwatering rather than underwatering. Being natives of arid climates, cacti and succulents are especially vulnerable to this. It is particularly the case when their growth rate slows down in winter. Many commercial growers will, in fact, not water their plants at all for months on end between October and March, to avoid any chance of their roots rotting in cold, wet earth. As modern living rooms are far warmer than commercial cacti growers\u2019 greenhouses, I tend to split the difference and water them sparingly, perhaps just once a month, in this time period, slowly building this up to once a week in the summer. And if it makes you feel any better, I have killed far more than 30 succulents over the years, so I am certainly heading straight to The Bad Place. But with these two simple tips, you could spare yourself the same fate \u2013 and enjoy keeping your plants safe and healthy, too. Follow James on Twitter @Botanygeek",

      "bodyText": "The role of Dominic Cummings in plotting and facilitating Boris Johnson\u2019s drive for power has focused attention on the influence exerted by behind-the-scenes advisers and confidants who have the ear of prominent politicians. Powerful men and women around the world all have personal counsellors, trusted aides and backroom mentors. Then there are the \u201cinsiders\u201d \u2013 string-pullers, fixers and manipulators with ambitions of their own. Few become well-known, although Cummings\u2019s notoriety is by no means exceptional. For example, American presidents rely heavily on confidential advisers. Ronald Reagan employed some oddball figures, such as Col Oliver North of Iran-Contra scandal fame. He even consulted a personal astrologer, courtesy of his wife, Nancy. Donald Trump, a political neophyte, turned for help to similarly inexperienced people, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner and theFox News TV host Tucker Carlson, who personally persuaded him not to bomb Iran last June. The broader point is that leaders rely to a surprising degree on the advice of often unelected, unaccountable, and sometimes shady individuals who may decisively shape their ideas and direct their actions. Here we look at 10 of the world\u2019s less-known, most influential movers and shakers \u2013 the people who exercise power from behind the throne. Vladislav Surkov Russia The \u201cgrey cardinal of the Kremlin\u201d is an enigmatic figure. On paper, Surkov is a presidential adviser with responsibility for eastern Ukraine. But his influence reputedly extends much further. He rose to power with Putin in 1999 and was deputy prime minister until 2013. As the Kremlin\u2019s chief ideologist, he coined the term \u201csovereign democracy\u201d that underpins Putinism \u2013 an ostensibly open political system controlled from the top. Surkov, who has a theatrical bent, is seen as a skilled practitioner of the black arts of post-truth politics, including stage-managed social movements, influence campaigns, and fake news. Among other projects, he helped launch Nashi, the government-approved national youth activist group. He is also an intellectual chancer who pushes the boundaries, as shown by his risky suggestion this year that Putin himself was dispensable because Putinism is \u201cthe ideology of the future\u201d. Sibeth Ndiaye France Ndiaye is employed by President Emmanuel Macron to explain government policies as chief spokesperson with cabinet rank. But since her promotion in April, she has become a symbol and leading advocate for the inclusive, tolerant and generous France that Macron promised when he was elected. Born in Dakar, Senegal, and a naturalised French citizen for the past three years, Ndiaye has been attacked by the far right over her choice of brightly coloured clothes and occasional afro hairstyle. A former conservative minister, Nadine Morano, mocked her \u201ccircus outfits\u201d. \u201cAm I the target of racism? Yes, obviously, \u201d Ndiaye said recently. But as the first black woman to be spokesperson, she has also become the critical public face of Macron\u2019s bid, after a year of street protests, to get back in touch with the country, \u201cHe wants the second half of his term to be focused on proximity with our compatriots,\u201d she says. Ajit Kumar Doval India Popularly known as India\u2019s \u201creal-life James Bond\u201d, Doval is national security adviser to the Hindu nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi and reputedly his most trusted security and foreign affairs aide. Doval has become a cult figure in some quarters thanks to his background in intelligence-gathering, counter-terrorism and counter-espionage, including in Kashmir, Punjab and north-east India. According to some accounts, he lived under cover in China, Myanmar and Pakistan. When he feared identification as a Hindu due to his pierced ears, he had surgery to maintain his disguise, or so the story goes. Doval has been criticised for his hawkish views, known as the \u201cDoval Doctrine\u201d, especially on Kashmir, where he played a key role in the imposition of direct rule from Delhi earlier this year. He has argued that personal morality has no place in international relations. Stephen Miller USA Miller is a below-the-radar White House operative whose biggest achievement may be surviving the purges that brought down higher-profile figures such as Steve Bannon and John Bolton. Yet the youthful Miller, 34, whose official role is senior presidential adviser with responsibility for immigration, appears to have Donald Trump\u2019s ear \u2013 and to share his prejudices. He is said to have played a crucial role in formulating Trump\u2019s ban on migrants from Muslim countries and in the policy to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Opponents accuse Miller of being a closet white supremacist who promoted xenophobic, anti-immigrant and white nationalist views when he worked for former Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. A group of Democrat senators demanded his resignation this month. \u201cSimply put, Mr Miller is unfit to serve in any capacity at the White House, let alone as a senior policy adviser\u201d they said. Trump ignored them. Mohamed Hamden Dagalo Sudan The sinister face of Sudan\u2019s revolution is also the man who could yet undo it. Known as Hemedti, he heads the feared Rapid Support Forces (RSF), linear heirs to the Janjaweed paramilitaries who led the genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s. Hemedti was at the centre of the attempt to suppress the uprising that toppled Sudan\u2019s long-time dictator, Omar al-Bashir, in April. He and his forces were blamed for killing more than 100 protesters in Khartoum in June. But in subsequent power-sharing negotiations with the opposition, Hemedti emerged as deputy head of the transitional military council. Diplomats say Hemedti, whose family were camel traders and who enjoys the support of Saudi royals, hopes to become president. It\u2019s feared his ill-disguised ambitions, and the weak leadership of the council\u2019s head, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, could ultimately wreck Sudan\u2019s transition to civilian rule. Peter Altmaier Germany Altmaier has been described as the most powerful man in Berlin. If that\u2019s the case, it is because he has stuck close to Chancellor Angela Merkel, Berlin\u2019s most powerful woman. Since entering the Bundestag in 1994, Altmaier has served as chief whip for Merkel\u2019s CDU party, environment minister, head of chancellery, and economics minister, his current post. A centrist like his boss \u2013 though some on the right suspect him of liberal, Green-ish views \u2013 he helped Merkel manage the Greek bailout crisis and sustain her controversial open-door policy on Syrian refugees. He does have views of his own: in 2017, unlike Merkel, he voted in favour of same sex marriage. As the end of his boss\u2019s long reign approaches, Altmaier the confidential enforcer seems content to continue to pull the strings behind closed doors. His next crush? Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel\u2019s choice of successor, whom he has endorsed. Qassem Suleimani Iran The sinisterly handsome major- general in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and commander of its Quds Force, is responsible for covert operations abroad. He is one of the most powerful figures in the Middle East following a decade in which Iran\u2019s influence has spread. Whether the issue at hand is Bashar al-Assad\u2019s attempts to reassert control in Syria, the Houthi rebels\u2019 proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, the arming of pro-Iran Shia militias in Lebanon and elsewhere along Israel\u2019s borders, naval confrontation with the US in the Gulf, or the question of who governs Iraq, Suleimani is at the heart of the action, unseen, undemonstrative and apparently untouchable \u2013 the US and Israel have allegedly tried to eliminate him more than once. If anyone can stop Suleimani, it will be jealous mullahs in Tehran anxious to thwart his oft-denied political ambitions. Ibrahim Kalin Turkey Kalin is chief adviser and spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Given his impressive background as an academic and thinktank analyst, Kalin might just as well be called Erdo\u011fan\u2019s brain. Turkey\u2019s leader is widely viewed in Europe and the US as an impulsive, argumentative and authoritarian partner who is undermining Nato, in part by invading Syria and buying Russian missiles. It\u2019s Kalin\u2019s job to provide an alternative, more attractive narrative, and he does so with skill. In a recent article for Bloomberg, he turned the tables on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics. Turkey\u2019s vital security interests in fighting \u201cKurdish terror\u201d, seeking peace in Syria, settling the Cyprus question and rooting out coup plotters were not taken seriously by the west, he wrote. \u201cForeign policy is not a zero sum game\u2026 Turkey is as much entitled to protect its interests in the Middle East or Africa as are France or the US.\u201d Liu He China China\u2019s vice-premier and chief trade negotiator with the US had a fortunate start in life: he was a class-mate and close friend of Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s all-powerful president, at Beijing 101 middle school in the early 1960s. Following Xi\u2019s ascent to the top of the Communist party, Liu, a Harvard-educated economist, was parachuted into the politburo in 2017. In a fast-paced world of rival party cadres, where a nod or a frown from the president can make or break a career, low-profile Liu has the inside lane. Xi once described him as \u201cvery important to me\u201d. But he will need all the luck he can get if he is to prevent the trade dispute with Trump reigniting. This month\u2019s partial agreement damped the issue for now, but Chinese goods remain subject to $360bn in US tariffs \u2013 and China\u2019s economy is suffering. Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Cuba He is man with one of the world\u2019s toughest jobs \u2013 navigating a future path for Cuba in the post-Castro era. Named as president earlier this year, D\u00edaz-Canel is expected to succeed Raul Castro, the late Fidel\u2019s brother, in the more powerful post of first secretary of the Communist party in 2021. That would make him the first Cuban leader who is not a Castro since 1959. Yet D\u00edaz-Canel, a party technocrat with a reputation for competence rather than brilliance, may lack the charisma and authority of his more famous predecessors. He also has to deal with their legacy, which includes a deteriorating relationship with the US. Donald Trump\u2019s administration imposed new sanctions this year, and revived old ones, while vowing to vanquish the \u201ctroika of tyranny\u201d \u2013 Cuba and its allies in Venezuela and Nicaragua. D\u00edaz-Canel must show whether a backroom boy can lead from the front.",

      "body": "<p>In the corner of Matthew Indge\u2019s kitchen is a photograph of the entertainer Kerby Drill. For many years, Drill was both a clown and a comic voice of authority. He toured the nation\u2019s schools and appeared on television shows, often promoting road safety, until he passed away last year, aged 97. Indge describes him as his \u201cclown hero\u201d, but he recognises that Drill represents a very different era of clowning. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d Indge says, \u201cthese days, I don\u2019t know if kids are going to listen to a clown saying be careful on the road.\u201d</p> <p>Indge has been clowning for 32 years, since he was eight years old. In a way that wasn\u2019t necessary for Drill, Indge must now take steps to prove to his audiences that he doesn\u2019t represent a dark and sinister threat. When we meet, he\u2019s preparing for a performance as Zaz the Clown at a five-year-old\u2019s birthday party, and \u201cjust to save me any problems,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll make up in front of the kids\u201d \u2013 an attempt to provide reassurance that there\u2019s a benign performer behind the mask.</p> <p>As I sip tea from a mug printed with a photo of Indge dressed as an ostrich performing in front of a crowd of delighted children, he recalls how, as a child himself, he would borrow his father\u2019s shirts, cover them with badges, and join hundreds of other clowns for a triumphant annual convention and parade through Bognor Regis, his home town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68ad1f0048c9936dd4e2ab1496452cfb84040546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68ad1f0048c9936dd4e2ab1496452cfb84040546/0_345_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Who\u2019s laughing now?: Jenna Rothwell aka Minnie the Clown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who\u2019s laughing now?: Jenna Rothwell aka Minnie the Clown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 850 people attended the event in 1991, setting a world record for the largest gathering of professional clowns. More recently the parade has taken place only intermittently, but its glory years were instrumental in shaping Indge\u2019s view of clowning as an art form with near universal appeal. \u201cI still firmly believe that now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve entertained kids in the Ritz and kids on a rough estate in Brixton \u2013 <em>on the same day</em>. Same day, same act, very different people.\u201d</p> <p>Indge has performed for all kinds of audiences over the years. He tells me about gigs in airport terminals, at funerals and at a 21st birthday party in London\u2019s Fabric nightclub. Nowadays, he largely tours schools with his <a href=\"https://circuspazaz.com/\" title=\"\">Circus Pazaz </a>show. Wherever the performance might be, he tries to capture the innocent spirit of the clowns he was inspired by as a boy, which means actively avoiding the sinister side of clowning. \u201cI don\u2019t really \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 entertain that sort of genre at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of those scary movies.\u201d</p> <p>The movies he\u2019s talking about include <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/03/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-todd-phillips\" title=\"\">Joker</a></em>, this year\u2019s box-office hit. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck as he gradually transforms into a comic-book super villain, a process that culminates in a murderous rampage. The film plays on all our worst suspicions about clowns: that a sinister and unpredictable character lies behind the mask. In November it became the highest grossing comic-book film of all time.</p> <p><em>Joker</em>\u2019s UK release came just a month after <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/03/it-chapter-two-review-stephen-king-bill-skarsgard-andy-muschietti\" title=\"\">It Chapter 2</a></em> arrived in cinemas, itself released two years after the first big-screen appearance of Stephen King\u2019s creation, the murderous clown Pennywise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e1979f262068e38002ec3d1fcc9f7d0580477eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1979f262068e38002ec3d1fcc9f7d0580477eb/0_862_3744_4754/788.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The last few years haven\u2019t been the easiest of rides\u2019: Andrew Davis, president of the World Clown Association.\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The last few years haven\u2019t been the easiest of rides\u2019: Andrew Davis, president of the World Clown Association.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The recent box-office success of sinister clowns marks the peak of a process that began in earnest in 1990, when a television adaptation of <em>I</em><em>t</em> was first broadcast in the US. Since then, creepy clowns have gradually edged good clowns out of the public\u2019s consciousness. In a 2014 YouGov poll, 12% of British adults said they were either \u201cvery afraid\u201d or \u201ca little afraid\u201d of clowns. Two years later, coulrophobia \u2013 a term coined in the 1980s to denote a fear of clowns \u2013 was shortlisted by the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> for its word of the year (facing stiff competition from \u201cBrexiteer\u201d, \u201calt-right\u201d, and \u201cwoke\u201d; the winner was \u201cpost-truth\u201d).</p> <p>In his 2016 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/why-wouldnt-it-go-viral-clowns-are-unnerving-and-funny-at-the-same-time\" title=\"\">Bad Clowns</a></em>, Benjamin Radford writes: \u201cIt\u2019s misleading to ask when clowns turned bad, for they were never really good.\u201d Radford asserts that clowns and jesters have been ambiguous characters for hundreds of years. But he adds that the clowns of our nightmares have \u201cflourished and found fame\u201d in the past few decades. Clowns, as with everything else in modern life, have become polarised, leaving audiences unsure how to react to a performer in white face paint. As Radford writes: \u201cYou can no more separate a good clown from a bad clown than a clown from his shadow.\u201d So where does this leave our well-intended red-nosed comedians?</p> <p>A police siren screams before a voice announces over a loudhailer: \u201cHello, hello, hello.\u201d The speaker crackles. \u201cPC Bibbledy Bob here.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-47177281/life-as-a-clown-it-s-just-a-joy-to-see-people-smiling\" title=\"\">Rob Bowker</a> beams, then lowers the mouthpiece. He points to a yellow sticker attached to the bonnet of the miniature patrol vehicle parked outside his house in Tamworth. \u201cI\u2019ve even given myself a ticket,\u201d he says. \u201cFirm but fair; I was on double yellows.\u201d Next to us is Bowker\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Millie, who made her professional clowning debut this summer. She sits in the driving seat of a red and yellow clown car. \u201cI don\u2019t get tickets,\u201d she declares defiantly. \u201cI take them off.\u201d</p> <p>The jokes come frequently with Bowker. But, recently, he\u2019s been forced to get serious. In October 2016, clowns were in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. A \u201ckiller clown\u201d craze was sweeping the UK and the US. Individuals wearing clown masks were taking to the streets, terrorising children. As spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://www.clownsinternational.com/\" title=\"\">Clowns International</a> membership organisation, Bowker fielded calls from the nation\u2019s media. He warned that the craze was putting livelihoods at risk, and he expressed hope that he and his colleagues would soon be allowed to get back to funny business. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/14/scary-clowns-craze-joke-masks\" title=\"\">column</a> for the <em>Guardian</em>, he wrote: \u201cIn three weeks\u2019 time Halloween will be over and I\u2019m hopeful that the media frenzy will have moved on, leaving genuine clowns to do what we do best.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Bowker plays down the extent to which the creepy clown phenomenon has affected family entertainers. \u201cI think the public are actually crystal clear that it\u2019s two separate things,\u201d he says. But, occasionally, there are awkward moments, when the line between good and bad clowns becomes blurred. Bowker was recently booked to attend an event for a beer brand, but when he arrived he was asked to appear alongside burlesque performers. \u201cThere were people shooting nails through their nose and stuff like that,\u201d he says, recalling the incident with astonishment. \u201cWe were like: \u2018I think there\u2019s a miscommunication here. We\u2019re family, happy clowns.\u2019 \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0e533e64b25d4ca66172488ffa7d688a8af105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0e533e64b25d4ca66172488ffa7d688a8af105/0_342_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Sometimes I\u2019ll put the makeup on in front of the kids\u2019: Matthew Indge, aka Zaz, takes steps to show his young audience there\u2019s a benign performer behind the mask.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes I\u2019ll put the makeup on in front of the kids\u2019: Matthew Indge, aka Zaz, takes steps to show his young audience there\u2019s a benign performer behind the mask.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrew Davis was booked to perform alongside Bowker that day. When I arrive in Norwich to meet Davis, I am greeted by a man with white face paint and a red nose, wearing an orange bowler hat, white gloves and oversized shoes. Next to him, a battered brown briefcase rests upon a fully extended ironing board. As we stroll together through the city centre, Davis still clutching the briefcase and ironing board, he shouts a cheery hello to anyone who glances his way. Some people smile; most don\u2019t bat an eyelid. No one seems particularly scared.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he became president of the World Clown Association. In March, his inaugural president\u2019s message appeared in <em>Clowning Around</em> magazine. \u201cThe last few years haven\u2019t been the easiest of rides,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut we can leave all that behind us and concentrate on the future.\u201d When we speak, Davis pinpoints the start of clowning\u2019s recent troubles to the television adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s <em>I</em><em>t</em>. \u201cA bit of a bad press,\u201d he remarks with understatement. More than two decades later, in 2013, King\u2019s Pennywise made a series of mysterious appearances in Northampton, in what was later revealed to be a university student\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/16/clowns-northampton-diy\" title=\"\">prank</a>. Davis recalls the time with more than a hint of frustration: \u201cThe press and everybody picked up on it, ran the story, all of a sudden the whole world is scared of clowns again.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, Davis has thrown everything into clowning, including learning sign language after he was asked to perform at a deaf girl\u2019s birthday party. He looks back at the mistakes of his early days with horror. \u201cMy makeup was horrendous, my costume was terrible, my shoes were rubber overshoes,\u201d he says. Many hours were spent scouring library books and, more recently, YouTube videos to learn how to improve. That work never stops, he says: \u201cYou always want to be the best clown you can be.\u201d</p> <p>With this in mind, I can understand why Davis balked when asked to soften his clown persona. A few years ago he was invited to attend a birthday party without makeup. He refused, and the decision lost him the booking. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to continue with the red nose and the full paint,\u201d he says of his current approach, but he now gives parents a concession: if he must, he\u2019ll turn up without makeup. He also offers another character: Mango the Pirate. I suggest that in a decade\u2019s time, the bulk of enquiries he gets may be for Mango. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d he says. \u201cEven pirates get a bad rep.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Davis if clowning has a future, if the clowning livelihood is under threat, he shows me a clip from a 1964 clown magazine that refers to \u201cthe decline of clowning\u201d. Trends may come and go, he says, but clowning will always be here. Davis points to the enduring popularity of Ant and Dec. \u201cThe routines, the jokes and the way they tell the jokes are the same as the way two clowns would perform in the circus,\u201d he says, even if TV viewers don\u2019t make the connection. \u201cThey don\u2019t see them as clowns, because they\u2019re not wearing the nose.\u201d In that respect, Davis is in agreement. When I ask Davis what it is that makes a clown, he points to his nose. \u201cFor me?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the start.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, in Tooting, I visit Jenna Rothwell, who runs a company providing children\u2019s party entertainers while also performing as <a href=\"https://minnietheclownparties.co.uk/about-us/\" title=\"\">Minnie the Clown</a>. Rothwell offers a choice of entertainers. \u201cWe also do other things like princesses, superheroes, fairies\u2026\u201d she says, but her favourite character is the clown. With Rothwell\u2019s huge smile and rainbow-coloured costume, it\u2019s hard to imagine any kids being scared of Minnie. Still, some parents need convincing. \u201cThey need reassurance, some of them, for sure,\u201d she says. That pays off in the reaction from the children, she says: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got that face paint on, and the clothes and the big shoes, there\u2019s a different energy you get from the kids than when you turn up as a princess.\u201d</p> <p>Rothwell started clowning as a sideline, pursuing jobs as an actor, before realising she wanted to clown full-time. Does she think today\u2019s young performers will fall in love with clowning as she did? Rothwell says she sometimes ends her shows by painting children\u2019s faces. Some want to be pirates or superheroes, but others just want a white face and red nose. \u201cThat\u2019s just the best compliment, right? Whatever else they could be, they want to be a clown.\u201d</p> <p>On a Saturday afternoon in north London, I join 24 student clowns towards the end of a five-day workshop taught by the actor and director <a href=\"https://www.mickbarnfather.com/\" title=\"\">Mick Barnfather</a>. Each clown has a red nose hanging on elasticated string around their neck. At the start of one exercise, Barnfather reminds the students: \u201cNoses please, as is tradition.\u201d Barnfather tells me later he largely dislikes the red nose. \u201cI prefer to see people without that in performance,\u201d he says. \u201cIt puts me off.\u201d Nevertheless, he finds it can help students inhabit the clown persona: \u201cIt\u2019s just a little tool to hopefully make people feel and look a little more ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the students cringe at the idea that they might be associated with family entertainers. One, Nicola, laughs when I ask about the connection between their performances and the face-painted and floppy-shoed clowns of the public\u2019s imagination. \u201cIt\u2019s an art form,\u201d she says of the clowning they are here to practise. \u201cIt\u2019s just a completely different thing.\u201d</p> <p>But when the students discuss what inspires them about clowning, many use terms that I\u2019ve heard from other clowns in recent weeks: innocence, freedom, vulnerability. Nicola believes clowning offers something deeper than other forms of comedy. \u201cStandup is about your ideas and how clever you are,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is about who you are as a human being.\u201d</p> <p>At one point in the class, Barnfather invites six students to stand in front of the group. Playing the role of a casting agent, he tells the clowns they are there to recreate the mating call of a rhinoceros. During the exercise, laughter echoes around the hall; the comedy comes less from the animal impressions than from the unscripted exchanges as the performance moves in unexpected directions.</p> <p>After the exercise, the clowns remove their noses. Barnfather tells several of them they missed opportunities to escalate their performances, to be guided by the laughter from the crowd. \u201cOf course, you are going to do it again if you receive a compliment,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cIf you receive a compliment, if you receive the love of the audience, you\u2019re going to do it again.\u201d The clowns nod and take their seats. Another six students place red noses on their faces and step on to the floor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the corner of Matthew Indge\u2019s kitchen is a photograph of the entertainer Kerby Drill. For many years, Drill was both a clown and a comic voice of authority. He toured the nation\u2019s schools and appeared on television shows, often promoting road safety, until he passed away last year, aged 97. Indge describes him as his \u201cclown hero\u201d, but he recognises that Drill represents a very different era of clowning. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d Indge says, \u201cthese days, I don\u2019t know if kids are going to listen to a clown saying be careful on the road.\u201d Indge has been clowning for 32 years, since he was eight years old. In a way that wasn\u2019t necessary for Drill, Indge must now take steps to prove to his audiences that he doesn\u2019t represent a dark and sinister threat. When we meet, he\u2019s preparing for a performance as Zaz the Clown at a five-year-old\u2019s birthday party, and \u201cjust to save me any problems,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll make up in front of the kids\u201d \u2013 an attempt to provide reassurance that there\u2019s a benign performer behind the mask. As I sip tea from a mug printed with a photo of Indge dressed as an ostrich performing in front of a crowd of delighted children, he recalls how, as a child himself, he would borrow his father\u2019s shirts, cover them with badges, and join hundreds of other clowns for a triumphant annual convention and parade through Bognor Regis, his home town. More than 850 people attended the event in 1991, setting a world record for the largest gathering of professional clowns. More recently the parade has taken place only intermittently, but its glory years were instrumental in shaping Indge\u2019s view of clowning as an art form with near universal appeal. \u201cI still firmly believe that now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve entertained kids in the Ritz and kids on a rough estate in Brixton \u2013 on the same day. Same day, same act, very different people.\u201d Indge has performed for all kinds of audiences over the years. He tells me about gigs in airport terminals, at funerals and at a 21st birthday party in London\u2019s Fabric nightclub. Nowadays, he largely tours schools with his Circus Pazaz show. Wherever the performance might be, he tries to capture the innocent spirit of the clowns he was inspired by as a boy, which means actively avoiding the sinister side of clowning. \u201cI don\u2019t really \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 entertain that sort of genre at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of those scary movies.\u201d The movies he\u2019s talking about include Joker, this year\u2019s box-office hit. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck as he gradually transforms into a comic-book super villain, a process that culminates in a murderous rampage. The film plays on all our worst suspicions about clowns: that a sinister and unpredictable character lies behind the mask. In November it became the highest grossing comic-book film of all time. Joker\u2019s UK release came just a month after It Chapter 2 arrived in cinemas, itself released two years after the first big-screen appearance of Stephen King\u2019s creation, the murderous clown Pennywise. The recent box-office success of sinister clowns marks the peak of a process that began in earnest in 1990, when a television adaptation of It was first broadcast in the US. Since then, creepy clowns have gradually edged good clowns out of the public\u2019s consciousness. In a 2014 YouGov poll, 12% of British adults said they were either \u201cvery afraid\u201d or \u201ca little afraid\u201d of clowns. Two years later, coulrophobia \u2013 a term coined in the 1980s to denote a fear of clowns \u2013 was shortlisted by the Oxford English Dictionary for its word of the year (facing stiff competition from \u201cBrexiteer\u201d, \u201calt-right\u201d, and \u201cwoke\u201d; the winner was \u201cpost-truth\u201d). In his 2016 book Bad Clowns, Benjamin Radford writes: \u201cIt\u2019s misleading to ask when clowns turned bad, for they were never really good.\u201d Radford asserts that clowns and jesters have been ambiguous characters for hundreds of years. But he adds that the clowns of our nightmares have \u201cflourished and found fame\u201d in the past few decades. Clowns, as with everything else in modern life, have become polarised, leaving audiences unsure how to react to a performer in white face paint. As Radford writes: \u201cYou can no more separate a good clown from a bad clown than a clown from his shadow.\u201d So where does this leave our well-intended red-nosed comedians? A police siren screams before a voice announces over a loudhailer: \u201cHello, hello, hello.\u201d The speaker crackles. \u201cPC Bibbledy Bob here.\u201d Rob Bowker beams, then lowers the mouthpiece. He points to a yellow sticker attached to the bonnet of the miniature patrol vehicle parked outside his house in Tamworth. \u201cI\u2019ve even given myself a ticket,\u201d he says. \u201cFirm but fair; I was on double yellows.\u201d Next to us is Bowker\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Millie, who made her professional clowning debut this summer. She sits in the driving seat of a red and yellow clown car. \u201cI don\u2019t get tickets,\u201d she declares defiantly. \u201cI take them off.\u201d The jokes come frequently with Bowker. But, recently, he\u2019s been forced to get serious. In October 2016, clowns were in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. A \u201ckiller clown\u201d craze was sweeping the UK and the US. Individuals wearing clown masks were taking to the streets, terrorising children. As spokesperson for the Clowns International membership organisation, Bowker fielded calls from the nation\u2019s media. He warned that the craze was putting livelihoods at risk, and he expressed hope that he and his colleagues would soon be allowed to get back to funny business. In a column for the Guardian, he wrote: \u201cIn three weeks\u2019 time Halloween will be over and I\u2019m hopeful that the media frenzy will have moved on, leaving genuine clowns to do what we do best.\u201d Today, Bowker plays down the extent to which the creepy clown phenomenon has affected family entertainers. \u201cI think the public are actually crystal clear that it\u2019s two separate things,\u201d he says. But, occasionally, there are awkward moments, when the line between good and bad clowns becomes blurred. Bowker was recently booked to attend an event for a beer brand, but when he arrived he was asked to appear alongside burlesque performers. \u201cThere were people shooting nails through their nose and stuff like that,\u201d he says, recalling the incident with astonishment. \u201cWe were like: \u2018I think there\u2019s a miscommunication here. We\u2019re family, happy clowns.\u2019 \u201d Andrew Davis was booked to perform alongside Bowker that day. When I arrive in Norwich to meet Davis, I am greeted by a man with white face paint and a red nose, wearing an orange bowler hat, white gloves and oversized shoes. Next to him, a battered brown briefcase rests upon a fully extended ironing board. As we stroll together through the city centre, Davis still clutching the briefcase and ironing board, he shouts a cheery hello to anyone who glances his way. Some people smile; most don\u2019t bat an eyelid. No one seems particularly scared. Earlier this year, he became president of the World Clown Association. In March, his inaugural president\u2019s message appeared in Clowning Around magazine. \u201cThe last few years haven\u2019t been the easiest of rides,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut we can leave all that behind us and concentrate on the future.\u201d When we speak, Davis pinpoints the start of clowning\u2019s recent troubles to the television adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s It. \u201cA bit of a bad press,\u201d he remarks with understatement. More than two decades later, in 2013, King\u2019s Pennywise made a series of mysterious appearances in Northampton, in what was later revealed to be a university student\u2019s prank. Davis recalls the time with more than a hint of frustration: \u201cThe press and everybody picked up on it, ran the story, all of a sudden the whole world is scared of clowns again.\u201d Over the years, Davis has thrown everything into clowning, including learning sign language after he was asked to perform at a deaf girl\u2019s birthday party. He looks back at the mistakes of his early days with horror. \u201cMy makeup was horrendous, my costume was terrible, my shoes were rubber overshoes,\u201d he says. Many hours were spent scouring library books and, more recently, YouTube videos to learn how to improve. That work never stops, he says: \u201cYou always want to be the best clown you can be.\u201d With this in mind, I can understand why Davis balked when asked to soften his clown persona. A few years ago he was invited to attend a birthday party without makeup. He refused, and the decision lost him the booking. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to continue with the red nose and the full paint,\u201d he says of his current approach, but he now gives parents a concession: if he must, he\u2019ll turn up without makeup. He also offers another character: Mango the Pirate. I suggest that in a decade\u2019s time, the bulk of enquiries he gets may be for Mango. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d he says. \u201cEven pirates get a bad rep.\u201d When I ask Davis if clowning has a future, if the clowning livelihood is under threat, he shows me a clip from a 1964 clown magazine that refers to \u201cthe decline of clowning\u201d. Trends may come and go, he says, but clowning will always be here. Davis points to the enduring popularity of Ant and Dec. \u201cThe routines, the jokes and the way they tell the jokes are the same as the way two clowns would perform in the circus,\u201d he says, even if TV viewers don\u2019t make the connection. \u201cThey don\u2019t see them as clowns, because they\u2019re not wearing the nose.\u201d In that respect, Davis is in agreement.

      "body": "<p>Farewell to the 2010s. The decade was captured by an intellectually bankrupt right wing for all the wrong reasons, above all because of a fear of foreigners. Yet for all that, it did give us a measure of progress \u2013 from our smartphones to declining poverty, although even on that metric, Britain managed to buck a global trend. From the perspective of any British believer in Enlightenment values, good riddance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/17/decade-of-perpetual-crisis-2010s-disrupted-everything-but-resolved-nothing\" title=\"\">dying decade</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet in 2009, matters did not look promising for the libertarian right. New Labour had been in power for 12 years and on all the key challenges of the day, the only effective policy responses were forms of collective action, whether on climate change or terrorism, the declining effectiveness of antibiotics or the power of multinationals. The financial crash of 2008 was the consequence of hyper-deregulation, following the palpably absurd rightwing faith that markets were magic. The future lay with the left, natural believers in the power of good government and international co-operation, in particular the EU. Thoughtful Tories openly pondered whether they could ever win a general election outright again.</p> \n<p>What is obvious, looking back, is that the right did not so much win the 2010s as the liberal left lost them. And it lost because at bottom it has a fatal, divisive weakness. Lack of any agreement about what being liberal left can and should mean creates a sectarianism that unless confronted consumes it, the left defining itself as the custodian of the \u201csocialist\u201d flame and everyone else, in varying degrees, as a traitorous \u201cneoliberal\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/26/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-contest-left\">It isn\u2019t all about Rebecca Long-Bailey \u2013 Labour\u2019s leadership contest is wide open | Sienna Rodgers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The very term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\" title=\"\">neoliberal</a>\u201d has become a catch-all to indicate contempt for any policy position or political figure the left considers to be departing from true \u201csocialism\u201d, which in turn must be based on the subordination of capitalism to the state rather than its reform. This is rather as the right uses \u201cMarxist\u201d to describe any departure from ultra free-market principles involving state ownership or regulation. Is it Marxist for the state to own a railway or the national grid? Is it \u201cneoliberal\u201d to believe that some goals can be achieved without state ownership? It\u2019s a conspiracy by both sides against evidence, thought and practice.</p> \n<p>But on the left, the passions aroused created a never-ending sectarian war.

      "bodyText": "Farewell to the 2010s. The decade was captured by an intellectually bankrupt right wing for all the wrong reasons, above all because of a fear of foreigners. Yet for all that, it did give us a measure of progress \u2013 from our smartphones to declining poverty, although even on that metric, Britain managed to buck a global trend. From the perspective of any British believer in Enlightenment values, good riddance to the dying decade. Yet in 2009, matters did not look promising for the libertarian right. New Labour had been in power for 12 years and on all the key challenges of the day, the only effective policy responses were forms of collective action, whether on climate change or terrorism, the declining effectiveness of antibiotics or the power of multinationals. The financial crash of 2008 was the consequence of hyper-deregulation, following the palpably absurd rightwing faith that markets were magic. The future lay with the left, natural believers in the power of good government and international co-operation, in particular the EU. Thoughtful Tories openly pondered whether they could ever win a general election outright again. What is obvious, looking back, is that the right did not so much win the 2010s as the liberal left lost them. And it lost because at bottom it has a fatal, divisive weakness. Lack of any agreement about what being liberal left can and should mean creates a sectarianism that unless confronted consumes it, the left defining itself as the custodian of the \u201csocialist\u201d flame and everyone else, in varying degrees, as a traitorous \u201cneoliberal\u201d. The very term \u201cneoliberal\u201d has become a catch-all to indicate contempt for any policy position or political figure the left considers to be departing from true \u201csocialism\u201d, which in turn must be based on the subordination of capitalism to the state rather than its reform. This is rather as the right uses \u201cMarxist\u201d to describe any departure from ultra free-market principles involving state ownership or regulation. Is it Marxist for the state to own a railway or the national grid? Is it \u201cneoliberal\u201d to believe that some goals can be achieved without state ownership? It\u2019s a conspiracy by both sides against evidence, thought and practice. But on the left, the passions aroused created a never-ending sectarian war. Making the compromises necessary to create a governing coalition that could exercise power is not on its agenda: the left\u2019s struggle is all about fighting for and delivering a particular definition of socialism \u2013 or nothing. It was sectarianism that drove the enmity between the Blair and Brown camps in the New Labour government, setting up what was to follow. If David Miliband had fought either the 2010 or 2015 general elections, he would have denied David Cameron his majorities. But the Brown camp ensured any challenge before 2010 was likely to fail. Then Ed Miliband, a clever, values-driven politician but no national leader, did not resist Brown\u2019s intense, sectarian pressure to stand against his brother in 2010. The results we know. Scrapping Labour\u2019s carefully constructed electoral college system in which MPs, members and trade unionists each had a third of the vote for leader, Miliband created the route to power for Jeremy Corbyn after he lost in 2015. Corbyn may have been an iconic, pacifist, socialist idealist, but he was happier to campaign than govern and, as events would prove, could never be elected prime minister. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, and his ambitious, narcissistic henchmen drank the austerity Kool-Aid and signed up for a full-blown coalition with the Tories.

She\u2019s passionately captured here by Saoirse Ronan, who reunites with Gerwig after starring in her directorial debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/18/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-laurie-metcalf-observer\" title=\"\">Lady Bird</a></em> (a film that, with its focus on mother-daughter relationships, female friendship and creative ambition, contains a notable thematic crossover with <em>Little Women</em>). Wildly imaginative, unfashionably ambitious and mutinously ungroomed, she has been the formative girl-crush for generations of wannabe writers with inky fingers and unravelling pigtails.

Gerwig acknowledges the commercial pressure to marry off a fictional female character, and argues that the real happy ending is the publishing of Jo\u2019s book. That said, by casting Louis Garrel as Friedrich Bhaer, Gerwig ensures that Jo is not exactly short-changed in the husband department.</p> <p>In addition to Alcott, the main beneficiary of Gerwig\u2019s inclusive approach is the youngest March sister, Amy (a magnificent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tvandradioblog/2018/oct/06/florence-pugh-lady-macbeth-king-lear-le-carre\" title=\"\">Florence Pugh</a> \u2013 what a year she has had!). While other versions of the story have painted her as bratty and spoiled, here Amy and Jo are two sides of the same coin. The brightest, most talented, most headstrong of the girls, and given to unleashing rollicking hoots of laughter at each other\u2019s misfortune, they clash because their kinship is closer than they care to admit. At times, it seems as though this is as much Amy\u2019s story as Jo\u2019s.

Yorick Le Saux\u2019s camera clearly feels the same way \u2013 it is constantly sneaking smitten glances at Amy across crowded rooms. More than Emma Watson\u2019s decorative, dull Meg and Eliza Scanlen\u2019s sickly, reticent Beth, our eyes are drawn to Pugh\u2019s mercurial Amy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/04/greta-gerwig-lady-bird-interview-metoo-oscars\">Greta Gerwig: 'I'm at peak shock and happiness'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And it\u2019s in these chaotic rooms in the March family home that the film derives its giddy energy.

The home is a crucial element in Little Women. It\u2019s not Jo\u2019s escape to New York that allows her to find her creative voice, but her return to the heart of the family. And if that\u2019s not the perfect sentiment for holiday viewing, I don\u2019t know what is.",

      "body": "<p>On 27 December 2018, at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, I shifted uncomfortably on my small sofa in the freezing cold living room of my messy rented bungalow. I\u2019d passed out mid-bingeing on Richard Curtis films and whisky an hour or so before. My shoulders screamed in agony, my mouth was dry and gasping, my head was pounding. I put my feet on the floor and faceplanted the carpet, so shuffled to the bathroom on my stomach, falling asleep again on the linoleum floor, clutching the toilet bowl.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/alcoholism\" title=\"\">Alcoholism</a> had crept up on me, disguised as a friend to ease the social anxieties of newfound minor fame, a lubricant for awkward situations and parties where people I recognised from television peered over my shoulder while making small talk, looking for someone more noteworthy to flit off to chat to. I filled in trauma wounds with ethanol, I became louder, bolder, wearing my booze-soaked persona like armour against impostor syndrome and rooms full of thinner, more beautiful people.</p> <p>I found myself pinned to walls by household-name male journalists, who forced their hands inside my shirt and tongues in my mouth, while telling myself I had asked for it, getting in that state. I lost count of the number of boozy lunches with people I considered peers and colleagues that ended with disquieting gropes in the back of taxis and the niggling feeling that I should really stop allowing myself to be so vulnerable.</p> <p>That morning I lifted my head from the floor and threw up half a dozen times, guilt and grief and self-loathing wracking every trembling, retching pore of my body. I think I have a problem, I slurred to myself as I sank back to the ground, covered in vomit and sweat.</p> <p>I decided, then, that I would go sober. I\u2019d tried before, in secret, tipping all of the household booze down the sink and counting the days on one hand until I slipped up again. So, this time, I decided to let everyone else in on it. Not for glory, but for accountability. If everyone knew, there would be nowhere to hide. Nowhere to hole up and order a sneaky glass of wine or two. No excuses, no yellow cards.</p> <p>I walked into my local shop on 6 January 2019, and the owner called me by my name. \u201cYou\u2019re famous!\u201d he laughed, not unkindly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/05/jack-monroe-i-am-an-alcoholic-mea-culpa\" title=\"\">wielding a copy of that day\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/05/jack-monroe-i-am-an-alcoholic-mea-culpa\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em> at me. There I was, on the front page, declaring myself an alcoholic, for all the world to see. I took a deep breath. \u201cYes, that\u2019s me. And I don\u2019t want you to serve me alcohol ever again. It doesn\u2019t matter what I say, how much I ask, if I say it\u2019s for someone else, just don\u2019t serve me.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, understanding. I bought my paper and fled, embarrassed and ashamed. I hadn\u2019t expected it to be so prominent, but it was done now, and there was no going back.</p> <p>I slotted a piece of paper into my passport, with the words \u201cDo not serve me \u2013 I am an alcoholic\u201d in block capitals, and carried it everywhere. I used it twice. Both times, I burned with shame as the cashier read it, scanned my face for the moment of realisation and handed it back, sweeping the bottles of booze out of my basket and placing them out of reach behind the counter. \u201cJust go to the meetings, you don\u2019t need to tell everyone you meet that you\u2019re an alcoholic,\u201d my then sponsor sighed at me.</p> <p>I found a new sponsor; one with less interest in squeezing my thigh and referring to our meetings as \u201cdates\u201d. I found online meetings, plugged in to women-only groups with recovering alcoholics from around the world from the comfort of my garden chair or burrowed beneath my duvet. The convenience of being dialled into group chats with strangers, avoiding the glances or trying to place where we may have run into each other before, worked for me. </p> <p>And I <em>did</em> need to tell people. Because in my line of work there are always invitations, open bars, long nights and swanky clubs you can slip into if you know the right B-lister and are considered worthy of their company. Coming out publicly was difficult, and damaged some of my friendships and strained some family relationships, but I did it to be held accountable. And for the most part, it worked.</p> <p>When I launched my book <em>Tin Can Cook</em> at a pop-up kitchen in Hackney in the spring, my agent and longtime friend Rosemary brought me a bottle of rose lemonade. My friend and publicist, Jess, turned up with a blend of herbal tea and lemonade she had seen me post about on Instagram.</p> <p>For a friend\u2019s book launch later in the year, her publisher reassured me in the invitation that all of the drinks would be non-alcoholic. At my favourite private hideaway in Soho, the bar staff no longer took my order, but presented me with a double espresso and a large glass of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/09/is-kombucha-good-for-you\" title=\"\">kombucha</a> as soon as I sat down. </p> <p>I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my partner, Louisa. It\u2019s been a very difficult year in some respects; and there have been times where I have sat beside her at a dinner or out with friends, hissing out of the corner of my mouth that I am an adult and if I want a fucking drink I will have one. She has cut short many of her own nights out to come home and hold me, and on the occasions where I have fallen off the wagon, she has picked me up and set me back on my feet, without anger or judgment, just love and concern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c25345346bf46316525ae085e9d27c87cd29bc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c25345346bf46316525ae085e9d27c87cd29bc5/0_0_6718_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alcohol became a means for Monroe of helping to deal with the potentially awkward social encounters that come with public recognition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alcohol became a means for Monroe of helping to deal with the potentially awkward social encounters that come with public recognition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have gained literally hundreds of hours of time over the last year; where before I would spend my evenings drunk and my mornings in a fog of headache and nausea, now I go to bed early with crime novels or lengthy world war tomes about double-crossing agents, cold cases, or other similar genres.</p> <p>I made it my mission to \u201cgrow up and show up\u201d, having previously had a reputation for being flaky, late and unreliable.

We spend far more quality time together now, and the little boy who was at times anxious, awkward and painfully shy is flourishing under the warmth of genuine maternal attention and time spent doing not much at all. I always feared motherhood; growing up in a household where foster children came and went in a revolving door of trauma and disarray, I was continually petrified that I would never be able to be a proper mother to my son.</p> <p>Not a day goes by, yet, where I am not gripped by the desire to drink. Sometimes it is a fleeting temptation, batted away like a pesky mosquito; sometimes it is a mania that lasts for hours, hissing and whispering from the darkest parts of myself that oblivion is the safest place to be.</p> <p>I am contacted every day by strangers who want to ask me how I\u2019ve \u201cdone it\u201d.

You can have the gift of more time, more money, better health and healthier relationships, because a life beyond your wildest dreams and expectations awaits you outside of that bottle, not at the bottom of it.</p>",

Its cast is a who\u2019s who of Germany\u2019s best actors, headed by Liv Lisa Fries, playing the impoverished stenographer and aspiring detective Charlotte Ritter, and Volker Bruch, who plays her superior, chief inspector Gereon Rath.</p> <p>Both investigators harbour secrets, with Ritter turning to prostitution at night to subsidise her family, and Rath battling PTSD triggered by his experiences in the first world war as well as leading a complicated love life.</p> <p>The backdrop is 1929 in Berlin, a city in turmoil as it undergoes profound cultural, economic and political change. Nazis lurk in the wings, ready to exploit the desperation caused by poverty and unemployment. The foundations of the young republic show signs of crumbling and, as if in expectation of its imminent demise, the city\u2019s inhabitants, including the protagonists, indulge in a frenzy of dancing, drug-taking and cabaret parties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f5b824a030f58ceaced5943772bf249e9c9a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f5b824a030f58ceaced5943772bf249e9c9a5e/0_0_4588_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meret Becker, Jenny Schily, Leonie Benesch, Hannah Herzsprung, Liv Lisa Fries and Fritzi Haberland at the premiere of the third season of the TV series Babylon Berlin at the Zoo Palast in Berlin, 16 December\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left, Meret Becker, Jenny Schily, Leonie Benesch, Hannah Herzsprung, Liv Lisa Fries and Fritzi Haberland at the premiere of the third season of Babylon Berlin in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayoung Jeon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At its recent red carpet premiere in Berlin, and the after-party event in a dairy factory from the Weimar era, cast and audience members wore cloche hats, flapper dresses, spit curls and drag queen looks, underlining how the show has caught the public\u2019s imagination.</p> <p>A 1920s musical, guided tours of Weimar Berlin, including many of the locations in the show, a rise in popularity of burlesque nightclubs and table telephone bars, as well as a flurry of books and music, are among the cultural spin-offs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1012daed019200e340bc558d446991aff5d1083e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1012daed019200e340bc558d446991aff5d1083e/0_0_5333_3555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Lisa Fries plays Charlotte Ritter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liv Lisa Fries plays the aspiring detective Charlotte Ritter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: X Filme</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liv Lisa Fries, wearing a 1920s-style cinnamon taffeta gown at the premiere, has also become caught up in the craze. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating.

      "bodyText": "It has been sold to 100 countries, spawned international interest in the fashions of 1920s Berlin and, in 2020, Germany\u2019s first TV blockbuster of the streaming era returns for its third season, promising more murder and mystery in the turbulent days of the Weimar era. Based on the bestselling detective novels by Volker Kutscher, Babylon Berlin is the most expensive non-English language screen production ever. Its cast is a who\u2019s who of Germany\u2019s best actors, headed by Liv Lisa Fries, playing the impoverished stenographer and aspiring detective Charlotte Ritter, and Volker Bruch, who plays her superior, chief inspector Gereon Rath. Both investigators harbour secrets, with Ritter turning to prostitution at night to subsidise her family, and Rath battling PTSD triggered by his experiences in the first world war as well as leading a complicated love life. The backdrop is 1929 in Berlin, a city in turmoil as it undergoes profound cultural, economic and political change. Nazis lurk in the wings, ready to exploit the desperation caused by poverty and unemployment. The foundations of the young republic show signs of crumbling and, as if in expectation of its imminent demise, the city\u2019s inhabitants, including the protagonists, indulge in a frenzy of dancing, drug-taking and cabaret parties. At its recent red carpet premiere in Berlin, and the after-party event in a dairy factory from the Weimar era, cast and audience members wore cloche hats, flapper dresses, spit curls and drag queen looks, underlining how the show has caught the public\u2019s imagination. A 1920s musical, guided tours of Weimar Berlin, including many of the locations in the show, a rise in popularity of burlesque nightclubs and table telephone bars, as well as a flurry of books and music, are among the cultural spin-offs. Liv Lisa Fries, wearing a 1920s-style cinnamon taffeta gown at the premiere, has also become caught up in the craze. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating. I know a lot of people wanting to have their hair cut in a bob like Charlotte, who are wearing her cloche hat. They also like the real world of this film, and how my character boxes her way through this very male world to fulfil her goals.\u201d Its creators, the director-screenwriter trio Tom Tykwer, Achim von Borries, and Henk Handloegten said they sometimes had difficulty keeping up with reality, citing economic and political upheaval around the world. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to say it, but similar things are happening in the world today,\u201d said Tykwer. \u201cIt has also been one of the big challenges. We have had to keep reminding ourselves to stick to the point of view of the characters in 1929, otherwise it will become cheap.\u201d It has surprised some in the entertainment industry that Germany was so late in entering the field of television blockbuster serials, which has been dominated by the US, Scandinavia and the UK. On the eve of the launch of the third season of Babylon Berlin, and with a fourth season in the pipeline, Germany is now considered to be firmly established in the genre. A remake of Germany\u2019s hitherto most successful TV export, Das Boot, came out in 2018 to critical acclaim. Other series, such as Der Pass (Pagan Peak) and Acht Tage (8 Days) are also making an international impact. Deutschland 83, a drama based on recent German history, is particularly popular in the US and is also about to launch its third season. The sci-fi eco thriller Der Schwarm (The Swarm), based on a popular novel by Franz Sch\u00e4tzing, is creating a buzz even before shooting starts next year. But critics in Germany have taken umbrage at the extent to which the compulsory TV licence fee, one of the highest in the world, has provided the bulk of the \u20ac40m (\u00a334m) funding for Babylon Berlin, which is co-financed and produced with Sky, whose subscribers will see it in January. German terrestrial television will not broadcast season three until the autumn. Tykwer, also known for Run Lola Run and Perfume, defended the model. \u201cMany more people \u2013 something like 10 times as many \u2013 watched the first two seasons on the public television station ARD,\u201d he said. \u201cThe year before it was shown on ARD, it didn\u2019t really exist for most German viewers, most of whom, I have to say, are still watching linear television.\u201d Season three was kept under wraps until its premiere in December but the Guardian was allowed on to the Studio Babelsberg set.

The 30ft-high barrier is under construction on the edge of the San Bernardino national wildlife refuge in south-eastern Arizona, where rare desert springs and crystalline streams provide the only US habitat for the endangered freshwater R\u00edo Yaqui fish. The region\u2019s water reserves are already depleted due to prolonged drought and record high temperatures linked to the climate crisis. The expansion of water-intensive crops such as alfalfa and pecan farms is also draining aquifers in the arid region. Now, experts fear that construction of this 20-mile stretch of Trump\u2019s wall, which began in October, has reduced spring flow and groundwater levels in San Bernardino which provide scarce habitat for the Yaqui topminnow, chub, beautiful shiner and the most vulnerable, the Yaqui catfish. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason to believe that the Yaqui fish\u2019s only US habitat is drying up as a result of tens or hundreds of thousands of gallons of groundwater being pumped to build the border wall,\u201d said Laiken Jordahl, a borderlands campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity who recently visited the area. In September, the Trump administration pledged to erect 450 to 500 miles of the wall by the end of 2020, an ambitious undertaking to be partially funded by $6bn previously earmarked for defense and counter-drug programmes. Construction in Arizona and New Mexico is under way, despite multiple ongoing lawsuits challenging the constitutional basis of Trump\u2019s executive orders which diverted billions of defense dollars to the wall by declaring a national emergency in February. Despite the potential for far-reaching long-term consequences, details about the plans are sparse since the government suspended 28 federal laws mandating protections and oversight, relating to clean air and water, endangered species, public lands and the rights of Native Americans, in order to expedite construction. The waiver includes the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), considered the cornerstone of environmental protection in the US, the Endangered Species Act, National Fish and Wildlife Act and Migratory Bird Conservation Act. These laws require robust scientific, environmental and costs analysis before projects can be sanctioned. \u201cWith his wall obsession, President Trump has created an environmental crisis at the border,\u201d said the Arizona congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva. \u201cThrough environmental waivers and stolen funds, he\u2019s building a wall that will deplete precious water resources, desecrate sacred sites and destroy the environmental treasures and biodiversity that make the borderlands unique.\u201d Jordahl added: \u201cThe wall could not be built without the waiver.

This wall is an unjustifiable project.\u201d More than 100 miles of the new border wall have been slated for Arizona, costing roughly $14m a mile, according to the US army corps of engineers. Thirty-seven federally listed endangered and threatened species live around the Arizona-Mexico border. The Arizona stretch will need at least 50 million gallons of water, according to Gary Nabhan, an agricultural ecologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson investigating food and water security on the borderlands. (US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it was still working with the army corps of engineers to estimate the volume of water required for construction and dust suppression.)

In addition to the Yaqui fish, water depletion also threatens federally protected Chiricahua leopard frogs, Huachuca water umbel, Mexican garter snakes and Aplomado falcon, as well as the San Bernardino springsnails which are confined to a couple of fragile springs. The impenetrable bollard wall also encroaches into a crucial migratory corridor where \u201cSombra\u201d, one of just three known surviving jaguars in the region, most likely crossed into the US from Mexico.

He then makes it two in a row with a compact glance, beating fine leg again. A third boundary later in the over!

He is the 13th highest Test wicket-taker among all Australian bowlers and will be forever remembered for the hat-trick he claimed on his birthday against England at the \u2018Gabba in 2010.</p> <p>Justin Langer, the Australian Men\u2019s Team Head Coach, described Siddle as a true team man.</p> <p>\u201cThe year after I retired from playing, Matty Hayden and Ricky Ponting were raving about this guy called Peter Siddle,\u201d Langer said. \u201cIf it came from them, you knew it was right and so it proved throughout his brilliant international career.</p> <p>\u201cHe is an unbelievable bloke and an extremely good cricketer. He is the everything of what a team player is. He has given his heart and soul to the Australian team and the game of cricket.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll always be thankful to him for what he\u2019s given to the national team, and for the critical role he played in helping us retain the Ashes in England this year. He\u2019s going out when he\u2019s still playing well which, in a perfect world, is something every athlete wants to do.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Paine, the Australian Men\u2019s Team Captain, thanked Siddle for his exemplary service to Australian and international cricket.</p> <p>\u201cSids has been the heart and soul of the team for a long time,\u201d Paine said. \u201cI remember coming up through with him through the academies and even back then he was one of the great team men, something he has continued to this day.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a massive heart and is a fantastic bowler. He\u2019ll be very much missed around the group. He\u2019s been unbelievably good for our younger fast bowlers over the last 18 months and been a great support for me during that time, as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see him leave international cricket, but the time is right for him.

He is a terrific competitor, a humble person and exemplifies the values of Australian cricket.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to his 67 Tests, Siddle also represented Australia in 20 One-Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals.</p> <p>He will continue to play cricket at domestic level, including for the Adelaide Strikers in this year\u2019s KFC BBL and for Victoria in the Marsh Sheffield Shield.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e07e97e8f08c39722641ab1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T23:49:27.742Z\">11.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>49th over: Australia 153-4 (Wade 23, Head 20)</strong> More of the same, Wagner banging it in at Wade who does what he needs to do keep the board moving.

Third innings declaration runs, typically acquired on the fourth day, are part of this rhythm. There\u2019s no spinning the fact that this is where we are, with Australia preparing to resume this morning already some 456 runs ahead in their second innings. </p> <p>But let\u2019s look at this another way. Isn\u2019t a big part of the reason why we as lovers of our game tell anyone who\u2019ll listen Test Match cricket is the greatest sport of all due to the elation we get when all four results are possible late on day five? Of course it is. But if that was the case in every Test, would those special moments be so memorable? Don\u2019t we need the drab days make the Headingley Miracle - or any number like it over the last 142 years - so much more meaningful when the come? </p> <p>I spent today sitting in a studio talking about the fixture taking place over in Pretoria between South Africa and England. The visitors limped and stuttered their way through more than half a day with the ball. That half their team have been struck down with gastro - including two more this morning - gave the impression that they were going to be sliced and diced in three days. Three hours later, they are a sniff at a comeback that would be in the same bracket as Leeds. </p> <p>Sure, that isn\u2019t going to happen here. Australia will declare at some stage today setting the Black Caps an impossible target - maybe 500, maybe 550. But the very fact that we are going to take it all in together anyway, finding meaning where we can and enjoying excellence as it is presented - especially when the local quicks are let loose, so superb the first time around - is the investment we make to earn the elation of a huge payoff when a Test does go down to the wire, as tomorrow\u2019s in South Africa might. This is all part of it. We get stuck in and watch it anyway. <br></p> <p>Good morning to you all. <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">Let\u2019s talk. <br></a></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s your match report: Well, that was comprehensive. Australia dominant across all four days of this MCG Test despite Tom Blundell\u2019s rearguard century today and a couple of awkward partnerships. This has been an extremely disappointing tour from New Zealand who arrived with such hope but will trudge to Sydney with their tail between their legs. The opposite is the case for Australia who are now rampant with a thrilling attack and runs flowing from batsmen not just called Smith. Thanks for joining us again today, and throughout the Test. We\u2019ll see you again next year in Sydney. Travis Head named player of the match for his first-innings 114. Tim Paine: \u201cBatters applied themselves on day one... James Pattinson started the rot today and we all shared the load.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re playing well but we need consistency, all the guys stepping up, not just one or two contributing, and that\u2019s starting to happen.\u201d Kane WIlliamson: \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite at our best\u201d explains the Kiwi skipper about day one, when he inserted Australia after winning the toss. He then credits Australia\u2019s attack for being the difference in the match. \u201cTheir pace, bounce and accuracy\u201d in particular. Trent Boult does not come out so New Zealand are all out. Australia complete a thumping victory. Oh no! Blundell will not carry his bat after all, holing out to Lyon off Labuschagne. The end of a quite brilliant innings. 71st over: New Zealand 240-8 (Blundell 121, Wagner 6) Another four! Another c&amp;b drop! It\u2019s all happening late on at the MCG! Blundell carves Labuschagne through the covers then offers a very gettable return chance but the bowler flinches in his follow through and shells the mistimed drive. Blundell dismisses the rare error and whacks another boundary through wide long-on. But then... 70th over: New Zealand 232-8 (Blundell 113, Wagner 6) Just to reinforce his alpha status today, Blundell is now batting in his black cloth cap while there are spinners bowling in tandem. Liberated from his helmet he smashes consecutive fours off Lyon through midwicket. Wagner gets in on the act, bludgeoning Lyon back down the ground for four meaty runs. Technically that might have been a missed caught and bowled opportunity but that was like trying to grab a fast-moving freight train. 69th over: New Zealand 219-8 (Blundell 104, Wagner 2) Blundell makes a few runs and Wagner survives another handy Labuschagne over. 68th over: New Zealand 216-8 (Blundell 101, Wagner 2) There\u2019s no official word on Trent Boult yet, but we\u2019re not expecting him to bat with broken hand, so this is effectively the last wicket partnership. Australia have 55 minutes to end it. Yes, no, waiting, sorry. Chaos out in the middle for New Zealand, and it ends with Tim Southee trudging off. He dabbed what should have been an easy single into the off-side but there was hesitation in the call and by the time Pattinson threw the ball into Paine\u2019s gloves both batsmen were at the non-striker\u2019s end. The end is nigh. 67th over: New Zealand 214-7 (Blundell 101, Southee 2) Marnus Labuschagne is tossed the ball and he shows why with an opening delivery that draws Blundell forward before spinning past the centurion\u2019s outside edge. A very promising maiden from the part-time leggie. 66th over: New Zealand 214-7 (Blundell 101, Southee 2) The official word from the ground is that the extra half-hour will be taken to achieve a result tonight (on top of the half hour allowed for the sides to get through their allotted overs). In other words we could be here until 6.30pm. If we end up requiring tomorrow... A fine Santner innings ends tamely when he goes back to a Lyon delivery that turns and just grazes his outside edge before nestling in Paine\u2019s gloves. 65th over: New Zealand 210-6 (Blundell 100, Santner 26) Late on a hot day, with an old ball, Pat Cummins is still bending his back, but this has been a long old slog for Australia since lunch. Blundell gets to three figures the first ball of Cummins\u2019 over, and the MCG erupts. A clip just wide of midwicket precedes a scamper and a well-judged single. Blundell removes his helmet, soaks up the adulation, and savours the innings of his life. 64th over: New Zealand 208-6 (Blundell 99, Santner 25) Four dots from Lyon to Blundell then some neat footwork engineers the batsman enough space to clip a single to long-on. New Zealand\u2019s opener advances to 99! 63rd over: New Zealand 207-6 (Blundell 98, Santner 25) Blundell safely navigates another Cummins over and moves to 98 with his latest compulsive hook. Looks like we\u2019re going to be coming back tomorrow after all. If we do, conditions are going to be brutal. 40C with gale force northerly winds. Yuk. 62nd over: New Zealand 206-6 (Blundell 97, Santner 25) Santner cuts Lyon for three to push New Zealand beyond 200 and bring Blundell on strike. The opener then survives a bat-pad that spent an age in the air but landed in an unguarded zone at leg-slip. Santner calls his colleague through for a single then dumps Lyon over long-on, much to the delight of the vocal Kiwi contingent in the stands. 61st over: New Zealand 198-6 (Blundell 96, Santner 18) Cummins replaces Pattinson and the change benefits the becalmed Blundell who plays an angled dab with soft hands to earn his first boundary in age through third-man. The Kiwi opener has been scoring slowly for a while now, but it\u2019s not been a nervous 90s for Blundell, more a patient pre-ton passage. 60th over: New Zealand 194-6 (Blundell 92, Santner 18) Blundell\u2019s been doing it in singles for about an hour now, and that continues in Lyon\u2019s latest over. The Australian spinner hasn\u2019t ragged that many this afternoon but he gets one to grip and spit past Santner\u2019s edge that may introduce an element of doubt into the left-hander\u2019s mind. 59th over: New Zealand 193-6 (Blundell 91, Santner 18) Santner is growing into his knock and he repels a Pattinson over without much difficulty. Australia\u2019s seamers have found very little sideways movement today. During that previous Lyon over Mitchell Starc did some fielding that ended with him grimacing and holding his knee. He\u2019s still out on the ground but he\u2019s in some discomfort. One to keep an eye on. 58th over: New Zealand 193-6 (Blundell 91, Santner 18) Santner looks all at sea against the quicks but a million dollars against the spin of Nathan Lyon. Another over, another boundary for the Kiwi no.8, two in fact, the first carved behind the point, the second driven against the spin through mid-on. 57th over: New Zealand 184-6 (Blundell 91, Santner 9) Pattinson is on the money, almost trapping Blundell LBW before whistling one past Santner\u2019s outside edge. The latter then escapes despite clipping off his hip in the air in the region of square leg. 56th over: New Zealand 182-6 (Blundell 90, Santner 8) Santner strikes another boundary off Lyon, this time skipping down the pitch then timing a lofted straight drive back over the bowler\u2019s head. No alarms for New Zealand that over. 55th over: New Zealand 178-6 (Blundell 90, Santner 4) An eventful maiden over from Pattinson. Blundell lives to fight another day. Not out! Blundell\u2019s review is successful with DRS indicating the ball was bouncing over the bails. It did look a bit trigger happy from Nigel Llong for such a short delivery. Pattinson takes over from Starc and from the third ball of his over he has Blundell LBW... but the batsman reviews immediately. 54th over: New Zealand 178-6 (Blundell 90, Santner 4) Santner gets off the mark with a very nicely timed back-foot drive through the covers. off Lyon Blundell creeps into the 90s. 53rd over: New Zealand 173-6 (Blundell 89, Santner 0) Blundell continues to hook compulsively, but his latest swipe to a Starc bouncer flies safely down to fine-leg. The resulting single invites Santner onto strike, and the no.8 looks ill-equipped to deal with Starc\u2019s thunderbolts for long. 52nd over: New Zealand 172-6 (Blundell 88, Santner 0) What does Blundell do now? Does he go all out for his ton and forget about the match situation? The Kiwis are effectively seven-down remember because Trent Boult has a broken hand. Another one goes, and it\u2019s little surprise it\u2019s CdG. One could charitably describe his brief innings as enterprising, but the more critical would call it reckless. One attempt to force the issue too many ends with a flick to leg coming off a thick inside-edge and travelling to the safe hands of Warner on the 45 at short fine-leg. Lyon is doing the job just when his team needed him to. 51st over: New Zealand 170-5 (Blundell 88, de Grandhomme 7) An all action over that goes for eight and provides half-chances from nearly every delivery. First off Starc finds the shoulder of de Grandhomme\u2019s bat, but inexplicably there\u2019s no gully in place to accept the catch - despite that being exactly how CdG was dismissed in the first innings. With Blundell on strike the pattern of previous overs is repeated, the batsman taking on the short ball, and getting away with it, just, hooking fractionally short of fine leg. CdG then teases point with a square cut that\u2019s only a few inches over the leaping fielder as it travels to the boundary. 50th over: New Zealand 162-5 (Blundell 87, de Grandhomme 1) CdG is busy at the crease, and it eventually earns him the run he craved to get off the mark, but Lyon\u2019s guile unsettled him. Breakthrough over for Australia, can they capitalise before the end fo the day? Lyon with a huge breakthrough! He almost gets Watling with a top-edged sweep but he strikes soon after, getting one to rip through his gate from outside off, taking an inside-edge on its way through to Warner at leg-slip. Two handy partnerships in a row for the Kiwis but they\u2019re running out of bodies. 49th over: New Zealand 159-4 (Blundell 87, Watling 20) Ooooh! Just as Ricky Ponting on TV was demanding Australia go short to the compulsive hooker Blundell, Starc does go short, Blundell does hook, and he feathers a tiny edge that flies agonisingly over the leaping Tim Paine behind the stumps. That has to be the home side\u2019s plan of attack for the foreseeable. 48th over: New Zealand 153-4 (Blundell 82, Watling 19) Blundell again uses his feet to Lyon, and again takes the aerial route, this time earning four through long-on. He then offers a half-chance to the spinner when he belts a full toss just to the right of the diving bowler. After jogging a single Watling takes up the charge, using his feet and clipping four through midwicket. The Kiwis in the crowd are making plenty of noise. Two partnerships in a row at the MCG that have caused Australia problems on a surface that is as flat and even-paced as it has been all Test. 47th over: New Zealand 144-4 (Blundell 77, Watling 15) Starc replaces Cummins but this pair now have the measure of the surface. Blundell is happy to take on the short ball, hooking safely for one, while Watling is untroubled in defence. 46th over: New Zealand 143-4 (Blundell 76, Watling 15) After re-establishing their partnership after tea New Zealand are easing their way back into the runs. Watling collects four off Lyon with some handy footwork engineering enough space to guide a late cut down to the third-man fence. 45th over: New Zealand 139-4 (Blundell 76, Watling 11) Watling moves into double figures, and brings up the 50 partnership in the process, with a well-timed cover drive for three after Cummins errs in length. 44th over: New Zealand 136-4 (Blundell 76, Watling 8) That\u2019s a welcome livener, Blundell using his feet and chipping Lyon for a couple down to cow corner. 43rd over: New Zealand 134-4 (Blundell 74, Watling 8) Cummins finds a genuine edge from Watling pushing forward but the batsman played it with an angled bat and the ball died well in front of second slip. There\u2019s an end-of-the-day feel to proceedings already, despite 130-minutes of play still to go. The batsmen are focussed on defence, the fielding side isn\u2019t getting much life out of the pitch, and the crowd has reached that state of inebriation where the scene has that dull roar of a soundtrack. 42nd over: New Zealand 133-4 (Blundell 73, Watling 8) Lyon is tossing the ball up, aiming for the footmarks wide outside the right-hander\u2019s off-stump. The majority are hitting that region, and turning and bouncing, but Watling is equal to them. He eschews defence against the final delivery of the over, and almost regrets it, when his whip to the on-side floats off a leading edge, but it lands safely. 41st over: New Zealand 131-4 (Blundell 73, Watling 6) Cummins shares duties after tea and he matches Lyon\u2019s maiden with one of his own. 40th over: New Zealand 131-4 (Blundell 73, Watling 6) Oooh, Nathan Lyon begins proceedings after tea and he almost jags Watling straight away but Labuschagne can\u2019t grasp a difficult diving chance at silly point after the batsman tickled an inside edge onto his thigh pad. Maiden. The final session of the day is almost upon us. The embarrassment that is modern over-rates means we\u2019ll be playing through until 6pm local time (30 minutes later than scheduled) and we\u2019ll still fall well short of seeing the remaining 40 scheduled overs bowlers. After their calamitous morning session New Zealand regrouped well during the afternoon and Tom Blundell is growing into an impressive innings. Australia may yet have to return tomorrow to complete their series victory. 39th over: New Zealand 131-4 (Blundell 73, Watling 6) The runs are starting to flow for New Zealand now. Blundell earns four of them the hard way - all run - with a square drive off Cummins, then he smashes four more with a classical front foot push just wide of the diving mid-off. This is turning into a coming-of-age knock for the makeshift opener. 38th over: New Zealand 123-4 (Blundell 65, Watling 6) Pattinson is back on; T20 one-over burst stuff from Paine in the last half-hour or so, but it doesn\u2019t work. Blundell smacks consecutive fours through the on-side, first through midwicket, then behind square, profiting on the bowler pitching too full and then too short. 37th over: New Zealand 114-4 (Blundell 56, Watling 6) Cummins replaces Pattinson from the Members\u2019 end and he\u2019s immediately driven calmly through wide midwicket for three by the busy Blundell. The strike is then rotated from four of the next five deliveries. Australia have adjusted their field, taking out third slip and placing them at short cover for Watling and second gully for Blundell. Is that an acknowledgment the pace has left this pitch once the ball ages a little? 36th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Blundell 51, Watling 4) Lyon returns after just the one over from Cummins and he almost buys a wicket when Blundell mistimes a clip to leg onto his thigh pad but the ball loops behind square and not to the man fielding under his nose. 35th over: New Zealand 106-4 (Blundell 50, Watling 4) Pattinson is bowling a top-of-off spell so far but Blundell is up to the task, clipping a couple to the on-side when the line leaks a fraction onto the batsman\u2019s pads, and then he reaches 50 by driving a long half-volley towards point for three more. Watling completes the two-three-four stepping stone of runs by drilling a gorgeous on-drive all along the carpet and into the sightscreen. 34th over: New Zealand 97-4 (Blundell 45, Watling 0) The ball change heralds Cummins\u2019 return to the attack in place of Lyon. After Blundell nicks a single Watling defends stoutly. 33rd over: New Zealand 96-4 (Blundell 44, Watling 0) Pattinson replaces Starc from the Members\u2019 end and he\u2019s immediately into a tidy line and length against Watling. Four deliveries into his over there\u2019s a conflab about the state of the Kookaburra and Nigel la la la la Llong invites the fourth umpire onto the field to furnish his heist movie metal suitcase full of replacements. The second ball of the over dovetails with the first to deliver a maiden. 32nd over: New Zealand 96-4 (Blundell 44, Watling 0) Blundell looks like he might just have singed a brain cell or two in this fierce heat. He\u2019s looking increasingly skittish at the crease, especially against Lyon, who moves his man across the crease like a marionette in a testing maiden. Can someone better than me at the internet do a remix of this featuring Nigel Llong? Please and thank you. 31st over: New Zealand 96-4 (Blundell 44, Watling 0) Blundell is living dangerously. After being beaten for pace with that LBW shout he then gloves a bumper down the leg-side that is only just out of reach of the diving Paine. He earns four for his troubles though, and three more with a nice checked drive down to long-on. NOT OUT - Nigel Llong was right, the ball pitched outside the line of leg-stump. REVIEW! Starc reckons he has Blundell LBW, Nigel Llong doesn\u2019t. 30th over: New Zealand 89-4 (Blundell 37, Watling 0) That partnership was getting irritating for Australia but some brilliance from Lyon and Paine has put them back on course for victory this afternoon. Nicholls greets Lyon\u2019s latest over by skipping down the pitch and belting him back over his head for six! Lyon responds by dropping his pace and executing a perfect off-spinning delivery that drifts in then spins away, beating the outside edge of a forward prod. So far so normal. But Paine is alert behind the stumps and whips off the bails in a flash, catching Nicholls with his back foot on the line, not behind it. The Aussie skipper tears away like Cristiano Ronaldo in celebration long before the DRS confirms the dismissal. 29th over: New Zealand 82-3 (Blundell 37, Nicholls 26) Starc is bowling with excellent rhythm but his over largely targeting the ribcages of New Zealand\u2019s batsmen fails to engineer a chance. Again, Nicholls hints that his aerial clip off his hip could lead to his downfall. 28th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Blundell 36, Nicholls 26) Lyon is on top of his duel with Blundell, working the batsmen over from both sides of the wicket and almost inducing a play-on. The opener holds his own though, even nudging his first run on the off-side this innings. 27th over: New Zealand 80-3 (Blundell 35, Nicholls 26) Nicholls clips Starc off his hip for two and in so doing gives square leg a sniff of a chance, but it\u2019s well out of reach. Australia trying to outmuscle New Zealand\u2019s no.5 midway through this fourth day. Nicholls survives though, and alongside Blundell he has posted the touring side\u2019s longest partnership of the series (in terms of balls faced). While Adam catches some z\u2019s (cuddling his life-size Peter Siddle dakimakura) remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. Thank you very much Adam. My condolences on Peter Siddle robbing you of endless material. If you get nostalgic for the venomous vegan he has a series of instructional videos on YouTube. My favourite is the bouncer edition where he terrorises some patsy on a net wicket that should be roped off with crime scene tape. 26th over: New Zealand 77-3 (Blundell 35, Nicholls 24) The Australian fielders are talking loudly around the bat. Simon Katich, also on SEN radio, reckons they are discussing their respective Australian Rules football careers. As my OBO colleague Sam Perry rightly says, cricket is just footy in the summer these days. Lyon concedes four singles this time around, the final of those very, very close to a run out. Indeed, had Cummins hit from mid-on, Nicholls was gone by a long way. And after that moment of chaos, drinks are on the field. New Zealand have made it through the third hour without loss, which isn\u2019t for nothing with both of these players trying to make a something of a statement before this Test is over. I\u2019ll take this moment to hand over to JP Howcroft. Thanks for your company. Bye for now! 25th over: New Zealand 73-3 (Blundell 33, Nicholls 22) Another instance in 2019 of the stumps being hit by the ball without the bails coming off! As it happens, Starc was over the line anyway, called a no-ball as he sent it down. It found Nicholls\u2019 inside edge, clipping the leg stump and ending up running away for a boundary with five added to the tally. He then makes it two in a row with a compact glance, beating fine leg again. A third boundary later in the over! It looked to have come off Blundell\u2019s backside rather than his bat but it goes in the book as runs against Starc\u2019s name. All told, 15 from the over after three maidens in a row. The final ball of the over was clocked at 152.4kph - whoa. \u201cYou\u2019re having a laugh,\u201d Brendon McCullum says of that reading on SEN radio. \u201cThat makes Henry Nicholls, who defended it easily off the front dog, the best player of fast bowling of all time.\u201d 24th over: New Zealand 58-3 (Blundell 28, Nicholls 13) A silly point is brought in for Lyon to dissuade Blundell from lunging at the off-spinner. It works, the opener reverting back to playing him from the crease before using his feet the take the catchers out of range. Nice cat and mouse stuff. Three maidens on the trot. 23rd over: New Zealand 58-3 (Blundell 28, Nicholls 13) A new spell for Starc, a maiden to begin as it was with Lyon. He was well above 140kph throughout to Nicholls, who had to deal with the usual complement of short stuff in addition to a couple of probing deliveries aimed right at his stumps. He\u2019s defending positively. 22nd over: New Zealand 58-3 (Blundell 28, Nicholls 13) Lyon immediately finds his range to Blundell, played with respect from start to end. A tidy maiden to begin. 21st over: New Zealand 58-3 (Blundell 28, Nicholls 13) Nicholls picks the right Cummins delivery to turn around the corner, beating long leg for four. Nice shot. Of course, the bouncer follows. He deals with it well. The next bumper is quicker again, ducked as soon as he saw it banged in. The New Zealand fans are giving the Barmy Army chant a razz, which I\u2019m all about. They have been fantastic throughout the week. The good news is that Cricket Australia are open to having them back again for Boxing Day soon. 20th over: New Zealand 54-3 (Blundell 28, Nicholls 9) Another strong lbw shout, Pattinson jagging back at Blundell and hitting him on the knee roll. Lyon at point says it is going over the top, which means he isn\u2019t getting a review; the subsequent TV projection confirms this to be the correct call. We\u2019re still waiting to find out from the New Zealand camp if Trent Boult will bat, by the way. I can\u2019t imagine why he would unless there\u2019s a realistic chance of them getting something out of it. 19th over: New Zealand 52-3 (Blundell 28, Nicholls 8) More good batting from Blundell, getting into position early to pull Cummins. There\u2019s no real doubt how this game is going to end but there is plenty to be gained for the new opener. Simon Katich is making some strong comments on SEN radio about the lack of tour games teams play before starting a tour in Australia, observing that it hurts the quality of the end product: the Test Matches. There was some fairly silly stuff floating around last week saying that the Black Caps should have been fine in Perth because they played England in Hamilton. That\u2019s not quite how it works. 18th over: New Zealand 50-3 (Blundell 27, Nicholls 7) Shot! Blundell has pulled really well, this time getting on the top of the bounce off Pattinson, hammering it in front of square leg. Head, sweeping on that rope, had no chance of cutting it off. The visiting fans are happy as it brings up the New Zealand 50. Pattinson is much fuller to finish, beating the edge on the angle away from the left-hander. 17th over: New Zealand 46-3 (Blundell 23, Nicholls 7) Cummins to Nicholls now, locating his inside edge within two balls. He gets better through the over, ducking and leaving nice and early. A reminder: New Zealand\u2019s target is (notionally) 488. There are 17,725 people in the MCG, bringing the overall attendance to 201,477. 16th over: New Zealand 44-3 (Blundell 23, Nicholls 5) At last a productive over for New Zealand against Pattinson. For the new man Nicholls that is important as he searches for a way into his groove, pulling a couple of times through midwicket. \u201cI was an early-adopter of all things Siddle and I love the way he\u2019s bowing out,\u201d writes Robert Wilson, who I instinctively believe on this point. \u201cI\u2019d have been sad if it was a total retirement. It\u2019s typical and somehow delightful that he\u2019s going to crack on and try to get another 1st class milestone under his belt. He always reminded me of Boxer, the dray horse in Animal Farm - solid, patient, often poorly-used and impeccably herbivore. It\u2019s in no way a diss. I once rode a dray. Size of a Sherman tank but the thing could truly move when it was in the mood, a horse that could take a hat-trick. I felt like a cork on a waterfall. Vale Siddle.\u201d Love. Now, this might be a bit much but, hearing him say that he will bowl till his body says no more, what if he goes around for four more years both in the UK and Oz? That would, dare I suggest it, bring 1000 wickets into consideration. Go on! 15th over: New Zealand 39-3 (Blundell 23, Nicholls 1) Gee whiz, Blundell leaves Cummins close to his body, the ball just clearing his off-stump bail. He goes for the inswinger at the timber next up, doing enough to beat the inside edge before hooping big down the legside. You don\u2019t see him bowl with conventional shape through the air too often - he looks pretty happy with how it came out. Maiden. 14th over: New Zealand 39-3 (Blundell 23, Nicholls 1) Blundell gets one away off his middle stump into the legside to open his account for the session. Nicholls\u2019 turn, looking pretty organised in defence, leaving well too outside the off stump. It prompts a shift to around the wicket with one ball to go, dealt with solidly. The players are back! That means Pattinson is back. He now has 81 Test wickets at 25 apiece, really making the most of this excellent comeback. \u201cImagine he takes seven or eight?\u201d says Damien Fleming on SEN Radio of his fellow Victorian. Dare to dream. Nicholls will be taking the first ball of this middle session. PLAY! Australia doing just as was expected. The 31 runs they added to start the day across 38 lacklustre minutes matter not at all now, Pattinson striking thrice in a hurry to set the final innings of this Test up for a very likely four-day finish. 13th over: New Zealand 38-3 (Blundell 22, Nicholls 1) Nicholls is walking out on a King Pair but avoids that with a single, driven past Starc. Blundell, who picked up one around the corner earlier in the over, deals with the last couple of balls of the session, clipping a single to fine leg to finish. That\u2019s LUNCH at the MCG, the Australians seven wickets from victory after a most productive 13 overs. Meanwhile, what a nightmare of a tour this has been for New Zealand with the bat, and specifically the captain Williamson who has made 57 runs in four hits. He was pretty unlucky there. You don\u2019t see many like that given out by the on-field ump. Taylor chops on fourth ball! Nothing special about the delivery but there\u2019s something special going on in this Pattinson spell - he has two wickets in the over and three scalps in nine balls. 12th over: New Zealand 35-3 (Blundell 20) Umpire\u2019s call! Pitching on off-stump, the DRS projection showed the ball JUST touching the leg stump. Because he was given out on the field, it is good enough to send the New Zealand captain packing for a duck. Disaster for the tourists. And clever captaincy from Paine, swinging Pattinson around to follow Cummins. HAS PATTINSON TRAPPED WILLIAMSON LBW? He\u2019s given out on the field, the New Zealand captain taking his time before sending it upstairs. Stand by! 11th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Blundell 20, Williamson 0) Starc is straight back after Pattinson\u2019s one, successful over. They must want him to have a crack at Williamson before the main man is set? Or changing ends? If the former, it doesn\u2019t here, Blundell taking charge of the whole over. After prodding unsuccessfully at the first ball, he builds in confidence by the end - defending solidly; calling loudly. 10th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Blundell 20, Williamson 0) That\u2019s rapid from Cummins to Williamson, flinging an accurate bouncer at his lid, the New Zealand captain swaying inside the line of it. No inch given throughout the over. 9th over: New Zealand 32-1 (Blundell 19, Williamson 0) The Kiwi crowd are giving the skipper Williamson a huge ovation as he walks out with two balls to go in the successful Pattinson over. Before Latham fell, they had another reason to cheer when Blundell clipped him through midwicket for three. The big quick is right on the button to New Zealand megastar, defending both into the off side. It is Pattinson to replace Starc and he\u2019s into the book with his fourth ball! It was a delivery Latham didn\u2019t need to play at - wide and full. It\u2019s edged through to Paine, who completes a tidy catch diving with two hands low to his left. 8th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Latham 8, Blundell 16) Cummins slips a quick delivery past Blundell\u2019s inside edge to begin, whacking him on the back pad. He\u2019s got a good temperament though, taking the next ball from the same angle into the legside for a single. Latham\u2019s turn now and he plays the shot of the morning, a glorious on-drive that races to the rope. The New Zealand fans love it. \u201cThis wicket is FLAT,\u201d declares the hopeful McCullum. The southpaw takes two more past square leg from the next before leaving the final offering. Seven from it. Nice. 7th over: New Zealand 22-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 15) Starc misses his line at Latham, a deflection off his backside running down to the fine leg rope. He\u2019s engaging the opener with a false stroke from the last delivery though, playing at an outswinger well outside the off-stump, his outside edge well beaten. Even so, I reckon it might be time for James Pattinson next up from the MCC End. Brendon McCullum has taken it a fraction further now on SEN radio, saying they\u2019ll win with Blundell making 120 and Williamson an unbeaten 240. That\u2019d be fun! 6th over: New Zealand 18-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 15) Cummins is slamming it in at Blundell, forcing him to use his bat early in the over before beating both edges by the time his maiden is complete. He\u2019s in the form of his life. 5th over: New Zealand 18-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 15) More good batting from Blundell, waiting for a straighter Starc ball to take a single. Latham is less at ease, copping a nasty blow on the arm when trying to get out of the way from a bumper. Looked to hit him on the elbow - they cross for a leg bye. Blundell goes again through square leg, timing it out to the rope, denied a third boundary from some sharp tandem fielding on the rope by the Australians. He\u2019s 15 from 19. \u201cThis wicket is getting better and better,\u201d says Brendon McCullum on SEN. He thinks they will be two down overnight and will draw it tomorrow. \u201cYou have to think like that.\u201d 4th over: New Zealand 13-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 11) Cummins v Latham was an excellent contest yesterday and looks it again already here, this maiden from around the wicket forcing the opener to use his bat in response to every delivery. 3rd over: New Zealand 13-0 (Latham 2, Blundell 11) Latham misses a clip down the legside early in the over but the Australians are up for caught behind - that\u2019s definitely not out - but he does get off strike with one behind square from the next ball. Blundell deals with the rest quite comfortably. He looks up for this. 2nd over: New Zealand 12-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 11) Cummins is right on it to Blundell and up go the Australians for a second big shout! It\u2019s angled in nicely to beat the inside edge but it is too high to seriously consider a review. The opener keeps his cool after the appeal, responding with a punishing pull shot through midwicket for his second boundary. Have that, Pat! A fun start to this innings. \u201cNow that he\u2019s announced his retirement, I feel kinda bad that I\u2019ve been moaning to anyone who\u2019d listen since before the last Ashes that the selectors needed to put Sidds out to pasture,\u201d acknowledges John Phaceas. \u201cGreat servant, team man, and metronomic bowler over many years. Well done Peter Siddle, you have served Australia valiantly. But let\u2019s be honest, you can\u2019t truly be a red-blooded, helmet-cracking, Aussie nasty fastie if you\u2019re a 30-bananas a day vegan.\u201d As Justin Langer said after the win at Edgbaston, there was no bowler more important to that critical Ashes victory than Siddle. And I don\u2019t eat meat either, so I\u2019ll politely shoulder arms to the second part! 1st over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 7) Nice start from Latham, taking one to cover first ball but hey\u2019re all up for lbw two deliveries later, Blundell struck on the knee roll with a ball that shapes back beautifully over the wicket. NOT OUT on the field says Nigel Llong; no referral. But... it was hitting leg stump! It would have been overturned. The opener makes the most of his let off, clipping a full ball for four past square leg. \u201cIt\u2019s not going over,\u201d Starc tells his colleagues in the cordon after learning about the projection on the big screen. Blundell finishes the over with three more in the same direction, out to deep square leg. There are still a lot of Kiwi fans in the MCG and they give the new opener a big ovation. The players are back on the field. Blundell and Latham have the job ahead of them for the Black Caps. Starc will start Australia off from the Members End. PLAY! Siddle is going to continue with Essex and Victoria. We\u2019ll learn more at the lunch break when he holds a press conference, but he said in an interview with the Herald-Sun that he\u2019s striving for 700 First Class wickets. He currently has 603. In 38 minutes this morning Australia added 31 runs. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. In case you were wondering, New Zealand must survive 168 overs (I think) to save the Test. New Zealand\u2019s target is 488. He\u2019s bowled Head around his legs! Three for Wagner. All have been well earned. 54th over: Australia 168-4 (Wade 30, Head 28) You guessed it: three more singles. But, BUT... Tim Paine is taking his pads off upstairs. Or at least it appears that way. An interview Andy Bull did with Pete Siddle in 2015 is worth another look today. 53rd over: Australia 165-4 (Wade 29, Head 26) Not a lot going on here, is there? Three singles off Wagner. Paine is padded up in the sheds, the vision shows, suggesting that this innings might have a bit of time to run yet. I haven\u2019t got the TV commentary on but I can only imagine Shane Warne\u2019s delight. 52nd over: Australia 162-4 (Wade 28, Head 24) Southee is pulled by Wade for one then deflected by Head for another. The veteran is not going to give them the chance to really unleash here, his line and length disciplined to the last. As they note on SEN radio, Wade is chatting to the New Zealand players between overs. I can only imagine the sort of advice he is offering them. 51st over: Australia 160-4 (Wade 27, Head 23) Wagner keeps giving it his all, wanging it in halfway down time and again. There\u2019s a flurry of activity when Head inside edges, called through for a quick single. The declaration feels pretty close. 50th over: Australia 157-4 (Wade 25, Head 22) Singles to both along the carpet early in the over, Head then going once again towards third man later in the set, landing just in front Matt Henry - on as Boult\u2019s subsitute fielder. Wade keeps the strike with a single pulled out to deep backward square to finish. Some words from Justin Langer and the Australian camp on Peter Siddle. Cricket Australia has congratulated Peter Siddle on an outstanding Australian career after the veteran fast bowler announced on Sunday he was retiring from international cricket, effective immediately. Siddle, 35, took 221 wickets from 67 Test matches including eight five-wicket hauls. He is the 13th highest Test wicket-taker among all Australian bowlers and will be forever remembered for the hat-trick he claimed on his birthday against England at the \u2018Gabba in 2010. Justin Langer, the Australian Men\u2019s Team Head Coach, described Siddle as a true team man. \u201cThe year after I retired from playing, Matty Hayden and Ricky Ponting were raving about this guy called Peter Siddle,\u201d Langer said. \u201cIf it came from them, you knew it was right and so it proved throughout his brilliant international career. \u201cHe is an unbelievable bloke and an extremely good cricketer. He is the everything of what a team player is. He has given his heart and soul to the Australian team and the game of cricket. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be thankful to him for what he\u2019s given to the national team, and for the critical role he played in helping us retain the Ashes in England this year. He\u2019s going out when he\u2019s still playing well which, in a perfect world, is something every athlete wants to do.\u201d Tim Paine, the Australian Men\u2019s Team Captain, thanked Siddle for his exemplary service to Australian and international cricket. \u201cSids has been the heart and soul of the team for a long time,\u201d Paine said. \u201cI remember coming up through with him through the academies and even back then he was one of the great team men, something he has continued to this day. \u201cHe has a massive heart and is a fantastic bowler. He\u2019ll be very much missed around the group. He\u2019s been unbelievably good for our younger fast bowlers over the last 18 months and been a great support for me during that time, as well. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see him leave international cricket, but the time is right for him. He\u2019s had a wonderful career, he\u2019s achieved a lot and I know he\u2019s still got plenty to offer in domestic cricket.\u201d Kevin Roberts, Cricket Australia\u2019s Chief Executive, praised Siddle for playing a crucial role in defining the team culture in recent seasons. \u201cOn behalf of everyone in the Australian cricket family, I would like to thank Peter for his extraordinary service to the national team,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cPeter\u2019s contribution extends well beyond what you see on the field. He is a wonderful team player who has been a pivotal figure in the resurgence of the national team. \u201cHis 221 Test wickets are a huge accomplishment and matched by the impact he has made on the culture of the team. He is a terrific competitor, a humble person and exemplifies the values of Australian cricket.\u201d In addition to his 67 Tests, Siddle also represented Australia in 20 One-Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals. He will continue to play cricket at domestic level, including for the Adelaide Strikers in this year\u2019s KFC BBL and for Victoria in the Marsh Sheffield Shield. 49th over: Australia 153-4 (Wade 23, Head 20) More of the same, Wagner banging it in at Wade who does what he needs to do keep the board moving. Head is happy to get out of the way of a bumper trained on his helmet before slicing another ball over the cordon, albeit without a lot of power. There\u2019s no fielder there, though. 48th over: Australia 151-4 (Wade 22, Head 19) Southee to Wade now, who takes a couple into the off side early in the over. He\u2019s beaten later with one that bounces a bit more, prompting a sledge from the bowler: \u201cyou\u2019re playing for a tennis ball on a concrete pitch.\u201d Something like that. The hosts get the last laugh from the final ball, Head successfully reaching a very wide T20-esque delivery, getting enough on it to go over about fourth slip for four runs. That lead is now 470 runs. 47th over: Australia 144-4 (Wade 19, Head 15) Wagner to Wade, a contest that has had meaning every time they have been pitted against each other in this series. He takes on the first accurate bouncer that comes his way, pulling a couple. 46th over: Australia 141-4 (Wade 16, Head 15) Head gets the first run of the morning, unfurling a cover drive into a gap, Wade then getting his day underway with a quick single into the offside. There\u2019s no mucking around here, Head slashing hard at the last delivery, over point for a couple. The lead is 460. Right, to the middle. The players are on the field. How long will they bat? Pat Cummins hinted on SEN radio that it might be about an hour. Trent Boult won\u2019t be involved today for what time that is left as it was confirmed overnight he broke his right hand when batting yesterday. A massive blow for the tourists. Tim Southee, his long-term partner in crime, has the ball in his hand from the MCC End. Travis Head is on strike, resuming on 12 after his first-innings ton yesterday. PLAY! Peter Siddle Day is coming in 2020, by the way. Ten years on from his birthday hat-trick, on The Final Word pod we\u2019re lobbying the government to formalise it. And his first Test wicket. A bloke called Tendulkar - you might have heard of him. \u201cCan we celebrate Peter Siddle please?\u201d asks Ruth Purdue. We can and we must. \u201cFor me the consistency of that man was great.\u201d Too right. I\u2019ll go first. In the summer of 1999-2000, playing rep cricket against Sidds, we had three runs to get in the final over with three wickets in hand and he was the man with the ball. Sure enough, he took three wickets in five balls to win it by a run. Remember his first ball in Test cricket, whacking Gautum Gambhir on the lid? We have just received word from the Australian camp that Peter Siddle has called time on his 12-year international career. What a gem of a bowler he has been. The inescapable truth is that most Test Matches reach a stage like this, where one side has dominated to such an extent that the final result appears certain even though many columns in the scorebook are yet to be filled. Third innings declaration runs, typically acquired on the fourth day, are part of this rhythm. There\u2019s no spinning the fact that this is where we are, with Australia preparing to resume this morning already some 456 runs ahead in their second innings. But let\u2019s look at this another way. Isn\u2019t a big part of the reason why we as lovers of our game tell anyone who\u2019ll listen Test Match cricket is the greatest sport of all due to the elation we get when all four results are possible late on day five? Of course it is. But if that was the case in every Test, would those special moments be so memorable? Don\u2019t we need the drab days make the Headingley Miracle - or any number like it over the last 142 years - so much more meaningful when the come? I spent today sitting in a studio talking about the fixture taking place over in Pretoria between South Africa and England. The visitors limped and stuttered their way through more than half a day with the ball. That half their team have been struck down with gastro - including two more this morning - gave the impression that they were going to be sliced and diced in three days. Three hours later, they are a sniff at a comeback that would be in the same bracket as Leeds. Sure, that isn\u2019t going to happen here. Australia will declare at some stage today setting the Black Caps an impossible target - maybe 500, maybe 550. But the very fact that we are going to take it all in together anyway, finding meaning where we can and enjoying excellence as it is presented - especially when the local quicks are let loose, so superb the first time around - is the investment we make to earn the elation of a huge payoff when a Test does go down to the wire, as tomorrow\u2019s in South Africa might. This is all part of it. We get stuck in and watch it anyway. Good morning to you all. Let\u2019s talk.",

And so even when we were shooting, we were shooting different versions of each scene.\u201d</p> <p>Hausner\u2019s thriller, her first in English, is perhaps closer to the 1956 US sci-fi film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/27/invasion-of-the-bodysnatchers-1956\" title=\"\"><em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em></a><em> </em>than to John Wyndham\u2019s triffids novel.

      "bodyText": "An award-winning science-fiction thriller billed by critics as a modern Day of the Triffids takes a provocative approach to Britain\u2019s growing dependence on mood-lifting chemicals and antidepressants. Little Joe, released in UK cinemas in February, and starring Ben Whishaw, Emily Beecham and Kerry Fox, has divided reviewers with its odd, disturbing story of a newly bred plant designed to spread joy. On set in a vast greenhouse laboratory, the acclaimed Austrian director Jessica Hausner first told her actors to forget about finding \u201cthe truth\u201d of their characters. \u201cLittle Joe looks at the question of how do you perceive whether someone has changed or not,\u201d Hausner told the Observer. \u201cThat was the big issue when I talked to the actors. And so even when we were shooting, we were shooting different versions of each scene.\u201d Hausner\u2019s thriller, her first in English, is perhaps closer to the 1956 US sci-fi film Invasion of the Body Snatchers than to John Wyndham\u2019s triffids novel. It plays tricks with audience expectations of the genre and with public concern about the 7 million Britons \u2013 16% of adults \u2013 who are prescribed antidepressants each year. Hausner, 47, knew her approach was risky, but if we could be engineered into better humans, she wanted to ask, how would we tell, and would it matter? \u201cI always have the feeling that everyone plays different roles all the time anyway,\u201d said Hausner, director of the critically-admired Lourdes and Amour Fou. \u201cIn films like Body Snatchers, I love those moments when a husband says \u2018This is not my wife\u2019, although she looks just the same. The audience wonders who is the crazy one. The second half of these films, with the solutions, are more boring, so I decided to stay with the puzzle. I like it when you feel there is something secret that you have to solve. As an audience member, I am mostly disappointed when I get the answer at the end. I know it is a bit of a risk, but I thought: why not give it a try?\u201d The screenplay, co-written with Hausner\u2019s regular collaborator G\u00e9raldine Bajard, revolves around the difficulty of detecting whether or not a personality has been influenced by contact with the bright red \u201chappy plant\u201d. \u201cIt was clear to the actors that they should not act out any changes. We talked about ambiguity and also about the ideas that build up in your mind about other people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d said Hausner. \u201cI thought I would like to have the opportunity to decide at the editing stage which level of strangeness the actors should have in their performances. I mainly chose the not-so-strange performances because it was much more interesting when the question is still in our heads. That is the fun of it.\u201d The tone of Little Joe, which takes its title from the name given to the plant\u2019s prototype, also owes much to the heightened, comic-book look of the musical film Little Shop of Horrors, Hausner admits. \u201cWe looked at the film with our designer, Katharina W\u00f6ppermann, because I did not want it to be a deadly serious sci-fi thriller.\u201d Hausner\u2019s sister, Tanja, chose the costumes with similar comic intent. British actress Beecham, who plays the lead role of Alice, a scientist and plant breeder, is dressed throughout in 1970s-inspired outfits. Beecham, who starred in the British film Daphne and appeared in the Coen Brothers\u2019 Hail, Caesar!, won the best actress award at the Cannes film festival this spring for her role in Little Joe. In Cannes a critic dubbed the film \u201canti-horror\u201d, but in America, where Little Joe has just been released, reviews have been mixed, with some unsure of Hausner\u2019s intent. The Washington Post, however, said the Austrian had given the allegorical arthouse horror film \u201ca stylish, nuanced and deeply unsettling airing\u201d, while Rolling Stone praised Beecham\u2019s \u201ccoolly magnetic\u201d performance.",

Spanish language communities, the same thing: they are losing their newspapers and their online news outlets. The danger can\u2019t be over overstated. I think mostly we focus on the national, which is obviously very important, especially given Donald Trump being president and all what he does, but even at a very personal, local level, losing these is so bad for us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Federal and state Labor MPs have rounded on the Queensland LNP leader, Deb Frecklington, after she criticised Annastacia Palaszczuk for her fashion choices and said she had \u201cno choice but to remain grounded\u201d because she had children. In an interview with the Sunday Mail, Frecklington said Palaszczuk had \u201cdeliberately changed her image \u2013 the whole \u2018Princess Palaszczuk\u2019 is pretty obvious \u2013 but I haven\u2019t changed mine\u201d. \u201cI have no choice but to remain grounded, because of [my husband] Jason and the girls,\u201d Frecklington said. \u201cI can have a tough day but then I\u2019ll get a call from one of my kids and you\u2019ve got to deal with whatever\u2019s going on in their lives. She, on the other hand, has had a complete makeover \u2013 all the makeup, the designer labels, it\u2019s too much, when there are bigger issues to focus on.\u201d Frecklington has three children between the ages of 17 and 21. Palaszczuk has spoken openly about having had a miscarriage, unsuccessful attempts to have a child through IVF, and her painful history of endometriosis, which can affect fertility. Federal Labor senator Kristina Keneally criticised Frecklington\u2019s comments in a series of tweets, referring to a statement in the report that Frecklington bought her clothes at Target and Cue, in contrast to Palaszczuk, who has begun shopping at the upmarket Scanlan &amp; Theodore, according to the Sunday Mail. It was \u201ceven more shameful\u201d that a woman was attacking a fellow female politician for her wardrobe choices, Keneally said. The deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said Frecklington\u2019s comments were \u201castonishing\u201d. The state member for Cook, Cynthia Liu, said in a statement posted on Facebook that it was \u201ca really sad day for all women when this sort of garbage is published\u201d. Another state Labor MP, Kim Richards, reiterated Liu\u2019s comments. Other Labor members, including Mark Furner and the attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, also weighed in. The former federal Labor MP Emma Husar said Frecklington\u2019s comments were \u201cthe epitome of everything that\u2019s wrong with politics\u201d. Asked about the criticism, Frecklington told Guardian Australia she was \u201csimply pointing out my real world experience and that my kids keep me grounded\u201d. \u201cI won\u2019t stand by and allow the Labor party to try and twist the love I have for my kids for some warped political gain.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A funny thing happened to me last Monday. I was lunching with my friend Sir Samuel Brittan, the great <em>Financial Times</em> economics commentator, in advance celebration of his 86th birthday. It was he who, when we were colleagues on the <em>FT</em>, suggested that I specialise in writing about the economy.</p> <p>During the lunch, several anti-Brexit sympathisers approached our table to express approval of the slogan on my pullover. It was the present from one of my daughters that I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/31/brexit-bravery-new-world-nightmare-nationalism\" title=\"\">referred to here two years ago</a>, which proclaims in large letters: \u201cAll I want for Christmas is EU.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the meal there was a general, and not especially discreet, discussion about how awful the situation was and, in particular, how disgraceful the behaviour of the man who is now our prime minister. At which point a nearby diner left the restaurant and one of the waiters said: \u201cDo you know who that was?

      "bodyText": "A funny thing happened to me last Monday. I was lunching with my friend Sir Samuel Brittan, the great Financial Times economics commentator, in advance celebration of his 86th birthday. It was he who, when we were colleagues on the FT, suggested that I specialise in writing about the economy. During the lunch, several anti-Brexit sympathisers approached our table to express approval of the slogan on my pullover. It was the present from one of my daughters that I referred to here two years ago, which proclaims in large letters: \u201cAll I want for Christmas is EU.\u201d At the end of the meal there was a general, and not especially discreet, discussion about how awful the situation was and, in particular, how disgraceful the behaviour of the man who is now our prime minister. At which point a nearby diner left the restaurant and one of the waiters said: \u201cDo you know who that was? Johnson\u2019s mother.\u201d Yes, Alexander Johnson, the man who campaigned all too successfully on the slogan Get Brexit Done, but who, according to reports, has now banned government officials from using the very word Brexit on the grounds that it is \u201ctime to move on\u201d. There are those Remainers who take comfort in the thought that in due course the principally pro-Remain younger generation will see its ranks swollen and demand that we should acknowledge this historic mistake and apply to rejoin the EU. But those of us who recall how difficult it was to join in the first place \u2013 our application was turned down twice by General de Gaulle \u2013 think this is far too optimistic. I was therefore heartened by the Christmas message from Frans Timmermans, the deputy president of the European commission: there has been damage already, and there will be more to come, but the UK \u201cwill always be welcome to come back\u201d. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has made it clear that a year\u2019s transition period is perilously short for negotiating future arrangements \u2013 and, indeed, that the kind of Trumpian departure from EU regulations envisaged by Johnson, Dominic Cummings and their ilk is non-negotiable with the EU. The stage is therefore set for a year\u2019s fooling around, followed by a no-deal crash-out. This at a time when Johnson is promising a golden future for the former Labour supporters in the north of England and Midlands who have supposedly lent him their votes. So what kind of economy and outlook does Johnson inherit? As regular readers know, I did not get where I am today by making economic forecasts \u2013 the old economists\u2019 joke is that it is difficult enough to forecast the past \u2013 but I take note of all the forecasts being made by reputable economic institutions, and they are almost all terrible. The loss of tax revenue likely to accompany the mere approach to Brexit, let alone the expected crash-out, makes Johnson\u2019s electoral promises for the north look, well, ridiculous. Consider: in the days when Brittan and I were covering economic crises such as the notorious three-day week, the average annual growth of productivity in this country was 2-2.5%. The average growth of productivity in the 10 years since the financial crisis of 2007-09 has been 0.3%.

What Johnson should do, now that he has achieved his childhood ambition to become prime minister, is grow up, become a statesman and be big enough to say he has made a mistake. He won\u2019t, of course. An easy forecast. Happy new year!",

A week later, after a party in London, he began an affair with the rackety bohemian heiress Lady Caroline Blackwood. Hardwick wondered at his silence \u2013 for which his excuses included not knowing how to buy a stamp or to lick the gummed edges of an aerogram \u2013 but even after learning the truth she remained his distant, dutiful helpmeet, preparing his taxes, dealing with \u201cdegrading money things\u201d like car insurance, and replacing his typewriter ribbon in the hope that he would return. When the bipolar Lowell suffered a bout of mania, she hastened to London to nurse him. Blackwood had no interest in such connubial care, and preferred to express emotion operatically or perhaps alcoholically. \u201cIf I have had drunken hysterical seizures,\u201d she told Lowell, \u201cit\u2019s because I love you so much.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Often he helped himself to Hardwick's words verbatim, but when he changed them, he cruelly misrepresented her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The estrangement widened into a case of cultural desertion: writing from an America roiled by Vietnam and Watergate, Hardwick lamented that her \u201cYankee genius\u201d had decamped to the \u201cspoiled richness\u201d of England, where he was patronised by \u201csilly little Tories\u201d. This patriotic appeal failed. Lowell obtained a divorce and married the pregnant Blackwood, though he still addressed Hardwick as \u201cMrs Robert Lowell\u201d on envelopes that contained letters quibbling over the division of their marital property. Then in 1973 he published <em>The Dolphin</em>, with those abject, unauthorised quotations from Hardwick. Friends denounced Lowell\u2019s breach of trust; even he wondered in a poem whether he had \u201cplotted perhaps too freely with my life,/ not avoiding injury to others\u201d, though he went on to fret about the additional \u201cinjury to myself\u201d.

Her wry phrase acknowledged the muddled state of her feelings. Lowell transferred the emphasis to his own physical and mental health, which she now seems to be wishfully harming. In another letter, Hardwick spoke of herself as \u201ca wife\u201d who did \u201ceverything for the man she loves\u201d.

The poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/adrienne-rich\" title=\"\">Adrienne Rich</a> sternly informed Lowell that during the 1970s women were \u201cmore interesting\u201d than ever before, \u201cliving more autonomous lives\u2026 like a second youth\u201d. Although he ignored the lecture, scoffing at feminists as \u201cLesbian storm troops\u201d who \u201ctalk like hysterical Negroes\u201d, the newly self-reliant Hardwick came to spurn the servitude he had wished on her. She mocked mousy academic wives who spent their days typing manuscripts for their husbands, chuckled when a university that wanted to buy Lowell\u2019s papers offered to employ her as their part-time curator, and even threatened him by warning that he would soon hear from her lawyer, \u201cwho goes by the name of Mrs Gentleman!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/29/new-york-stories-elizabeth-hardwick\" title=\"\">Writing well</a>, she found, was the best revenge.

And life \u2013 or rather death \u2013 has the last word here, abruptly and raggedly disrupting the finesse of art.</p> <p>In 1977 Lowell flew back to New York from Ireland. Blackwood had ended their marriage, but he carried with him as a souvenir <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw248339/Girl-in-Bed\" title=\"\">a portrait of her in bed</a> by Lucian Freud, the first of her three husbands. On the way from the airport to Hardwick\u2019s apartment, he suffered a heart attack; she redirected the taxi to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The official certificate identified the absent Blackwood as his \u201csurviving spouse\u201d, with Hardwick relegated to the status of \u201cfriend\u201d. Needing to let her daughter know of their loss, Hardwick found she lacked change for a payphone; \u201cno one at the hospital\u201d, Hamilton reports, \u201cwould lend her a coin\u201d, but a hard-bargaining stranger charged her 10 dollars for a dime.

Blackwood had ended their marriage, but he carried with him as a souvenir a portrait of her in bed by Lucian Freud, the first of her three husbands. On the way from the airport to Hardwick\u2019s apartment, he suffered a heart attack; she redirected the taxi to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The official certificate identified the absent Blackwood as his \u201csurviving spouse\u201d, with Hardwick relegated to the status of \u201cfriend\u201d. Needing to let her daughter know of their loss, Hardwick found she lacked change for a payphone; \u201cno one at the hospital\u201d, Hamilton reports, \u201cwould lend her a coin\u201d, but a hard-bargaining stranger charged her 10 dollars for a dime. Try versifying that. \u2022 The Dolphin Letters, 1970-1979: Elizabeth Hardwick, Robert Lowell and Their Circle, edited by Saskia Hamilton, is published by Faber (\u00a335).

We\u2019ll be far better off out of the bloody thing. In every aspect. Football-wise as well, absolutely. To hell with the rest of the world.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 Ian Holloway</strong>, August \u2013 calling for football to be played under WTO rules. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s our boys making up that new [handball] law. I think that\u2019s people telling us what to do with our game. Now they should stop doing that. I hope we get out, Brexit, because that\u2019s what people are voting for.

      "bodyText": "Quotes of the year \u2022 Neil Warnock, January \u2013 asked about Brexit while sitting in front of a \u201cVisit Malaysia\u201d sign put up by a Cyprus-born chairman to help fund his 11-nationality Cardiff squad: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out, if I\u2019m honest. We\u2019ll be far better off out of the bloody thing. In every aspect. Football-wise as well, absolutely. To hell with the rest of the world.\u201d \u2022 Ian Holloway, August \u2013 calling for football to be played under WTO rules. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s our boys making up that new [handball] law. I think that\u2019s people telling us what to do with our game. Now they should stop doing that. I hope we get out, Brexit, because that\u2019s what people are voting for. You cannot have someone telling us how to do our own game.\u201d Campaigner of the year Leading on the year\u2019s other hot-button issue: \u201cExtinction of our race is becoming more and more likely \u2026 the world is a messed up place. World leaders are either uneducated or don\u2019t care about the environment at all. Honestly, I feel like giving up\u2026 people don\u2019t seem to care.\u201d Lewis Hamilton \u2013 who denied later that his jet, \u00a313m car collection and \u00a350m Petronas endorsement took the edge off. \u201cI sold my plane a year ago.\u201d Clean break of the year Gianni Infantino in June \u2013 addressing Fifa\u2019s congress two years after he sacked the ethics team investigating him. \u201cWe turned it around! Fifa has gone from being toxic, almost criminal, to what it should be: synonymous with credibility, trust, integrity, equality, and with human rights.\u201d His other big message in 2019: rejecting talk that it was Fifa\u2019s new reliance on Chinese sponsors that led it to drop all human rights checks and award China the 2021 Club World Cup. \u201cThere are problems in this world, everywhere, in many countries. It is not the mission of Fifa to solve the problems of this world.\u201d \u2022 Also not buying complaints from human rights and ethics groups about sportswashing in 2019 \u2013 Uefa head Aleksander Ceferin: a) Explaining why holding the Europa League final in Azerbaijan was the right thing to do: \u201cHuman rights is a problem in other places too. Does it mean the fans in Baku do not deserve live football?\u201d And b) reacting to the World Anti\u2011Doping Agency\u2019s call for Russia to be stripped of Euro 2020 by confronting Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. His message to Putin \u2013 Uefa stands by Russia because: \u201cI must say, the World Cup was organised perfectly\u2026 I do not speak just to be nice: I really mean it.\u201d Red line of the year Pushing the Fifa ethics boundaries too far in 2019: Central African Republic executive Patrice-Edouard Nga\u00efssona \u2013 banned for six years from all Fifa activities for leading a militia accused of \u201cmass executions, torture, mutilation and rapes\u201d. Nga\u00efssona, on trial in The Hague in 2020, denies 111 war crimes charges. And torment of the year Was felt by Sepp Blatter - threatening to sue Fifa in July for not giving back the 60 luxury watches he left in his office. \u201cThese are my watches, give me my watches. It\u2019s important for me.\u201d His biggest question: \u201cWhy are they fighting me for these watches? There is no respect... I\u2019ve reached the end of my temper.\u201d Comeback of the year Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 started 2019 out of work, going viral with an ice-rink faceplant in Russia and a \u20ac3.3m tax fraud sentence; ended it managing Spurs and quoting Nelson Mandela. \u201cLike Mr Mandela said: \u2018You never lose, you win or you learn.\u2019 At United I won and I learned. My time after I left United, that was a good time for me.\u201d Most triggered @realDonaldTrump \u2013 responding to Megan Rapinoe\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House\u201d snub in June by mis-tagging a series of rebukes \u2013 telling @meganrapino, a surprised 21-year-old Starbucks employee from Virginia: \u201cNever disrespect our country, the White House, or our flag.\u201d \u2022 Also getting to him during the USA\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup run: Rapinoe\u2019s preview of the quarter-final, played in Pride month. \u201cGo gays! You can\u2019t win a championship without gays on your team \u2013 it\u2019s never been done before, ever. That\u2019s science, right there!\u201d Boldest legal claim Israel Folau \u2013 suing Rugby Australia for \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. Folau, sacked in May for views including \u201chell awaits homosexuals\u201d and gay marriage causes bushfires, claimed \u00a37.4m for violation of \u201creligious freedom\u201d. Statement: \u201cMr Folau wants all Australians to know that he does not condone discrimination of any kind.\u201d Edgiest comms strategy Franck Rib\u00e9ry \u2013 handling the feedback last January after he posted a video of himself eating a steak coated in gold. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the jealous, the haters, those only born because a condom had a hole in: f*** your mothers, your grandmothers and even your family tree. I owe you nothing.\u201d Bayern Munich: \u201cFranck accepts his words were unwise.\u201d War on racism \u2013 toughest stand Still winning on racism: Serie A \u2013 expressing \u201csincere regret\u201d for the \u201cNo To Racism\u201d posters they put up this month featuring monkeys with painted faces. CEO Luigi De Siervo: \u201cI realise now these were inappropriate. But what cannot be questioned is the strong, constant condemnation of racism by Serie A.\u201d \u2022 Also standing firm in 2019: a) Uefa, clearing Porto of racism in September after a fan claimed he was referring to himself as a joke when he led chants of \u201cmonkey\u201d while a black player lined up a penalty. The fan said: \u201cEveryone in Portugal knows me as Monkey, it\u2019s my nickname. This is an embarrassing mistake from Uefa.\u201d Uefa accepted the defence. And b) Downing Street, 10 days after Boris Johnson\u2019s win, unsure why racists were feeling emboldened: \u201cRacism has no place in football, and we must confront this vile behaviour. There is more work to be done by the football authorities ... We don\u2019t rule out taking further steps, if required.\u201d Image of the year Jack Leach, cleaning his glasses at one end as history unfolded at the other. \u201cThey needed cleaning. I know I look stupid when I am out there. But it got the job done.\u201d See also the slow-mo video of the year: Modern football moment of the year Came in July: Liverpool FC trying to trademark the word \u201cLiverpool\u201d. The bid was knocked back by officials due to the \u201cgeographical significance of the city\u201d; the club said it would \u201ccontinue aggressively to pursue those who illegally exploit our intellectual property\u201d. Gap year of the year Bernard Tomic \u2013 fined for not trying at Wimbledon again. Tomic appealed to get his \u00a345,000 prize money back after his 58-minute exit in July; Wimbledon said no. Tomic: \u201cThey\u2019re mocking me with what they\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t need the money. It\u2019s just about what\u2019s right.\u201d Best intentions Out of ideas last January, Fulham tried a team yoga session to reverse relegation form and \u201cfind peace\u201d. It ended early when Aboubakar Kamara and Aleksandar Mitrovic had to be \u201cdragged apart\u201d \u2013 sources telling the press it was triggered when \u201cAbou started talking during silent time \u2013 a mindfulness moment. Mitrovic told him to shut up.\u201d Most respectful Another big year for poppy respect and sad mascots \u2013 but viral retweets of Tranmere\u2019s 2017 full body poppy had new resonance in 2019. Adult of the year Sebastian Vettel, 32 \u2013 swapping the finishing position cards at the Canadian Grand Prix in June after a five-second penalty denied him victory. Vettel, who put \u201c1\u201d next to his car, and \u201c2\u201d next to Lewis Hamilton\u2019s, said: \u201cThis is a wrong world. This is not fair.\u201d Defiance of the year Italian Serie C club Viterbese \u2013 reacting to a five-year ban for vice-president Luciano Camilli for punching opposition president Giorgio La Cava \u201cand kicking his legs away\u201d. The club called the ban \u201csqualid\u201d and \u201cslander\u201d, alleging Arezzo\u2019s La Cava provoked it by shouting: \u201cYou suck, shit fans.\u201d The ban was cut to 20 months on appeal. Sacking of the year Came from Zamalek president Murtada Mansour in Egypt: sacking Christian Gross in play during a 1-1 draw for being \u201ca failure, a wreck \u2026 I went to the dressing room at half\u2011time and told the players to ignore him.\u201d Mansour said critics pointing to his man-management record \u2013 including his 2016 move to hire \u201csorcerers\u201d due to three players \u201cbeing bewitched\u201d, and the fact that he\u2019s now on his fourth manager since sacking Gross in May \u2013 should \u201cknow this: I\u2019m not some crazy guy.\u201d Worst use of social media 1) Ex-Notts County owner Alan \u201cBig Alan\u201d Hardy \u2013 trying to expose \u201cthe fickle side of fans\u201d in January by posting screenshots of two contradictory tweets from the same fan, but accidentally posting a photo of his penis instead. 2) @Cristiano \u2013 tweeting a private-jet selfie in January on the same day he was fined \u00a316.6m for tax evasion and Emiliano Sala went missing in a plane crash. Three emojis: smiley face, plane taking off, thumbs up. 3) Adidas UK in July, running its #DareToCreate social media campaign to promote Arsenal\u2019s new kit: auto-generating images of the strip featuring the Twitter handles of users who shared the hashtag. Adidas said the result \u2013 their official account tweeting a series of racist slurs with the message \u201cwelcome to the squad\u201d \u2013 was an unforeseeable abuse \u201cof a personalisation mechanic created to allow excited fans to get their name on the jersey. We have turned the functionality off.\u201d 4) Fleetwood chair Andy Pilley, @capboy70, telling fans to vote Tory or he\u2019d shut the club down. 5) And Welsh Fire cricket coach Gary Kirsten, showing his best enthusiasm in October. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for The Hundred Draft and to pick the [insert team name] squad on Sunday at 7pm. #TheHundredDraft.\u201d Best use of social media Was lower league clubs live-tweeting the colour as well as the action: 1) @lossiemouthfc, April: \u201c8.20pm: Game delayed temporarily while the referee spews in the centre circle \u2026 8.22pm: That\u2019s him done yakking up his tea and we\u2019re on the go again.\u201d 2) Berwick Rangers\u2019 @OfficialBRFC, March: \u201cCowdenbeath waste a corner and Berwick get the chance to clear \u2026 Ugly scenes in the dugout as Cowdenbeath\u2019s manager has just told Johnny Harvey to \u2018take his face for a sh*te\u2019 #BRFC.\u201d 3) @sligorovers, February: \u201c9 min. The ball is kicked out of play, striking the box of chips owned by the fan at the Joma sign. Many chips fall to the ground. (0-0).\u201d 4) @AFCFylde, October: \u201c80\u2019 There\u2019s a stoppage in play as a rather rotund man storms the field, topless, with a bouquet of flowers. (4-0).\u201d 5) And @NuneatonBoroFC, going for a face-palm emoji after their keeper Tony Breeden came up to take a penalty in November: \u201c61\u2018 He\u2019s missed and has broke the lights in the terrace. What have I just witnessed.\u201d Understatement of the year Sarah Thomas, September \u2013 swimming the channel and back, then back, then back again. The 37-year-old cancer survivor from Colorado did it in 54 hours; the route was 80 miles, but tidal pulls meant she ended up swimming 130. \u201cI got stung in the face by a jellyfish. I\u2019m pretty tired right now.\u201d Best scoop Was Sky spotting Huddersfield\u2019s incoming manager Jan Siewert in the directors\u2019 box in January, and going in for an exclusive interview. \u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d said Man City fan Martin Warhurst later. \u201cI was sat in the crowd and suddenly I was aware of a guy coming towards me from the right. He thought I was the manager; I said: \u2018No, no, that\u2019s not me. I\u2019m Martin from Wakefield.\u2019\u201d Best choreography Billy Sharp\u2019s sock puppet goal celebration in February \u2013 his tribute to WWE star Mick Foley\u2019s \u201cMr Socko\u201d. @RealMickFoley called it \u201cTREMENDOUS\u201d and turned up a month later. Sharp: \u201cAfter the game I had 200 texts then God knows how many on Twitter. Next thing I know Mick Foley is having breakfast at my house.\u201d Best Bart/Moe moment National league @AFCFylde - appealing in February for three youths who \u201cduped our stadium announcer into asking for a white Nissan Micra NE14 ABJ to be moved last night\u201d. The boys came forward; Fylde gave them free shirts. Worst \u2018beating the rush\u2019 Calling it early: three Spurs fans, missing the Champions League comeback at Ajax in May after leaving the ground just before half-time, thinking it was full time due to being \u201cpretty drunk\u201d. James Perkins: \u201cWe thought we were leaving at the perfect time.\u201d He said they were \u201cpretty confused\u201d at the station \u201cwhen no one was stood around us waiting for a train\u201d. Reflection of the year Came from New Zealand\u2019s Jimmy Neesham, tweeting straight after their World Cup defeat to England in July. @JimmyNeesh: \u201cKids, don\u2019t take up sport. Take up baking or something. Die at 60, really fat and happy.\u201d Interviewee of the year Was Coco Gauff during her Wimbledon breakthrough. On her self-image: \u201cWeird. Weird, goofy, and, I don\u2019t know. Yeah, weird and goofy, I guess.\u201d On her mum\u2019s celebration dance: \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her, but she\u2019s going to go viral, I know. She\u2019s going to be a meme.\u201d And on why the best bit of the summer was rapper Jaden Smith tweeting her. \u201cObviously the tennis is great \u2026 but I\u2019ve looked up to Jaden for so long. People who follow me know that\u2019s all I post about. It was pretty exciting for me.\u201d Gaffes of the year Among 2019\u2019s regrets: Great Britain being disqualified from the men\u2019s 4x400m at the European Athletics Team Championships in August after naming reserve shot putter Youcef Zatat in the lineup by mistake; and Telstar striker Jordie van der Laan being sacked in May for calling in sick so he could travel to London to watch Ajax play Spurs. Telstar officials spotted him in the crowd on TV; Van der Laan said: \u201cIt was not my best decision.\u201d Precaution of the year Colorado Rapids \u2013 cancelling their post-game fireworks in August due to \u201cplague\u201d. Officials said \u201cthe presence of plague-infested fleas affecting prairie dog colonies\u201d around Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park meant the club \u201chad no alternative but to cancel\u201d. A Rapids fan in a plague doctor mask told the Denver Post. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just embrace it.\u201d Round of the year Solid entertainment from David Duval at the Open in Royal Portrush in July: birdieing his first two holes, reaching the 5th one off the lead, then hitting a quadruple bogey, a bogey and a nonuple bogey 14 at the par-five 7th after losing two tee shots then playing the wrong ball. He finished with a 20-over 91, but said he never thought about walking away. \u201cIf you play, you post your score. Is there some hint of embarrassment? I don\u2019t know. What I shot, I put on the board.\u201d Gear change of the year 2018: David Beckham accepts the Uefa president\u2019s award. \u201cI\u2019m very honoured, honoured to be here.\u201d 2019: Eric Cantona accepts the Uefa president\u2019s award: \u201cAs flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport. Soon science will not only be able to slow the ageing of cells, soon science will fix the cells to the state and so we will become eternal. Only accidents, crimes, wars will still kill us, but unfortunately, crimes, wars, will multiply. I love football. Thank you.\u201d Surprise headline of the year \u201cWayne Hennessey is \u2018desperate\u2019 to learn about the Nazis, says Roy Hodgson\u201d \u2013 theguardian.com, April. Runner-up: The Times, last week: \u201cWest Ham footballer Michail Antonio crashed Lamborghini while dressed as snowman.\u201d Photoshops of the year Making it big on Twitter in 2019: @visualsatire\u2019s Football Manager Hair on Politicians. Including acclaimed works \u201cHenry VIII with the hair and earpiece of Phil Brown\u201d, and \u201cAngela Merkel with the face of Steve Bruce\u201d. OMG of the year Fallon Sherrock, @Fsherrock: \u201cReally buzzing now.... ! I have done it again.. ! OMG\u201d. Sherrock said this month\u2019s PDC World Darts Championship run was \u201cincredible\u2026 the fact that all these people are tweeting me, especially Billie Jean King. Oh my god... I mean, this is me. I\u2019m just a normal person.\u201d VAR quote of the year Defining VAR\u2019s solid debut season: the official @Premierleague account \u2013 rebutting online derision in November after Martin Atkinson found Roberto Firmino\u2019s right nipple seeking to gain an unfair advantage: \u201cThe red line was aligned to Firmino\u2019s armpit, which was marginally ahead of the last Villa defender.\u201d \u2022 The year\u2019s definitive VAR decision: Bundesliga 2, October \u2013 VAR operators spotting a sub who was warming up behind the goal had touched a wayward shot with his foot, millimetres before it had gone out of play for a goal-kick. The verdict: a penalty and yellow card. Teammate Alexander M\u00fchling: \u201cThe boy didn\u2019t know that rule. None of us knew that rule.\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez of the year Was Luis Su\u00e1rez \u2013 hailed for \u201creaching peak Luis Su\u00e1rez\u201d in Uruguay\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica win over Chile in June after: a) Seeming to appeal for a handball in the box by the goalkeeper; and b) Reacting to an opponent tripping a pitch invader by running towards the referee brandishing an imaginary card. Rant of the year Days after Cardiff Met manager Christian Edwards was taken ill in November, young son Isaac stepped up to replace him with this teamtalk after an unconvincing win over Cefn Druids. Best winding down Katarina Johnson-Thompson, nine days after heptathlon gold in October. @JohnsonThompson: \u201cIf anyone wants to know how my off season is going \u2026 I\u2019ve been to two karaoke bars in 48 hours. My chosen songs are Bonnie Tyler \u2018Total eclipse of the heart\u2019 and Busta Rhymes \u2018Look at me now\u2019.\u201d Grandma enjoying sport clip of the year 2.1m wholesome views for this reaction to England\u2019s Cricket World Cup win. Endurance of the year A decent effort from Harlequins\u2019 Joe Marler in November \u2013 fully committing to his metaphor. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another week to get back on the horse, and take that horse to the water. And you can ask that horse, you can say: \u2018Hey, horsey, do you want to have a drink or do you want to swim?\u2019 It\u2019s up to that horse to then realise what he wants to do in his life. That horse, at the moment, wants to go out on Saturday and he wants to say \u2018hello\u2019 to those fans. And he goes [does accent]: \u2018I\u2019m sorry about the result last week, but I\u2019m going to give a better performance against Bath.\u2019 He\u2019s a slightly Irish horse. So we are looking forward, like I say, to getting back on that horse.\u201d Interviewer: \u201cAnd are you looking forward to getting back on the horse?\u201d Marler: \u201cI don\u2019t like horses, I can\u2019t ride.\u201d Biggest attention seekers Headlining 12 months of viral animal cameos: \u2022 Multiple cats causing time added on, including at Everton v Wolves in February and a Real Salt Lake game in July at Rio Tinto Stadium in the US, where a duck pitch-invaded last year. \u2022 A sick fox emptying itself on the Oval in July during Surrey v Glamorgan; \u2022 A squirrel disrupting the Minnesota Twins twice in two nights, making the Twins\u2019 dugout \u201cscatter in fear\u201d. \u2022 A bee swarm sending players to the turf at Sri Lanka v South Africa at Chester-le-Street in June. Faf du Plessis: \u201cIt is very funny actually. It\u2019s like someone\u2019s run a machine gun through the players.\u201d \u2022 Two stags disrupting Fort William\u2019s training this month. @Mocko500: \u201cFort William tried to offer them contracts, but they were two deer.\u201d \u2022 A limping first-half possum delaying Puebla\u2019s trip to Veracruz in January. Veracruz said the possum was \u201ctreated by vets before returning to the wild\u201d. \u2022 Half a dozen hippos eating Letaba\u2019s rugby pitch in May. The club told South African media: \u201cThese boys just came up from the river and started grazing.\u201d \u2022 And the purest goal celebration of 2019 \u2013 a deer hitting the net, then dancing away. 20.8m views. Best entrance Was Freddie, getting his life-changing first look inside Goodison Park. Emotions of the year Also causing \u201csomething in my eye\u201d tweets in 2019: \u2022 David Martin hugging dad Alvin after his West Ham debut at 33; \u2022 Tearful tennis veteran Nicolas Mahut being consoled by his young son in June after defeat at Roland Garros to Leonardo Mayer, who also left in tears; \u2022 And Jordan Henderson with his dad Brian in June after the Champions League final. Brian, a cancer survivor, said later: \u201cWhen he was 12 I took him to the Champions League final, and when they came out to the Champions League music he said: \u2018Dad, I\u2019m going to play it one day.\u2019 Not only once but twice, and now he\u2019s won one. So the tears come, you start shaking, you grab the wife, you grab the daughter-in-law, you grab anybody that\u2019s around you. I\u2019m just so happy.\u201d Ballboys of the year Going the extra mile: Duncan Ferguson\u2019s Everton goal celebrators; Jos\u00e9 Mourinho rewarding Callum, 15, with a pasta lunch for his assist against Olympiakos; and this Wimbledon tennis ballboy who, despite a sustained, shock soaking from a rogue sprinkler, stayed in place, upright and straight-faced. Until the tiniest smirk got out. And final word of the year From Rebekah Vardy, asked if she\u2019d confronted Coleen Rooney after their social media coming together in October. \u201cThat would be like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it\u2019s still going to shit in your hair.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has attended a rugby match will have seen him from a distance. The anorak, the slightly rounded shoulders from decades of lugging his equipment around, the broad smile and, at certain times of year, the trademark tan. If there is a game happening Dave Rogers will probably be there photographing it for Getty Images, always assuming he has remembered to remove his lens cap.</p> <p>It is one of the trade\u2019s timeless gags: for as long as newspapers exist there will be snappers (photographers) and hacks (writers) disputing each other\u2019s respective worth. Is every picture really worth a thousand words? According to Rogers, who was patrolling sodden touchlines long before today\u2019s players were even born, it is barely a contest.</p> <p>\u201cTake the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/23/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion2\" title=\"\">2003 Rugby World Cup final</a>. People remember the radio reports, the TV pictures and <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/products/jonny-wilkinson-rugby-world-cup-2003\" title=\"\">the photos</a>, but no one remembers what was written about it. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? I think a still image is fantastic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c564405992d592410fb474f8f8bbaf3e01b5162\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c564405992d592410fb474f8f8bbaf3e01b5162/0_0_3043_2113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s winning drop goal at the Rugby World Cup final in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s winning drop goal at the Rugby World Cup final in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Don\u2019t tell him, but he may have a point. Years after the last rugby writer has penned his final, breathless paragraph, people will still retain the images of Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s drop goal or a mud\u2011covered Fran Cotton (taken by the late Colin \u201cBig C\u201d Elsey) in their mind\u2019s eye. Rogers grew up in the Black Country supporting Wolverhampton but he has done more to spread rugby\u2019s gospel than most.</p> <p>Now 63, the snapper\u2019s snapper is about to chalk up 40 years of chronicling the sport. His first Five Nations game was Ireland versus Scotland on 2 February 1980; that summer he covered the Lions in South Africa, which remains his all-time favourite tour. In those days players and press drank together and shared the same hotels. Which is how the debutant tourist Rogers, lying on what he thought was his own bed, first met the Welsh centre Dai Richards, whose room he was in. \u201cI remember him saying: \u2018What are you doing in here?\u2019 It turned out they\u2019d mixed up Dai Richards and Dave Rogers at reception.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48ea8bb35495fe8e0bb536657e6b33d3521604af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48ea8bb35495fe8e0bb536657e6b33d3521604af/0_71_4005_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British and Irish press on the 1983 Lions tour of New Zealand.

The players don\u2019t enjoy themselves as much as they used to because they can\u2019t. In the old days things would happen that would never be reported. These days someone in a bar will put it on social media instantly.\u201d</p> <p>As countless former players will testify, however, there are few more trusted witnesses than Rogers. Few over the years have been able to resist the easy charm of the boy from Brierley Hill, not least Diego Maradona, whom he met when England toured Argentina in 1981. \u201cI remember my boss, Bob Thomas, saying: \u2018There\u2019s this new up-and\u2011coming footballer. He\u2019s the best player I\u2019ve seen in years.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Off trotted Rogers to Boca Juniors, with the <em>Daily Express</em>\u2019s Tony Bodley acting as his bag carrier and the rest is sepia-tinted history. Later that year a handwritten Christmas card from Maradona arrived in the post. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen now, would it? I kept it for five years until I got back from the 1986 World Cup and ripped it up in a fit of pique after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/world-cup-moments-maradona-hand-god\" title=\"\">Hand of God incident</a>. I wish I\u2019d bloody kept it now.\u201d</p> <p>Rogers has met pretty much all the greats since the fateful day he gave up his job \u2013 \u201cI lasted a week\u201d \u2013 as a trainee accountant.

Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s drop goal in 2003, because of what it means as an Englishman. The coldest I\u2019ve ever been? The first Lions Test in New Zealand in 2005. I was shivering but managed to take a picture of a freezing Jonny, shot at 1/60th of a second, with long streaks of rain coming down around him. There were three or four Scots guys there wearing kilts but no shirts. They must have nearly died of exposure.\u201d</p> <p>How come he has lasted so long? Across the cafe table his Getty colleague Stu Forster has a simple explanation. \u201cI see plenty of older photographers and not one of them has the same enthusiasm as Dave.\u201d</p> <p>In a job their fellow snapper Clive Rose reckons is \u201c80% about dealing with disappointment\u201d\u201a he remains a beacon of positivity. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got enthusiasm you might as well pack it in,\u201d says Rogers, sipping reflectively on his cup of tea. \u201cI love it but I still get very nervous before big games.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has attended a rugby match will have seen him from a distance. The anorak, the slightly rounded shoulders from decades of lugging his equipment around, the broad smile and, at certain times of year, the trademark tan. If there is a game happening Dave Rogers will probably be there photographing it for Getty Images, always assuming he has remembered to remove his lens cap. It is one of the trade\u2019s timeless gags: for as long as newspapers exist there will be snappers (photographers) and hacks (writers) disputing each other\u2019s respective worth. Is every picture really worth a thousand words? According to Rogers, who was patrolling sodden touchlines long before today\u2019s players were even born, it is barely a contest. \u201cTake the 2003 Rugby World Cup final. People remember the radio reports, the TV pictures and the photos, but no one remembers what was written about it. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? I think a still image is fantastic.\u201d Don\u2019t tell him, but he may have a point. Years after the last rugby writer has penned his final, breathless paragraph, people will still retain the images of Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s drop goal or a mud\u2011covered Fran Cotton (taken by the late Colin \u201cBig C\u201d Elsey) in their mind\u2019s eye. Rogers grew up in the Black Country supporting Wolverhampton but he has done more to spread rugby\u2019s gospel than most. Now 63, the snapper\u2019s snapper is about to chalk up 40 years of chronicling the sport. His first Five Nations game was Ireland versus Scotland on 2 February 1980; that summer he covered the Lions in South Africa, which remains his all-time favourite tour. In those days players and press drank together and shared the same hotels. Which is how the debutant tourist Rogers, lying on what he thought was his own bed, first met the Welsh centre Dai Richards, whose room he was in. \u201cI remember him saying: \u2018What are you doing in here?\u2019 It turned out they\u2019d mixed up Dai Richards and Dave Rogers at reception.\u201d In those distant days touring players and snappers would even attend church together on Sundays \u2013 \u201cNed Van Esbeck of the Irish Times would round us all up like a sheepdog\u201d \u2013 and lifelong friendships were forged. \u201cYou\u2019d be best mates with people like Bill Beaumont, Peter Wheeler, Rory and Tony Underwood, Ieuan Evans ... loads of them. The players don\u2019t enjoy themselves as much as they used to because they can\u2019t. In the old days things would happen that would never be reported. These days someone in a bar will put it on social media instantly.\u201d As countless former players will testify, however, there are few more trusted witnesses than Rogers. Few over the years have been able to resist the easy charm of the boy from Brierley Hill, not least Diego Maradona, whom he met when England toured Argentina in 1981. \u201cI remember my boss, Bob Thomas, saying: \u2018There\u2019s this new up-and\u2011coming footballer. He\u2019s the best player I\u2019ve seen in years.\u2019\u201d Off trotted Rogers to Boca Juniors, with the Daily Express\u2019s Tony Bodley acting as his bag carrier and the rest is sepia-tinted history. Later that year a handwritten Christmas card from Maradona arrived in the post. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen now, would it? I kept it for five years until I got back from the 1986 World Cup and ripped it up in a fit of pique after the Hand of God incident. I wish I\u2019d bloody kept it now.\u201d Rogers has met pretty much all the greats since the fateful day he gave up his job \u2013 \u201cI lasted a week\u201d \u2013 as a trainee accountant. He has seen 36 England captains and his memories are sharper than some of his faded old pictures. \u201cMy favourite photo? Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s drop goal in 2003, because of what it means as an Englishman. The coldest I\u2019ve ever been? The first Lions Test in New Zealand in 2005. I was shivering but managed to take a picture of a freezing Jonny, shot at 1/60th of a second, with long streaks of rain coming down around him. There were three or four Scots guys there wearing kilts but no shirts. They must have nearly died of exposure.\u201d How come he has lasted so long? Across the cafe table his Getty colleague Stu Forster has a simple explanation. \u201cI see plenty of older photographers and not one of them has the same enthusiasm as Dave.\u201d In a job their fellow snapper Clive Rose reckons is \u201c80% about dealing with disappointment\u201d\u201a he remains a beacon of positivity. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got enthusiasm you might as well pack it in,\u201d says Rogers, sipping reflectively on his cup of tea. \u201cI love it but I still get very nervous before big games. If you haven\u2019t got that you\u2019re in danger of getting blase. I\u2019m not the best snapper in the world but I think I know what\u2019s needed. I don\u2019t always get it, mind.\u201d One example was the day Erica Roe ran topless on to the Twickenham pitch during half-time in the England v Australia Test in January 1982. \u201cIn those days you had pocketfuls of film and you always used half-time to reload. All hell was breaking out behind me and I missed it all.\u201d His defining picture of a deliriously happy Jeremy Guscott hugging his coach, Ian McGeechan, after the Lions\u2019 series-clinching win in South Africa in 1997, on the other hand, was the direct result of his friendship with the players. \u201cThey get to trust you.

      "body": "<p>The next year will see a fresh Brexit crisis, parliament sidelined and a renewed threat to the union \u2013 but there is still hope for supporters of progressive politics, according to some of the leading figures who took on the government over Brexit.</p> <p>The 80-strong majority secured by Boris Johnson at the election ended the parliamentary stalemate that left the prime minister unable to push through his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit deal.</a> The election also ended the tenures of key figures responsible for leading the battle to oppose his plans.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> spoke to David Gauke, who quit the cabinet; Sam Gyimah, who defected from the Tories to the Lib Dems; Anna Soubry, who set up a new party; and Dominic Grieve, who helped lead the fight against Brexit in parliament, about the crucial year ahead. They pointed to key contradictions in Johnson\u2019s plans that could lead quickly to a Brexit crisis \u2013 and predicted he would not pivot towards securing a soft Brexit trade deal with the EU.</p> <p>Gauke said Johnson was now in an enormously strong position, with parliament unable to curb his plans. However, he said the prime minister now faced the problem of delivering Brexit without inflicting further pain on the very areas, such as the Midlands and the north-east, that delivered him a majority.</p> <p>\u201cTo what extent is he going to deliver a purist form of Brexit, or is he going to look to find a pragmatic way forward that ensures our economy can grow?\u201d he said. \u201cI would have thought the more likely course of action for him is to keep beating the Brexit drum and blame any difficulties on the EU and appear defiant. His determination to diverge makes it hard to see common ground. I hope some kind of pragmatic compromise is the way forward, but given how boxed in he is on the implementation period not being extended and an apparent determination to reject any kind of dynamic alignment, I think we may well find ourselves at the end of 2020 facing real problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c38ba9c4f0acbcf587124034edc84835f84becad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c38ba9c4f0acbcf587124034edc84835f84becad/0_0_2045_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson is likely to blame the EU for any difficulties in forging a deal, says David Gauke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe part of the country that is likely to be worst hit by a hard Brexit is the north-east of England, an area that has voted Conservative in a way that is unprecedented. That\u2019s going to make it hard \u2026 If you haven\u2019t got a strong economy that gives you the money to spend on the north of England, then it will be very hard to square the circle.\u201d</p> <p>Gyimah agreed: \u201cBumper-sticker slogans like \u2018take back control\u2019 and \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 may unite different tribes for the purposes of a campaign, but their interests are not aligned. The faultlines that run through Brexit are as real as ever.</p> <p>\u201cThere are painful trade-offs ahead, which will affect every sector and every constituency in the country in different ways. An 80-seat majority cannot deny this reality, nor can you use pork-barrel politics to blunt the edge of every hard Brexit policy decision. Most of those new MPs will have some tough explaining to do to their constituents as the rubber hits the road. And a slower-growing economy means less money for public services, and a new era of self-imposed austerity.\u201d</p> <p>The prospect of securing a good trade deal at the end of 2020 was very uncertain, said Grieve. \u201cOne of the themes of the election that continues to be of great concern to me is the risk of ending up with either a very unsatisfactory deal or no deal at all. I think they are very considerable.\u201d</p> <p>He also predicted a new constitutional crisis as Brexit takes place. \u201cIf the border in the Irish Sea starts to materialise, then I can foresee that politics in Northern Ireland will become very heated up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been underestimated, quite apart from the fact that it may also lead obviously to a rise on the other side for a demand for a border poll. With Scotland, the SNP have the grievance to revive the call for independence. How is that going to be contained? It is containable for a while, but I\u2019m not sure it is if the SNP get a majority in the 2021 Scottish parliamentary elections.\u201d</p> <p>Soubry, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston\" title=\"\">quit the Tories in February</a> to start the Independent Group for Change, called on Tories who had privately expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s approach to speak out. \u201cYou do have to say, where are these people that sat in meetings with the likes of me and Dominic Grieve, Antoinette Sandbach, who put the people\u2019s interests before their own. Where are they now? What are they going to do? Are they going to sit on their hands and stay mute?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad054fabcb8a7aca567b7edc0a6dbfc9bd487472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad054fabcb8a7aca567b7edc0a6dbfc9bd487472/0_117_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Soubry believes there is still potential for a new progressive party to emerge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Soubry believes there is still potential for a new progressive party to emerge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Soubry said that despite the failure of her new party, there was still the potential for a new progressive party to emerge should Labour continue to be embroiled in civil war. \u201cThe Tory party will get its comeuppance in due course,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tragedy is that unless the Labour moderates do the brave and right thing and leave to form a new centre-ground party, then the Tory party will be in power for at least 10 years, unchecked and unopposed. We were always the unofficial opposition. We were a genuine coalition. It was the David Lammys, the Dominic Grieves, it included the Lib Dems and SNP. We were hugely effective at checking the excesses.</p> <p>\u201cAll those people who were part of the much bigger grouping that cometh the hour didn\u2019t have the courage [to leave Labour], if they now want to do that. And if the Lib Dems recognise that they too have to change \u2026 and accept that there must be a different way of doing politics \u2013 if those things happen, then we could rebuild the centre ground of politics as we tried to do in February and failed. But it relies on people being brave and honest. I\u2019d be more than happy to play my part in that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Liberal voters are going to have to live with the fact that there is no proper opposition to the prime minister</p> <footer> <cite>Dominic Grieve</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gyimah urged liberals to \u201cresist the idea that the size of the majority means the case for progressive politics has been lost\u201d. He added: \u201cBritain now needs a new narrative that looks to the future and progressive voices must be a part of forging it. I continue to believe passionately that we need a progressive centre. If we\u2019re serious about winning this battle for the future, tribalism on the progressive left has to end \u2026 This fight won\u2019t be won in the next news cycle.

      "bodyText": "The next year will see a fresh Brexit crisis, parliament sidelined and a renewed threat to the union \u2013 but there is still hope for supporters of progressive politics, according to some of the leading figures who took on the government over Brexit. The 80-strong majority secured by Boris Johnson at the election ended the parliamentary stalemate that left the prime minister unable to push through his Brexit deal. The election also ended the tenures of key figures responsible for leading the battle to oppose his plans. The Observer spoke to David Gauke, who quit the cabinet; Sam Gyimah, who defected from the Tories to the Lib Dems; Anna Soubry, who set up a new party; and Dominic Grieve, who helped lead the fight against Brexit in parliament, about the crucial year ahead. They pointed to key contradictions in Johnson\u2019s plans that could lead quickly to a Brexit crisis \u2013 and predicted he would not pivot towards securing a soft Brexit trade deal with the EU. Gauke said Johnson was now in an enormously strong position, with parliament unable to curb his plans. However, he said the prime minister now faced the problem of delivering Brexit without inflicting further pain on the very areas, such as the Midlands and the north-east, that delivered him a majority. \u201cTo what extent is he going to deliver a purist form of Brexit, or is he going to look to find a pragmatic way forward that ensures our economy can grow?\u201d he said. \u201cI would have thought the more likely course of action for him is to keep beating the Brexit drum and blame any difficulties on the EU and appear defiant. His determination to diverge makes it hard to see common ground. I hope some kind of pragmatic compromise is the way forward, but given how boxed in he is on the implementation period not being extended and an apparent determination to reject any kind of dynamic alignment, I think we may well find ourselves at the end of 2020 facing real problems. \u201cThe part of the country that is likely to be worst hit by a hard Brexit is the north-east of England, an area that has voted Conservative in a way that is unprecedented. That\u2019s going to make it hard \u2026 If you haven\u2019t got a strong economy that gives you the money to spend on the north of England, then it will be very hard to square the circle.\u201d Gyimah agreed: \u201cBumper-sticker slogans like \u2018take back control\u2019 and \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 may unite different tribes for the purposes of a campaign, but their interests are not aligned. The faultlines that run through Brexit are as real as ever. \u201cThere are painful trade-offs ahead, which will affect every sector and every constituency in the country in different ways. An 80-seat majority cannot deny this reality, nor can you use pork-barrel politics to blunt the edge of every hard Brexit policy decision. Most of those new MPs will have some tough explaining to do to their constituents as the rubber hits the road. And a slower-growing economy means less money for public services, and a new era of self-imposed austerity.\u201d The prospect of securing a good trade deal at the end of 2020 was very uncertain, said Grieve. \u201cOne of the themes of the election that continues to be of great concern to me is the risk of ending up with either a very unsatisfactory deal or no deal at all. I think they are very considerable.\u201d He also predicted a new constitutional crisis as Brexit takes place. \u201cIf the border in the Irish Sea starts to materialise, then I can foresee that politics in Northern Ireland will become very heated up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been underestimated, quite apart from the fact that it may also lead obviously to a rise on the other side for a demand for a border poll. With Scotland, the SNP have the grievance to revive the call for independence. How is that going to be contained? It is containable for a while, but I\u2019m not sure it is if the SNP get a majority in the 2021 Scottish parliamentary elections.\u201d Soubry, who quit the Tories in February to start the Independent Group for Change, called on Tories who had privately expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s approach to speak out. \u201cYou do have to say, where are these people that sat in meetings with the likes of me and Dominic Grieve, Antoinette Sandbach, who put the people\u2019s interests before their own. Where are they now? What are they going to do? Are they going to sit on their hands and stay mute?\u201d However, Soubry said that despite the failure of her new party, there was still the potential for a new progressive party to emerge should Labour continue to be embroiled in civil war. \u201cThe Tory party will get its comeuppance in due course,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tragedy is that unless the Labour moderates do the brave and right thing and leave to form a new centre-ground party, then the Tory party will be in power for at least 10 years, unchecked and unopposed. We were always the unofficial opposition. We were a genuine coalition. It was the David Lammys, the Dominic Grieves, it included the Lib Dems and SNP. We were hugely effective at checking the excesses. \u201cAll those people who were part of the much bigger grouping that cometh the hour didn\u2019t have the courage [to leave Labour], if they now want to do that. And if the Lib Dems recognise that they too have to change \u2026 and accept that there must be a different way of doing politics \u2013 if those things happen, then we could rebuild the centre ground of politics as we tried to do in February and failed. But it relies on people being brave and honest. I\u2019d be more than happy to play my part in that.\u201d Gyimah urged liberals to \u201cresist the idea that the size of the majority means the case for progressive politics has been lost\u201d. He added: \u201cBritain now needs a new narrative that looks to the future and progressive voices must be a part of forging it. I continue to believe passionately that we need a progressive centre. If we\u2019re serious about winning this battle for the future, tribalism on the progressive left has to end \u2026 This fight won\u2019t be won in the next news cycle. We can win it, because populists eventually get found out. The wheel of history will turn again and we must be ready.\u201d Grieve is less optimistic. \u201cLiberal voters are going to have to live with the fact that there is currently no proper opposition to the prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in for a period where opposition to what Johnson is doing is going to be very difficult to put together. I was just looking at a letter sent to me this morning that contains the words, \u2018God for Boris, England and St George! We will take the Brexit hill, Mr Grieve. It is there in our history.\u2019 There will be a lot of people who will be let down if God for Boris, England and St George doesn\u2019t succeed.\u201d",

Every Christmas of my childhood that I can remember, the shiny black school shoes were neatly lined up by the door. A new pair for all of us. Then came the new clothes proudly presented by my parents \u2013 the fruit of long hours of labour. And then, in our new finery, off we went to church. The long sunny hours of Christmas Day, usually with a brief but refreshing afternoon thunderstorm, were spent at huge family gatherings, feasting on chicken and rice, washed down with an array of brightly-coloured soft drinks \u2013 cherry plum, cream soda and Fanta orange.</p> <p>As the years went by and independence came to Zimbabwe, many things changed. But Christmas traditions remained much the same, with big gatherings to which people travelled many miles, new clothes, lots to eat and drink.</p> <p>Back in February this year, we had started planning a family reunion to be held in the Mbanga village in central Zimbabwe. With family scattered all over the world since 2000, I felt we needed to make an effort to touch base back home. I myself had been allowed to return from exile in September 2018, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/robert-mugabe-resigns-as-president-of-zimbabwe\" title=\"\">Robert Mugabe had been removed from power</a>.</p> <p>We set up a \u201cChristmas in Zimbabwe\u201d WhatsApp group, and for months excited messages flew back and forth with tips for cheap flights, recipes for traditional fare and accommodation plans. But as the year went by, things back home deteriorated significantly, with the government declaring at the end of September that foreign currency was no longer legal tender \u2013 11 years after the US dollar became the de facto national currency!</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/zimbabwe-to-print-local-us-dollar-to-ease-severe-cash-crunch\" title=\"\">Zimdollar</a> was reintroduced by government directive at par with the US dollar. Within a few days, it was 10:1 and by November the rate on the street was 25:1. As December approached, it became apparent that family members abroad were sacrificing every available penny to keep those at home alive \u2013 part of the US$2bn diaspora remittances into Zimbabwe annually. Regretfully, one by one, they cancelled. I was determined to go. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I arrived in mid-December, the tales of hardship were heart-breaking. There\u2019d be no gifts for children this year.</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I arrived in mid-December, the tales of hardship were heart-breaking. The cost of goods constantly rises, as do the prices of transport, utilities and rent. There would be no gifts for their children this year \u2013 not even new shoes. For those with a job, salaries cannot keep pace with the rampant inflation, now estimated at over 300%, as employers battle to stay afloat. </p> <p>As I travelled on to Harare, the main trunk road was eerily empty. At this time of year it should have been packed with traffic. But in the many small towns along the route, there was chaos. Long lines of vehicles waiting in fuel queues blocked the main thoroughfares. There were people everywhere, many of them desperately trying to sell their wares \u2013 cellphone airtime cards, wild fruits, trashy Chinese geegaws, bananas, cabbages, roasted maize cobs and bottles of water. Hundreds queued at banks and ATMs in a desperate attempt to get cash. </p> <p>Despite the fact that selling anything for US dollars is illegal, the government turns a blind eye to ruling party Zanu PF-connected businessmen who refuse to sell fuel for anything other than the greenback. After passing numerous queues of more than a mile in length, I was angry but grateful to get a full tank from a service station owned by a party heavyweight opposite a five-star resort in the eastern Highlands.. </p> <p>In Harare, I was keen to take my grandchildren to see the festive lights in the city centre\u2019s gardens, which I had always particularly enjoyed.. But the daily 18-hour power cuts put paid to that. When the sun goes down, the city is plunged into darkness. Only the magnificent African sky, where you can almost touch the Milky Way, gives any light. Apart, of course, from those fortunate enough to have installed solar power. In the wealthier suburbs this is now common, with solar panels festooning roofs where once Father Christmases and reindeer blazed in red, green and blue fairy lights.</p> <p>A far cry from my 16 Christmases in exile, which had always been cold, but bright with lights of every description \u2013 from Sinterklaas in Holland to London\u2019s Oxford Street. Even candles are too precious in Zimbabwe today to waste on Christmas decoration. They are needed to cook by, to do homework by, to polish school shoes by.</p> <p><em>Wilf Mbanga is editor and founder of the independent newspaper </em><a href=\"http://www.thezimbabwean.co/\" title=\"\"><em> The Zimbabwean</em></a></p>",

Back in February this year, we had started planning a family reunion to be held in the Mbanga village in central Zimbabwe. With family scattered all over the world since 2000, I felt we needed to make an effort to touch base back home. I myself had been allowed to return from exile in September 2018, after Robert Mugabe had been removed from power. We set up a \u201cChristmas in Zimbabwe\u201d WhatsApp group, and for months excited messages flew back and forth with tips for cheap flights, recipes for traditional fare and accommodation plans. But as the year went by, things back home deteriorated significantly, with the government declaring at the end of September that foreign currency was no longer legal tender \u2013 11 years after the US dollar became the de facto national currency! The Zimdollar was reintroduced by government directive at par with the US dollar. Within a few days, it was 10:1 and by November the rate on the street was 25:1. As December approached, it became apparent that family members abroad were sacrificing every available penny to keep those at home alive \u2013 part of the US$2bn diaspora remittances into Zimbabwe annually. Regretfully, one by one, they cancelled. I was determined to go. When I arrived in mid-December, the tales of hardship were heart-breaking. The cost of goods constantly rises, as do the prices of transport, utilities and rent. There would be no gifts for their children this year \u2013 not even new shoes. For those with a job, salaries cannot keep pace with the rampant inflation, now estimated at over 300%, as employers battle to stay afloat. As I travelled on to Harare, the main trunk road was eerily empty. At this time of year it should have been packed with traffic. But in the many small towns along the route, there was chaos. Long lines of vehicles waiting in fuel queues blocked the main thoroughfares. There were people everywhere, many of them desperately trying to sell their wares \u2013 cellphone airtime cards, wild fruits, trashy Chinese geegaws, bananas, cabbages, roasted maize cobs and bottles of water. Hundreds queued at banks and ATMs in a desperate attempt to get cash. Despite the fact that selling anything for US dollars is illegal, the government turns a blind eye to ruling party Zanu PF-connected businessmen who refuse to sell fuel for anything other than the greenback. After passing numerous queues of more than a mile in length, I was angry but grateful to get a full tank from a service station owned by a party heavyweight opposite a five-star resort in the eastern Highlands.. In Harare, I was keen to take my grandchildren to see the festive lights in the city centre\u2019s gardens, which I had always particularly enjoyed.. But the daily 18-hour power cuts put paid to that. When the sun goes down, the city is plunged into darkness. Only the magnificent African sky, where you can almost touch the Milky Way, gives any light. Apart, of course, from those fortunate enough to have installed solar power. In the wealthier suburbs this is now common, with solar panels festooning roofs where once Father Christmases and reindeer blazed in red, green and blue fairy lights. A far cry from my 16 Christmases in exile, which had always been cold, but bright with lights of every description \u2013 from Sinterklaas in Holland to London\u2019s Oxford Street. Even candles are too precious in Zimbabwe today to waste on Christmas decoration. They are needed to cook by, to do homework by, to polish school shoes by.

It paints a picture of a complex 19-year-old who was capable of behaving badly but who was also out of her depth, crushed by the weight of the British establishment.</p> <p>\u201cHere is a story with two young women at its centre that we\u2019ve never seen told from the point of view of those women because they\u2019re just treated as transactional objects,\u201d says the series writer, Amanda Coe. \u201cYet once you start researching the story, the thing that really strikes you is what it must have felt like to be Christine Keeler. To be that young and to come from such a difficult, embattled background and then go through the things she went through \u2013 moving to London, having a new life and then finding herself in the public eye to this extraordinary and unprecedented degree.</p> <p>\u201cShe and Mandy became famous for being famous, and then added to this was the political espionage scandal and the fact that she was absolutely vilified as this slut who had brought down the government. There was a very real ambivalence about her and also a fascination with her sexuality as it was portrayed in the media, and the very big gap between that and her genuine emotional life. It was chaotic to be Christine and I wanted the series to show both how that might feel and why it might be.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, Rice-Davies was \u201cthe Becky Sharp of the piece\u201d says Coe. Younger than Keeler but also more streetwise, she turned potentially life-destroying accusations to her own advantage. \u201cI think Mandy is really ballsy,\u201d says Ellie Bamber, who plays her. \u201cShe had horrible accusations made against her but she rode the wave, pushed any vulnerability deep down and turned the publicity to her own advantage.\u201d</p> <p>To understand the impact of the Profumo affair on British society at the time, it\u2019s essential to realise how repressed the country still was in 1963 when the news broke that Profumo, the secretary of state for war in Harold Macmillan\u2019s government, had had an affair with Keeler.</p> <p>The spice in the story came from reports that Keeler had also been sleeping with Soviet naval attach\u00e9 \u2013 and spy \u2013 Ivanov, whom she had met through osteopath Ward. Ward had introduced her and Rice-Davies to well-connected men, and before long rumours were swirling of other establishment figures who may have known the girls. Further fuelling the already rabid press excitement was the fact that Keeler\u2019s primary romantic relationships were with young black men. \u201cShe felt they would go after her for her boyfriends so she offered Ivanov up to take the pressure off,\u201d says Coe. \u201cShe protected the genuine relationships at the expense of the transactional flings.\u201d</p> <p>Yet instead of tamping down the interest, her statement fanned the flames, and an affair that had been over within months in 1961 eventually brought down a government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf48023ffbb4a52f3471164450cb2e270531450d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf48023ffbb4a52f3471164450cb2e270531450d/0_161_2966_1779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keeler arrives at court in the 1963 trial of Ward.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeler arrives at court in the 1963 trial of Ward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe thing that really struck me reading the reports from the time is how much the press constructed the story they wanted to tell,\u201d says Andrea Harkin, who directed four of the six episodes of the series. \u201cThe accepted narrative was that Christine was a call girl, a prostitute, a siren, a femme fatale.

He takes advantage of her feelings for his own gain.\u201d</p> <p>For Coe, that ambiguity permeates the Profumo scandal. \u201cThis is a story filled with grey, and Stephen Ward in particular is a deeply ambivalent character,\u201d she says. \u201cI do think [viewers\u2019] opinions of him will change as the story goes along, as it will of Christine, because part of the message of the drama is that nobody is one thing.

A gift from an American visitor, it portrays Moses as a rugged Israelite matinee idol; a Charlton Heston in the desert. It is, Iv\u00e1nyi smiles, \u201ca bit kitsch\u201d.<br><br>Iv\u00e1nyi himself has the look of an Old Testament prophet, dressed in black and sporting a splendid biblical white beard. But there is nothing kitsch about him. The president of the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship \u2013 a small Methodist offshoot which played a heroic part in the anti-communist struggles of the 1970s and 80s \u2013 Iv\u00e1nyi is a well-known figure in Hungary\u2019s religious landscape. Now approaching 70, he is also a controversial one.</p> <p>On the first Sunday of December, together with other pastors from his church and a few like minds from different denominations, Iv\u00e1nyi published an extraordinary and furious text.</p> <p>Modelled on the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Synod-of-Barmen#ref41332\" title=\"\">Barmen Declaration of 1934</a>, which denounced the Nazification of German churches through the <em>Deutsche Christen</em> movement, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/everybody-advent-statement-of-the-hungarian-evangelical-fellowship\" title=\"\">Advent Statement</a>\u201d rejects the claims of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to be running a Christian government. Orb\u00e1n likes to boast that his administration, in contrast to secular equivalents in western Europe, is dedicated to a distinctive notion of \u201cChristian liberty\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In ancient Israel, the prophets spoke out against corruption and wickedness \u2026 we take courage from their example</p> <footer> <cite>Pastor G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Denouncing his government\u2019s centralisation of power and marginalisation of minorities, Iv\u00e1nyi and his co-authors rebut that claim in passionate prose: \u201cWe are calling for resistance to an arrogance of power that makes the concept of \u2018Christian liberty\u2019 a slogan for exclusionary, hate-filled and corrosive policy; a power that destroys the social fabric \u2026 that systematically threatens democracy and the rule of law. True<strong> </strong>Christian freedom is always threatened by a politics that separates and isolates. The authoritarian exercise of power is spreading around the world but especially before our eyes in Hungary.\u201d As biblical evidence, the declaration cites the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25: \u201cI was hungry and you gave me something to eat \u2026 I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me.\u201d</p> <p>The European Union has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Hungary over issues relating to its asylum policies, press freedom and judicial independence. This intervention though, is in a different register altogether. And far closer to home.</p> <p>Iv\u00e1nyi knows Orb\u00e1n well from the tumultuous days of communism\u2019s collapse, when they were on the same side. He baptised two of the prime minister\u2019s children, and when the up-and-coming politician embraced Christianity in the 1990s, he renewed Orb\u00e1n\u2019s marriage vows in his church. Relations have soured dramatically since then, as Iv\u00e1nyi has refused to give cover to his old ally\u2019s drift to the authoritarian right. In 2011, a year after Orb\u00e1n was re-elected as prime minister, state funding to the Evangelical Fellowship church was withdrawn. It will certainly remain a pariah organisation after this declaration. But Iv\u00e1nyi has no doubts that this needed to be done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40f336fc999b2ae7fab59f4435d718226b928c81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40f336fc999b2ae7fab59f4435d718226b928c81/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pastor G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pastor G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi, once the prime minister\u2019s ally, now a fierce critic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tam\u00e1s Kov\u00e1cs/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are ringing the alarm bell.

The idea of participation in public life, for people who grew up under communism, when churches were systematically placed at a civil disadvantage, was very tempting. I think that in 2010 [when Orb\u00e1n was re-elected prime minister] there was a sense of hope in the churches. Church leaders thought: \u2018This government may be far from perfect but it\u2019s a way of getting things done, for example of making sure there\u2019s a Christian ethos in the schools.\u2019 From speaking to people in the churches, I think they thought they could ride the tiger.\u201d</p> <p>After 10 years in which Orb\u00e1n\u2019s grip on civil society has been relentlessly strengthened, Faludy says: \u201cAt best, the churches have chosen quietism rather than prophetic vocation.\u201d</p> <p>D\u00f3ra Laborczi founded a blog for the Hungarian Lutheran church on public life. Disillusioned with the church\u2019s timidity, she now edits an independent one called \u201cChristian culture\u201d, which attacks the intrusion of rightwing populism into Hungary\u2019s religious life. \u201cIt gets exasperating dealing with all the stock phrases,\u201d she says. \u201cThe aggressive polemics against refugees, the homeless, the poor, NGOs, same-sex marriage and any gender issues. The references to a \u2018Bible of Death\u2019 when discussing homosexuality. Constant reference to murder when abortion comes up.\u201d</p> <p>In the Lutheran church, she says, as in others, there is a fear of stepping out of line. \u201cThey try to say nothing because they fear the trouble it will cause and the members they will lose. Ten years ago, the Lutheran church could have a debate about gay people\u2019s place in the church. That wouldn\u2019t happen now. Rightwing populism dominates the church, and secular liberals are ferociously anti-religion. Christians like me often feel isolated and alone.\u201d</p> <p>Laborczi\u2019s husband used to be a Lutheran pastor. \u201cHe works in IT now,\u201d she says.

This compact red-brick church is the centre of worship for the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship. It is a remarkable building, designed to express solidarity between the Christian and Jewish faiths. On each larchwood pew, a star of David has been carved, and on this sunny December day light streams through a large Menorah-shaped window.</p> <p>One by one, members of the congregation stand up to dedicate the day\u2019s service: \u201cMay my son\u2019s broken wrist heal quickly,\u201d says one woman. \u201cMay this lovely sunshine continue,\u201d says another to laughter. Then a third woman rises to say: \u201cMay our theatres be successfully defended from the government\u2019s new legislation and may the demonstration against it succeed tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The prayer refers to a law giving the state a role in the appointment of theatre directors. Duly passed, it defines the purpose of the arts as the protection of \u201cthe interests of the nation\u2019s survival, wellbeing and growth\u201d. A well-attended demonstration did take place however, and was addressed by the newly elected liberal mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony. Kar\u00e1csony has already given positive signals to the homeless shelter that Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s church runs, and there is optimism that the battle against poverty and drug addiction in the city has a new, powerful ally.</p> <p>After the service, as the congregation chats over cups of tea, a guest is introduced. Judit Rajk is a well-known classical singer and the wife of the late L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk, an avant-garde architect who was blacklisted by the communist regime and became, more recently, a critic of Orb\u00e1n. Rajk died in September and, gently prompted by Iv\u00e1nyi, his wife tells a few stories about him, before saying sadly: \u201cIn recent years he wasn\u2019t getting any contracts.\u201d </p> <p>Filing out of the reception hall, Abel Tamas, whose wife Petra is a pastor in Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s church, explains why he is also a supporter. \u201cIn the 1980s,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was a hope that the new Hungary would be a liberal country where human rights were a reality. That liberal tradition survives in enclaves, and this place is one of them.\u201d Tamas is Jewish. \u201cFor Hungarian Jews, this community is important not just for religious reasons. We know it is a place that will stand up for human rights.\u201d</p> <p>Or, as Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s Advent statement puts it: \u201cWe believe that God\u2019s wisdom is reflected in our diversity and that we were all created in God\u2019s wisdom and likeness. We want this image and likeness to be recognised and honoured in the image of the other person. We are speaking now because we sense the return of perils and shadows of the past.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 December 2019. Due to an error in the editing process, an earlier version stated that the Hungarian Reformed church, the Catholic church and the Evangelical-Lutherans were invited and declined to sign Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s declaration. They were not invited to sign.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the wall of Pastor G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s study, in the heart of one of Budapest\u2019s poorest districts, a painting depicts Moses in the wilderness, gazing towards the promised land. A gift from an American visitor, it portrays Moses as a rugged Israelite matinee idol; a Charlton Heston in the desert. It is, Iv\u00e1nyi smiles, \u201ca bit kitsch\u201d. Iv\u00e1nyi himself has the look of an Old Testament prophet, dressed in black and sporting a splendid biblical white beard. But there is nothing kitsch about him. The president of the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship \u2013 a small Methodist offshoot which played a heroic part in the anti-communist struggles of the 1970s and 80s \u2013 Iv\u00e1nyi is a well-known figure in Hungary\u2019s religious landscape. Now approaching 70, he is also a controversial one. On the first Sunday of December, together with other pastors from his church and a few like minds from different denominations, Iv\u00e1nyi published an extraordinary and furious text. Modelled on the Barmen Declaration of 1934, which denounced the Nazification of German churches through the Deutsche Christen movement, the \u201cAdvent Statement\u201d rejects the claims of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to be running a Christian government. Orb\u00e1n likes to boast that his administration, in contrast to secular equivalents in western Europe, is dedicated to a distinctive notion of \u201cChristian liberty\u201d. Denouncing his government\u2019s centralisation of power and marginalisation of minorities, Iv\u00e1nyi and his co-authors rebut that claim in passionate prose: \u201cWe are calling for resistance to an arrogance of power that makes the concept of \u2018Christian liberty\u2019 a slogan for exclusionary, hate-filled and corrosive policy; a power that destroys the social fabric \u2026 that systematically threatens democracy and the rule of law. True Christian freedom is always threatened by a politics that separates and isolates. The authoritarian exercise of power is spreading around the world but especially before our eyes in Hungary.\u201d As biblical evidence, the declaration cites the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25: \u201cI was hungry and you gave me something to eat \u2026 I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me.\u201d The European Union has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Hungary over issues relating to its asylum policies, press freedom and judicial independence. This intervention though, is in a different register altogether. And far closer to home. Iv\u00e1nyi knows Orb\u00e1n well from the tumultuous days of communism\u2019s collapse, when they were on the same side. He baptised two of the prime minister\u2019s children, and when the up-and-coming politician embraced Christianity in the 1990s, he renewed Orb\u00e1n\u2019s marriage vows in his church. Relations have soured dramatically since then, as Iv\u00e1nyi has refused to give cover to his old ally\u2019s drift to the authoritarian right. In 2011, a year after Orb\u00e1n was re-elected as prime minister, state funding to the Evangelical Fellowship church was withdrawn. It will certainly remain a pariah organisation after this declaration. But Iv\u00e1nyi has no doubts that this needed to be done. \u201cWe are ringing the alarm bell. Of course there are differences between now and the 1930s but it is the similarities we should focus on. Orb\u00e1n wants to become the charismatic leader of a nationalist European right. He talks about the restoration of lands Hungary lost at Versailles after the first world war, 100 years ago. That\u2019s dangerous. He is a child playing with something that once made Europe burn.\u201d It is, above all, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s determination to present his Fidesz government as distinctively Christian that led to the Advent statement. \u201cHe is turning the Christian message on its head,\u201d says Iv\u00e1nyi. \u201cIs there any other Christian country in the world where it is written in the constitution that you can be jailed for being homeless? Is it a Christian country where asylum seekers are not given the basic resources they need to survive? Is it Christian to use power to abolish media freedoms, the independence of judges and academic autonomy? \u201cIn ancient Israel, the prophets spoke out against corruption and wickedness. We are now compelled to speak out. We might not be Isaiahs or Jeremiahs. But we take courage from their example.\u201d Iv\u00e1nyi is respected far beyond his own congregations by those who remember his courage before 1989. But in challenging Orb\u00e1n so brazenly, he stands almost alone. \u201cThe other churches should be doing far more,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they stood together for what is right, then Orb\u00e1n couldn\u2019t do the things he does. Refugees starve at our borders. George Soros is demonised with antisemitic overtones. But no one from the churches speaks out. Jesus told his disciples: \u2018You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavour, with what shall it be salted?\u2019 In Hungary, the churches should be the salt of the earth. Preaching the gospel is not a philosophical exercise.\u201d The battle between Iv\u00e1nyi and Orb\u00e1n over the meaning of Christianity goes to the heart of Europe\u2019s culture wars. Serving as a reboot of his original doctrine of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d, the idea of \u201cChristian liberty\u201d is defined by Orb\u00e1n as a politics of \u201cthe common good\u201d, dedicated to the protection of the nation\u2019s culture, values and borders. Liberal internationalism and individualism, which uproots citizens from the ties that bind, threaten this vision of warm, rooted and homogenous community. More migration, says Orb\u00e1n, \u201cwould destroy Europe, the way we know it today\u201d. This type of thinking has blazed a trail for rightwing populist movements across Europe, as supposedly Christian values have been weaponised. The battlegrounds of choice have ranged from so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d to multiculturalism, LGBT rights and abortion. And as politicians such as Orb\u00e1n claim that God is on their side, liberal parishioners, priests, pastors, bishops, cardinals and ministers have faced a dilemma: speak out or stay silent about the dangers of a domineering politics that demonises minorities and outsiders. The proportion of Hungarians who actually go to church each week is small. Only 12% of Catholics, for example, regularly attend services. But given the country\u2019s communist past, the cultural reach and significance of its churches is huge. A year before being re-elected as prime minister, Orb\u00e1n told supporters that he intended to construct a \u201ccentral political force field\u201d to keep the right in power \u201cfor the coming 15 to 20 years\u201d.

Disillusioned with the church\u2019s timidity, she now edits an independent one called \u201cChristian culture\u201d, which attacks the intrusion of rightwing populism into Hungary\u2019s religious life. \u201cIt gets exasperating dealing with all the stock phrases,\u201d she says. \u201cThe aggressive polemics against refugees, the homeless, the poor, NGOs, same-sex marriage and any gender issues. The references to a \u2018Bible of Death\u2019 when discussing homosexuality. Constant reference to murder when abortion comes up.\u201d In the Lutheran church, she says, as in others, there is a fear of stepping out of line. \u201cThey try to say nothing because they fear the trouble it will cause and the members they will lose. Ten years ago, the Lutheran church could have a debate about gay people\u2019s place in the church. That wouldn\u2019t happen now. Rightwing populism dominates the church, and secular liberals are ferociously anti-religion. Christians like me often feel isolated and alone.\u201d Laborczi\u2019s husband used to be a Lutheran pastor. \u201cHe works in IT now,\u201d she says. Laborczi often thinks back to a conversation with her father when she was young and Hungary\u2019s post-communist democracy was in its infancy. \u201cMy father said I was going to grow up in a free democratic society,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel on some level I\u2019m living something similar to what he experienced when it comes to the silence and self-censorship that goes on, even if there aren\u2019t any black cars arriving on doorsteps.\u201d A 15-minute drive from the heart of Budapest, on the ragged northern periphery of the city, the House of Reconciliation has almost filled up by 9am on the second Sunday of Advent. This compact red-brick church is the centre of worship for the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship. It is a remarkable building, designed to express solidarity between the Christian and Jewish faiths. On each larchwood pew, a star of David has been carved, and on this sunny December day light streams through a large Menorah-shaped window. One by one, members of the congregation stand up to dedicate the day\u2019s service: \u201cMay my son\u2019s broken wrist heal quickly,\u201d says one woman. \u201cMay this lovely sunshine continue,\u201d says another to laughter. Then a third woman rises to say: \u201cMay our theatres be successfully defended from the government\u2019s new legislation and may the demonstration against it succeed tomorrow.\u201d The prayer refers to a law giving the state a role in the appointment of theatre directors. Duly passed, it defines the purpose of the arts as the protection of \u201cthe interests of the nation\u2019s survival, wellbeing and growth\u201d. A well-attended demonstration did take place however, and was addressed by the newly elected liberal mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony. Kar\u00e1csony has already given positive signals to the homeless shelter that Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s church runs, and there is optimism that the battle against poverty and drug addiction in the city has a new, powerful ally. After the service, as the congregation chats over cups of tea, a guest is introduced. Judit Rajk is a well-known classical singer and the wife of the late L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk, an avant-garde architect who was blacklisted by the communist regime and became, more recently, a critic of Orb\u00e1n. Rajk died in September and, gently prompted by Iv\u00e1nyi, his wife tells a few stories about him, before saying sadly: \u201cIn recent years he wasn\u2019t getting any contracts.\u201d Filing out of the reception hall, Abel Tamas, whose wife Petra is a pastor in Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s church, explains why he is also a supporter. \u201cIn the 1980s,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was a hope that the new Hungary would be a liberal country where human rights were a reality. That liberal tradition survives in enclaves, and this place is one of them.\u201d Tamas is Jewish. \u201cFor Hungarian Jews, this community is important not just for religious reasons. We know it is a place that will stand up for human rights.\u201d Or, as Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s Advent statement puts it: \u201cWe believe that God\u2019s wisdom is reflected in our diversity and that we were all created in God\u2019s wisdom and likeness. We want this image and likeness to be recognised and honoured in the image of the other person. We are speaking now because we sense the return of perils and shadows of the past.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 December 2019. Due to an error in the editing process, an earlier version stated that the Hungarian Reformed church, the Catholic church and the Evangelical-Lutherans were invited and declined to sign Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s declaration. They were not invited to sign.",

I looked across to the front door, which was flapping open. As a customer left, they pulled it shut behind them. It sprung open again, just enough to let in a gust of frigid air. I studied the narrow, L-shaped dining room with its textured walls in light shades of oatmeal, and its bar tiled in jade green, and its hard-wooden banquettes, with their sky-blue panels. The colours may have changed, but everything else was familiar, including my plummeting core temperature. I got out my phone and did something I never, ever, ever do, because it\u2019s hideously vain and I am absolutely not that person. Not at all. Not me. I Googled myself.</p> <p>I thought I recognised that cold wind.

Back then it was an ill-conceived modish Indian restaurant, limbering up to die.

It is smooth and close to a light peanut butter. Next to this is a pumpkin tirshy, a Moroccan dip the colour of a dying sun, with the acidity of preserved lemons, the fire of harissa and the light bitterness of kalamata olives.

There\u2019s an enthusiastically refreshing coconut and cardamom sorbet on plums roasted with the purple citrus spring of sumac, all of it scattered with grated coconut. There\u2019s a brilliant date and tangerine ice-cream dribbled with more tahini. (Can you imagine how much tahini they get through in a week here? I hope they\u2019re investing in sesame futures.) But at this point, what you want is friable pastries; something made with crushed nuts and syrup and orange blossom, and maybe sweetened cream cheese.

I looked across to the front door, which was flapping open. As a customer left, they pulled it shut behind them. It sprung open again, just enough to let in a gust of frigid air. I studied the narrow, L-shaped dining room with its textured walls in light shades of oatmeal, and its bar tiled in jade green, and its hard-wooden banquettes, with their sky-blue panels. The colours may have changed, but everything else was familiar, including my plummeting core temperature. I got out my phone and did something I never, ever, ever do, because it\u2019s hideously vain and I am absolutely not that person. Not at all. Not me. I Googled myself. I thought I recognised that cold wind. Exactly two years ago I sat in this very same dining room, on Commercial Street in east London. Back then it was an ill-conceived modish Indian restaurant, limbering up to die. In that review I also whined about the door. \u201cEfficiently, on a cold November lunchtime,\u201d I wrote, \u201cthe open front door channels chilly air right to the back corner.

For all that the quality of wines has improved, I\u2019m not sure all these new kids on the sparkling block have really managed to make an immediately identifiable regional style. Handed a glass of one of them on New Year\u2019s Eve, how many of us would be able to guess that M&amp;S\u2019s pair of Antipodean fizzes \u2013 the Craft 3 or New Zealand\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/sparkling-mount-bluff-brut-nv-case-of-6/p/p21127083\" title=\"\">Mount Bluff Brut NV (\u00a315) </a>\u2013 had their origins Down Under rather than on the Montagne de Reims?

Does that take some of the shine off drinking it on New Year\u2019s Eve? Possibly, although my love of Campari spritz, which works just fine with a decent cheapie, such as <a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Morrisons-The-Best-Prosecco-DOC/120002011\" title=\"\">Morrisons The Best Prosecco NV (\u00a37)</a> alongside the essential red bitter, never goes out of style and will certainly make an appearance on Tuesday night.

      "bodyText": "Craft 3 Sparkling Brut, South Australia, Australia NV (\u00a310, Marks &amp; Spencer) Although there has always been sparkling wine made all over the world, it\u2019s only really in the past couple of decades that France\u2019s \u2013 and by that I really mean Champagne\u2019s \u2013 stranglehold on the posh bubbly market has loosened. For all that the quality of wines has improved, I\u2019m not sure all these new kids on the sparkling block have really managed to make an immediately identifiable regional style. Handed a glass of one of them on New Year\u2019s Eve, how many of us would be able to guess that M&amp;S\u2019s pair of Antipodean fizzes \u2013 the Craft 3 or New Zealand\u2019s Mount Bluff Brut NV (\u00a315) \u2013 had their origins Down Under rather than on the Montagne de Reims? Rather fewer, I think, than would be able to do so for comparable still wines. How much that really matters is moot, since both offer a classy glass of fizz for a very good price. J Laurens Cr\u00e9mant de Limoux Les Graimenous Brut, France 2017 (\u00a313.99, Roberson Wine) One genuinely distinctive style is the one that\u2019s made sparkling wine a regular event for British drinkers rather than something we only get out on celebrations: prosecco. Does that take some of the shine off drinking it on New Year\u2019s Eve? Possibly, although my love of Campari spritz, which works just fine with a decent cheapie, such as Morrisons The Best Prosecco NV (\u00a37) alongside the essential red bitter, never goes out of style and will certainly make an appearance on Tuesday night. Other distinctive sparkling styles can be found in Catalonia (the toasty, herby Juve y Camps Gran Reserva de la Familia Cava; \u00a320.90, Fortnum &amp; Mason), Slovenia (the stone fruity Istenic Special Cuv\u00e9e No 1, NV; \u00a321.99, Novel Wines) and Limoux in France\u2019s southern Languedoc, home of the fantastically good value, apple pie-flavoured Les Graimenous. Gonet-M\u00e9deville Blanc de Noirs 1er Cru, Champagne NV (\u00a340.95, Lea &amp; Sandeman) And if \u2013 even now, when you could have a splendid English fizz, such as the electrifying Sugrue Pierre The Trouble With Dreams 2014 from West Sussex (\u00a343.50, Hennings Wines) \u2013 it still has to be Champagne on New Year\u2019s Eve, there has never been a more diverse selection of styles. You could go for an established older big name house currently on the top of its game, such as Louis Roederer, the makers of the peerless Cristal, whose Brut Premier NV (\u00a346, Waitrose) is silky and gorgeously rich yet balanced with fine lines of acidity. Or you could go for one of the many grower-producers who have emerged in the past 20 years to shake up the grandes marques, such as the quite thrilling (and pound for pound, in the Champagne context, remarkable value) blancs de noir from Gonet-M\u00e9deville, with its laser-guided richness and lipsmacking, saline finish.

      "body": "<p>2019 was the year that Netflix movies came of age, and ageing actors were made young again. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2019\" title=\"\">91st Oscars</a> in February, the bland <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/03/green-book-review-peter-farrelly-viggo-mortensen-mahershala-ali\" title=\"\">Green Book</a></em> beat the superior <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form\" title=\"\">BlackKklansman</a></em> to the best picture award, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/spike-lee-implores-us-to-regain-humanity-oscars-blackkklansman\" title=\"\">Spike Lee</a> won his first competitive Oscar in the adapted screenplay category. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/rami-malek-wins-best-actor-oscar-for-bohemian-rhapsody\" title=\"\">Rami Malik</a> scooped best actor for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/27/bohemian-rhapsody-review-queen-biopic-will-not-rock-you\" title=\"\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a></em>, but best actress Olivia Colman (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos\" title=\"\">The Favourite</a></em>) stole the evening with one of the funniest and most self-deprecating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUytvAg_hE4\" title=\"\">acceptance speeches</a> ever (complete with raspberry-blowing).</p> <p>More significantly, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/02/roma-review-alfonso-cuaron-ode-to-childhood-70s-mexico-city\" title=\"\">Roma</a></em> won for cinematography, direction and best foreign language film, despite naysayers\u2019 complaints that Netflix-backed movies were essentially made-for-TV films. That attitude is now history: in the forthcoming awards season, the platform has several contenders, including Noah Baumbach\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-noah-baumbach-best-film-yet\" title=\"\">Marriage Story</a></em> and Martin Scorsese\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/10/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci-netflix\" title=\"\">The Irishman</a></em>.</p> <p><em>The Irishman</em> marked a watershed moment for \u201cdigital de-ageing\u201d, with innovative technology allowing Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci to play characters much younger than themselves. We\u2019ve seen de-aging elsewhere (from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/10/captain-marvel-brie-larson-middling-marvel\" title=\"\">Captain Marvel</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/gemini-man-review-will-smith-unconvincing\" title=\"\">Gemini Man</a></em>), but never this unobtrusively. Alongside the release of its <a href=\"https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/netflix-launches-trailer-for-its-first-original-animated-feature-sergio-pablos-hand-drawn-klaus-180530.html\" title=\"\">first original animated feature</a>, Sergio Pablos\u2019s <em>Klaus</em>, Netflix also picked up distribution rights for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/24/i-lost-my-body-review-french-animation-jeremy-clapin-severed-hand\" title=\"\">I Lost My Body</a></em>, which made history when it took the <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/news/jeremy-clapins-i-lost-my-body-wins-2019-cannes-critics-week/5139842.article\" title=\"\">top prize</a> in the Critics\u2019 Week section at Cannes in May.

The Cannes <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.es/20190526/banderas-wins-cannes-best-actor-as-almodovar-alter-ego\" title=\"\">best actor</a> award went to Antonio Banderas for his career-best turn in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s semi-autobiographical <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/25/pain-and-glory-review-pedro-almodovar-antonio-banderas-penelope-cruz\" title=\"\">Pain and Glory</a></em>.</p> <p>A range of high-quality films from around the world graced UK cinemas in 2019. From Colombia we had <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/birds-of-passage-review-colombia-drug-trade\" title=\"\">Birds of Passage</a></em>, an arresting tale of gangsters and spirits from the creators of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/12/embrace-of-the-serpent-observer-review\" title=\"\">Embrace of the Serpent</a></em>. Writer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/16/nadine-labaki-interview-capernaum-film-director-actor-lebanon-oscar-nomination\" title=\"\">Nadine Labaki</a> earned an Oscar nomination with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/24/capernaum-review-nadine-labaki-oscar-nominated-zain-al-rafeea\" title=\"\">Capernaum</a>,</em> about a young boy\u2019s struggles in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Icelandic actor Halld\u00f3ra Geirhar\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir excelled in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/05/woman-at-war-review-benedikt-erlingsson-icelandic-eco-comedy\" title=\"\">Woman at War</a>,</em> a jet-black eco-warrior comedy featuring onscreen musical accompaniment with drums, accordion and sousaphone.</p> <p>This year also saw a plethora of brilliant film scores. Standouts included Clint Mansell\u2019s ethereal <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/31/out-of-blue-review-carol-morley-patricia-clarkson-martin-amis\" title=\"\">Out of Blue</a></em> soundtrack; Anna Meredith\u2019s mesmerising electronica accompaniment to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bo-burnham\" title=\"\">Bo Burnham</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/24/eighth-grade-review-elsie-fisher-josh-hamilton-bo-burnham\" title=\"\">Eighth Grade</a></em>; Alex Weston\u2019s unexpectedly quirky music for The Farewell; and Mica Levi\u2019s otherworldly score for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/27/monos-review-alejandro-landes-teenage-guerrillas\" title=\"\">Monos</a></em>. My favourite score was by Icelandic composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, who lent real depth to one of 2019\u2019s most successful and controversial releases, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/06/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-ace-turn\" title=\"\">Joker</a></em>.</p> <p>Great scores weren\u2019t confined to drama: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nainita-desai\" title=\"\">Nainita Desai</a> provided excellent understated accompaniment to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/for-sama-review-documentary-aleppo-syria\" title=\"\">For Sama</a></em>, an astonishing documentary about life under siege in Aleppo, filmed by Syrian citizen-journalist Waad al-Kateab. Matt Morton\u2019s music took audiences into space in Apollo 11, a documentary released on the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing. More down to earth (although no less ecstatic) was <em>Amazing Grace</em>, the long-delayed film of Aretha Franklin\u2019s two-night performance at the New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Los Angeles in 1972.</p> <p>This year also proved to be remarkable for talent grown closer to home. In April, Irish actor and singer Jessie Buckley shone in Tom Harper\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/14/wild-rose-review-jessie-buckley\" title=\"\">Wild Rose</a></em>, about a single mother living in Glasgow but dreaming of country music stardom in Nashville. In May, Dexter Fletcher\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/26/rocketman-review-right-spectacle-elton-john\" title=\"\">Rocketman</a></em> channelled the spirit of Ken Russell as it turned Elton John\u2019s life into a rip-roaring pop fantasia. June saw the release of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/09/dirty-god-review-uplifting-portrait-true-survivor\" title=\"\">Dirty God</a></em>, boasting a star-making turn from feature first-timer Vicky Knight. And in July, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/14/only-you-review-harry-wootliff-laia-costa-josh-oconnor-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">Only You</a></em> was an extraordinary feature debut from writer-director Harry Wootliff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6e4c22a49634acbe8cbe020dbd4bc21dd1d66c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6e4c22a49634acbe8cbe020dbd4bc21dd1d66c0/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laia Costa and Josh O\u2019Connor in Only You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laia Costa and Josh O\u2019Connor in Only You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curzon Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As summer turned to autumn, Joanna Hogg gave us <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/the-souvenir-review-joanna-hogg-tom-burke-honor-swinton-byrne-tilda-swinton\" title=\"\">The Souvenir</a></em>, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/18/joanna-hogg-the-souvenir-film-interview-honor-swinton-byrne-tilda\" title=\"\">Honor Swinton Byrne</a> and Tom Burke excelled in a close-to-life story of a relationship built upon deceit. From writer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/19/shola-amoo-the-man-behind-the-british-moonlight\" title=\"\">Shola Amoo</a> came another autobiographically inspired work, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/29/the-last-tree-review-shola-amoo\" title=\"\">The Last Tree</a></em>, about a British-Nigerian boy being uprooted from an idyllic rural childhood to face life on the mean streets of London.</p> <p>My favourite film of 2019 was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/bait-review-mark-jenkin-cornish-fishing-village\" title=\"\">Bait</a></em>, the breakthrough feature from Cornish film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/23/rocking-the-boat-how-cornish-class-war-inspired-a-masterpiece\" title=\"\">Mark Jenkin</a>.

      "bodyText": "2019 was the year that Netflix movies came of age, and ageing actors were made young again. At the 91st Oscars in February, the bland Green Book beat the superior BlackKklansman to the best picture award, although Spike Lee won his first competitive Oscar in the adapted screenplay category. Rami Malik scooped best actor for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, but best actress Olivia Colman (The Favourite) stole the evening with one of the funniest and most self-deprecating acceptance speeches ever (complete with raspberry-blowing). More significantly, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma won for cinematography, direction and best foreign language film, despite naysayers\u2019 complaints that Netflix-backed movies were essentially made-for-TV films. That attitude is now history: in the forthcoming awards season, the platform has several contenders, including Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story and Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman. The Irishman marked a watershed moment for \u201cdigital de-ageing\u201d, with innovative technology allowing Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci to play characters much younger than themselves. We\u2019ve seen de-aging elsewhere (from Captain Marvel to Gemini Man), but never this unobtrusively. Alongside the release of its first original animated feature, Sergio Pablos\u2019s Klaus, Netflix also picked up distribution rights for I Lost My Body, which made history when it took the top prize in the Critics\u2019 Week section at Cannes in May. More family-friendly releases \u2013 Frozen II, Toy Story 4 and a weirdly photorealist rehash of The Lion King \u2013 may have dominated the box office in 2019, but I Lost My Body was my favourite animated film of the year. Other Cannes firsts included Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite (which opens here in February) becoming the first Korean film to win the Palme d\u2019Or; while French-Senegalese film-maker Mati Diop was the first black female film-maker to direct a Palme d\u2019Or contender with the Grand Prix winner Atlantics. The Cannes best actor award went to Antonio Banderas for his career-best turn in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s semi-autobiographical Pain and Glory. A range of high-quality films from around the world graced UK cinemas in 2019. From Colombia we had Birds of Passage, an arresting tale of gangsters and spirits from the creators of Embrace of the Serpent. Writer-director Nadine Labaki earned an Oscar nomination with Capernaum, about a young boy\u2019s struggles in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Icelandic actor Halld\u00f3ra Geirhar\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir excelled in Woman at War, a jet-black eco-warrior comedy featuring onscreen musical accompaniment with drums, accordion and sousaphone. This year also saw a plethora of brilliant film scores. Standouts included Clint Mansell\u2019s ethereal Out of Blue soundtrack; Anna Meredith\u2019s mesmerising electronica accompaniment to Bo Burnham\u2019s Eighth Grade; Alex Weston\u2019s unexpectedly quirky music for The Farewell; and Mica Levi\u2019s otherworldly score for Monos. My favourite score was by Icelandic composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, who lent real depth to one of 2019\u2019s most successful and controversial releases, Joker. Great scores weren\u2019t confined to drama: Nainita Desai provided excellent understated accompaniment to For Sama, an astonishing documentary about life under siege in Aleppo, filmed by Syrian citizen-journalist Waad al-Kateab. Matt Morton\u2019s music took audiences into space in Apollo 11, a documentary released on the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing. More down to earth (although no less ecstatic) was Amazing Grace, the long-delayed film of Aretha Franklin\u2019s two-night performance at the New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Los Angeles in 1972. This year also proved to be remarkable for talent grown closer to home. In April, Irish actor and singer Jessie Buckley shone in Tom Harper\u2019s Wild Rose, about a single mother living in Glasgow but dreaming of country music stardom in Nashville. In May, Dexter Fletcher\u2019s Rocketman channelled the spirit of Ken Russell as it turned Elton John\u2019s life into a rip-roaring pop fantasia. June saw the release of Dirty God, boasting a star-making turn from feature first-timer Vicky Knight. And in July, Only You was an extraordinary feature debut from writer-director Harry Wootliff. As summer turned to autumn, Joanna Hogg gave us The Souvenir, in which Honor Swinton Byrne and Tom Burke excelled in a close-to-life story of a relationship built upon deceit. From writer-director Shola Amoo came another autobiographically inspired work, The Last Tree, about a British-Nigerian boy being uprooted from an idyllic rural childhood to face life on the mean streets of London. My favourite film of 2019 was Bait, the breakthrough feature from Cornish film-maker Mark Jenkin. An authentic portrait of tensions between locals and tourists in a once-thriving fishing village, it was shot with clockwork cameras on grainy 16mm stock, which Jenkin hand-processed in his studio in Newlyn. I hope Bait gets the recognition it deserves at the Baftas, alongside films like Ordinary Love, in which Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson play a couple facing her diagnosis of breast cancer. As for the Oscars, it would be good to see nominations for Rian Johnson\u2019s whodunnit Knives Out, Jordan Peele\u2019s chiller Us, and Greta Gerwig\u2019s literary adaptation Little Women, all of which injected new life into die-hard cinematic genres. The top 10 films of 2019 1. Bait Mark Jenkin\u2019s masterpiece is one of the defining British films of the decade. 2. Monos An extraordinary fable of child soldiery from Colombian-Ecuadorian film-maker Alejandro Landes. 3. Ordinary Love Co-directors Glenn Leyburn and Lisa Barros D\u2019Sa work wonders with Owen McCafferty\u2019s superb sceenwriting debut. 4. Rocketman A full-blooded rock-musical fantasia with a standout turn by Taron Egerton. 5. Only You Josh O\u2019Connor and Laia Costa shine in this perfectly realised tale of love and longing. 6. If Beale Street Could Talk Regina King earned a best supporting actress Oscar for Barry Jenkins\u2019s gem, which opened here in February. 7. For Sama A searing portrait of life during wartime from Waad al-Kateab and Edward Watts. 8. Us Jordan Peele uncovers America\u2019s hidden underclass in this scissor-sharp chiller. 9. Out of Blue Carol Morley sets out to \u201crescue the characters from the pages\u201d of Martin Amis\u2019s source novel. 10. The Souvenir Joanna Hogg\u2019s most personal film to date, part two of which is due in 2020. Turkey Mektoub My Love: Canto Uno Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s leering arthouse indulgence should have been called Mektoub My Arse.",

We don\u2019t \u201cgo online\u201d by turning on a computer and dialing up through a modem; we live online 24/7, creating data as we move through our lives, accessible to everyone and everything. Our smartphones are not devices that sit in our pockets; they create new worlds with new rules about our availability, intimacies, appearance and privacy. Apple, Twitter and Google are not just technology services we use, but staples in our retirement portfolios, on whose continued success our financial futures depend.</p> <p>At this point, the digital environment is no more the result of a series of choices made by technology developers, as it is the underlying cause of those choices. What happened to us in the 2010s wasn\u2019t just that we were being surveilled, but that all that data was being used to customize everything we saw and did online. We were being shaped into who the data said we were. The net you see and the one I see are different. Your Google search results are different than mine, your news feeds are different and your picture of the world is different.</p> <p>As the decade began and social media took over society, many people tried to call attention to digital technology\u2019s more environmental effects. In <a href=\"https://www.orbooks.com/catalog/program/\">Programmed or Be Programmed</a>, I argued that we have to understand the platforms on which we\u2019re working and living, or we\u2019re more likely to be used by technology than to be the users controlling it. But those of us arguing for new media literacies may have been making our case a bit too literally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d06a98588e19027a7ee380074f9d95bf3b7e8f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d06a98588e19027a7ee380074f9d95bf3b7e8f2/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The digital environment is no more the result of a series of choices made by technology developers, as it is the underlying cause of those choices.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The digital environment is no more the result of a series of choices made by technology developers, as it is the underlying cause of those choices.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Howell/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The people and organizations responding to our plea launched the \u201clearn to code\u201d movement. Schools initiated Stem curriculums, and kids learned code in order to prepare themselves for jobs in the digital economy. It was as if the answer to a world where the most powerful entities speak in code was to learn code, ourselves, and then look for employment servicing the machines. If you can\u2019t beat them, join them.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the point. Or shouldn\u2019t have been. What we really needed this decade was to learn code as a liberal art \u2013 not so much as software engineers, but as human beings living in a new sort of environment. It\u2019s an environment that remembers and records everything we have done online, every data point we leave in our wake, in order to adapt itself to our individual predilections \u2013 all in order to generate whatever responses or behaviors the platforms want from us. The digital media environment uses what it knows about each of our pasts to direct each one of our futures.</p> <p>We can no longer come to agreement on what we\u2019re seeing, because we\u2019re looking at different pictures of the world. It\u2019s not just that we have different perspectives on the same events and stories; we\u2019re being shown fundamentally different realities, by algorithms looking to trigger our engagement by any means necessary. The more conflicting the ideas and imagery to which are exposed, the more likely we are to fight over whose is real and whose is fake. We are living in increasingly different and irreconcilable worlds. We have no chance of making sense together. The only thing we have in common is our mutual disorientation and alienation.</p> <p>We\u2019ve spent the last 10 years as participants in a feedback loop between surveillance technology, predictive algorithms, behavioral manipulation and human activity. And it has spun out of anyone\u2019s control.</p> <h2><strong> \u2018</strong>Russian bots, meme campaigns and Cambridge Analytica\u2019</h2> <p>This is a tough landscape for anyone to navigate coherently. We may be benefiting from the internet\u2019s ability to help us find others with whom we share rare diseases, hobbies, or beliefs, but this sorting and grouping is abstract and over great distances. We are not connecting with people in the real world, but gathered by our eyeballs in disembodied virtual spaces, without the benefit of any of our painstakingly evolved social mechanisms for moderation, rapport, or empathy.</p> <p>The digital media environment is a space that is configuring itself in real time based on how the algorithms think we will react. They are sorting us into caricatured, machine-language oversimplifications of ourselves. This is why we saw so much extremism emerge over the past decade. We are increasingly encouraged to identify ourselves by our algorithmically determined ideological profiles alone, and to accept a platform\u2019s arbitrary, profit-driven segmentation as a reflection of our deepest, tribal affiliations.</p> <p>Since 2016, we have summoned demons to embody and represent these artificially generated worldviews \u2013 Russian bots and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/political-memes-2016-election-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">meme campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Cambridge Analytica</a>. But though these may have amplified and accelerated the effect of the digital environment, that environment would have generated standing waves of cultural angst in primary colors no matter what.</p> <p>Then, all it takes is an ideologue or ideology to jump in and claim that standing wave as their own. Trump is not the originator of his demagoguery so much as the vessel. Ideologically speaking, he\u2019s less a tweeter than a <em>re</em>-tweeter. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/europe-brexit-britain-state-politics-fit-for-purpose\">Brexit is not a policy design</a> for an independent England so much as a projection of one group\u2019s collective angst. And these are not even the most monstrous of the phantoms we are generating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b799b2e851be70758ab8529d12e06ffc961d5b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b799b2e851be70758ab8529d12e06ffc961d5b2/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019ve surrendered to digital platforms that look at human individuality as noise to be corrected, rather than signal to be cherished.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve surrendered to digital platforms that look at human individuality as noise to be corrected, rather than signal to be cherished.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Howell/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incapable of recreating a consensus reality together through digital media, we are trying to conjure a television-style hallucination. Television was a global medium, broadcasting universally shared realities to a world of spectators. The Olympics, moon landings and the felling of the Berlin Wall were all globally broadcast, collective spectacles. We all occupied the same dream space, which is why globalism characterized that age.</p> <p>But now we are resurrecting obsolete visions of nationalism, false memories of a glorious past, and the anything-goes values of reality TV. We are promoting a spectator democracy on digital platforms, and, in the process, we are giving life to paranoid nightmares of doom and gloom, invasion and catastrophe, replacement and extinction. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/28/can-we-stop-robots-outsmarting-humanity-artificial-intelligence-singularity\">artificial intelligence</a> hasn\u2019t even arrived yet.</p> <h2>Reconnecting to reality</h2> <p>There is a way out, but it will mean abandoning our fear and contempt for those we have become convinced are our enemies. No one is in charge of this, and no amount of social science or monetary policy can correct for what is ultimately a spiritual deficit. We have surrendered to digital platforms that look at human individuality and variance as \u201cnoise\u201d to be corrected, rather than signal to be cherished. Our leading technologists increasingly see human beings as a problem, and technology as the solution \u2013 and they use our behavior on their platforms as evidence of our essentially flawed nature.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We must stop looking to our screens and their memes for a sense of connection to something greater than ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the digital media environment could be helping us reconnect to local reality and terra firma. This is one of its potential breaks from media environments of the past. In the digital environment, we have the opportunity to remember who we really are and how to take responsibility for our world. Here, we are not just passive consumers; we are active citizens and more. That\u2019s the real power of a distributed network: it is not centrally controlled, but locally generated.</p> <p>The digital environment is also built, quite literally, on memory. Everything a computer does happens in one form of RAM or another \u2013 just moving things from one section of its memory to another. The digital media environment functions like a big blockchain, recording and storing everything we say or do for later retrieval. It could be helping us retrieve real facts, track real metrics and recall something about the essence of who we were and how we related before we were untethered from ourselves and alienated from one another.</p> <p>The next decade will determine whether we human beings have what it takes to rise to the occasion of our own, imposed obsolescence. We must stop looking to our screens and their memes for a sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. We must stop building digital technologies that optimize us for atomization and impulsiveness, and create ones aimed at promoting sense-making and recall instead. We must seize the more truly digital, distributed opportunity to remember the values that we share, and reacquaint ourselves with the local worlds in which we actually live. For there, unlike the partitioned servers of cyberspace, we have a whole lot more in common with one another than we may suspect.</p> <p>Happy holidays.</p> <ul> <li><p>Douglas Rushkoff, a fellow of the Center for Digital Life, is the author of Team Human and the host of the Team Human podcast</p></li> </ul>",

The digital media environment is a space that is configuring itself in real time based on how the algorithms think we will react. They are sorting us into caricatured, machine-language oversimplifications of ourselves. This is why we saw so much extremism emerge over the past decade. We are increasingly encouraged to identify ourselves by our algorithmically determined ideological profiles alone, and to accept a platform\u2019s arbitrary, profit-driven segmentation as a reflection of our deepest, tribal affiliations. Since 2016, we have summoned demons to embody and represent these artificially generated worldviews \u2013 Russian bots and meme campaigns and Cambridge Analytica. But though these may have amplified and accelerated the effect of the digital environment, that environment would have generated standing waves of cultural angst in primary colors no matter what. Then, all it takes is an ideologue or ideology to jump in and claim that standing wave as their own. Trump is not the originator of his demagoguery so much as the vessel. Ideologically speaking, he\u2019s less a tweeter than a re-tweeter. Likewise, Brexit is not a policy design for an independent England so much as a projection of one group\u2019s collective angst. And these are not even the most monstrous of the phantoms we are generating. Incapable of recreating a consensus reality together through digital media, we are trying to conjure a television-style hallucination. Television was a global medium, broadcasting universally shared realities to a world of spectators. The Olympics, moon landings and the felling of the Berlin Wall were all globally broadcast, collective spectacles. We all occupied the same dream space, which is why globalism characterized that age. But now we are resurrecting obsolete visions of nationalism, false memories of a glorious past, and the anything-goes values of reality TV. We are promoting a spectator democracy on digital platforms, and, in the process, we are giving life to paranoid nightmares of doom and gloom, invasion and catastrophe, replacement and extinction. And artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t even arrived yet. Reconnecting to reality There is a way out, but it will mean abandoning our fear and contempt for those we have become convinced are our enemies. No one is in charge of this, and no amount of social science or monetary policy can correct for what is ultimately a spiritual deficit. We have surrendered to digital platforms that look at human individuality and variance as \u201cnoise\u201d to be corrected, rather than signal to be cherished. Our leading technologists increasingly see human beings as a problem, and technology as the solution \u2013 and they use our behavior on their platforms as evidence of our essentially flawed nature. But the digital media environment could be helping us reconnect to local reality and terra firma. This is one of its potential breaks from media environments of the past. In the digital environment, we have the opportunity to remember who we really are and how to take responsibility for our world. Here, we are not just passive consumers; we are active citizens and more. That\u2019s the real power of a distributed network: it is not centrally controlled, but locally generated. The digital environment is also built, quite literally, on memory. Everything a computer does happens in one form of RAM or another \u2013 just moving things from one section of its memory to another. The digital media environment functions like a big blockchain, recording and storing everything we say or do for later retrieval. It could be helping us retrieve real facts, track real metrics and recall something about the essence of who we were and how we related before we were untethered from ourselves and alienated from one another. The next decade will determine whether we human beings have what it takes to rise to the occasion of our own, imposed obsolescence. We must stop looking to our screens and their memes for a sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. We must stop building digital technologies that optimize us for atomization and impulsiveness, and create ones aimed at promoting sense-making and recall instead. We must seize the more truly digital, distributed opportunity to remember the values that we share, and reacquaint ourselves with the local worlds in which we actually live. For there, unlike the partitioned servers of cyberspace, we have a whole lot more in common with one another than we may suspect. Happy holidays.

This fits with Gaiman\u2019s talents \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant at surprises, delivered within an everyday setting \u2013 and <em>Chivalry</em> was done just as well as you might imagine. A story of the holy grail, Sir Galahad, his sword, the philosopher\u2019s stone\u2026 all worked around Mrs Whitaker, a stubborn older woman who bought the holy grail in a local secondhand shop. Glenda Jackson performed her part beautifully. Exquisite.</p> <p>McCall Smith\u2019s 15-minute stories, each set in a different part of the world, were read by Kelly Macdonald, Thierry Mabonga, Meera Syal, and Adam Courting. <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0001qvr/episodes/guide\" title=\"\">Christmas Compass</a> </strong>was the overarching title, and as you\u2019d expect from McCall Smith, each story was gentle and humane. They concerned family, emotional changes, all the little things of life. Someone reading you a story well is such a treat, isn\u2019t it? Plus, I could listen to Macdonald reading anything, even Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, and enjoy it. Over on Classic FM, at 5pm on Christmas Day, Derek Jacobi read, in a manfully actorly manner, the story of <strong><a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/occasions/christmas/derek-jacobi-narrates-the-nutcracker-tchaikovsky/\" title=\"\">The Nutcracker</a></strong>, accompanied by Tchaikovsky\u2019s ballet music.

No news allowed, plus only cheerful people are deemed suitable to broadcast on Christmas Day. So hello to Clare Balding and Count Arthur Strong on Radio 4, Amy Lam\u00e9 and Jessica Hynes on 6 Music, Anneka Rice, Paul O\u2019Grady, Matt Lucas and Liza Tarbuck on Radio 2. Radio 1 peppered its weeks with Radio 1 Anthems, hosted by presenters new to the station (a nice move); though Scott Mills, the man who never rests, did the Radio 1 breakfast on Christmas Day. Magic Radio has been playing Christmas music for weeks \u2013 as each of my festive taxi rides have attested \u2013 and continued with the same on the big day, though Ronan Keating and Harriet Scott moved to the lunchtime slot. A quick mention for Grace Dent, sitting in for Vanessa Feltz on the early breakfast show at Radio 2 all this week: Dent is sarky, funny and as camp as, well, Christmas. An ideal booking. Well-told stories take centre stage at Christmas. Radio 4 offered a selection of salty-sweet tales from writers such as Alexander McCall Smith and Neil Gaiman. In fact, Gaiman had two goes on Radio 4 on Christmas Day, first in the morning with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (music and readings); and second, in the afternoon, with his lovely story Chivalry, starring Glenda Jackson.

The false description of the attack stated that \u201ca whole gang of African guys, ranging from teenage to mid-20s, approximately 10-15 of them with weapons \u2013 iron bars and baseball bats \u2013 attacked him, knocked my sister out\u201d. Those comments have since been edited out of 3AW\u2019s online news story, but are still being shared on social media. The online copy does not state that earlier reports were inaccurate, and a correction was not issued from 3AW\u2019s official Twitter account. On Sunday the unedited audio from 3AW was still embedded in a story about the alleged assault on The Age\u2019s website. Nyuon questioned why the race of the attackers was no longer being stated in the story, now it had been determined that they were not African. It\u2019s not the first time media have been accused of whipping up racial tensions in Melbourne. In January, Channel Nine\u2019s A Current Affair was criticised for a segment headlined \u201cThe \u2018race war\u2019 brewing on Melbourne\u2019s streets\u201d. That segment featured a masked, anonymous man described as a \u201cVietnamese teenager\u201d calling on people to \u201churt any African youths\u201d, but did not name any Vietnamese Australians or Sudanese Australians who were willing to be identified. After the alleged attack in Mooroolbark, a 50-year-old woman was also taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Up to eight people may have been involved in the fight, AAP reported. An 18-year-old man from Mooroolbark was arrested at the scene but released. Police are continuing to investigate the attack.",

      "bodyText": "Victorian authorities have told thousands of visitors and residents in East Gippsland \u2013 an area half the size of Belgium \u2013 to leave immediately as a bushfire threat looms. The emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, issued the order on Sunday ahead of what the Bureau of Meteorology has called one of the \u201csignificant fire weather days in Victoria\u2019s history\u201d. The final two days of the Falls Festival in Lorne, south-west of Melbourne, were cancelled on Sunday morning in anticipation of the extreme fire risk. The Otways in south-west Victoria, where the festival is held, and the alpine region including east Gippsland, are forecast to experience extreme heat and damaging winds, and thunderstorms are expected to bring dry lightning and new bushfires on Monday night. There were three active fires in east Gippsland on Sunday with a combined area of more than 130,000ha. An evacuation warning has been issued for the east Gippsland town of Goonergah, which is surrounded by high-value old growth forests. East Gippsland is popular with campers and holidaymakers over the New Year period. Up to 30,000 people are on holiday at Lakes Entrance, 300km east of Melbourne. The main road in and out, the Princes Highway, was likely to be affected by fires on Monday, Crisp said. The Great Alpine Road, the other road out of East Gippsland, is already closed due to bushfires. \u201cWhat we are saying now, based on the conditions that will be confronting us tomorrow across the state, but in particular in east Gippsland, is that if you\u2019re holidaying in that part of the state, it\u2019s time that you left,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to give people time to leave east Gippsland now. So if you\u2019re camping, if you\u2019re in a holiday home, it is time \u2026 to leave this afternoon.\u201d Emergency Victoria outlined a potential impact zone beginning just east of Bairnsdale and extending south along the coast to Cann River and then north to the NSW border. North of Bairnsdale, the impact zone stretches up to Omeo and then cuts back to the Deddick Valley. The total affected area is about 15,000 square kilometres. People who live in east Gippsland have been advised to stay with family or friends in Bairnsdale or other larger towns, and to leave no later than Monday morning. Crisp said Parks Victoria was considering closing national parks in the region and warned that camping in a national park was \u201cthe last place you should be\u201d. \u201cWe are giving you fair warning: you should not be in the parks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might think you know where the fires are. There could be fires that start and they could be close to you. You might not find a way out of where you are at the moment.\u201d Crisp said 550 state forest firefighters and 300 Country Fire Authority volunteers were standing by as well as 70 helicopters and water-bombing aircraft, but \u201cthere isn\u2019t enough trucks to go around\u201d. \u201cSo don\u2019t count on a fire truck protecting your particular house,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to get out of there.\u201d Crisp advised people to register with the Red Cross\u2019s unification service as they left to help emergency services trying to locate missing people and to reassure their families. The fire danger is forecast to be extreme in seven of the nine districts of Victoria, and severe in the remaining two, which includes east Gippsland. Kevin Parkin, a senior meteorologist with the bureau, said Monday was \u201clikely to be one of the significant fire weather days in Victoria\u2019s history\u201d. Parkin said temperatures were forecast to top 40C across most of the state, including Melbourne and parts of East Gippsland, but the dangerous fire conditions were due to a wind change that would reach the south-west coast between 1pm and 2pm, and would reach the Gippsland fire grounds near midnight on Monday. \u201cThe wind change is very problematic when it comes to fires and the landscape because it lights up the whole flanks of fires quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious life-threatening situation. Make no mistake about it.\u201d South Australia also faces a potentially catastrophic day on Monday in three districts, including the Adelaide Hills, where a large blaze continues to smoulder. Authorities fear a possible repeat of the devastating blaze 10 days ago that burnt through 25,000 hectares and destroyed more than 80 homes, with high temperatures and strong winds forecast. Country Fire Service chief officer Mark Jones said it was regrettable that the same conditions had returned so soon. \u201cParticularly when firefighters have been labouring for five days already before Christmas and for five days since Christmas in the field addressing the fire and tackling hotspots to black them out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential for hot-spot breakouts tomorrow is incredible across the whole fire zone.\u201d Catastrophic conditions will stretch across the Adelaide Hills, through the mid-north and across to Yorke Peninsula. Other areas of the state will have either extreme or severe warnings in place, prompting the CFS to call in extra firefighting aircraft from Victoria. The worst of the conditions will occur on Monday morning, which Jones said was unusual and meant people considering leaving should be ready to make the call early. Temperatures are forecast to reach 40C in Adelaide ahead of a cool change just after midday. That change that will bring the worst of the conditions, with wind speeds to rise to about 40km/h. Jones said Monday\u2019s forecast winds most likely risked fire breakouts along the southern flank in the Adelaide Hills fire zone, but shifting conditions meant that the whole fire perimeter could be at risk at different times. In New South Wales the worst fire danger will come on Tuesday when the wind change will move up the coast. The entire coastal stretch of NSW up to the greater Sydney region, then moving inland to the greater Hunter, will experience extreme fire danger on Tuesday. \u201cWe need everyone to ensure they have got their plans, and a plan isn\u2019t just about being at home,\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. \u201cA plan is about when you\u2019re travelling. Whether you\u2019re out visiting loved ones, or out taking a break somewhere, spending time with family.

      "bodyText": "Falls Festival in Lorne has been cancelled and Sydney faces increased pressure to cancel its New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks as a heatwave brings a return to extreme bushfire risk conditions. In a statement on Sunday morning, the organisers of the long-running New Year\u2019s Eve festival at Lorne, 142km west of Melbourne, said conditions were too dangerous to go ahead. The festival began on Saturday and was slated to run until New Year\u2019s Eve. Some 9,000 attendees are already camping on site. Temperatures in Lorne are forecast to reach 40C on Monday. The festival is held on private land surrounded by bushland and ringed by the Great Otway national park. Congestion from festival goers trying to leave on a single dirt track means it takes hours for the campground to clear at the end of a normal festival. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart we have had to cancel the remaining days of the Falls Festival in Lorne due to the predicted extreme weather conditions forecast for Monday December 30th in the Otways and surrounding region, creating a risk to health and safety due to potential fires, smoke, severe winds and tree hazards,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe decision has not been made lightly. Our patron and staff safety is our priority.\u201d Organisers said the weather forecast had become \u201csignificantly worse in the past 12 hours\u201d. That information was not available before campers began arriving for the event on Saturday, they said. \u201cAfter consultation with local and regional fire authorities and other emergency stakeholders, it is clear that we have no other option,\u201d they said. \u201cWhile conditions are fine at time of writing, we are taking the opportunity to move everyone offsite safely and in good time. \u201cFor those 9,000 currently staying onsite we ask you calmly pack up your campsite and return to your place of origin. There is no need to rush. Please ensure you have a sober driver.\u201d Gates to the Lorne festival will close at 9am Monday. Three-day festivals in Marion Bay in Tasmania, Byron Bay in New South Wales, and Fremantle in WA, will go ahead. Tickets for the Lorne festival will be refunded. The fire danger for all Victoria, except for the north-east and east Gippsland, which are not as severely in drought, is extreme on Monday. The rating for the north-east and east Gippsland is severe. In New South Wales the worst fire danger coincides with New Year\u2019s Eve, with severe to extreme conditions in eight regions, from the greater Hunter and greater Sydney regions to the far south coast. Response to the announcement on the festival\u2019s Facebook page has been split between anger from revellers who say the organisers should have decided to hold it in a different location \u2013 as happened in 2015 when a bushfire threatened the Lorne venue \u2013 and praise from people who do not appear to be attending the festival, for putting safety first. Some social media users wondered whether the future of the event was in doubt. Triple J presenter Bridget Hustwaite also pointed to the \u201cvulnerable location\u201d of the festival and criticised festival-goers who attacked the organisers\u2019 decision. Some commentators said the Marion Bay festival should also be cancelled. The fire danger for the upper Derwent valley and south-east of Tasmania, which includes Marion Bay, are listed to be extreme on Monday. Hobart is forecast to reach 40C \u2013 a rarity in a state where summer temperatures rarely top 30C \u2013 and Marion Bay is forecast to reach 38C. More than 260,000 people have signed a petition seeking to cancel New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks in Sydney, but the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday they would go ahead unless the fire service advised otherwise. Berejiklian said the fireworks sent a message to NSW to stay strong during the bushfire season. \u201cNSW has always been a state hopeful about the future, resilient and optimistic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to stay strong so we can keep supporting our communities that are doing it tough. And Sydney is one of the first cities in the world welcoming in the new year. \u201cIf it is safe to do so, we should continue to do it as we have done every other year.\u201d Numerous smaller fireworks displays around the state have been cancelled for New Year\u2019s Eve, including in Canberra. The ACT government announced on Sunday afternoon that two planned shows would not go ahead because the territory would be under a total fire ban. The NSW fire commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said the final decision on Sydney would be made after the forecast for New Year\u2019s Eve was issued on Tuesday morning. Fitzsimmons said he could not remember a time when the risk of fireworks on the harbour could not be accommodated, but if he felt the risk was too high he would not allow them to go ahead, even if it meant a significant financial loss for the state. The lord mayor, Clover Moore, has not moved from her position set out two weeks ago that the fireworks were planned 15 months in advance and could not be canned. She said the display generated $130m for the NSW economy. Sydney is forecast to reach 35C on New Year\u2019s Eve, with 44C forecast for Penrith in western Sydney. The City of Sydney celebrations are expected to attract a million people to the harbour foreshore.",

The prime minister announced overnight that eligible volunteers would receive $300 a day, up to $6,000 in total, if called out for more than 10 days this fire season. The payments apply only to volunteers with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, earlier criticised the federal government for restricting the payment to volunteers from NSW, saying it needed \u201ca national approach\u201d. But Morrison said he expected that other states and territories would also request help with volunteer compensation and would be offered access to the same scheme. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re making this decision now is because it was beginning to impact on the RFS\u2019s efforts to fight fires,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2026 about paying volunteers. That\u2019s a different issue. What this is about is resourcing a firefighting effort, to ensure that the commissioner is in the best place possible to be able to do those call-outs.\u201d Morrison said he expected the scheme would cost $50m but that it was uncapped. \u201cIt could end up costing less than that, it could end up costing more than that,\u201d he said. The first $10m will be made available to NSW next month. The payments will be backdated to 1 July and applied retrospectively to firefighters who have already worked more than 10 volunteer days. Morrison said he had already spoken to the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, about making them available in her state. The payments were announced days after the Coalition frontbencher Darren Chester, whose electorate of Gippsland is under threat from out-of-control bushfires, broke ranks and joined Labor in calling for payment for volunteers. Morrison and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian said on Sunday the payments were compensation for loss of income, to ensure that volunteers did not \u201cgo backward\u201d as a result of volunteering their time. Those who have access to emergency leave from their employer \u2013 such as public servants \u2013 are not eligible. Morrison said the focus was on self-employed people and those working for small and medium-sized employers. He said the maximum $6,000 payment equated to about 20 days emergency leave. Responding to questions about how long it had taken to set up the payments, Morrison said it was \u201cvery important in any disaster situation that you don\u2019t run the government by Twitter, you don\u2019t set up programs by Facebook\u201d. The NSW fire commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said the payments would \u201cprovide comfort\u201d to volunteers by offering \u201ca security net to ensure that volunteers are not disadvantaged or going through loss of income\u201d. Fitzsimmons said he would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if any RFS volunteer had been fighting fires for 150 days, saying crews were rotated on and off. Volunteers from South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania have travelled to the Blue Mountains and north coast of NSW to assist local firefighters. As of Sunday there were 85 fires burning in NSW, 40 of which remained uncontrolled. The 15,000-hectare Grose Valley fire, which split off from the 500,000-hectare Gospers Mountain megafire, was declared contained on Sunday. A watch and act warning was issued for an out of control bushfire in East Gippsland, 13km west of Goongerah, at 10am on Sunday, downgraded from an emergency warning. The 33,000-hectare fire is threatening Bonang, Cabanandra, Deddick Valley, Dellicknora, Tubbut and Amboyne. An evacuation warning for Goongerah was issued on Saturday night. There are three fires burning out of control in Gippsland, covering an area of about 130,000 hectares. The Gippsland fires are being managed by Forest Fire Management Victoria, which is not a volunteer service. But Emergency Victoria said that in recent days an extra 300 Country Fire Authority volunteers and 65 trucks had been called up around the state. In Western Australia, a watch and act warning was issued for a bushfire burning in the Stirling Range national park, south-east of Perth, just before 6am on Sunday. It was downgraded from an emergency warning issued on Saturday night. The blaze has already burnt through more than 10,000 hectares of scrub after being started by a lightning strike on Boxing Day. About 20 Parks and Wildlife Service firefighters were working to strengthen containment lines. Two fires \u2014 the Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills and one on the northern side of Kangaroo Island \u2014 remain at advice level in South Australia. Those fires began in catastrophic fire conditions on 20 December and burned through 47,000 hectares, killing one person and destroying 86 homes.",
