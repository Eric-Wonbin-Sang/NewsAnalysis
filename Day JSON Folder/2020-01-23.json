Everett claimed Chekhov wrote it as a comedy and played his buffoonish Vanya for laughs. What does Conor McPherson bring to this new adaptation? A different kind of laughter, it turns out: deeper, more poignant and perfectly weighted.</p> <p>Ian Rickson\u2019s exquisite production is full of energy despite the play\u2019s prevailing ennui. It does not radically reinvent or revolutionise Chekov\u2019s 19th-century story. It returns us to the great, mournful spirit of Chekhov\u2019s tale about unrequited love, ageing and disappointment in middle-age, while giving it a sleeker, modern beat.</p> <p>McPherson\u2019s script has a stripped, vivid simplicity which quickens the pace of the drama, and despite its contemporary language \u2013 Vanya swears and uses such terms as \u201cwanging on\u201d \u2013 it does not grate or take away from the melancholic poetry.</p> <p>Rae Smith\u2019s set is a thing of beauty which raises the theme of environmental damage visually rather than having the modern-day resonances spelled out more crudely in the script. This sitting room contains all the faded grandeur of the household.

      "bodyText": "Last year, David Hare teamed up with Rupert Everett to stage an Uncle Vanya that drew much humour from out of the gloom. Everett claimed Chekhov wrote it as a comedy and played his buffoonish Vanya for laughs. What does Conor McPherson bring to this new adaptation? A different kind of laughter, it turns out: deeper, more poignant and perfectly weighted. Ian Rickson\u2019s exquisite production is full of energy despite the play\u2019s prevailing ennui. It does not radically reinvent or revolutionise Chekov\u2019s 19th-century story. It returns us to the great, mournful spirit of Chekhov\u2019s tale about unrequited love, ageing and disappointment in middle-age, while giving it a sleeker, modern beat. McPherson\u2019s script has a stripped, vivid simplicity which quickens the pace of the drama, and despite its contemporary language \u2013 Vanya swears and uses such terms as \u201cwanging on\u201d \u2013 it does not grate or take away from the melancholic poetry. Rae Smith\u2019s set is a thing of beauty which raises the theme of environmental damage visually rather than having the modern-day resonances spelled out more crudely in the script. This sitting room contains all the faded grandeur of the household. Garden foliage climbs into the room through the open door and windows, as if nature were reaching into this manmade space, serving as a subtle visual backdrop to the climate message. Richard Armitage, as Dr Astrov, speaks of his love of nature and the dangers of deforestation, but he does so with an ardour that is metabolised fully into character. Toby Jones\u2019s Vanya is a vaguely dissolute type in sunglasses whose shirt is always untucked. He is variously ridiculous, self-pitying, and made to look a fool by his unrequited passion for Professor Serebryakov\u2019s young wife, Yelena (Rosalind Eleazar). But Jones brings a tortured truth to the role that renders him eminently likeable, even in these moments, and he never fails to move us. His rages against the pomposity of the professor and his academic achievements have a tone that suggest he secretly hates his own failure. \u201cI could have been another Schopenhauer, a Dostoevsky,\u201d he says, and it is both funny in its echoes of Brando\u2019s \u201cI coulda been a contender\u201d and a middle-aged moment of reckoning filled with nostalgia and pathos. Armitage plays Astrov as a romantic idealist while Eleazar emanates the indolent boredom of Yelena, but shows what lies beneath in a sudden, volcanic eruption of passion with Astrov.

      "bodyText": "The risk of civil collapse from nuclear weapons and the climate crisis is at a record high, according to US scientists and former officials, calling the current environment \u201cprofoundly unstable\u201d. They said the rise of \u201ccyber-enabled disinformation campaigns\u201d compounds both threats by keeping the public from insisting on progress. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced its symbolic \u201cdoomsday clock\u201d has moved forward to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest to catastrophe that the scientists have judged the world to be at any point since its creation in 1947, at the outset of the cold war. \u201cThe world needs to wake up. Our planet faces two simultaneous existential threats,\u201d said Mary Robinson, chair of an independent group of global leaders called The Elders, and the former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner of human rights. Robinson said that countries that don\u2019t aim to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet and instead exploit fossil fuels are issuing \u201ca death sentence for humanity\u201d. She said while public pressure presents a \u201csliver of hope\u201d for the climate, there is no such pressure on leaders to avert nuclear threats. As long as nuclear weapons are available it is inevitable they will one day be used, \u201cby accident, miscalculation or design\u201d, she said. Robert Rosner, chair of the Bulletin\u2019s science and security board, said society has normalized a very dangerous world, and that \u201cinformation warfare\u201d is undermining \u201cthe public\u2019s ability to sort out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s patently false\u201d. Sharon Squassoni, a board member and research professor at George Washington University, noted the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, which has resulted in Iran reducing compliance. And she said although some thought Donald Trump\u2019s unique approach might bring North Korea to the negotiating table, no real progress has ensued. The warning comes as nuclear arms control is in danger of dying out altogether. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty lapsed in August after the US accused Russia of cheating and Donald Trump declared he would leave the 1987 treaty altogether. The US has begun testing medium-range missiles similar to the new Russian weapon, although it is unclear where in Europe or Asia they would be based. The death of the INF leaves the New Start treaty as the last remaining limit on the US and Russian deployed strategic arsenals. It was agreed in 2010 by the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and Barack Obama, and it expires in February 2021. It can be extended for five years and Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to agree an extension, but the Trump administration has insisted that China be included. China, whose arsenal is a 20th of the two nuclear superpowers and not as aggressively deployed, has ruled out joining in. The farthest the doomsday clock has ever been from midnight was 17 minutes at the end of the cold war. While nuclear warfare remains a threat, the climate crisis continues to intensify, as the US federal government under Trump has withdrawn from international climate efforts. Last year was the second hottest on record for the Earth\u2019s surface. The 2019 average temperature was 1.1C warmer than the average between 1850 and 1900, before the ramp-up of fossil fuel use. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are on track to push that warming to 3 or 4C. The disruptions are intensifying extreme weather and expected to exacerbate poverty and global unrest. \u201cIf the Earth warms by what we tend to think of as just a few degrees and human life pushes the planet into the opposite of an Ice Age \u2026 or even pushes the climate halfway there, we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization,\u201d said Sivan Kartha, a board member, senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute and author of the fifth and sixth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Robert Latiff, a board member and retired air force major general, said the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdisdain for expert opinion\u201d threatens action on climate change and a host of other science-based issues. New technologies and developments \u2013 from \u201cdeep fake\u201d videos, to dangerous pathogens and artificial intelligence, all could threaten a fragile global peace.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for all your many emails, tweets, contributions and your excellent humour \u2013 sorry I didn\u2019t get to all of it. And thanks for reading! We\u2019ve seen Liverpool do exactly what champions do; they are a machine, and a mighty fine one at that. Catch you again soon \u2013 take care! Klopp speaks! \u201cIt was a big [test], the toughest you could get for today but for different reasons. Wolves with Nuno are doing really well but they are pretty different to all the other teams. They use the width of the pitch with Coady\u2019s long balls and when Traore gets the ball he\u2019s pretty much unplayable. [The goal] was a counterattack which makes not too much sense when you\u2019re one goal up, another five or 10 minutes it was Wolves but then the game calmed down a bit. \u201cThe chances we had were incredible. We were four or five times in front of the goalie. We won the game, incredibly difficult, but who cares? We didn\u2019t panic but it is not that we were completely in the mood I wanted at 1-1. \u201cIt\u2019s over when it\u2019s over. Not before. So why should we really think about that? If I hear the message \u2018you can lose six games\u2019 [and win title] I could vomit to be honest.\u201d \u201cJust to point out, Liverpool are now guaranteed safe from relegation,\u201d writes David Grey. They\u2019ll be partying on the streets on Merseyside! Nuno speaks: \u201cVery good performance. I think we performed well, defensively well organised, created a lot of chances and the momentum was there. We were facing a very good team but I was very happy with the boys. Small margins, details. \u201c[Traore] is unique, he has things nobody else has and he is trying to improve because I still think he has a lot of space to grow.\u201d You won\u2019t want to miss Paul Doyle\u2019s match report of *that*: Jordan Henderson: \u201cWe had some chances to put the game to bed which is something we want to improve on and kill the game earlier. But we showed the mentality to keep going. \u201cIt\u2019s just about the next game, keep going, every game is the biggest game of the season as the manager keeps saying to us.\u201d Virgil van Dijk: \u201cYou need to give them credit, they played good, they have good players. They\u2019re difficult to break down, created moments of danger and we had to dig deep. We\u2019re not happy about the goal we conceded but how we reacted is a good thing and we know we\u2019re always going to have chances. Liverpool go SIXTEEN points clear with a game in hand. But that\u2019s not half the story! They were pushed harder than they have been all season here \u2013 but they found a way through with Firmino\u2019s fine later winner! 90+4 min: One last bite for Wolves but a Doherty throw is cleared. And then ... 90+2 min: Sky give man of the match to Traore and would anyone disagree? He has been immense. The best team in the world has found him virtually impossible to deal with. Now he goes on another run as we speak ... and oh, my!! His cross is yet again right on point and nudged back by Jimenez for Jota .. who screws over from in front of goal! Both managers go berserk for very different reasons. 90+1 min: Four added minutes for Wolves to turn this again ... 90 min: Do Wolves have one more push in them? This must be so deflating now. Liverpool are playing the ball around in their half and, not before time, now seem to be well in control. 87 min: Moutinho is replaced by Gibbs-White. My word, how well Wolves have played here. But Liverpool are incredible. Un. Be. Lievable. Liverpool are going to win the league at an absolute canter and this is exactly why. They always come up with something and this time Firmino gets it right after Salah, with some beautiful control and footwork, lays off to Henderson. The skipper promptly plays Firmino in just like that and, after cutting inside, he blasts it high into the net! Nothing can stop this team. 82 min: And now Liverpool get their big chance! Firmino dances beautifully past Coady and probably scores if he lifts the ball over Patricio. Instead he goes low and it\u2019s a vital save. That would have been against the run of virtually this entire half. 81 min: Jota is presented with the ball by \u2013 gasp! \u2013 a sloppy Van Dijk header. If he sees Traore sprinting beyond Wijnaldum to his right, Traore is clean through! He looks the other way and makes the wrong choice! 80 min: Gomez and Jota engage in a 50/50 grapple that ends, I think, in a booking for Gomez. More importantly Moutinho can deliver another dangerous free-kick ... from which Alisson is crowded out and fouled. 77 min: A game like this is good for Liverpool, no? They\u2019ve been properly extended; in a right royal tussle; not necessarily the better side. In fact definitely not the better side. That\u2019s football, right? Wolves roll the dice with Jota making his return, replacing the watchable Neto. 74 min: Traore goes part of the way past Van Dijk but then seems to lose confidence, weirdly, even though with one more step he\u2019d be virtually clear. He shoots too early, from 22 yards, and drags it wide. 73 min: Coady stops Firminho latching onto a Robertson ball at the near post. Have Liverpool sorted this out now? The evidence is not that compelling given the unconvincing way in which, right down the other end, they panickily crowd a Neto run out as he makes for the area. 70 min: But there\u2019s a reminder that Salah is still here, and thus so are Liverpool. He slaloms across the 18-yard line and shoots just wide of the near post. Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s dynamism is thereafter sacrificed for Fabinho\u2019s diligence. 68 min: Alisson bails out Liverpool again after the unplayable Traore slips through the almost unplayable Jimenez, who is onside but at enough of a tight angle to make the chance tricky. The keeper spreads himself and saves. Liverpool are in trouble and Klopp is prowling that technical area like there\u2019s no tomorrow. 66 min: Now a Neves ball arcs across the six-yard line and I have not seen Liverpool given this much trouble all season \u2013 seriously. 65 min: What a save from Alisson! Traore has room again and is thwarted by a low one-handed stop as he looks to rake one into the bottom corner! 64 min: Neto has looked trickily useful at times without quite getting away down that left flank. He does pretty well again but then Wolves are forced back. They sensibly build again from the back; they are controlling this game just now. 62 min: Peter Oh requests a managerial change \u2013 \u201cWith all due respect to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, it\u2019s time Liverpool went Nigel Pearson on these pesky Wolves.\u201d Klopp OUT! Pearson IN! 60 min: Minamino does get a shooting chance after good work from Salah but his weighted shot from the edge of the box is blocked \u2013 and Firmino blasts the rebound at Patricio. 59 min: Minus Mane, Liverpool just don\u2019t have one of their most potent attacking outlets and are finding it hard to get back up the pitch. They need to get a foothold again here. They always find a way ... don\u2019t they? 57 min: Moutinho\u2019s free-kick is punched away by Alisson. Wolves are all over this! 56 min: And Traore is away again ... and Robertson is booked for scything him down *just* outside the area ... 55 min: Traore rips down that right flank again and Liverpool just aren\u2019t handling him. They haven\u2019t met an opponent like this all season. Jimenez can\u2019t quite master his latest cross in a deep position. 54 min: They chant Traore\u2019s name from the stands, and what a delivery that was. Liverpool are on the rack now! It\u2019s game on! They deserve that!! It\u2019s a brilliant, trademark, powerful header from the striker, and what a one-two! It\u2019s Jimenez who marauds into the Liverpool half and feeds Traore into space before continuing his run into the box. Traore delivers expertly and directs his finish wonderfully into the corner on the run! How do Liverpool respond now? 50 min: Rattling early tempo here, again, and Wolves have come out full of intent. 48 min: Then Neto is sent away by a lucky ricochet, but lacks conviction and Gomez blocks! That, too, was a chance and Wolves may regret not taking it. 47 min: Traore messes around just outside his own area and is *very* lucky that Salah, picking his pocket, can\u2019t beat Patricio with an arrowed left-footer. It\u2019s batted around the left post and the corner is defender desperately after Henderson \u2013 again \u2013 wins the header. Wolves kick us off! I reckon he\u2019s got that for life now. It is a very, very fair point. Salah weaves clear and takes aim, but is thwarted by a brave sliding block from Doherty. Could yet be a crucial moment. And that, there, is the half! That early Henderson header/shoulderer is the difference in a half that has otherwise been pretty even. It started at one heck of a pace and Doherty really should have equalised for Wolves. From the midway point it became a little more nip and tuck but Wolves are well in this, still. For Liverpool there is the worry of Mane\u2019s early departure. 43 min: Jimenez thinks he\u2019s got a clear crack at goal after fine work by Saiss but Van Dijk, giant among men that he is, tracks him all the way and blocks. But Wolves keep the ball alive and do win a left-sided corner ... which is well defended by the otherwise quiet Firmino. 42 min: \u201cDid you know your name is an anagram of \u201cMan\u00e9 sick\u201d?\u201d asks Peter Oh of me, your unassuming MBM-er. \u201cOh dear me, please don\u2019t let it be a bad injury.\u201d Hands up, I\u2019ve always known this day would come. 40 min: Whisper it, but Liverpool have not really created a lot since scoring. 38 min: Nice control from Jimenez, who takes possession on the left of the area, takes a couple of touches inside, and then drags wide of Alisson\u2019s near post. 36 min: Minamino has started brightly, his exploits including one implausible spin on halfway that may or may not have been the result of a miscontrol. Big call! From Krish and from Wilson. 33 min: Yep, it\u2019s the end of Mane. On comes Minamino. I\u2019m sure we will find out what the issue was there soon enough. Mane made his own \u201csubstitute me\u201d sign; hopefully it is more precautionary than anything. 32 min: Neto twists into left-sided space but Gomez heads his cross away. It looks as if Mane is injured and may have to come off ... he\u2019s gone down ... 30 min: The game has definitely tightened up a bit, but Wolves have done really well not to let that early goal get to them and at this point it\u2019s still hard to pick a winner. OK, it\u2019s probably going to be Liverpool. But still, there are two very good sides out here. 28 min: I guess this is, at last, what we in the MBM trade might call \u201ca lull\u201d. 26 min: Neves gets up gingerly, he should be OK. \u201cHow could he miss?\u201d laments Mary Waltz of Doherty. \u201cTeams playing Liverpool know they might only get one or two chances to score. This adds to the pressure. He would have scored against any other team.\u201d 24 min: A snappy midfield spell now, with challenges won and balls turned over by both sides. Neves goes down under one of the former, a fair one from Mane I think, and will need treatment ... 21 min: Dendoncker makes a vital challenge to stop Mane running through onto an Oxlade-Chamberlain ball. Cracking game this, so far. 20 min: Traore bounces four of five Liverpool players off him in midfield and works space; it\u2019s a quite awesome display of strength and soloism. Then he goes and spoils it all with a wayward pass! Errr ... wow. 18 min: Liverpool break, though, and Salah works a good shooting chance inside the box only for Jonny to block heroically. 17 min: Now Traore beats Robertson on the other side and, from his centre, Van Dijk has to chaperone Jimenez carefully away from goal. 16 min: Apart from the goal (I know, I know) Wolves will be very happy with this start. 14 min: More jitters from Liverpool as another free-kick is aimed at Doherty, who can\u2019t win a header this time but watches as the ball loops up and Alisson jumps to claim under a challenge. He totally misses it first time around and is lucky to grab it after it bounces. 13 min: That miss gets worse and worse every time you see it. Doherty had the entire box to himself! A sign, though, that Liverpool\u2019s back line might not be in full working order tonight? 11 min: Traore, on the left, goes outside Alexander-Arnold and now wins Wolves a corner. Encouraging sign for him, winning that particular one-on-one. The corner is played short, chipped over from deep ... and what a miss from Doherty! Liverpool push up for offside but, on the far side of the box, Doherty has timed his run perfectly. The away defence has got it wrong and he\u2019s all alone, but heads across goal and wide! 9 min: We had a totally unnecessary VAR check for that, delaying the restart and the full celebration. Why? Because football has been taken over by appalling pedants, spoilt brats and questionable agendas. Nobody\u2019s stopping them, are they? Alexander-Arnold whips over the corner he won, bending it the the edge of the six-yard box via that almost 90-degree run-up. Henderson charges onto it and, probably with his shoulder as it turns out, converts! 7 min: An end-to-end start, and Liverpool now win a free-kick in excellent shooting range just outside the box and to the right of the D. It is taking a *long* time to set up but here\u2019s Alexander-Arnold ... whose effort clips the wall, Saiss I think, and goes out for a corner. 5 min: ... And it causes no little consternation! Moutinho whips a devilish low ball across and it evades everyone inside the six-yard box before being smuggled away. That was begging to be converted! 4 min: Michael Oliver waves play on after Gomez seems to foul Traore, and Neto can\u2019t take advantage of the ... err ... advantage, undercooking a centre from the left. But now Wolves do win themselves a free-kick just outside that left edge ... 2 min: Liverpool control the ball early on, Alexander-Arnold starting an attack with a switch to Robertson. Ultimately, though, a long pass sails over the byline. This one ought to be good! The teams are walking out on a fizzing, crackling, see-your-breath night at Molineux. I have a feeling ... just a feeling ... Wolves are going to give Liverpool a proper examination tonight. We could be in for something here. Even if that something is not, in any eventuality, a title race. \u201cThere\u2019s always one huge question to be asked when Wolves play. Not formation or strategy per se but is Robert Plant in the building?\u201d asks Jason Graff. Excellent question. I certainly saw he was at one of their games pre-Christmas. Gary Byrne ponders: \u201cWill Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo seek to be a Portuguese man o\u2019 war tonight, or turn to jelly against the might of Liverpool?\u201d That is much closer to the level I\u2019m at tonight. Evan writes on the ol\u2019 Twitter: \u201cAs a Reds supporter who has never seen Liverpool win the league since I\u2019ve been alive, I\u2019m hoping this will really do it. I don\u2019t see them dropping points to many other teams this season. I also do really enjoy these late games, great viewing time in the US, the game goes great for lunchtime viewing.\u201d Hope you enjoy it! 8pm is definitely better than the new-fangled 8.15pm for most of us over here so everyone seems to be a winner. Graeme Thorn has a correction with a caveat: \u201cRather than mixing Latin with Portugese, D. Cameron should have written: \u2018Em nome do Pai, do Filho e do Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019, though I had to trust Google Translate for that.\u201d It\u2019s been too long a day for this. Willy Boly, who has been out since October, and Diogo Jota (just the three weeks out) are back on the bench for Wolves tonight. They\u2019re amassing some decent depth. Good to see those two on the scene again, they\u2019d usually be nailed-on starters for Nuno. \u201cThoughts and prayers with Wolves tonight: \u2018In nomine Patris et Filii et Nuno Espirito Santo (Amen)\u2018\u201d, intones D Cameron. Any more invocations, musings, jokes, score predictions, tell-alls ... send them my way! Not going too well for Liverpool\u2019s old chums, and most recent opponents, Manchester United. John Brewin\u2019s excellent piece hits on a particularly hot topic: Wolves: Rui Patricio, Dendoncker, Coady, Saiss, Doherty, Joao Moutinho, Neves, Jonny, Pedro Neto, Jimenez, Traore. Subs: Boly, Gibbs-White, Jota, Ruddy, Giles, Kilman, Ashley-Seal. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade Chamberlain, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Fabinho, Adrian, Minamino, Origi, Matip, Jones, Williams. Referee: Michael Oliver Is this the night? Could it be? Are we going to be asking this question every five or six days until May? Probably not; probably not; probably. But you\u2019d sense this might be one of Liverpool\u2019s closer calls on their inexorable march to Premier League domination and that Wolves, flagging a touch but still outstanding when at full tilt, have it in them to give them an almighty run for their money. And, hell with it, even knock off their \u201cinvincible\u201d crown! Liverpool edged past Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s team at Anfield a mere four weeks ago thanks to Sadio Mane\u2019s goal. They\u2019d take an identical outcome tonight; it\u2019d be a huge hurdle cleared and I would say that, of their remaining fixtures, Man City (a) on 4 April is the only tougher gig than this. A win for Wolves would put them three points off the Champions League spots; a draw would still lift them to fifth. Make no mistake, this is a heavyweight clash and we\u2019ll have it especially for *you* at 8pm UK time.",

Reports suggested the proposal would allow Israel to retain large parts of the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jewish settlements, and all of contested Jerusalem. The Palestinians would be granted statehood, but under tight conditions and restrictions.<br><br>The timing of the reported release was widely seen as a boost for Trump\u2019s close ally, Netanyahu, who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">battling three corruption charges</a> and faces a fierce battle as he fights for re-election in a 2 March poll.

So I gladly accept your invitation, his invitation, to come to Washington and discuss with him his ideas on how to advance peace and to work closely with him to advance that goal.\u201d<br><br>He said he had asked that Gantz also be invited, as the plan would need \u201cas broad a consensus as possible\u201d.<br><br>The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, immediately rejected the US move.</p> <p>\u201cThis step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the US administration has done so far, particularly the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d Abbas\u2019s spokesman said in a statement.</p> <p>The Palestinian leadership has pre-emptively rejected any blueprint for a deal from the Trump administration, citing a series of pro-Israeli moves made by Washington.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has invited Israel\u2019s prime minister and leader of the opposition to Washington for talks on the \u201cprospects of peace\u201d, signalling that the White House was preparing to share details of its long-awaited \u201cultimate deal\u201d for Israelis and Palestinians. Mike Pence, the US vice-president who is visiting Jerusalem for a Holocaust remembrance forum, said after a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu that he had asked the leader to fly to Washington next week. \u201cPresident Trump asked me to extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the White House next week to discuss regional issues as well as the prospect of peace here in the Holy Land,\u201d he said. Opposition leader Benny Gantz would also visit, he added, although it was not clear if at the same time. No Palestinian representatives appeared to have been invited. Trump later tweeted: \u201cReports about details and timing of our closely-held peace plan are purely speculative.\u201d But Israeli media, citing unnamed officials, reported that details of the much-delayed plan could be released as soon as this week \u2013 and that they would be extremely favourable to Israel. Reports suggested the proposal would allow Israel to retain large parts of the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jewish settlements, and all of contested Jerusalem. The Palestinians would be granted statehood, but under tight conditions and restrictions. The timing of the reported release was widely seen as a boost for Trump\u2019s close ally, Netanyahu, who is battling three corruption charges and faces a fierce battle as he fights for re-election in a 2 March poll. Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader has failed to form a government after two inconclusive elections but sought to play up his acumen with Trump and other world leaders to prove to Israelis that he can score big diplomatic wins. Speaking at the US embassy in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said the country \u201chad no better friend than President Trump\u201d. \u201cWith this invitation, I think that the president is seeking to give Israel the peace and security that it deserves. So I gladly accept your invitation, his invitation, to come to Washington and discuss with him his ideas on how to advance peace and to work closely with him to advance that goal.\u201d He said he had asked that Gantz also be invited, as the plan would need \u201cas broad a consensus as possible\u201d. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, immediately rejected the US move. \u201cThis step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the US administration has done so far, particularly the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d Abbas\u2019s spokesman said in a statement. The Palestinian leadership has pre-emptively rejected any blueprint for a deal from the Trump administration, citing a series of pro-Israeli moves made by Washington. Since he came to power, Trump has moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, shuttered the US consulate dealing with Palestinians and cut hundreds of millions in aid to the Palestinians. Expectations are exceedingly low, even by the standards of Middle East peace plans, that the proposal will lead to an agreement. Trump first billed it as the \u201cultimate deal\u201d but the process has been dogged by delays and false starts. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner is leading the project but has failed to gather much diplomatic support, while a lack of clarity around who will be Israel\u2019s next prime minister \u2013 and the person to negotiate with \u2013 has also stalled the process. In June, Kushner held an economic conference in Bahrain, which the Palestinians said was a cheap bribe to bring them to the table. Husam Zomlot, former head of the Palestinian mission in the US, told AFP that the invitations to two Israeli leaders and no Palestinians showed the meeting was about influencing domestic Israeli politics, rather than a genuine attempt at peace. \u201cThis is confirmation of their policy from the beginning \u2013 it is all about and for Israel,\u201d Zomlot said.",

One UCLA study that followed families over a period of 18 years <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9681119\">found no negative effects</a> among adolescents who observed their parents naked regularly when they were between the ages three to six. Another study asked college students about their childhood experiences of parental nudity and found \u201cmodest support that these childhood experiences are positively related to indices of adjustment\u201d.</p> <p>One of the main benefits to seeing a parent naked is that a child gets to see what a normal, naked adult body looks like. \u201cThe bodies they will see in the media and porn are not typical, women just don\u2019t look like that,\u201d explains Amy Lang, a child sexual health educator.</p> <p>By contrast, seeing women with stretch marks, pubic hair and lumpy parts gives children more realistic expectations. To see women\u2019s naked bodies in a desexualized way can also help children to understand that women are more than just objects, and that their bodies are not inherently shameful.</p> <p>\u201cKids are super curious. If they want to see what boobs look like, they will Google it. It\u2019s better that they have resources to learn about the body which are safe,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Some fear exposing a child to nudity will ruin them in some way, or at least embarrass them \u2013 but these concerns are unfounded. \u201cAll the evidence we see is to the contrary,\u201d says Lang. Because family nudity gives children an opportunity to talk about boundaries, bodies and safety, children who see their parents\u2019 naked bodies are actually safer from sexual abuse, she says.</p> <p>It also means that they have a better model for talking about sex in a healthy way. If your first experience seeing a naked body results in the conversation shutting down, a child may think they can\u2019t talk to their parents about their body, or that there is something wrong with it, says Lang.</p> <p>Of course, strict guidelines need to be set. \u201cYou might say that when their friends are over, they at the very least need to have their underpants on,\u201d explains Lang. Parents need to accept other families will have different rules that need to be respected, too.</p> <p>There also needs to be a proper discussion about rules. That means talking about when it\u2019s OK to see someone naked, or telling your children not to touch each other\u2019s private parts. You must be consistent with these rules, as kids sometimes need reminding. But in the end, it can even provide a good base for future discussions about consent. \u201cKids are always just grabbing \u2013 at boobs, at penises \u2013 especially at bathtime. This is a really good opportunity to plant the seeds around understanding respectful consent later in life, because they are learning someone else\u2019s body is not theirs,\u201d says Lang.</p> <p>Ultimately, Lang says parents need to be comfortable \u2013 don\u2019t start getting naked around your kids if you hate it. Equally, if you feel it\u2019s normal, worthwhile or practical to let your kids see you naked, do it \u2013 but make sure you\u2019re comfortable explaining that: \u201cPeople might freak out. Parents need to be ready to explain it,\u201d she says.</p>",

Outside of the inherent misogyny in this case (the complainants\u2019 partner had his top off, too), aren\u2019t non-sexualized adult bodies a pretty good thing for children to see? Adults have a habit of sexualizing the human body; it\u2019s largely why breastfeeding in public remains taboo, despite the fact that it is a practical, non-sexual function of the breast. What little research there is on the topic suggests fears around the harms of parental nudity are exaggerated. One UCLA study that followed families over a period of 18 years found no negative effects among adolescents who observed their parents naked regularly when they were between the ages three to six. Another study asked college students about their childhood experiences of parental nudity and found \u201cmodest support that these childhood experiences are positively related to indices of adjustment\u201d. One of the main benefits to seeing a parent naked is that a child gets to see what a normal, naked adult body looks like. \u201cThe bodies they will see in the media and porn are not typical, women just don\u2019t look like that,\u201d explains Amy Lang, a child sexual health educator. By contrast, seeing women with stretch marks, pubic hair and lumpy parts gives children more realistic expectations. To see women\u2019s naked bodies in a desexualized way can also help children to understand that women are more than just objects, and that their bodies are not inherently shameful. \u201cKids are super curious. If they want to see what boobs look like, they will Google it. It\u2019s better that they have resources to learn about the body which are safe,\u201d she says. Some fear exposing a child to nudity will ruin them in some way, or at least embarrass them \u2013 but these concerns are unfounded. \u201cAll the evidence we see is to the contrary,\u201d says Lang. Because family nudity gives children an opportunity to talk about boundaries, bodies and safety, children who see their parents\u2019 naked bodies are actually safer from sexual abuse, she says. It also means that they have a better model for talking about sex in a healthy way. If your first experience seeing a naked body results in the conversation shutting down, a child may think they can\u2019t talk to their parents about their body, or that there is something wrong with it, says Lang. Of course, strict guidelines need to be set. \u201cYou might say that when their friends are over, they at the very least need to have their underpants on,\u201d explains Lang. Parents need to accept other families will have different rules that need to be respected, too. There also needs to be a proper discussion about rules. That means talking about when it\u2019s OK to see someone naked, or telling your children not to touch each other\u2019s private parts. You must be consistent with these rules, as kids sometimes need reminding. But in the end, it can even provide a good base for future discussions about consent. \u201cKids are always just grabbing \u2013 at boobs, at penises \u2013 especially at bathtime. This is a really good opportunity to plant the seeds around understanding respectful consent later in life, because they are learning someone else\u2019s body is not theirs,\u201d says Lang. Ultimately, Lang says parents need to be comfortable \u2013 don\u2019t start getting naked around your kids if you hate it. Equally, if you feel it\u2019s normal, worthwhile or practical to let your kids see you naked, do it \u2013 but make sure you\u2019re comfortable explaining that: \u201cPeople might freak out. Parents need to be ready to explain it,\u201d she says.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 24 January. Top stories The scandal-ridden $100m community sport infrastructure program is facing further scrutiny, after a rugby union club in a marginal Coalition-held seat received $500,000 for new female change rooms, despite not fielding a women\u2019s team since 2018. Concerned former members of the club have expressed anger at the lucrative grant despite an alleged culture of mistreatment and misogyny that prompted the entire female team to quit. Then sports minister Bridget McKenzie faces an internal investigation, with the prime minister vowing on Thursday to take \u201cwhatever action was necessary\u201d once his department had assessed the concerns. The Chinese government has cancelled several major public events and put five cities on lockdown, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Transport links from Wuhan were cancelled, with movie theatres and other entertainment venues forced to shut down, with similar restrictions in place for nearby Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang. The World Health Organisation has said it\u2019s too early to declare an emergency, with isolated cases reported in neighbouring Asian nations as well as in the US and Northern Ireland. There have been 17 reported fatalities so far in China, from 575 documented cases. The Australian Red Cross has been criticised for spending up to 10% of bushfire donations on administration, costs it has claimed are \u201cessential\u201d, despite previously committing 100% of monies raised towards causes. Liberal MP for Bega, Andrew Constance, had questioned delays in distributing $115m in donations the organisation has received since July. The Red Cross\u2019 director, Noel Clement, told Guardian Australia donations had been directed to a standing fund for all-year-round support, and that the NGO will strive to keep administrative costs as low as possible. Australia Revenue authorities in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and US have launched coordinated raids against a multinational financial institution, the first overt \u201cday of action\u201d by a joint tax-enforcement body set up in 2018 to fight tax crime and money laundering. Three US firefighters have been killed battling bushfires in southern New South Wales, after their waterbombing plane crashed on Thursday afternoon. There has been no indication, as yet, as to what caused the accident. Biosecurity officials in Sydney have met passengers from one of the last flights out of epidemic-hit Wuhan, clearing those on board of illness, but warning the possibility of \u201cpeople incubating the virus\u201d had to be considered in coming weeks. Prime minister Scott Morrison has paid tribute to his father, John, who died, aged 84. \u201cDad lived a life of love, faith, duty and service,\u201d said Morrison via a Facebook post, honouring his service as a police officer, loving husband and church elder. The world Dozens of world leaders have travelled to Jerusalem to remember the Holocaust, with French president Emmanuel Macron warning the \u201cdark shadow of antisemitism is being reborn\u201d as Tel Aviv-based researchers suggested racially motivated attacks on Jews had increased in 2018. Dignitaries attending included Vladimir Putin, US vice president Mike Pence and Prince Charles. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill has officially become law, having cleared the various houses of parliament and received royal assent from the Queen. \u201cAt times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we\u2019ve done it,\u201d Johnson said. The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, providing European parliament approves the deal. US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has belittled Greta Thunberg, dismissing the Swedish school student\u2019s call for immediate fossil fuel divestment, joking to journalists at Davos that he didn\u2019t know who she was and that she shouldn\u2019t be listened to until she\u2019s got a college decree in economics. The Church of England has declared that sex belongs only within heterosexual marriage, calling on Christians in gay or straight civil partnerships to remain sexually abstinent.

The leaked report also revealed that Wray had put \u00a31.3m towards companies owned by Itoje, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Chris Ashton, in a way that constituted a breach of the Premiership\u2019s \u00a37m salary cap rules. The players\u2019 names were redacted when Premiership Rugby published the report. However Damian Hapley, head of the Rugby Players\u2019 Association, said the leak had still caused \u201cuntold damage to all parties concerned\u201d. \u201cHaving been given absolute assurances that all confidential player information would be redacted, we were stunned that the entire report was leaked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have taken up this breach of confidence with PRL as a matter of urgency and will continue to offer our support to all the players involved.\u201d In a statement Premier Rugby stressed that no blame was attached to players for the breaches committed by Saracens before also expressing its anger at the leak, calling it \u201cunauthorised and reckless\u201d. The biggest revelation in the report is that the Premiership\u2019s salary cap manager, Andrew Rogers, submitted evidence that Wray and two Saracens directors had paid Itoje \u00a31.6m for a 30% share of his image rights. However a separate valuation undertaken for Premier Rugby Limited said Saracens had overpaid by \u00a3800,000, an amount that was therefore considered to be salary. The report quotes Rogers telling the disciplinary panel: \u201cIt seems to be that the investors either must or ought to have known they were overpaying and that they overpaid anyway because the player at the club was being underpaid.\u201d The panel declined to rule on the claim, saying \u201cit is not necessary to do so\u201d when judging whether Saracens had breached the salary cap, for which the club was docked 35 points and fined \u00a35.3m. In response to the report\u2019s publication, Wray issued a lengthy statement in which he apologised for \u201cthe heartache I have caused due to my ill-considered approach to matters relating to salary cap compliance. My intention with co-investments was always to support players beyond their playing careers.\u201d The statement broke down in great detail Saracens\u2019 view of the assessments made in the report with Wray adding: \u201cI recognise the actions of the club were described by the panel as \u2018reckless\u2019 primarily due to my failure to consult with PRL\u2019s salary cap manager prior to entering into any agreements and then disclosing the transactions to him. I take full responsibility for this. We should have been far better.\u201d A Premiership Rugby spokesman said other clubs came to them \u201cpretty much every day\u201d to ask questions about the salary cap and that Saracens had ample opportunity to do the same. \u201cClubs came to me on a daily basis,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s all about disclosure.\u201d",

With concern growing about the spread of the virus, universities in the UK are keeping a check on staff who have recently returned from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, as well as Chinese students who come from affected areas, many of whom will be concerned about loved ones at home. China has become an increasingly important partner in UK higher education in recent years, with 120,000 Chinese students enrolled in UK universities last year and numerous partnerships and collaborations between universities in the UK and China. Nine UK institutions have partnerships with Wuhan University in Hubei Province in central China, among them Dundee University which runs an architecture course in collaboration with Wuhan. In an email to students, the university urged anyone who had travelled to affected areas and was suffering symptoms to contact their GP by phone, avoid crowded places and alert the people they live with. Dr Jim McGeorge, university secretary and chief operating officer at Dundee, also warned students to take care if receiving packages from areas where the virus is present, especially if a package contains food items. Experts believe the virus has come from animals, possibly seafood. In the case of the Dundee-Wuhan university partnership, Chinese students complete their first four years of study in Wuhan, and come to Dundee for their fifth and final year, often choosing to remain in the Scottish city to complete their master\u2019s degree.

Aberdeen also has a partnership with Wuhan University. \u201cThe university is aware of five members of staff who have visited Wuhan during the outbreak, four of whom returned to the university three or more weeks ago,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe remaining member of staff has a non-teaching role and is working from home as a precautionary measure.\u201d Newcastle University hosts around 300 students who have links with Hubei province. \u201cWe are writing to them all to remind them to follow the health protection advice and to offer support to any student concerned about themselves or loved ones,\u201d a spokesperson said. The university has also arranged a special health advice event for students arriving from China in the last month, to ensure they register with a doctor. \u201cIn line with Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice, the university is advising that staff and students don\u2019t travel to this area,\u201d a spokesperson said. Since the cap was lifted on the number of students able to study at UK universities in 2015, the sector has worked hard to increase recruitment from China. According to the most recent data, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of Chinese students studying in UK higher education institutions exceeded 120,000 for the first time last year, a 13% increase on the previous year and up from fewer than 90,000 in 2014/15. Liverpool University has one of the biggest Chinese student populations. It too has issued guidance to any student currently in or planning to travel to China in the immediate future. A statement on the university website said: \u201cWe would advise our students to avoid travelling to Wuhan if possible and follow basic hygiene rules including regular hand washing; maintain good personal hygiene; avoid visiting animal and bird markets, avoid people who are ill with respiratory symptoms [and] seek medical attention if you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China, or on return to the UK.\u201d Birmingham University also confirmed that students from a range of partner universities in Wuhan City are currently studying in the city. A spokesperson said those students would have travelled to the university months ago and the risk of infection was low.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

Fourteen people were tested for the virus, with five confirmed negative and nine still awaiting results, Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday night.

In searing testimony, Sciorra described the events leading up to the alleged attack and its impact on her life in which she said she fell into depression, took to cutting herself and sought solace in drinking.</p> <p>Several times during her account, Sciorra\u2019s voice broke and she dabbed her eyes with tissue.</p> <p>Sciorra is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/06/harvey-weinstein-trial-rose-mcgowan-rosanna-arquette\">the first of six women</a> who will testify about being allegedly sexually attacked by the movie producer. Weinstein, 67, who at one time was a titan of Hollywood with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/10/13/oscar-hero-to-zero-how-harvey-weinsteins-power-enabled-him-and-led-to-his-decline/#1027602a3062\">81 Oscars</a> for his films, faces five counts including two of rape, one of forcibly performing oral sex on a woman and two of predatory sexual assault that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p> <p>Sciorra\u2019s forceful testimony began when she was asked by a prosecutor whether she saw Weinstein in the courtroom. She stood and pointed at him: \u201cYes I do. He\u2019s wearing a black suit and a white shirt and black tie.\u201d</p> <p>She then went on to recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/28/annabella-sciorra-alleges-rape-harvey-weinstein\">how she had met the defendant</a> in the early 1990s at a private party in Los Angeles. He gave her his card and invited her to contact him if she came across any interesting film scripts.</p> <p>She did contact him a few months later on behalf of a friend who had a script that became the film The Night We Never Met, and though she was not particularly interested in the film she agreed to star in it under pressure from Weinstein.</p> <p>When she complained to him she was tired and needed a break before filming, he sent her a care package containing some movies, liquorice, popcorn and a bottle of Valium. The witness said she began taking valium day and night, and only weaned herself from the drug a few years later.</p> <p>The alleged attack occurred in the winter of 1993 to 1994, when Sciorra was living in an apartment in the Manhattan neighbourhood of Gramercy Park. She had been at a dinner with Weinstein and others, including the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/uma-thurman\">Uma Thurman</a>.</p> <p>She decided to go home at about 10pm and Weinstein offered her a ride. He dropped her off at the apartment and she went upstairs and got ready for bed, putting on a white cotton nightgown that was a family heirloom from Italy.</p> <p>There was a knock on the door. Sciorra at this point in her testimony paused for several seconds, and was handed a box of tissues. She continued: \u201cThe defendant was there and pushed the door open. I didn\u2019t understand why he was there.\u201d</p> <p>She told the jury that he then began walking around the apartment \u2013 she presumed to check it was empty \u2013 but began unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cI realized that if he was taking off his shirt that in his head he wanted to have sex, and I did not want to. I started to back up as I thought I could make it to the bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>She said: \u201cI felt very overpowered as he was very big.\u201d The court has heard that Weinstein was about 300lb (135kg) around 1993, while she said she was 5ft 4in and weighed 110 to 115lb (50-52kg).</p> <p>\u201cThen he grabbed me. He led me into the bedroom and he shoved me on the bed. I was punching him, I was kicking him, I was trying to take him away from me. He took my hands and put my hands over my head.\u201d</p> <p>That is when she did the re-enactment with her arms upheld. \u201cHe raped me. I was trying to fight but I couldn\u2019t because he had my hands locked.\u201d</p> <p>Sciorra was openly crying as she told the jury what Weinstein allegedly said to her after he had ejaculated on the nightgown: \u201cI have perfect timing.\u201d</p> <p>Then she took a deep breath in the courtroom, wiped her eyes again and described how he had then forcibly performed oral sex on her. \u201cThis is for you,\u201d she alleged he said to her.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so disgusting that my body started to shake in a way that was very unusual. It was like a seizure.\u201d</p> <p>Sciorra told the court that she was very confused after the alleged rape, not knowing how to think of the incident or Weinstein. \u201cI thought he was a nice person. I felt confused. I wished I\u2019d never opened the door.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/06/harvey-weinstein-los-angeles-criminal-charges-metoo\">Harvey Weinstein hit with new charges in Los Angeles during New York trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the alleged rape she began cutting herself, using drops of blood from her fingers and hands to stain the walls of her apartment. \u201cWherever I would put the blood I would take pieces of gold leaf and mark it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sciorra said she did not articulate the event to herself initially as rape, nor go to the police, \u201cbecause he was someone I knew.

      "bodyText": "In a packed courtroom in the New York supreme court in Manhattan on Thursday, the former Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra held her arms above her head, wrists locked, in a physical re-enactment of the moment she alleged that the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein forcibly pinned her to her bed. \u201cHe took my hands and put them over my head to hold them back,\u201d the actor said, staring straight at the jury. Some 15ft away on the defense table, the defendant looked impassively at her. \u201cThen he got on top of me and he raped me.\u201d The dramatic moment marked the first time that the Weinstein sex crimes trial directly heard from one of his accusers. In searing testimony, Sciorra described the events leading up to the alleged attack and its impact on her life in which she said she fell into depression, took to cutting herself and sought solace in drinking. Several times during her account, Sciorra\u2019s voice broke and she dabbed her eyes with tissue. Sciorra is the first of six women who will testify about being allegedly sexually attacked by the movie producer. Weinstein, 67, who at one time was a titan of Hollywood with 81 Oscars for his films, faces five counts including two of rape, one of forcibly performing oral sex on a woman and two of predatory sexual assault that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. Sciorra\u2019s forceful testimony began when she was asked by a prosecutor whether she saw Weinstein in the courtroom. She stood and pointed at him: \u201cYes I do. He\u2019s wearing a black suit and a white shirt and black tie.\u201d She then went on to recall how she had met the defendant in the early 1990s at a private party in Los Angeles. He gave her his card and invited her to contact him if she came across any interesting film scripts. She did contact him a few months later on behalf of a friend who had a script that became the film The Night We Never Met, and though she was not particularly interested in the film she agreed to star in it under pressure from Weinstein. When she complained to him she was tired and needed a break before filming, he sent her a care package containing some movies, liquorice, popcorn and a bottle of Valium. The witness said she began taking valium day and night, and only weaned herself from the drug a few years later. The alleged attack occurred in the winter of 1993 to 1994, when Sciorra was living in an apartment in the Manhattan neighbourhood of Gramercy Park. She had been at a dinner with Weinstein and others, including the actor Uma Thurman. She decided to go home at about 10pm and Weinstein offered her a ride. He dropped her off at the apartment and she went upstairs and got ready for bed, putting on a white cotton nightgown that was a family heirloom from Italy. There was a knock on the door. Sciorra at this point in her testimony paused for several seconds, and was handed a box of tissues. She continued: \u201cThe defendant was there and pushed the door open. I didn\u2019t understand why he was there.\u201d She told the jury that he then began walking around the apartment \u2013 she presumed to check it was empty \u2013 but began unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cI realized that if he was taking off his shirt that in his head he wanted to have sex, and I did not want to. I started to back up as I thought I could make it to the bathroom.\u201d She said: \u201cI felt very overpowered as he was very big.\u201d The court has heard that Weinstein was about 300lb (135kg) around 1993, while she said she was 5ft 4in and weighed 110 to 115lb (50-52kg). \u201cThen he grabbed me. He led me into the bedroom and he shoved me on the bed. I was punching him, I was kicking him, I was trying to take him away from me. He took my hands and put my hands over my head.\u201d That is when she did the re-enactment with her arms upheld. \u201cHe raped me. I was trying to fight but I couldn\u2019t because he had my hands locked.\u201d Sciorra was openly crying as she told the jury what Weinstein allegedly said to her after he had ejaculated on the nightgown: \u201cI have perfect timing.\u201d Then she took a deep breath in the courtroom, wiped her eyes again and described how he had then forcibly performed oral sex on her. \u201cThis is for you,\u201d she alleged he said to her. \u201cIt was so disgusting that my body started to shake in a way that was very unusual. It was like a seizure.\u201d Sciorra told the court that she was very confused after the alleged rape, not knowing how to think of the incident or Weinstein. \u201cI thought he was a nice person. I felt confused. I wished I\u2019d never opened the door.\u201d After the alleged rape she began cutting herself, using drops of blood from her fingers and hands to stain the walls of her apartment. \u201cWherever I would put the blood I would take pieces of gold leaf and mark it,\u201d she said. Sciorra said she did not articulate the event to herself initially as rape, nor go to the police, \u201cbecause he was someone I knew. I felt at the time that rape was something that happens in a back alleyway in a dark place by someone you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Sciorra is seen as a star witness for the prosecution. She is the only one of the six women testifying in the case who is a celebrity, having appeared in the hit TV series Sopranos and several movies including The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Jungle Fever. She is not formally attached to the rape and sexual assault charges against Weinstein because the alleged rape occurred well before New York\u2019s statute of limitations. But she is the key witness addressing the predatory sexual assault charges that allege that Weinstein engaged in a pattern of violent and abusive behavior over many years.

      "body": "<p>The longed-for report into Saracens\u2019 salary-cap misdemeanours is out. Premier Rugby Limited\u2019s release has redacted all mention of any individuals but a leak on Wednesday night had already made those names from the Lord Dyson judgment public. No blame is attached to any of the players involved in the ventures deemed to be breaches of the cap by the report across three season up to 2018-19 and which led to Saracens\u2019 \u00a35.4m fine and initial 35-point deduction.</p> <p>Here, the Guardian unpacks the details from the report of how the principal overspends were made, why the panel came to its conclusions, and then analyses the arguments for and against Saracens based on the evidence submitted.</p> <p>The judgment makes clear that the panel\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to whether the salary cap manager\u2019s findings were reasonable, not whether the panel would have arrived at the same themselves. To adopt Television Match Official parlance, they have been asked the second question: \u201cIs there any reason why the salary cap manager\u2019s decisions should not stand?\u201d In every case, the answer was no. </p> <h2><strong>Maro Itoje\u2019s image rights</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/23/premiership-rugby-is-from-mars-and-saracens-are-from-venus\">Premiership Rugby are from Mars and Saracens are from Venus | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> (Overspend \u00a3800,000 in salary cap year 2018-19)</strong></p> <p>On 2 November 2018, a consortium of Saracens directors, led by Nigel Wray, agreed to pay \u00a31.6m for a 30% share in Oghene Holdings Limited, Itoje\u2019s image rights company. Itoje\u2019s accountant suggested \u00a33m as the appropriate valuation.</p> <p>The investors sought a valuation from PwC and paid the \u00a31.6m accordingly. Andrew Rogers, the salary cap manager, sought a valuation from PRL\u2019s accountants, Saffery Champness, who returned a valuation of \u00a3800,000. The difference between the two amounts was thus accounted as salary for the year.</p> <p>The panel decided that Rogers\u2019s valuation was not unreasonable and would not overturn the finding. \u201cValuation is not a science,\u201d the report states. \u201cWe emphasise that we are not saying that we find that the market value of the shares was in fact \u00a3800,000. We are saying that it was reasonably open to Mr Rogers to come to that conclusion.\u201d</p> <p><strong>For Saracens:</strong> The sum of \u00a31.6m for a 30% share of Itoje\u2019s image rights (for the rest of his life) will prove to be a very good deal if he goes on to enjoy the career most expect for him. It is in no way an overpayment if that is so (but his playing career could also end at any time).</p> <p><strong>Against Saracens:</strong> Saracens did not register the transaction or clear it at the time and valuations are notoriously fluid. PRL submitted in its evidence details of Itoje\u2019s playing contract, which was signed in January 2019, just a couple of months later.

      "bodyText": "The longed-for report into Saracens\u2019 salary-cap misdemeanours is out. Premier Rugby Limited\u2019s release has redacted all mention of any individuals but a leak on Wednesday night had already made those names from the Lord Dyson judgment public. No blame is attached to any of the players involved in the ventures deemed to be breaches of the cap by the report across three season up to 2018-19 and which led to Saracens\u2019 \u00a35.4m fine and initial 35-point deduction. Here, the Guardian unpacks the details from the report of how the principal overspends were made, why the panel came to its conclusions, and then analyses the arguments for and against Saracens based on the evidence submitted. The judgment makes clear that the panel\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to whether the salary cap manager\u2019s findings were reasonable, not whether the panel would have arrived at the same themselves. To adopt Television Match Official parlance, they have been asked the second question: \u201cIs there any reason why the salary cap manager\u2019s decisions should not stand?\u201d In every case, the answer was no. Maro Itoje\u2019s image rights (Overspend \u00a3800,000 in salary cap year 2018-19) On 2 November 2018, a consortium of Saracens directors, led by Nigel Wray, agreed to pay \u00a31.6m for a 30% share in Oghene Holdings Limited, Itoje\u2019s image rights company. Itoje\u2019s accountant suggested \u00a33m as the appropriate valuation. The investors sought a valuation from PwC and paid the \u00a31.6m accordingly. Andrew Rogers, the salary cap manager, sought a valuation from PRL\u2019s accountants, Saffery Champness, who returned a valuation of \u00a3800,000. The difference between the two amounts was thus accounted as salary for the year. The panel decided that Rogers\u2019s valuation was not unreasonable and would not overturn the finding. \u201cValuation is not a science,\u201d the report states. \u201cWe emphasise that we are not saying that we find that the market value of the shares was in fact \u00a3800,000. We are saying that it was reasonably open to Mr Rogers to come to that conclusion.\u201d For Saracens: The sum of \u00a31.6m for a 30% share of Itoje\u2019s image rights (for the rest of his life) will prove to be a very good deal if he goes on to enjoy the career most expect for him. It is in no way an overpayment if that is so (but his playing career could also end at any time). Against Saracens: Saracens did not register the transaction or clear it at the time and valuations are notoriously fluid. PRL submitted in its evidence details of Itoje\u2019s playing contract, which was signed in January 2019, just a couple of months later. It argued Saracens knew they were overpaying for his image rights because they underpaid him through his salary. The panel decided not to rule on this point. However, multiple sources have suggested to the Guardian that his regular salary is notably low. Itoje\u2019s representatives have been approached for comment. Capital payments and expenditure (Overspend \u00a3924,000 and \u00a3363,000 across four ventures, 2016-17) The report lists payments of more than \u00a3900,000 that Wray made into joint venture companies (JVCs), one with the Vunipola brothers and one each with Richard Wigglesworth and Itoje. It deals with the details of the Vunipola transactions only. These amount to \u00a3450,000 in the purchase of two properties, in which neither player lived.

Wray paid for the rest in the shape of an interest-free loan to the JVC. The Vunipolas and Wray took shareholdings in each according to their investments. On sale, the Vunipola mortgage is discharged first, followed by Wray\u2019s capital investment and his subsequent investment in the properties\u2019 improvement. Any further proceeds are shared according to each investor\u2019s shareholding. As the Vunipolas\u2019 mortgage is repaid first, Wray takes on most of the risk of the venture. The panel found reasonable Rogers\u2019s contention that Wray\u2019s investments constituted open-ended loans, not repayable in the same salary cap year, and must thus be accounted salary. For Saracens: Wray\u2019s investment was into the JVC, for which he took an appropriate shareholding. At the most, only the interest the Vunipolas might have been expected to pay should count as salary, not the entirety of Wray\u2019s investment. Against Saracens: The Vunipolas would not find terms as agreeable under normal circumstances, benefiting from an interest-free loan and bearing virtually none of the risk of their venture. Thus they are benefiting from their association with Saracens and Wray. Thus, the entire investment should be treated as salary for the year in which it was made. Chris Ashton\u2019s loan (Overspend \u00a3320,000, 2017-18) In October 2015, Wray and Dominic Silvester bought a property with Ashton for \u00a31.3m plus incidentals.

She said of her TV distribution business: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me that people went and bought the box to watch satellite television because my father is the president. That\u2019s utterly rubbish.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Sonangol</strong></h2> \n<p>Dos Santos said that by 2015 it was widely known that Sonangol was close to bankruptcy, with $20bn of debt and a collapse in the price of oil. The government therefore established a commission to restructure the country\u2019s oil sector, which invited Dos Santos\u2019s company Wise Intelligence Solutions to manage the project.</p> \n<p>Dos Santos said that despite initially refusing several times, she subsequently accepted an invitation to chair Sonangol for the restructure.</p> \n<p>The oil company\u2019s board of directors then approved the transfer of Wise\u2019s contract to the Dubai company Ironsea Consulting, later renamed Matter Business Solutions, \u201ca consulting firm with capabilities and knowledge of the Angolan market\u201d. Dos Santos said neither she nor her husband owned Matter, and that she did not vote on that decision so as to avoid any conflict of interest.</p> \n<p>She said consultancy costs for the restructure project were $115m, adding that this was far lower than consultancy costs incurred by her predecessors. In response to questions about the series of invoices settled in the final days of her leadership, her lawyers said that by June 2017 a large unsettled consultancy bill had built up.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn order to settle the outstanding invoices, a number of payments began to occur between June and November 2017, with the final payment occurring by 15 November 2017,\u201d they said. \u201cInstruction for payment of $38m a few days prior to the board\u2019s dismissal related to invoices received, for services that had already been provided and delivered by consultants in accordance with contract.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>De Grisogono</strong></h2> \n<p>In an interview with Radio France Internationale, Dokolo described the Angolan government\u2019s attempt to seize his assets as \u201carmageddon\u201d. \u201cThey want to blame us for all the corruption and bankruptcy in Angola,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A letter from Dokolo\u2019s lawyers said accusations of nepotism and corruption against him \u201csimply parrot the politically motivated allegations from the current Angolan government\u201d. They said he had invested in De Grisogono in 2012 after three years of negotiation, in partnership with the Angolan state diamond company Sodiam.</p> \n<p>In response to claims Sodiam\u2019s investment was funded by a high-interest loan from a bank part-owned by Dos Santos, the lawyers said a rate of 9% was \u201cmarket-standard\u201d. They accepted that Dokolo had received a \u201cremuneration fee\u201d of $5m for helping to acquire and structure De Grisogono. They said both Dokolo and Sodiam had invested equal amounts of $115m in De Grisogono.</p> \n<p>The Angolan government has also accused Dokolo of benefiting from diamond sales at below market rates. Dokolo claims that in fact Sodiam was paid an above market rate of an additional 5% as goodwill in exchange for the diamonds.</p> \n<p>The lawyers added that De Grisogono\u2019s performance had in fact improved from 2012 to 2017 as part of \u201can extensive business turnaround process\u201d, and that events at the Cannes film festival were part of a marketing campaign approved by the company\u2019s board.</p> \n<p>Isabel dos Santos told BBC News she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono.</p> \n<h2><strong>Luanda </strong><strong>master</strong><strong>plan and Marginal da Corimba</strong></h2> \n<p>Dos Santos\u2019s lawyers say her company Urbinveste, working with a team of international contractors, helped design the Luanda masterplan for Angola\u2019s capital, which won an architectural award. They say her company consulted widely, with more than 40 meetings, presentations, public consultations and seminars.</p> \n<p>Urbinveste also envisioned the concept of the <strong> </strong>related Marginal da Corimba project, paying for its initial design stages, to ameliorate Luanda\u2019s traffic congestion.</p> \n<p>The lawyers said the project had \u201cminimal environmental and social impact, notably by there being no need of any expropriations, and no need to evict or relocate any residents or any communities\u201d by virtue of all the land being reclaimed from the sea.</p> \n<p>Her lawyers said \u201cthere were never any evictions related\u201d to the Marginal project, and said allegations of overcharging were \u201cfalse and unfounded\u201d. They stressed the Luanda development project her company was involved in was ultimately abrogated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/15/angolan-president-sacks-predecessors-daughter-as-state-oil-chief\">Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o</a>, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos\u2019s successor as president.</p> \n<h2>Galp</h2> \n<p>Lawyers for Dokolo deny allegations that a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp was acquired in a preferential deal with the Angolan state, and that a loan financing that stake is in default.</p> \n<p>They say that Dokolo and the Portuguese businessman Am\u00e9rico Amorim first sought to acquire a stake in Galp in 2005, and entered discussions about a possible joint investment with Sonangol.</p> \n<p>They say Dokolo\u2019s company Exem Energy BV committed to invest \u20ac75m, corresponding to the size of the 40% share of the stake in Galp held through a company called Esperaza.</p> \n<p>They said that in the summer of 2017 Sonangol asked Exem to repay its loan in the Angolan kwanza currency to help offset a liquidity crisis, and that Exem accordingly transferred the money in October 2017.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Isabel dos Santos issued the following statement on Thursday after being formally named as a suspect by the Angolan attorney general in connection with a criminal inquiry into embezzlement at the state oil company Sonangol. The allegations which have been made against me over the last few days are extremely misleading and untrue. We will seek to clarify our position in relation to the latest accusations. This is a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year. These claims are being placed at a time of economic instability in Angola. It is an attempt to neutralise me and to discredit the legacy of President dos Santos and his family. No one should be taken in by these diversionary tactics. Stolen documents have been leaked selectively to give a false impression of my business activities. I am a private businesswoman who has spent 20 years building successful companies from the ground up, creating over 20,000 jobs and generating huge tax revenue for Angola. Last year my businesses paid over $100m in tax. I have always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators. Sadly, the rule of law has been undermined in Angola where the courts are subject to political pressure. However, I am ready to fight through the international courts to defend my good name. I have engaged lawyers to take action against inaccurate and defamatory reports. We deny all the latest allegations being made by Angolan authorities. Previously, responding to the Luanda Leaks investigation, Isabel dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo, denied all allegations of wrongdoing. In an interview with BBC News and a letter from her lawyers, Dos Santos denied the suggestion that she owed her business success to nepotistic support from her father, a former president of Angola, and said corruption accusations were intended to smear her reputation. Angola\u2019s attorney general is investigating allegations of mismanagement during Dos Santos\u2019s time as head of the state oil company, Sonangol, and in December a civil court froze her assets, accusing her of having enriched herself at the expense of the state. Her lawyers said: \u201cIt is obvious that our client is the subject of a highly coordinated attack on both her reputation and business, an attack which originates from the Angolan authorities.\u201d She told the BBC her accusers in the Angolan government were pursuing her as part of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d intended to discredit her and her father, saying she was a private businesswoman who had developed her holdings over 20 years. Her businesses were commercially successful in their own right, she said, and did not require presidential backing. She said of her TV distribution business: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me that people went and bought the box to watch satellite television because my father is the president. That\u2019s utterly rubbish.\u201d Sonangol Dos Santos said that by 2015 it was widely known that Sonangol was close to bankruptcy, with $20bn of debt and a collapse in the price of oil. The government therefore established a commission to restructure the country\u2019s oil sector, which invited Dos Santos\u2019s company Wise Intelligence Solutions to manage the project. Dos Santos said that despite initially refusing several times, she subsequently accepted an invitation to chair Sonangol for the restructure. The oil company\u2019s board of directors then approved the transfer of Wise\u2019s contract to the Dubai company Ironsea Consulting, later renamed Matter Business Solutions, \u201ca consulting firm with capabilities and knowledge of the Angolan market\u201d. Dos Santos said neither she nor her husband owned Matter, and that she did not vote on that decision so as to avoid any conflict of interest. She said consultancy costs for the restructure project were $115m, adding that this was far lower than consultancy costs incurred by her predecessors. In response to questions about the series of invoices settled in the final days of her leadership, her lawyers said that by June 2017 a large unsettled consultancy bill had built up. \u201cIn order to settle the outstanding invoices, a number of payments began to occur between June and November 2017, with the final payment occurring by 15 November 2017,\u201d they said. \u201cInstruction for payment of $38m a few days prior to the board\u2019s dismissal related to invoices received, for services that had already been provided and delivered by consultants in accordance with contract.\u201d De Grisogono In an interview with Radio France Internationale, Dokolo described the Angolan government\u2019s attempt to seize his assets as \u201carmageddon\u201d. \u201cThey want to blame us for all the corruption and bankruptcy in Angola,\u201d he said. A letter from Dokolo\u2019s lawyers said accusations of nepotism and corruption against him \u201csimply parrot the politically motivated allegations from the current Angolan government\u201d. They said he had invested in De Grisogono in 2012 after three years of negotiation, in partnership with the Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. In response to claims Sodiam\u2019s investment was funded by a high-interest loan from a bank part-owned by Dos Santos, the lawyers said a rate of 9% was \u201cmarket-standard\u201d. They accepted that Dokolo had received a \u201cremuneration fee\u201d of $5m for helping to acquire and structure De Grisogono. They said both Dokolo and Sodiam had invested equal amounts of $115m in De Grisogono. The Angolan government has also accused Dokolo of benefiting from diamond sales at below market rates. Dokolo claims that in fact Sodiam was paid an above market rate of an additional 5% as goodwill in exchange for the diamonds. The lawyers added that De Grisogono\u2019s performance had in fact improved from 2012 to 2017 as part of \u201can extensive business turnaround process\u201d, and that events at the Cannes film festival were part of a marketing campaign approved by the company\u2019s board. Isabel dos Santos told BBC News she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. Luanda masterplan and Marginal da Corimba Dos Santos\u2019s lawyers say her company Urbinveste, working with a team of international contractors, helped design the Luanda masterplan for Angola\u2019s capital, which won an architectural award. They say her company consulted widely, with more than 40 meetings, presentations, public consultations and seminars. Urbinveste also envisioned the concept of the related Marginal da Corimba project, paying for its initial design stages, to ameliorate Luanda\u2019s traffic congestion. The lawyers said the project had \u201cminimal environmental and social impact, notably by there being no need of any expropriations, and no need to evict or relocate any residents or any communities\u201d by virtue of all the land being reclaimed from the sea. Her lawyers said \u201cthere were never any evictions related\u201d to the Marginal project, and said allegations of overcharging were \u201cfalse and unfounded\u201d. They stressed the Luanda development project her company was involved in was ultimately abrogated by Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos\u2019s successor as president. Galp Lawyers for Dokolo deny allegations that a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp was acquired in a preferential deal with the Angolan state, and that a loan financing that stake is in default. They say that Dokolo and the Portuguese businessman Am\u00e9rico Amorim first sought to acquire a stake in Galp in 2005, and entered discussions about a possible joint investment with Sonangol. They say Dokolo\u2019s company Exem Energy BV committed to invest \u20ac75m, corresponding to the size of the 40% share of the stake in Galp held through a company called Esperaza. They said that in the summer of 2017 Sonangol asked Exem to repay its loan in the Angolan kwanza currency to help offset a liquidity crisis, and that Exem accordingly transferred the money in October 2017.",

She said the EU would revive plans for a digital tax within a year if international efforts to find a solution failed.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is very important that we keep up the momentum. Because of this very fundamental injustice that most people and businesses pay their taxes and they are competing with businesses who create value but do not pay taxes,\u201d she said in an interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers.</p> <p>Although not mentioning the UK by name, Vestager backs all EU member states imposing digital taxes, based on the \u201cvery, very simple thing that most businesses pay their taxes\u201d.</p> <p>The transatlantic row over taxing digital companies, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, burst into the open at Davos this week, when the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/22/uk-to-press-ahead-with-digital-tax-despite-us-pressure-javid-insists\">chancellor, Sajid Javid, vowed to press ahead</a> with go-it-alone plans for a UK digital tax, despite threats from the US of punitive tariffs on British car exports.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a digital-tax champion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/france-poised-drop-plan-tax-tech-giants-amid-signs-us-deal\">agreed to postpone </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/france-poised-drop-plan-tax-tech-giants-amid-signs-us-deal\">tax plans for one year</a> in order to find a solution through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>. France was also under pressure from Trump, who threatened to slap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/us-threatens-tariffs-on-24bn-in-french-imports-in-retaliation-for-frances-tech-tax\">tariffs on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/us-threatens-tariffs-on-24bn-in-french-imports-in-retaliation-for-frances-tech-tax\">champagne, Roquefort cheese and handbags</a> if the tax went ahead.</p> <p>French economy minister Bruno Le Maire insisted France has not given in to US pressure and digital companies in France will have to \u201cpay their tax dues\u201d, either via an OECD deal or the French tax.</p> <p>The head of the OECD, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, said on Thursday he was hopeful of having a framework that would apply to more than 130 countries drafted by July.</p> <p>Speaking before Gurr\u00eda\u2019s latest intervention, Vestager said member states implementing digital taxes would get support from the commission. Trump \u201cdecides what he will do and we decide what we will do\u201d she said.</p> <p>But she added that it would be \u201cquestionable and wrong\u201d to give up on the prospect of an OECD agreement. Asked when the commission would act in the absence of a deal, she twice referred to a deadline set by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cIt says at the end of this year or beginning of next year,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the task we\u2019ve been given.\u201d</p> <p>The EU\u2019s desire to revive digital tax plans could be foiled: an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/06/eu-stumbles-in-plan-to-levy-3-digital-tax-on-major-firms\">earlier proposal for a 3% levy on internet companies</a> was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/06/eu-stumbles-in-plan-to-levy-3-digital-tax-on-major-firms\">rejected by a handful of member states</a>, including Sweden, Denmark and Ireland. EU laws on tax can only come into force with unanimous agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to taxation there are no guarantees,\u201d Vestager said, but added she was \u201cnot completely pessimistic\u201d, citing 14 laws agreed by the EU in five years to clamp down on tax avoidance.</p> <p>The Danish Liberal party politician, who won plaudits for forcing Apple to pay unpaid taxes and fining Facebook for misleading the regulators, started a five-year term last month as one of three European commission first vice-presidents. </p> <p>A former government minister, she failed in her bid to become European commission president, as Europe\u2019s centre-right and centre-left forces preserved their dominance in divvying up the EU\u2019s premier positions. Vestager said it took her \u201cbetween 20 and 30 seconds\u201d to digest not getting the top job, which went to Germany\u2019s centre-right defence minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/who-is-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-new-eu-commission-president\">Ursula von der Leyen</a>.</p> <p>Vestager said she was successful in one of her main targets: having a woman run the EU executive for the first time. \u201cThe fact that it wasn\u2019t me, I couldn\u2019t help it. So would it bring me something good to grinch about it? Conclusion after 30 seconds: no.\u201d</p> <p>Another pressing task is to assess how the EU should regulate artificial intelligence. Following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/17/eu-eyes-temporary-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public-places\">widely shared leak</a>, the commission is expected to call for a temporary ban on facial recognition in public places, while regulators assess how to treat the technology.</p> <p>Vestager said regulators needed to explore how society could exploit AI, such as in reducing health inequalities and tackling pollution, without exposing people to risks.</p> <p>That meant regulators deciding when AI should be considered risky. \u201cSay my music-streaming service only gives me a playlist of jazz from the 50s and what I really want to hear is the new Eurovision soundtrack. Well I can fix that, it\u2019s easy, no harm is done. But if it\u2019s technology that failed to detect malign cancer, then it is a different matter. So what is the trigger for technology to be seen as risky?\u201d</p> <p>As the EU\u2019s competition enforcer, Vestager is also expected to take a keen interest in trade talks with the UK, especially in ensuring the British government can not outcompete EU countries through unequal state subsidies. She said the EU had \u201ca firm starting point\u201d to ensure a level playing field between EU firms and British competitors.</p> <p>The EU has said the UK can only have a zero-quota, zero-tariff trade deal by maintaining EU rules on state aid and social and environmental protection.</p> <p>Brexit would leave a \u201cvoid\u201d in the EU likely to be filled, she suggested, by a varying alliance of countries seeking to be a counterweight to France and Germany. \u201cWe always talk about the French-German axis, but for an axis to be interesting it also needs some energy from the outside,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI think the energy coming from the British side has been part of [how] that axis works. With the Brits leaving, there\u2019s a void and a void will have to be filled, otherwise things implode. So I think there will emerge a new dynamic, where maybe not one country but changing groups of countries will step in to fill that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The European Union\u2019s leading tech regulator has thrown her weight behind the British government\u2019s plans to press ahead with a digital tax despite threats from Donald Trump. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner recently promoted to take charge of Europe\u2019s digital policy as well, said she was a \u201cstrong supporter\u201d of national digital taxes in order to advance the chances of an international agreement. She said the EU would revive plans for a digital tax within a year if international efforts to find a solution failed. \u201cI think it is very important that we keep up the momentum. Because of this very fundamental injustice that most people and businesses pay their taxes and they are competing with businesses who create value but do not pay taxes,\u201d she said in an interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers. Although not mentioning the UK by name, Vestager backs all EU member states imposing digital taxes, based on the \u201cvery, very simple thing that most businesses pay their taxes\u201d. The transatlantic row over taxing digital companies, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, burst into the open at Davos this week, when the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, vowed to press ahead with go-it-alone plans for a UK digital tax, despite threats from the US of punitive tariffs on British car exports. Earlier in the week, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a digital-tax champion, agreed to postpone tax plans for one year in order to find a solution through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. France was also under pressure from Trump, who threatened to slap tariffs on champagne, Roquefort cheese and handbags if the tax went ahead. French economy minister Bruno Le Maire insisted France has not given in to US pressure and digital companies in France will have to \u201cpay their tax dues\u201d, either via an OECD deal or the French tax. The head of the OECD, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, said on Thursday he was hopeful of having a framework that would apply to more than 130 countries drafted by July. Speaking before Gurr\u00eda\u2019s latest intervention, Vestager said member states implementing digital taxes would get support from the commission. Trump \u201cdecides what he will do and we decide what we will do\u201d she said. But she added that it would be \u201cquestionable and wrong\u201d to give up on the prospect of an OECD agreement. Asked when the commission would act in the absence of a deal, she twice referred to a deadline set by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cIt says at the end of this year or beginning of next year,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the task we\u2019ve been given.\u201d The EU\u2019s desire to revive digital tax plans could be foiled: an earlier proposal for a 3% levy on internet companies was rejected by a handful of member states, including Sweden, Denmark and Ireland. EU laws on tax can only come into force with unanimous agreement. \u201cWhen it comes to taxation there are no guarantees,\u201d Vestager said, but added she was \u201cnot completely pessimistic\u201d, citing 14 laws agreed by the EU in five years to clamp down on tax avoidance. The Danish Liberal party politician, who won plaudits for forcing Apple to pay unpaid taxes and fining Facebook for misleading the regulators, started a five-year term last month as one of three European commission first vice-presidents. A former government minister, she failed in her bid to become European commission president, as Europe\u2019s centre-right and centre-left forces preserved their dominance in divvying up the EU\u2019s premier positions. Vestager said it took her \u201cbetween 20 and 30 seconds\u201d to digest not getting the top job, which went to Germany\u2019s centre-right defence minister Ursula von der Leyen. Vestager said she was successful in one of her main targets: having a woman run the EU executive for the first time. \u201cThe fact that it wasn\u2019t me, I couldn\u2019t help it. So would it bring me something good to grinch about it? Conclusion after 30 seconds: no.\u201d Another pressing task is to assess how the EU should regulate artificial intelligence. Following a widely shared leak, the commission is expected to call for a temporary ban on facial recognition in public places, while regulators assess how to treat the technology. Vestager said regulators needed to explore how society could exploit AI, such as in reducing health inequalities and tackling pollution, without exposing people to risks. That meant regulators deciding when AI should be considered risky. \u201cSay my music-streaming service only gives me a playlist of jazz from the 50s and what I really want to hear is the new Eurovision soundtrack. Well I can fix that, it\u2019s easy, no harm is done. But if it\u2019s technology that failed to detect malign cancer, then it is a different matter. So what is the trigger for technology to be seen as risky?\u201d As the EU\u2019s competition enforcer, Vestager is also expected to take a keen interest in trade talks with the UK, especially in ensuring the British government can not outcompete EU countries through unequal state subsidies. She said the EU had \u201ca firm starting point\u201d to ensure a level playing field between EU firms and British competitors. The EU has said the UK can only have a zero-quota, zero-tariff trade deal by maintaining EU rules on state aid and social and environmental protection. Brexit would leave a \u201cvoid\u201d in the EU likely to be filled, she suggested, by a varying alliance of countries seeking to be a counterweight to France and Germany. \u201cWe always talk about the French-German axis, but for an axis to be interesting it also needs some energy from the outside,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the energy coming from the British side has been part of [how] that axis works. With the Brits leaving, there\u2019s a void and a void will have to be filled, otherwise things implode. So I think there will emerge a new dynamic, where maybe not one country but changing groups of countries will step in to fill that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Victoria Derbyshire has every right to feel aggrieved. The star of her eponymous show, a much-admired BBC Two current affairs programme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/23/victoria-derbyshire-says-not-told-bbc-axing-show\" title=\"\">learned</a> of its demise online. It reaches parts of Britain others can only dream of \u2013 and the BBC\u2019s legitimacy depends on doing so. To be axed in such a shabby way is hardly an advertisement for BBC management practice. Despite this, one ought not to lose sight of what led to this sorry state of affairs: the <a href=\"https://rts.org.uk/article/mark-thompsons-steve-hewlett-memorial-lecture-speech\" title=\"\">orchestrated campaign</a> by politicians, corporate rivals and rightwing thinktanks in a war against the BBC.</p> <p>The end of Ms Derbyshire\u2019s show has been hastened by deliberate Tory policy. In 2015, George Osborne compelled the BBC to accept the roughly \u00a3500m-a-year cost of providing the over-75s with a free TV licence \u2013 loading a welfare policy on to a broadcaster. This funding deal was based not on public consultation, a published analysis of the BBC\u2019s funding needs or the likely impact on services. Indeed, there had been no inkling that such a move might be undertaken by Mr Osborne. Perhaps his meetings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/18/george-osborne-rupert-murdoch-bbc-cuts-news-corp\" title=\"\">beforehand</a> with Rupert Murdoch might have helped make up the then chancellor\u2019s mind. Mr Murdoch sees the BBC as a commercial foe, describing it wrongly as being a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/386996593477840897\" title=\"\">massive taxpayer funded mouthpiece for tiny circulation leftist Guardian [sic]</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The chickens of the licence fee change are coming home to roost. By March, more than 4 million pensioners will get a letter from Auntie. In it, the BBC will explain that for the first time in two decades over-75s must pay for the licence fee.

      "bodyText": "Victoria Derbyshire has every right to feel aggrieved. The star of her eponymous show, a much-admired BBC Two current affairs programme, learned of its demise online. It reaches parts of Britain others can only dream of \u2013 and the BBC\u2019s legitimacy depends on doing so. To be axed in such a shabby way is hardly an advertisement for BBC management practice. Despite this, one ought not to lose sight of what led to this sorry state of affairs: the orchestrated campaign by politicians, corporate rivals and rightwing thinktanks in a war against the BBC. The end of Ms Derbyshire\u2019s show has been hastened by deliberate Tory policy. In 2015, George Osborne compelled the BBC to accept the roughly \u00a3500m-a-year cost of providing the over-75s with a free TV licence \u2013 loading a welfare policy on to a broadcaster. This funding deal was based not on public consultation, a published analysis of the BBC\u2019s funding needs or the likely impact on services. Indeed, there had been no inkling that such a move might be undertaken by Mr Osborne. Perhaps his meetings beforehand with Rupert Murdoch might have helped make up the then chancellor\u2019s mind. Mr Murdoch sees the BBC as a commercial foe, describing it wrongly as being a \u201cmassive taxpayer funded mouthpiece for tiny circulation leftist Guardian [sic]\u201d. The chickens of the licence fee change are coming home to roost. By March, more than 4 million pensioners will get a letter from Auntie. In it, the BBC will explain that for the first time in two decades over-75s must pay for the licence fee. The estimated 3 million of them who are not on pension credit will have to find \u00a3154.50 for a colour TV licence. The choice for some may be whether they want to put food on the table or be nourished emotionally and intellectually. Letting a group of people who may in many cases be living with some combination of disability, low income and loneliness navigate an unfamiliar bureaucracy to pay their TV licence is a recipe for chaos. Boris Johnson is no fan of the BBC \u2013 banning ministers from appearing on its flagship morning radio news show, Today. The hostility to the BBC is shared by Mr Johnson\u2019s chief of staff Dominic Cummings who has called the BBC a \u201cmortal enemy\u201d of the Tory party. One of Mr Johnson\u2019s first acts after the election was to order a review of whether people should still be prosecuted for failing to pay the licence fee. It would be morally wrong for a government to hoodwink the over-75s, the BBC\u2019s biggest users, with the message \u2013 amplified in friendly media \u2013 that when their free television licence ends there will be no damage to the BBC if they don\u2019t pay up.

      "bodyText": "Financial markets around the world have been rattled by the coronavirus outbreak, with its centre in Wuhan, a city known as the Chicago of China for its central location and booming car manufacturing industry. Amid growing concern over the spread of the virus, China has put Wuhan and four other cities with a combined population of more than 20 million on lockdown. It has banned travel during the biggest mass annual human migration on the planet for the lunar new year this weekend, when up to 400 million Chinese are expected to travel across the country to celebrate with friends and family. With outbound trains, buses and flights halted, fears are rising that the virus could also dent growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy, in a rerun of the Sars outbreak of 2003. The first major deadly infectious disease of the 21st century infected up to 8,098 people worldwide and killed 774, spreading fear of fatal disease around the world and dragging down Chinese growth. Almost two decades after becoming a member of the World Trade Organization, China is now far more important to the economic prospects of companies and countries worldwide. As fears of a \u201cblack swan\u201d event rise at a fragile time for the world economy, there was a sharp sell-off on Thursday, with markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen down 2-3.5%. On the London Stock Exchange, mining companies including Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American were among the biggest fallers, amid fears that demand for metals and materials in China could falter. The price of oil fell on international markets by 3%, while shares in hotel groups, airlines and luxury retailers \u2013 including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier \u2013 have all hit reverse. The lunar new year on 25 January is typically a significant opportunity for European luxury brands. China represents 35% of global income in the sector, and analysts warned sales could be dented by the travel bans during the crucial two-week spending period. Christopher Wood, an analyst at the US bank Jefferies, said the virus had potential to trigger further panic-selling, adding: \u201cMarkets have started to try to price in the risk of this becoming a full-blown epidemic.\u201d If not contained, economists said tourism, retail sales and travel would be hit in the next few months, while industrial production could struggle to recover after a slump at the end of 2019, amid the US-China trade war which has cut Chinese economic growth to its lowest level in 29 years. George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, said: \u201cIt\u2019s coming at a very sensitive time for the Chinese economy. It looked as though at the end of 2019 the downturn in economic activity and unemployment had stabilised. \u201cThe idea was that we would see a modest rise in economic growth in the first and second quarters of the year. That might not actually happen. It may cause stagnation around current levels of activity to continue.\u201d Wuhan is home to Dongfeng, one of China\u2019s largest car manufacturers. As the capital and most populous city of the central province of Hubei, with a population of about 11 million, it produced roughly $224bn (\u00a3171bn) in GDP in 2018. While equivalent to the size of Vietnam or Portugal, it is little more than 1% of China\u2019s total economic output. Drawing lessons from the Sars outbreak, economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale warned that economic growth would probably fall below 6% in the first quarter of 2020, down from a previous estimate of 6.1%, if the outbreak failed to stabilise by March. Consumer- and tourism-related sectors would be most affected, it said. Sars caused an estimated decline in China\u2019s GDP growth of between one and two percentage points, at a time when the country\u2019s economy was much smaller but faster growing at the turn of the millennium. Unlike the Wuhan coronavirus, Sars first hit the much more economically significant province of Guangdong and spread to Beijing \u2013 at a time when they accounted for a total of about 15% of GDP. According to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Sars caused visitor numbers to mainland China to plunge by 26% in the second quarter of 2003 from the previous three months, and by nearly 60% in Guangdong. Disruptions to normal production led to shortages of some products, including medicines. However, as the spread of the disease was contained, the disruption to activity was short-lived. A strong recovery followed, raising hopes that the coronavirus may also have little lasting impact if it can be contained. Seema Shah, the chief strategist at the fund manager Principal Global Investors, said memories of the impact could play havoc with market confidence, but should be kept in perspective. She added: \u201cIt is too early to assess the potential economic impact of this outbreak. However, there is reason to hope that the impact of this virus will not be greater than Sars. China\u2019s response has been considerably more proactive than in 2003.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary has clashed with Greta Thunberg after responding to the activist\u2019s call for immediate fossil fuel divestment by telling the 17-year-old to go to college and study economics. In an attempt to slap down the climate emergency movement, Steven Mnuchin pretended not to know who Thunberg was, before dismissing her concerns as ill-informed. Asked whether calls for public and private-sector divestment from fossil fuel companies would threaten US growth, Mnuchin jibed: \u201cIs she the chief economist? Who is she, I\u2019m confused\u201d \u2013 before clarifying that he was joking. \u201cAfter she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,\u201d Mnuchin added, at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Thunberg, 17, responded by tweeting a graph from a UN report showing how the world\u2019s remaining carbon budget will be used up by 2027 unless global emissions are curbed. \u201cMy gap year ends in August, but it doesn\u2019t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5\u00b0 carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don\u2019t add up,\u201d she pointed out. Mnuchin\u2019s comments expose the huge gulf that still exists between climate activists and the White House. Pressed on the climate emergency, Mnuchin insisted that environmental issues are \u201cclearly complicated\u201d. He said: \u201cWhen I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it. \u201cBut nobody focuses on how that electricity is made and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries.\u201d He also claimed the US was showing leadership in tackling emissions \u2013 but through its private sector rather than government. President Trump believes in clean air and water, and a clean environment, Mnuchin insisted, but also believes that more attention should be paid to the environmental damage caused by China and India. People who call for divestment should remember there are \u201csignificant economic issues, issues with jobs\u201d, he continued. \u201cMany economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesn\u2019t have to be all renewables.\u201d Angela Merkel, though, spoke warmly about the work of the new generation of climate activists. \u201cThe impatience of our young people is something that we should tap,\u201d the German chancellor said. In a special address to the WEF, Merkel called for more international cooperation to tackle climate change. \u201cI am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action,\u201d she declared. Thunberg has used this week\u2019s gathering in Davos to push for radical change on the climate emergency. She called for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investment, an end to subsidies for the industry and a halt to investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments. \u201cYou might think we\u2019re naive but if you won\u2019t do it, you must explain to your children why you\u2019ve given up on the Paris agreement goals and knowingly created a climate crisis,\u201d she told delegates on Tuesday. Mnuchin\u2019s comments clearly show the White House has yet to heed the call. The US labour secretary, Eugene Scalia, called for a balanced approach. The energy sector has been an important source of jobs and fully divesting from fossil fuels would also harm US pensioners, he said. On Tuesday, Trump told Davos that delegates should be optimistic. \u201cTo embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.

The NHS has more than 40,000 vacancies for nurses. \u201cThis announcement comes on the day that new figures show yet more nurses have been lost from our local community services in recent years,\u201d said Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing. \u201cThe evidence shows it is district nurses and health visitors who provide high-quality holistic care in people\u2019s homes. There can be no substitute for having enough nurses in communities, social care and hospitals too.\u201d Figures published by NHS Digital show that the number of nurses working in community services has fallen over the past decade from 67,316 in September 2009 to 62,898 last October \u2013 a drop of 6.6%.",

On the first floor, a colourful painting from 1947, Years of Victory, celebrates the nationalisation of the coal industry; smiling, suited miners and their wives march through Durham city, in front of a banner featuring former the Labour party leaders Clement Attlee and Keir Hardie.</p> <p>Since December, that kind of happy optimism is in short supply in the corridors of the DMA, traditionally a bastion of \u201cold Labour\u201d values. The scale of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/crushed-by-brexit-how-labour-lost-the-election\">unprecedented humiliation</a> of the party at last month\u2019s election, when swathes of County Durham and northern England turned Conservative for the first time in generations, felt like much more than a bad night at the polls. As seats such as Bishop Auckland, Sedgefield, North West Durham and Blyth Valley have fallen, there is a feeling that Labour\u2019s identity \u2013 its sense of itself \u2013 has been diminished as well as the party\u2019s parliamentary numbers.</p> <p>In a bleak conversation with association stalwarts, a now familiar list of causes is cited: lack of clarity on Brexit; an overloaded manifesto, the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn on the doorstep and the issue of antisemitism. The role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/labour-leadership-momentum-survive\">Momentum</a>, perceived as an anti-democratic movement, is also criticised. But for those whose politics were tempered in the fire and fury of the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/miners-strike-1984-85\">miners\u2019 strike</a>, there is a fear that the true source of this malaise lies much deeper, rooted in long-term industrial decline in which Labour governments are perceived to have been complicit. And there is trepidation that the worst may not be over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ce2f90f31b316c1715ba83ea13c66e4f0885be6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce2f90f31b316c1715ba83ea13c66e4f0885be6/0_214_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Mardghum, secretary of the DMA, at Redhills.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Mardghum, secretary of the DMA, at Redhills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople in the north-east and working-class communities generally feel let down by Labour over generations,\u201d says Alan Mardghum, the DMA\u2019s general secretary. \u201cThere is a perception that they haven\u2019t done enough, they haven\u2019t sufficiently been on working people\u2019s side. We\u2019ve seen a steady decline in support over years. My fear is now that Labour in the north-east is in the same situation that the Labour party found itself in Scotland, and they\u2019ve been absolutely decimated there. Wiped out. If they don\u2019t address the issues and talk to people, and I\u2019m not talking about the chattering classes in London, I mean the people up here who didn\u2019t vote for them, I fear for the future. We need to put it right.\u201d A backer of Jeremy Corbyn, Mardghum is not yet willing to be drawn on who he might favour as Corbyn\u2019s successor.</p> <p>The profound disconnect between the party and former heartlands that he identifies is easier to diagnose than to fix. Cultural continuities and political loyalties, which in regions like Durham appeared to survive the collapse of the industries that generated them, appear to be breaking down. The DMA still runs the well-attended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/08/jeremy-corbyn-helps-draw-record-crowds-to-durham-miners-gala\">summer gala</a> and offers support and advice to ex-mining communities. But the Sedgefield and North West Durham constituencies lost their pits more than two generations ago. \u201cMargaret Thatcher didn\u2019t succeed in her ambition to smash the ethos as well as the industry of the coalfield,\u201d says Stephen Guy, an ex-miner and former Labour councillor. \u201cBut with the passage of time, the sense of community is beginning to break up and fragment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efea94aeae8318602dced72cbb63a540e834ae9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efea94aeae8318602dced72cbb63a540e834ae9d/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Stratford in the Durham Miners\u2019 Hall (the Pitman\u2019s Parliament) at Redhills.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Stratford in the Durham Miners\u2019 Hall (the Pitman\u2019s Parliament) at Redhills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mary Stratford is 64. A labour activist all her life, she volunteers with a miners\u2019 heritage education group. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d she says, \u201cUp here you\u2019ve got a mainly white working class and you\u2019ve got an ageing population, as a direct result of the fact that jobs have disappeared and young people are having to leave if they want to find work. That left a vacuum and there have been warning signs [for Labour]. I remember in the Spennymoor area, around 2010, I was shocked by how much support the BNP had built up in those areas.\u201d</p> <p>Nationally Labour has new bastions in the cities which could never countenance a cultural shift to the right, particularly on issues such as immigration, in an effort to win the new breed of \u201cblue-collar conservative\u201d back \u2013 and some have argued that in the course of the attempt to regain the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/22/pick-long-bailey-and-its-over-the-view-from-the-ruins-of-labours-red-wall\">red wall</a>\u201d, the interests of minority voters and other crucial parts of the party\u2019s coalition have been forgotten.</p> <p>Stratford recognises the issue and the challenge. If the Labour movement is to have a future, she says, it must wake up to the truth that \u201cthe working class has changed. A trade unionist is just as likely to be a woman as a man. A worker is an Asian Uber driver, or someone working for Deliveroo. We need to re-connect with the solidarity and community of the past but we can\u2019t go back to some of the old insular ways and views.\u201d</p> <p>But how can that be done? At times, she believes, Labour has shown a tin ear for what local communities value and desire. In the aftermath of the election defeat, Stratford finds herself thinking back to a row in Lumley, the ex-mining village where she lives. \u201cThe community wanted a boxing club and that idea was blocked, primarily by Labour councillors. I think they thought boxing was a dangerous sport, not the right thing and not to be encouraged. There was a massive reaction. A residents\u2019 group was formed and it led eventually to the election of an independent councillor.

      "bodyText": "Redhills, the headquarters of the Durham Miners\u2019 Association, is one of the glories of the British labour movement. Opened in 1915, it remains a symbol of self-organisation, pride and collective power, rivalling in splendour the mansions built by the region\u2019s wealthiest mine owners. On the first floor, a colourful painting from 1947, Years of Victory, celebrates the nationalisation of the coal industry; smiling, suited miners and their wives march through Durham city, in front of a banner featuring former the Labour party leaders Clement Attlee and Keir Hardie. Since December, that kind of happy optimism is in short supply in the corridors of the DMA, traditionally a bastion of \u201cold Labour\u201d values. The scale of the unprecedented humiliation of the party at last month\u2019s election, when swathes of County Durham and northern England turned Conservative for the first time in generations, felt like much more than a bad night at the polls. As seats such as Bishop Auckland, Sedgefield, North West Durham and Blyth Valley have fallen, there is a feeling that Labour\u2019s identity \u2013 its sense of itself \u2013 has been diminished as well as the party\u2019s parliamentary numbers. In a bleak conversation with association stalwarts, a now familiar list of causes is cited: lack of clarity on Brexit; an overloaded manifesto, the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn on the doorstep and the issue of antisemitism. The role of Momentum, perceived as an anti-democratic movement, is also criticised. But for those whose politics were tempered in the fire and fury of the 1980s miners\u2019 strike, there is a fear that the true source of this malaise lies much deeper, rooted in long-term industrial decline in which Labour governments are perceived to have been complicit. And there is trepidation that the worst may not be over. \u201cPeople in the north-east and working-class communities generally feel let down by Labour over generations,\u201d says Alan Mardghum, the DMA\u2019s general secretary. \u201cThere is a perception that they haven\u2019t done enough, they haven\u2019t sufficiently been on working people\u2019s side. We\u2019ve seen a steady decline in support over years. My fear is now that Labour in the north-east is in the same situation that the Labour party found itself in Scotland, and they\u2019ve been absolutely decimated there. Wiped out. If they don\u2019t address the issues and talk to people, and I\u2019m not talking about the chattering classes in London, I mean the people up here who didn\u2019t vote for them, I fear for the future. We need to put it right.\u201d A backer of Jeremy Corbyn, Mardghum is not yet willing to be drawn on who he might favour as Corbyn\u2019s successor. The profound disconnect between the party and former heartlands that he identifies is easier to diagnose than to fix. Cultural continuities and political loyalties, which in regions like Durham appeared to survive the collapse of the industries that generated them, appear to be breaking down. The DMA still runs the well-attended summer gala and offers support and advice to ex-mining communities. But the Sedgefield and North West Durham constituencies lost their pits more than two generations ago. \u201cMargaret Thatcher didn\u2019t succeed in her ambition to smash the ethos as well as the industry of the coalfield,\u201d says Stephen Guy, an ex-miner and former Labour councillor. \u201cBut with the passage of time, the sense of community is beginning to break up and fragment.\u201d Mary Stratford is 64. A labour activist all her life, she volunteers with a miners\u2019 heritage education group. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d she says, \u201cUp here you\u2019ve got a mainly white working class and you\u2019ve got an ageing population, as a direct result of the fact that jobs have disappeared and young people are having to leave if they want to find work. That left a vacuum and there have been warning signs [for Labour]. I remember in the Spennymoor area, around 2010, I was shocked by how much support the BNP had built up in those areas.\u201d Nationally Labour has new bastions in the cities which could never countenance a cultural shift to the right, particularly on issues such as immigration, in an effort to win the new breed of \u201cblue-collar conservative\u201d back \u2013 and some have argued that in the course of the attempt to regain the \u201cred wall\u201d, the interests of minority voters and other crucial parts of the party\u2019s coalition have been forgotten. Stratford recognises the issue and the challenge. If the Labour movement is to have a future, she says, it must wake up to the truth that \u201cthe working class has changed. A trade unionist is just as likely to be a woman as a man. A worker is an Asian Uber driver, or someone working for Deliveroo. We need to re-connect with the solidarity and community of the past but we can\u2019t go back to some of the old insular ways and views.\u201d But how can that be done? At times, she believes, Labour has shown a tin ear for what local communities value and desire. In the aftermath of the election defeat, Stratford finds herself thinking back to a row in Lumley, the ex-mining village where she lives. \u201cThe community wanted a boxing club and that idea was blocked, primarily by Labour councillors. I think they thought boxing was a dangerous sport, not the right thing and not to be encouraged. There was a massive reaction. A residents\u2019 group was formed and it led eventually to the election of an independent councillor. I sometimes think now that people perceive the party as being more concerned with its own interests and preoccupations than with those of the community it represents, which feels taken for granted.\u201d The battle for the boxing club, and the resentments it generated, strikes a chord with Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan and an increasingly powerful presence in the Labour leadership race. A Guardian poll published on Wednesday found that a large majority of senior Labour figures in so-called red wall seats backed either Nandy or Keir Starmer as the next leader of the party. Starmer made a theme of the need to win back the trust of the post-industrial regions. But it is Nandy, who, since founding the Centre for Towns in 2017, has most actively tried to navigate the complex politics of post-industrial decline. If the relationship with regions like County Durham is to be renewed, she says, a relationship of mutual respect has to be re-established. \u201cStretching back four decades under successive leaders,\u201d says Nandy, \u201cthe Labour leadership has disconnected from people in these kind of places; it has more or less given the impression that \u2018We don\u2019t understand you and we don\u2019t particularly like you.\u2019\u201d The emphasis during that period on investment in cities, as dynamic drivers of economic growth and magnets for the young, has compounded the sense in older, smaller communities that they are now disregarded, having outlived their industrial usefulness, and that Labour has not fought their corner. \u201cThere has been investment in cities, but not much of that benefit of that has been felt outside.

      "body": "<p>If Boris Johnson is thinking of moving the House of Lords to the north \u2013 partly to get it out of his hair, and partly to suck up to the region of England most decimated by Thatcherism \u2013 York is the least suitable city to plonk it in (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/house-of-lords-may-move-out-of-london-to-reconnect-with-public\" title=\"\">House of Lords: Conservatives look north for Westminster shutdown</a>, 20 January). In reality, York is a bit of the south that just happens to be in the north geographically: a pretty, chocolate-box-lid tourist town, with lots of splendid medieval architecture, to remind their lordships, perhaps, of their feudal roots, an archbishop to partner the one living in Lambeth, no industry left, and a gleaming newish out-of-town university that doesn\u2019t strike me (and I worked there temporarily some years ago) as reflecting \u201cnorthern-ness\u201d in any essential way. York is a lovely town, but it\u2019s no longer \u201cthe north\u201d.</p> <p>Five years ago I suggested <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2014/november/parliamentary-roadshow\" title=\"\">in a London Review of Books blogpost</a> that parliament, as a whole, might relocate to another place temporarily, while the present building is being refurbished, in order to bring MPs closer to those of their electors that the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d has rather lost contact with. My favourite choice then was Manchester; and that would be my ideal venue for the upper house today. It has a fine Victorian Gothic city hall, which in my view is architecturally superior to Westminster, and which surely could house their lordships comfortably. It also has two leading football teams. (You can\u2019t get much more northern than that.)</p> <p>Beyond this, however, Manchester and its environs have a strong claim to be the capital of a vital English \u201cidentity\u201d quite distinct from, but just as important as, the one that London and Westminster represent: its industrial, nonconformist, creative, democratic and radical spirit. Boris Johnson might not feel comfortable there, but putting half of parliament in Manchester could help to bring the north and south together in the way he claims to want.</p> <p>And I write as an (adopted) Yorkist.<br><strong>Bernard Porter</strong><br><em>Hull, East Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Moving the House of Lords to York would certainly do something to redress the imbalance between London and the provinces, but it is surely time to consider other important reforms. While Simon Jenkins is right in much of his critique of the Lords (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/house-lords-north-york-mps-palace-westminster\" title=\"\">York is just the place for a peers\u2019 palace</a>, Journal, 20 January), he is wrong to claim that its function is largely symbolic. The functions of a second chamber to reconsider, reject or amend \u2013 even if only temporarily \u2013 aspects of proposed legislation are important elements of our democracy, and their lordships have, on occasion, provided valuable restraint over the excesses of the Commons. Their debates are often more intelligent and better-informed, and always less confrontational.</p> <p>The problem is that to a large extent the Lords is populated by a totally unrepresentative group of appointees. My concern is not so much with the fact that they are appointed but that they are in no sense of the word representative. This is not necessarily to argue for an elected house. Indeed I think an elected second chamber along the same party lines as the first would not only be a disaster but would still not be genuinely representative. A genuinely representative house would represent the composition of the population in terms of age, gender, social class, ethnicity and occupation (or lack of one).</p> <p>It should not be beyond our collective wit to devise a system where members could be appointed or elected from say, the various professions, unions, industry and commerce as well as those on benefits. Those groups could be invited to submit names and CVs to a second chamber appointing committee charged with selecting, or organising the election of, candidates who collectively best meet the representational criteria.</p> <p>It may not be easy to do and there could well be arguments about the categories, and the result may not be perfect \u2013 but then what is? It would certainly be greatly preferable to any of the alternatives so far canvassed.<br><strong>Roy King</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 Of course Johnson would love to shift parliament into the regions \u2013 the further away from the seat of power the better. It seems he\u2019s already learning similar tricks by diminishing the power of the lobby (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/the-westminster-lobby-system-is-at-the-heart-of-a-press-freedom-fight\" title=\"\">Press freedom: Parliament\u2019s lobby system now at the heart of the battle</a>, 20 January). If parliament is to hold government to account then it needs to be sitting on top of Whitehall. Moving the House of Lords to York would just be theatrics, and it\u2019s not as if York hasn\u2019t got enough visitors already. The obvious alternative, so far as Yorkshire is concerned, is to devolve power to a Yorkshire parliament, but the slogan \u201cpower to the regions\u201d rarely leads to genuine devolution.<br><strong>Colin Challen</strong><br><em>MP for Morley and Rothwell, 2001-10</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am very disappointed in your article about the prospect of the House of Lords moving to York (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/20/house-of-lords-idea-gets-lukewarm-reception-in-york\" title=\"\">Citizens not starstruck by proposal</a>, 21 January). Major regeneration proposals need to be assessed carefully, but with an eye to the possibilities of a different future for northern cities and towns. Unlike the Guardian, the local paper managed to find quite a few people who like the idea of the Lords plan, which would be a major improvement on the current plans for the disused land next to York railway station.</p> <p>We are well aware that too many in London want York to be a historic theme park for rich people, which is why it is currently the most unequal and unaffordable city in the north of England. If that is to be changed, it needs a major new vision and courage by local and national politicians. The recent decision to take traffic out of the city centre is a major step in the right direction.<br><strong>Richard Clark</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 One thing that moving the Lords to York would do is to greatly increase the travel expenses paid to members. A new Lords library briefing shows that, of the peers who declare their regions of residence, almost 55% live in London, or commutable distances from London in the south-east and the east of England \u2013 with another 9% in the south-west.</p> <p>A mere 4.6% live in the north-west of England where I live, and only 14% in all three north of England regions together. Scotland does slightly less badly, pro rata, with 9%, but the east and west Midlands have just 6.3% between them.</p> <p>If we want to bridge the north-south divide we might start with more regional balance in the upper house (preferably by election).

      "bodyText": "If Boris Johnson is thinking of moving the House of Lords to the north \u2013 partly to get it out of his hair, and partly to suck up to the region of England most decimated by Thatcherism \u2013 York is the least suitable city to plonk it in (House of Lords: Conservatives look north for Westminster shutdown, 20 January). In reality, York is a bit of the south that just happens to be in the north geographically: a pretty, chocolate-box-lid tourist town, with lots of splendid medieval architecture, to remind their lordships, perhaps, of their feudal roots, an archbishop to partner the one living in Lambeth, no industry left, and a gleaming newish out-of-town university that doesn\u2019t strike me (and I worked there temporarily some years ago) as reflecting \u201cnorthern-ness\u201d in any essential way. York is a lovely town, but it\u2019s no longer \u201cthe north\u201d. Five years ago I suggested in a London Review of Books blogpost that parliament, as a whole, might relocate to another place temporarily, while the present building is being refurbished, in order to bring MPs closer to those of their electors that the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d has rather lost contact with. My favourite choice then was Manchester; and that would be my ideal venue for the upper house today. It has a fine Victorian Gothic city hall, which in my view is architecturally superior to Westminster, and which surely could house their lordships comfortably. It also has two leading football teams. (You can\u2019t get much more northern than that.) Beyond this, however, Manchester and its environs have a strong claim to be the capital of a vital English \u201cidentity\u201d quite distinct from, but just as important as, the one that London and Westminster represent: its industrial, nonconformist, creative, democratic and radical spirit. Boris Johnson might not feel comfortable there, but putting half of parliament in Manchester could help to bring the north and south together in the way he claims to want. And I write as an (adopted) Yorkist. Bernard Porter Hull, East Yorkshire \u2022 Moving the House of Lords to York would certainly do something to redress the imbalance between London and the provinces, but it is surely time to consider other important reforms. While Simon Jenkins is right in much of his critique of the Lords (York is just the place for a peers\u2019 palace, Journal, 20 January), he is wrong to claim that its function is largely symbolic. The functions of a second chamber to reconsider, reject or amend \u2013 even if only temporarily \u2013 aspects of proposed legislation are important elements of our democracy, and their lordships have, on occasion, provided valuable restraint over the excesses of the Commons. Their debates are often more intelligent and better-informed, and always less confrontational. The problem is that to a large extent the Lords is populated by a totally unrepresentative group of appointees. My concern is not so much with the fact that they are appointed but that they are in no sense of the word representative. This is not necessarily to argue for an elected house. Indeed I think an elected second chamber along the same party lines as the first would not only be a disaster but would still not be genuinely representative. A genuinely representative house would represent the composition of the population in terms of age, gender, social class, ethnicity and occupation (or lack of one). It should not be beyond our collective wit to devise a system where members could be appointed or elected from say, the various professions, unions, industry and commerce as well as those on benefits. Those groups could be invited to submit names and CVs to a second chamber appointing committee charged with selecting, or organising the election of, candidates who collectively best meet the representational criteria. It may not be easy to do and there could well be arguments about the categories, and the result may not be perfect \u2013 but then what is? It would certainly be greatly preferable to any of the alternatives so far canvassed. Roy King Cambridge \u2022 Of course Johnson would love to shift parliament into the regions \u2013 the further away from the seat of power the better. It seems he\u2019s already learning similar tricks by diminishing the power of the lobby (Press freedom: Parliament\u2019s lobby system now at the heart of the battle, 20 January). If parliament is to hold government to account then it needs to be sitting on top of Whitehall. Moving the House of Lords to York would just be theatrics, and it\u2019s not as if York hasn\u2019t got enough visitors already. The obvious alternative, so far as Yorkshire is concerned, is to devolve power to a Yorkshire parliament, but the slogan \u201cpower to the regions\u201d rarely leads to genuine devolution. Colin Challen MP for Morley and Rothwell, 2001-10 \u2022 I am very disappointed in your article about the prospect of the House of Lords moving to York (Citizens not starstruck by proposal, 21 January). Major regeneration proposals need to be assessed carefully, but with an eye to the possibilities of a different future for northern cities and towns. Unlike the Guardian, the local paper managed to find quite a few people who like the idea of the Lords plan, which would be a major improvement on the current plans for the disused land next to York railway station. We are well aware that too many in London want York to be a historic theme park for rich people, which is why it is currently the most unequal and unaffordable city in the north of England. If that is to be changed, it needs a major new vision and courage by local and national politicians. The recent decision to take traffic out of the city centre is a major step in the right direction. Richard Clark York \u2022 One thing that moving the Lords to York would do is to greatly increase the travel expenses paid to members. A new Lords library briefing shows that, of the peers who declare their regions of residence, almost 55% live in London, or commutable distances from London in the south-east and the east of England \u2013 with another 9% in the south-west. A mere 4.6% live in the north-west of England where I live, and only 14% in all three north of England regions together. Scotland does slightly less badly, pro rata, with 9%, but the east and west Midlands have just 6.3% between them. If we want to bridge the north-south divide we might start with more regional balance in the upper house (preferably by election). Some of us try to make sure the needs of the north are heard, but more members will help, wherever it might meet in future. Tony Greaves Liberal Democrat, House of Lords \u2022 The current floated suggestions are candyfloss. We need something substantial. Why not an assembly for England? Base it in Birmingham. Then have a much-reduced national parliament remaining in London. Have the Lords limited to an elected 100. And while we\u2019re at it, why not a major base for the monarch in Manchester, replacing Buckingham Palace?

The World Health Organization has stated that an animal appears most likely to be the primary source, with experts suggesting it may have been carried by bats, badgers, rats or snakes.</p> <p>The virus is from the same family of viruses as Sars, which was passed to humans from bats by the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5643/276\">masked pam civets</a>, and Mers, which was carried from bats to humans <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(13)70164-6/fulltext\">by camels</a>.</p> <p>Ian Jones, professor of virology at Reading University, said it was likely that the Wuhan virus had also been transmitted in the same way \u2013 passed from bats to humans through an intermediate host. \u201cSomething in the local area will have picked up this virus and it\u2019s this something that would have been on sale in the wet market,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>Though the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed nearly 800 people, prompted efforts to regulate the wildlife trade in China, the tradition of eating endangered wild animals, or using wildlife to produce medicines, remains popular. Conservationists and health experts warn that such animals are being sold in unhygienic and cramped markets, allowing viruses to thrive.</p> <p>Media reports suggest that about 50 wild animals, including endangered pangolins, were on sale at the market in Wuhan before it was closed at the end of last year. Photographs taken before its closure show snakes, porcupines and foxes crammed into cages. The sister of a vendor infected by the virus told China Business Journal, a state-owned paper, that snakes, ducks and wild rabbits were common at the market.</p> <p>\u201cThe animal welfare part of this is obvious, but much more hidden is this stashing and mixing of all these species together in a very small area, with secretions and urine mixed up together,\u201d Christian Walzer, executive director of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told Reuters.</p> <p>The environment creates a perfect system to spread viruses, he said: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it any better if you tried.\u201d</p> <p>Research <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/snakes-could-be-the-original-source-of-the-new-coronavirus-outbreak-in-china-130364\">published on Wednesday</a> in the Journal of Medical Virology, which used analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus, suggested it may have been snakes at the market that passed the virus to humans.</p> <p>Some argue that the virus is more likely to have been passed on by a mammal. \u201cIn my view it\u2019s very unlikely to be a snake because the jump from a reptile to a person is evolutionarily quite a long way,\u201d said Jones, who added that while snake handling is common in the region, he is not aware of any individuals contracting this kind of virus after direct handling of snakes.</p> <p>Badgers and rats were both cited as possible sources by Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan. The sale of live poultry has been banned in Wuhan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/22/coronavirus-china-measures-rein-spread-mutate-disease-death-toll\">where all outbound public transport has also been suspended</a>.</p> <p>Identifying the origin of the virus would not only enable officials to prevent its circulation, but could also allow scientists to understand if the virus has further evolved after infecting people.</p> <p>On Wednesday, China\u2019s national health commission vice-minister Li Bin told reporters there was evidence of respiratory transmission of the virus from patient to patient. Among those infected are 15 medical staff.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Officials in China are searching to uncover the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, amid heightened scrutiny of the country\u2019s poorly regulated animal trade. Authorities believe the new strain of coronavirus came from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was sold illegally. The World Health Organization has stated that an animal appears most likely to be the primary source, with experts suggesting it may have been carried by bats, badgers, rats or snakes. The virus is from the same family of viruses as Sars, which was passed to humans from bats by the masked pam civets, and Mers, which was carried from bats to humans by camels. Ian Jones, professor of virology at Reading University, said it was likely that the Wuhan virus had also been transmitted in the same way \u2013 passed from bats to humans through an intermediate host. \u201cSomething in the local area will have picked up this virus and it\u2019s this something that would have been on sale in the wet market,\u201d said Jones. Though the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed nearly 800 people, prompted efforts to regulate the wildlife trade in China, the tradition of eating endangered wild animals, or using wildlife to produce medicines, remains popular. Conservationists and health experts warn that such animals are being sold in unhygienic and cramped markets, allowing viruses to thrive. Media reports suggest that about 50 wild animals, including endangered pangolins, were on sale at the market in Wuhan before it was closed at the end of last year. Photographs taken before its closure show snakes, porcupines and foxes crammed into cages. The sister of a vendor infected by the virus told China Business Journal, a state-owned paper, that snakes, ducks and wild rabbits were common at the market. \u201cThe animal welfare part of this is obvious, but much more hidden is this stashing and mixing of all these species together in a very small area, with secretions and urine mixed up together,\u201d Christian Walzer, executive director of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told Reuters. The environment creates a perfect system to spread viruses, he said: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it any better if you tried.\u201d Research published on Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology, which used analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus, suggested it may have been snakes at the market that passed the virus to humans. Some argue that the virus is more likely to have been passed on by a mammal. \u201cIn my view it\u2019s very unlikely to be a snake because the jump from a reptile to a person is evolutionarily quite a long way,\u201d said Jones, who added that while snake handling is common in the region, he is not aware of any individuals contracting this kind of virus after direct handling of snakes. Badgers and rats were both cited as possible sources by Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan. The sale of live poultry has been banned in Wuhan, where all outbound public transport has also been suspended. Identifying the origin of the virus would not only enable officials to prevent its circulation, but could also allow scientists to understand if the virus has further evolved after infecting people. On Wednesday, China\u2019s national health commission vice-minister Li Bin told reporters there was evidence of respiratory transmission of the virus from patient to patient. Among those infected are 15 medical staff. Reuters contributed to this report.",

Housing analysts said the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme, which launched in 2013 and gave financial support to homebuyers, had contributed to the increase in young people getting on the property ladder, along with stamp duty relief for some first-time buyers. \u201cHelp-to-buy and stamp duty relief are behind the march of the first-time buyers, who will be powering a recovery in home ownership in this age bracket,\u201d said Joseph Daniels, the founder of Project Etopia, which develops modular homes. \u201cFalling home ownership among the young still threatens to become a national crisis rooted in high property prices and stretched affordability but the tide has finally started to turn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take considerable time and momentum until owner occupancy among younger people returns to the 59% seen in 2003-04.\u201d Privately rented accommodation now accounts for 4.6m households, or 19%, which has remained unchanged for six years. But this sector is double the size it was in 2002. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, welcomed the rise in the proportion of young people owning their home. However, the figures also showed an increase in overcrowding in the social rented sector, where people rent largely from councils or housing associations at a rate pegged to local incomes. Overcrowding, which is measured by whether households have fewer bedrooms than notionally needed for its occupants, remains at its highest rate in the social rented sector, with 8% of that group living in overcrowded accommodation. Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: \u201cMore and more families are crammed like sardines into homes that are too small for them because they can\u2019t afford to rent anywhere bigger. \u201cThe odds are stacked against struggling families. What this country desperately needs is an alternative to private renting, which is why Shelter is urging the government to build a new generation of genuinely affordable social homes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British Steel is a step closer to being rescued by Chinese industrial firm Jingye, after a deal was agreed with trade unions wary of the impact on jobs and conditions. Workers\u2019 representatives and executives from the Chinese company, led by former communist party official Li Ganpo, are understood to have shaken hands about steelworkers\u2019 future terms of employment. The government, which has provided an indemnity to fund the operation of a business reportedly losing up to \u00a31m a day, is determined to complete a sale that could save more than 4,000 jobs by the end of February. If a sale is completed close to the deadline, it will have taken more than nine months since British Steel\u2019s collapse into insolvency to find a buyer. Backing from trade unions, first reported by the Financial Times and confirmed by sources close to the discussions, removes one potential obstacle standing in the way. Jingye still needs to reach agreement with suppliers, while the French state has to approve the sale of the company\u2019s plant in Hayange, near the border with Luxembourg. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that the government has lined up Turkey\u2019s Cengiz Holdings, led by President Erod\u011fan\u2019s ally Mehmet Cengiz, as a potential fallback option. But Jingye remains in pole position after signing a deal late last year to buy the company for about \u00a350m and promising to invest about \u00a31.2bn to restore it to former glories. Despite the pledge, the takeover is expected to result in some redundancies, adding more job cuts to a steel sector already suffering contraction elsewhere. Trade unions will now write to their members and ask whether they are willing to accept the terms on offer from Jingye. A spokesperson for the trade union Community said it could not comment until it has spoken to its members. The Guardian has approached Jingye for comment. The Official Receiver, a government employee managing the sale in tandem with accountancy firm EY, declined to comment.",

      "body": "<p>For those who like to think the FA Cup is about more than just monitoring the load on Premier League legs, one of the first ties of the fourth round looks a decent prospect. Two teams in good form, two teams with ambitions, two teams with distinctly contrasting styles, all under the floodlights on a Friday night. And for those who find the Cup an unnecessary distraction from more glamorous competitions then, yes, Northampton v Derby County will likely feature Wayne Rooney too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite special sharing a pitch with Rooney,\u201d says Jordan Turnbull, the Northampton centre-half. A mainstay of Keith Curle\u2019s team this season, with five league goals, the former Southampton youth product has been integral to the Cobblers\u2019 League Two promotion push. He also happens to be a Manchester United fan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/23/manchester-united-ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">Solskj\u00e6r understands \u2018disillusionment\u2019 after Manchester United\u2019s defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s a hero for me and growing up I was always watching him,\u201d the 25-year-old says. \u201cThe amount of goals he scored was just brilliant, but I think what everyone liked about him \u2013 especially United fans \u2013 was his aggression on the pitch. Of course he went over the top sometimes but you get that with football players and you enjoy watching it.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull admires Rooney still as a player, but before the match he has also assessed his former hero more dispassionately. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be that same threat up front with Derby; I think he\u2019s had to adapt his game to a sort of sitting position in central midfield. He\u2019s able to do that because the quality he possesses is out of this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s another threat we have to take on board and really counteract. But during the 90 minutes, he\u2019s just another player.\u201d</p> <p>Unbeaten in their past five league matches, Northampton are sixth in League Two, two points off an automatic promotion place. They also comprehensively outplayed League One Burton Albion in the third round of the Cup, romping through 4-2 away from home in a display of clinical finishing.</p> <p>\u201cIt was brilliant,\u201d Turnbull says of that result. \u201cWe took around 1,500 fans there and they were fantastic. To put in a performance like that against a team in a higher division was a way of repaying them. We\u2019re definitely capable of pulling a result out of the bag against Derby too. We know it\u2019s going to be a tough ask. We need to be at the best of our game and be ruthless but we\u2019ve definitely got a chance. A little Cup upset would be brilliant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71b4d8bda95c27b4ebd612753cc1e15f951d7019\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b4d8bda95c27b4ebd612753cc1e15f951d7019/74_0_3426_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicky Adams puts Northampton on their way to a 4-2 win at Burton in the FA Cup third round.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"471\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicky Adams puts Northampton on their way to a 4-2 win at Burton in the FA Cup third round.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Norton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There wasn\u2019t a big \u201cFA Cup payday\u201d for Northampton in beating Burton, and the Pirelli Stadium was no glamorous away day for the supporters either. But they still travelled en masse and the atmosphere (and result) was still one everyone at the club will remember. Which is one reason why Turnbull is not inclined to go along with the argument which says (in rough precis) that the Cup should be reconfigured to best suit the recuperative needs of the Premier League\u2019s Big Six.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the point of view of teams in the lower divisions it\u2019s a great occasion every round,\u201d Turnbull says. \u201cFor teams in the higher divisions they might not see it like that, but every round we\u2019ve had brilliant support wherever we\u2019ve been playing. Now we\u2019ve got a big Cup tie against Derby at home where we can have the same again.</p> <p>\u201cI think the hunger from players to play in the FA Cup is definitely still there and it\u2019s still a fantastic competition, especially when you get into the latter stages.

      "bodyText": "For those who like to think the FA Cup is about more than just monitoring the load on Premier League legs, one of the first ties of the fourth round looks a decent prospect. Two teams in good form, two teams with ambitions, two teams with distinctly contrasting styles, all under the floodlights on a Friday night. And for those who find the Cup an unnecessary distraction from more glamorous competitions then, yes, Northampton v Derby County will likely feature Wayne Rooney too. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite special sharing a pitch with Rooney,\u201d says Jordan Turnbull, the Northampton centre-half. A mainstay of Keith Curle\u2019s team this season, with five league goals, the former Southampton youth product has been integral to the Cobblers\u2019 League Two promotion push. He also happens to be a Manchester United fan. \u201cOf course he\u2019s a hero for me and growing up I was always watching him,\u201d the 25-year-old says. \u201cThe amount of goals he scored was just brilliant, but I think what everyone liked about him \u2013 especially United fans \u2013 was his aggression on the pitch. Of course he went over the top sometimes but you get that with football players and you enjoy watching it.\u201d Turnbull admires Rooney still as a player, but before the match he has also assessed his former hero more dispassionately. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be that same threat up front with Derby; I think he\u2019s had to adapt his game to a sort of sitting position in central midfield. He\u2019s able to do that because the quality he possesses is out of this world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s another threat we have to take on board and really counteract. But during the 90 minutes, he\u2019s just another player.\u201d Unbeaten in their past five league matches, Northampton are sixth in League Two, two points off an automatic promotion place. They also comprehensively outplayed League One Burton Albion in the third round of the Cup, romping through 4-2 away from home in a display of clinical finishing. \u201cIt was brilliant,\u201d Turnbull says of that result. \u201cWe took around 1,500 fans there and they were fantastic. To put in a performance like that against a team in a higher division was a way of repaying them. We\u2019re definitely capable of pulling a result out of the bag against Derby too. We know it\u2019s going to be a tough ask. We need to be at the best of our game and be ruthless but we\u2019ve definitely got a chance. A little Cup upset would be brilliant.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a big \u201cFA Cup payday\u201d for Northampton in beating Burton, and the Pirelli Stadium was no glamorous away day for the supporters either. But they still travelled en masse and the atmosphere (and result) was still one everyone at the club will remember. Which is one reason why Turnbull is not inclined to go along with the argument which says (in rough precis) that the Cup should be reconfigured to best suit the recuperative needs of the Premier League\u2019s Big Six. \u201cFrom the point of view of teams in the lower divisions it\u2019s a great occasion every round,\u201d Turnbull says. \u201cFor teams in the higher divisions they might not see it like that, but every round we\u2019ve had brilliant support wherever we\u2019ve been playing. Now we\u2019ve got a big Cup tie against Derby at home where we can have the same again. \u201cI think the hunger from players to play in the FA Cup is definitely still there and it\u2019s still a fantastic competition, especially when you get into the latter stages. It\u2019s brilliant. To talk about getting rid of replays \u2026 I think it would be terrible for lower-league teams if that was to happen. You\u2019re talking about ticket sales, a full stadium, a brilliant occasion. You\u2019ve got to look at it from the perspective of teams in lower divisions.\u201d It\u2019s not just the attitude towards the Cup that\u2019s different in lower divisions. The style of play that has brought Northampton recent success is not quite the same as that Phillip Cocu is trying to instill in his Derby team. Curle described his tactics against Burton in the following terms: \u201cPlan A was to get the ball into [striker] Vadaine Oliver, upset them aerially and get runners off him.

This is absolutely unprecedented and I say to the house that this is a constitutional crisis.</p> <p>We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented, when the government in Edinburgh, in Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. And this completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament to become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations.</p> <p>I full respect that those that voted for the Conservative party in England have got what they wanted. But the fact remains that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that, if we stayed in the UK, our rights as EU citizens would be respected. And moreover we were told that we were to lead the United Kingdom, that this was a family of nations, our rights would be respected. And we find today that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored, and against the express wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum, and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blackford was referring to the fact that, under <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/sewel-convention?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo4iyloKa5wIVx7HtCh2_XQHZEAAYASAAEgLlGfD_BwE\">the so-called Sewel convention</a>, the UK government is not supposed to legislate on matters covered by the devolved administrations without the devolved legislatures granting legislative consent. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act does contain provisions affecting devolved matters. Yet the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-51181641\">all recently voted to refuse it legislative consent.</a></p> <p>In the article 50 case the supreme court ruled that the Sewel convention was a political convention, and not one that could be enforced by law. The wording includes an opt-out - it says Westminster will \u201cnot <em>normally</em> legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent\u201d of the devolved legislatures - and there is precedent for Westminster passing legislation after one of the devolved administrations refused consent. The votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff cannot stop Brexit.</p> <p>But there is no precedent for a major piece of legislation being passed after all three devolved legislatures refused to grant it legislative consent.</p> <p>Blackford\u2019s reference to a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d may sound a touch hyperbolic. If there is a crisis, most MPs in London this afternoon don\u2019t seem to have noticed. But a crisis does not always have to be immediate, and Blackford is right to say that Brexit has unleashed forces that could have a profound impact on the union.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b0354dc852e0ff228256602a733c7b109a85a00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b0354dc852e0ff228256602a733c7b109a85a00/22_0_603_362/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Blackford.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Blackford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliament TV</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29b8008f0879d539efdaf4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T15:13:12.236Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the Brexit department</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DExEUgov/status/1220362856702599179\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Brexit Bill has been given Royal Assent.<br><br>Watch the moment Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans announced it in the Commons \u2b07\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/K9UQZIW8f1\">pic.twitter.com/K9UQZIW8f1</a></p>&mdash; Department for Exiting the EU (@DExEUgov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DExEUgov/status/1220362856702599179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29afaa8f0879d539efda94\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T14:57:34.168Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bercow says he should get peerage and criticises No 10 for not giving him one</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Bercow,</strong> the former Commons Speaker, has issued a fresh statement in response to the report that Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a formal complaint about him alleging bullying.

Even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues, he did not once complain to me and neither did any other official on his behalf.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the statement Bercow argues that he is entitled to a peerage, because it is conventional for retiring Speakers to go to the Lords, and he criticises No 10 for not giving him one. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Since retiring it has] become increasingly obvious that the government has no intention of honouring the centuries-old convention that a departing speaker is promptly elevated to the House of Lords.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the US view, widely supported by intelligence assessments, Huawei\u2019s accountability to political masters is so great that any network that the company builds is going to be in effect a portal for the Chinese government to spy on the activities of anyone using it. So the US has banned Huawei from doing business in the US and blocked American companies from working with it. But the larger struggle is unfolding over Huawei\u2019s business with other countries, in particular US allies.</p> <p>A senior American official told me that one of the Trump administration\u2019s main priorities for 2020 is to persuade countries around the world not to use Huawei in building their 5G networks. Critics say this is, in essence, a form of barely disguised protectionism, that the Huawei threat is overstated and that the US is simply trying to impede the commercial success of a rival Chinese company.</p> <p>To counter that criticism, officials told me, their ideal outcome would be a US-European joint venture that could produce networks just as well as Huawei. But for now that alternative does not exist.</p> <p>Britain, of course, is in America\u2019s sights, with Boris Johnson\u2019s government set to approve a contract with the Chinese company any day now. Last week there was an explosive meeting in London between senior American and British officials. A top US official said that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, \u201cerupted\u201d at a senior policymaker from the White House during a heated exchange over Huawei, as No 10 stood firm in defending its pending decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Baker says the key question is whether Washington would use talks on a UK-US trade deal to try to influence Britain\u2019s policy on Huawei. He quotes an adviser to President Trump as saying that the US is not planning to link the two issues \u201cat this point\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e29859e8f08e97ed2128c45\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T11:38:52.909Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A Welsh Conservative candidate accused of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been deselected by his party, PA Media reports.

He said the protocol was \u201cvery clear\u201d that the UK authorities would have to implement the checks and ensure that products going from GB to NI complied with the EU\u2019s single market standards for food and agrifood. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented.</p> </blockquote> <p>He warned that the next stage of negotiations would be tough and that there could be no sector by sector cherry-picking.

This was a foregone conclusion ever since <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>won the general election with a near-landslide majority and, in a curious paradox, the Brexit deal that paralysed parliament for more than two years, and brought down a PM, barely made the news as it finally got over its last parliamentary hurdle. In response, Johnson put out this statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill, meaning we will leave the EU on 31 January and move forwards as one United Kingdom.</p> <p>At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we\u2019ve done it.</p> <p>Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future \u2013 with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country.</p> </blockquote> <p>But \u2018crossing the finishing line\u2019 may be a tad optimistic, given that the government still has not resolved what its final trade relationship with the EU will look like, and last night a senior EU official used a speech in London to make this very point. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Stefaan De Rynck</strong>, the senior adviser to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said what came next would be \u201cmore complicated\u201d and that a \u201cdose of realism\u201d was needed. As Jack Blanchard reports <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/politico-london-playbook-getting-brexit-done-big-news-from-fleet-street-survival-guide-for-new-mps/\">in his London Playbook briefing </a>for Politico Europe, De Rynck said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There should be no misunderstanding of the fact that the next phase will be more complicated to negotiate than the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>The construction of the text for the withdrawal agreement wasn\u2019t always easy \u2014 but compared to the construction of the text for the future relationship agreement, we are talking about two different kinds of exercises.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has become law after it received royal assent from the Queen, having cleared all its stages in parliament. Shortly after this was announced Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told MPs that the country was facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d because the legislation had been passed despite devolved legislatures in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all voting to withhold consent for it. (See 3.37pm.) The government has hinted strongly that it will allow the Chinese firm Huawei some role in the UK\u2019s 5G mobile network, despite warnings from the US that doing so could compromise security. Sajid Javid has sought to reassure business that there will be no wholesale dumping of EU regulations as he pledged there would be no divergence after Brexit for the sake of it. John Bercow has accused Downing Street of trying to scupper his chances of being made a peer, and dismissed accusations of bullying made by his former most senior official. Richard Ratcliffe emerged from a 40-minute meeting with Boris Johnson in Downing Street admitting there had been no breakthrough in his efforts to persuade the government to do more to secure the release of his wife from a Tehran jail. The police watchdog is facing accusations that it is dragging its feet on a decision about whether to investigate Boris Johnson for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was London mayor. The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has implicitly criticised No 10\u2019s decision not to allow ministers to appear on the Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Downing Street has been refusing to put up ministers for interview on the programme in recent weeks, despite the fact that it is seen as one of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs programmes. No 10 has not given an official explanation for the boycott, but, as my Guardian colleague Rowena Mason reported this week, the tactic is one that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief policy adviser, first proposed around 15 years ago, when he was developing a strategy to sabotage the BBC, which he described as the \u201cmortal enemy\u201d of the Conservative party. Morgan was speaking in an interview for the Political Thinking podcast, hosted by Nick Robinson, a Today presenter. Asked if she was comfortable with the ban on ministers appearing on Today, she replied: My personal view is I think it\u2019s good to engage with all programmes on all channels. When Robinson told Morgan she would be welcome to appear on the programme if Cummings allowed that, she just laughed. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexiter leader of the Commons. But other Gibbon quotes are available. The great historian also said: History ... is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind. The European parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee has voted to recommend that MEPs should vote for the withdrawal agreement when they debate it on Wednesday afternoon next week. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has told Sky News that he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a trade deal in 2020 are just 50/50. In a short interview in Davos, when asked if he was confident about there being a deal this year, he replied: 50/50. Because a year is not very long, and if the UK is really not willing to ask for an extension, then we run a risk that we might get to a cliff edge again. By \u201ccliff edge\u201d, he means what would effectively be a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 (although a 2020 no deal would be different from a 2019 no deal, because the withdrawal agreement would be passed, which means the rights of EU nationals would be guaranteed, and the arrangement for Northern Ireland to remain effectively in the single market would be in place). This is from Sky\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway. Boris Johnson insists he is almost certain to get a trade deal, but the EU is more open about the risk of what it calls a \u201ccliff edge\u201d at the end of this year. It has recently published a whole series of briefing slides about the forthcoming trade talks, and this is from one set of slides (pdf) covering trade. Here is some niche research from a reader which might interest people following the Labour leadership contest. Shortly after the granting of royal assent to the Brexit bill was announced, the SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, used a point of order to say that the country was now facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d. He told MPs: Something quite momentous has taken place with this royal assent. This is absolutely unprecedented and I say to the house that this is a constitutional crisis. We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented, when the government in Edinburgh, in Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. And this completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament to become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations. I full respect that those that voted for the Conservative party in England have got what they wanted. But the fact remains that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that, if we stayed in the UK, our rights as EU citizens would be respected. And moreover we were told that we were to lead the United Kingdom, that this was a family of nations, our rights would be respected. And we find today that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored, and against the express wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum, and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored. Blackford was referring to the fact that, under the so-called Sewel convention, the UK government is not supposed to legislate on matters covered by the devolved administrations without the devolved legislatures granting legislative consent. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act does contain provisions affecting devolved matters. Yet the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly have all recently voted to refuse it legislative consent. In the article 50 case the supreme court ruled that the Sewel convention was a political convention, and not one that could be enforced by law. The wording includes an opt-out - it says Westminster will \u201cnot normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent\u201d of the devolved legislatures - and there is precedent for Westminster passing legislation after one of the devolved administrations refused consent. The votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff cannot stop Brexit. But there is no precedent for a major piece of legislation being passed after all three devolved legislatures refused to grant it legislative consent. Blackford\u2019s reference to a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d may sound a touch hyperbolic. If there is a crisis, most MPs in London this afternoon don\u2019t seem to have noticed. But a crisis does not always have to be immediate, and Blackford is right to say that Brexit has unleashed forces that could have a profound impact on the union. From the Brexit department John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has issued a fresh statement in response to the report that Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a formal complaint about him alleging bullying. (See 9.39am.) In it he categorically denies ever bullying anyone. He says: I have seen in the media that Lord Lisvane is formally complaining that I bullied staff. For the record, I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time. According to the Press Association, in the statement Bercow says Lisvane had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to raise concerns about Bercow\u2019s conduct with him and that Lisvane had \u201ca duty of care to all House staff\u201d. Therefore, he had not merely a right but a responsibility to act if he thought that he witnessed misconduct. The simple fact is that he did not at any time do so. Even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues, he did not once complain to me and neither did any other official on his behalf. In the statement Bercow argues that he is entitled to a peerage, because it is conventional for retiring Speakers to go to the Lords, and he criticises No 10 for not giving him one. He says: [Since retiring it has] become increasingly obvious that the government has no intention of honouring the centuries-old convention that a departing speaker is promptly elevated to the House of Lords. Indeed, it has been suggested to me that the government actively seeks to block any other attempt to nominate me for membership of the upper House. The Brexit bill has received royal assent. It is now an act of parliament, the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons (and arch-Brexiter), announced it on Twitter. And here are the latest nomination tallies for the Labour leadership posted by @CLPNominations. This tables, showing nominations by affiliates, is not up to date, because it does not include Chinese for Labour nominating Lisa Nandy. That means that she and Sir Keir Starmer are both now guaranteed a place on the final ballot. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has released a video message backing his fellow leftwinger Richard Burgon for the Labour deputy leadership. McDonnell is also urging constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to nominate Burgon. There are five candidates still in the contest for deputy leader but, as in the contest for the leadership, candidates will only make it onto the final ballot if they can get nominations from either 33 CLPs (5% of the total), or three affiliates (unions or socialist societies), comprising at least 5% of the affiliates vote. At the moment Burgon is struggling, but if he were to get nominated by Unite or CWU (the two big unions yet to decide), he would be close to guaranteeing his place on the ballot. Here are recent nomination tallies for the deputy leadership from @CLPNominations, a reliable guide. Angela Rayner is the only candidate so far guaranteed a place on the final ballot. The likely battle lines between SNP and Scotish Tories in advance of next year\u2019s Holyrood election are becoming clearer every week. At this lunchtime\u2019s FMQs (first minister\u2019s questions), interim Tory leader Jackson Carlaw - who launched his leadership campaign last week with proposals to reverse SNP tax rises for high earners - raised a pretty shocking story that was highlighted by the Courier this morning: the roof of a police station in Broughty Ferry collapsing just hours after the justice secretary dismissed concerns about the crumbling police estate as \u201chyperbole\u201d. Carlaw condemned \u201cyears of missed opportunities from a distracted government\u201d, noting that the FM would be returning to \u201cher favourite topic\u201d next week when she has promised to update parliament on her next steps after Boris Johnson ruled out granting her the legal powers to hold a second independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, shot back that it was Carlaw himself who was planning to strip public services, quoting an analysis of his tax proposals which she said proved they would \u201ctake \u00a3270m out of public services and give it back to the richest\u201d. With the Scottish draft budget due on February 6, we can expect plenty more of this. Emily Thornberry has also tweeted a message of support to her fellow Labour leadership candidate Keir Starmer. (See 1.19pm.) Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister, came up with a particularly unflattering description of himself in his maiden speech in the House of Lords a few minutes ago, Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti reports. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has been forced to cancel campaign events as his mother-in-law is critically ill in hospital. A spokesman for Starmer said: Following an accident, Keir Starmer\u2019s mother-in-law is critically ill and has been admitted to hospital in intensive care. In order to support his family at this difficult time, Keir will be cancelling all campaign events today and tomorrow. We ask that his family\u2019s privacy is respected at this time. In response, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Starmer\u2019s main rival in the contest, posted this on Twitter. The police watchdog is facing accusations that it is dragging its feet on a decision about whether to investigate Boris Johnson for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was London mayor, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is speaking at a CBI lunch in Davos. He has just sought to reassure business that the UK won\u2019t abandon all EU regulations after Brexit, saying: We won\u2019t diverge just for the sake of it. There is full coverage of the speech on my colleague Graeme Wearden\u2019s Davos live blog. From Bloomberg\u2019s Ian Wishart Ratcliffe says the recent weeks, since the killing of Qassem Suleimani, have been terrifying. Q: Did Johnson apologise for his own comments about Nazanin (about her being in Iran to teach journalism - a false statement that was used by Iran to justify her ongoing detention.) Ratcliffe says they did not talk about the past. But he says he was satisfied that Johnson was committed to getting this case resolved. He says he presented Johnson with a wallet made by Nazanin in prison. He says Johnson offered five-year-old Gabriella apple juice. And she was given a toy cat. During the meeting, she did some colouring, he says. Richard Ratcliffe is speaking to journalists now after his meeting with Boris Johnson. He says he did not come away thinking that his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, will be released very soon. He says he still thinks the government should be tougher on Iran. But it was a gracious visit, he says. Q: How could the government be tougher? He says in his opinion Nazanin is being held hostage by Iran. He says he spoke to Johnson about Magnitsky-style sanctions on Iran. He says after the UK leaves the EU it would be easier to impose those. He says hostage taking should not be allowed. That should be a universal value that should be upheld. He says it is important for their to be progress in the court case. (See 11.12am.) But he was told the government was doing all it could, he says. Richard Ratcliffe has arrived at Downing Street for his talks with Boris Johnson about his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is detained in Iran. (See 11.12am.) He has brought their daughter, Gabriella, and his own mother Barbara (to help look after Gabriella if she gets distracted during the meeting, he explained on the Today programme this morning). Turning back to Huawei, Gerard Baker has an interesting column on this topic here in the Times (paywall) today. Here\u2019s an extract. In the US view, widely supported by intelligence assessments, Huawei\u2019s accountability to political masters is so great that any network that the company builds is going to be in effect a portal for the Chinese government to spy on the activities of anyone using it. So the US has banned Huawei from doing business in the US and blocked American companies from working with it. But the larger struggle is unfolding over Huawei\u2019s business with other countries, in particular US allies. A senior American official told me that one of the Trump administration\u2019s main priorities for 2020 is to persuade countries around the world not to use Huawei in building their 5G networks. Critics say this is, in essence, a form of barely disguised protectionism, that the Huawei threat is overstated and that the US is simply trying to impede the commercial success of a rival Chinese company. To counter that criticism, officials told me, their ideal outcome would be a US-European joint venture that could produce networks just as well as Huawei. But for now that alternative does not exist. Britain, of course, is in America\u2019s sights, with Boris Johnson\u2019s government set to approve a contract with the Chinese company any day now. Last week there was an explosive meeting in London between senior American and British officials. A top US official said that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, \u201cerupted\u201d at a senior policymaker from the White House during a heated exchange over Huawei, as No 10 stood firm in defending its pending decision. Baker says the key question is whether Washington would use talks on a UK-US trade deal to try to influence Britain\u2019s policy on Huawei. He quotes an adviser to President Trump as saying that the US is not planning to link the two issues \u201cat this point\u201d. A Welsh Conservative candidate accused of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been deselected by his party, PA Media reports. Ross England was giving evidence as a witness in the trial of a male friend when it was halted after he referred to the female victim\u2019s previous sexual history against the directions of the judge. Today the Conservative party said England\u2019s nomination to contest the Vale of Glamorgan seat in the 2021 Welsh assembly election had been withdrawn. The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, fresh figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high, my colleague Jamie Grierson reports. Sharon Hodgson, the shadow health secretary, is responding to Matt Hancock\u2019s statement. She has some questions. Will flights from other Chinese cities be monitored? What advice is being given to other people flying to China? Are contingency plans in place in case the disease does reach the UK? Hancock is replying now. He says it is important to get enhanced monitoring right. He says symptoms from coronavirus take five to seven days to appear, and can take up to 14 days. So monitoring people on aircraft is of limited value, he suggests. But he says there will be no further flights out of Wuhan anyway. In the Commons Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a statement about the coronavirus outbreak. He says there have been 571 cases, and 17 reported fatalities. Most cases of this new virus have been non-fatal, he says. But some cases have been fatal. There are no cases of this new infection in the UK so far, he says. He says the government is closely monitoring the situation. Since yesterday health officials have been monitoring people on flights from Wuhan. And people on flights from China are receiving information about this, he says. He says the chief medical officer has changed the risk level to the UK from very low to low. But the UK is prepared to deal with any outbreak, he says. He says travel advice has been updated, and the government is now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan. In her Sky News interview this morning Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, hinted that the government is minded to allow the Chinese firm Huawei to play a role in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G network. The US government has been strongly urging London not to use Huawei, claiming that it poses a security risk and threatening to limit intelligence cooperation if Huawei does get the go-ahead. Leadsom said the government would take a decision on this soon. But, as Reuters reports, she highlighted difficulties with not using Huawei. She said: There are other providers but they are limited. Ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon. It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing. But she also said she shared concerns about protecting national security. Speaking ahead of his meeting with Boris Johnson later, Richard Ratcliffe said that he hoped the PM would \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for the detention of his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran. Ratcliffe told the Today programme: [Johnson] needs to take responsibility for Nazanin\u2019s case, for upholding the promise he made to us to leave no stone unturned. Ratcliffe also urged Johnson to be \u201cbrave\u201d in resolving a long-running trade dispute with Iran over the settlement of a \u00a3400m debt. He said: Nazanin was told way back in 2016 she was being held over it. It has long been in the shadows of our case. [Johnson\u2019s] obligation is to protect British citizens. He needs to be brave in doing positive gestures in relation to the debt and other issues that will calm relations down, but also being brave in calling out Iran on hostage-taking. It is not an acceptable way to conduct diplomacy. My colleague Patrick Wintour has more on this in his overnight story previewing the meeting. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has launched a hunt for someone to replace longstanding Office for Budget Responsibility chairman Robert Chote when his term at the fiscal watchdog comes to an end in October. As PA Media reports, Chote has headed up the independent economic forecaster since it was launched in 2010, having served the maximum two five-year terms. The chancellor said Chote had led the OBR with \u201cintelligence, independence and integrity\u201d. In a statement Javid said: Finding the right candidate to lead the OBR and build on the significant progress of the last 10 years is vital for maintaining the credibility of the UK\u2019s fiscal framework and our status as a world leader in fiscal transparency. I look forward to working with Robert Chote to deliver my budget on March 11 before he finishes his second term as chair. The Treasury said the recruitment process would look at the \u201cbroadest possible pool of applicants\u201d and is open to applications until 20 February. Michel Barner\u2019s senior adviser Stefaan De Rynck has warned that the EU will not tolerate any \u201cbacksliding\u201d on the commitment to introduce checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea as part of the controversial Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. At an event at University College London last night, De Rynck was clear that checks were part of the Northern Ireland protocol and warned that if the deal was not complied with there could be sanctions. We will not tolerate any backsliding or half measures on this. It is clear what needs to be done by both sides. His remarks put him at odds with Boris Johnson, who on Wednesday gave yet another assurance to the DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, that there would be no checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to GB or from GB to Northern Ireland under the deal. De Rynck refused to comment on what Johnson said, but confirmed checks were part of the special NI arrangements. He said the protocol was \u201cvery clear\u201d that the UK authorities would have to implement the checks and ensure that products going from GB to NI complied with the EU\u2019s single market standards for food and agrifood. He said: There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented. He warned that the next stage of negotiations would be tough and that there could be no sector by sector cherry-picking. And he said it needed to be better understood in British media that a zero-tariff and zero-quota offer to the single market was a big offer to the UK. That is a pretty generous offer for the EU to consider. Because this is a market of 450m people at the doorstep of the UK. In terms of some of the stories I read this morning in the media, I think we need to stress that this is not something that any other country has, across the board zero tariffs, zero quota access to the market. Touching on recent comments by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, that the UK would not be seeking alignment with the EU on trade rules, De Rynck warned there were \u201cconsequences\u201d for that. Asked if the EU would agree to a \u201csalami slice\u201d deal involving a \u201cbare bones\u201d pact on trade by the end of the year with other issues to follow in the months and years beyond, De Rynck quipped: I prefer \u2026 this kind of pasta where everything is integrated as a main course. An over-arching institutional framework with linked chapters and agreements is certainly part of the political declaration and certainly one the UK has also agreed to. We will want now to see how that pans out in practice. This is from my colleague John Crace on Liz Truss\u2019s comments about trade and the US. Here is the full reply from Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, when she was asked in the Commons a few minutes ago by the Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds if the government would back down in the face of American pressure over its plans for a digital services tax. (See 9.55am.) She told him: Let me be absolutely clear. UK tax policy is a matter for the UK chancellor. It\u2019s not a matter for the US, it\u2019s not a matter for the EU, it\u2019s not a matter for anybody else, and we will make the decisions that are right for Britain, whether it is on our regulatory standards, whether it\u2019s on our tax policy, or whether it is on anything else. In the Commons Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is taking questions. She has just suggested that the government will not back down over its plans for a digital services tax despite opposition from Washington, which is worried about the impact on US tech giants. This is from Politico\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. Truss\u2019s comments reflect what Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said at Davos yesterday, although her tone was more confrontational than his. She was effectively telling the US not to interfere. Yesterday the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the US might respond with retaliatory tariffs if the UK went ahead with the digital sales tax. The shadow Treasury minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said he found her comment interesting. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, was giving interviews this morning to promote the announcement that the government is ensuring that parents who suffer the loss of a child under the age of 18 will be entitled to two weeks of statutory paid leave from work. Our story on the announcement is here. According to the Times (paywall), Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a complaint to the parliamentary commissioner standards about alleged bullying by John Bercow when he was Speaker. Other officials have complained about Bercow\u2019s treatment of staff in the past, but Lisvane is the most senior official to have submitted a formal complaint, the paper says. In a statement to the Times Bercow, who has repeatedly denied claims that he bullied officials, said: During the five years that we worked together, Lord Lisvane had ample opportunity to raise any accusations of bullying with me. At no stage did he do so, even though he became clerk of the House - the most senior official. The timing of this intervention is curious. The last sentence is a reference to reports that Bercow is being nominated for a peerage. It is normal for a former Speaker to be offered a peerage, but there have been reports that Bercow\u2019s nomination for one comes from Jeremy Corbyn, in the dissolution honours list, because Boris Johnson is reluctant to make the nomination himself. In an interview on Sky News this morning the business secretary Andrea Leadsom, who had an acrimonious relationship with Bercow herself when she was leader of the Commons (she says he once called her a \u201cstupid woman\u201d in the chamber), suggested that a bullying complaint could stop Bercow getting a peerage. She said: In the event that there are genuine, upheld complaints about any persons that should have an impact on whether they are found suitable for the House of Lords. In Davos Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, has said Washington expects to conclude a trade deal with the UK by the end of this year, Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, reports. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his Davos live blog. He will be covering Sajid Javid, the chancellor, who will be giving a speech at the conference at lunchtime. There will be an oral statement in the Commons after 10.30am from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on the coronavirus crisis. Yesterday the government\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, the legislation that will take the UK out of the EU next week, cleared parliament. This was a foregone conclusion ever since Boris Johnson won the general election with a near-landslide majority and, in a curious paradox, the Brexit deal that paralysed parliament for more than two years, and brought down a PM, barely made the news as it finally got over its last parliamentary hurdle. In response, Johnson put out this statement: Parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill, meaning we will leave the EU on 31 January and move forwards as one United Kingdom. At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we\u2019ve done it. Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future \u2013 with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country. But \u2018crossing the finishing line\u2019 may be a tad optimistic, given that the government still has not resolved what its final trade relationship with the EU will look like, and last night a senior EU official used a speech in London to make this very point. Stefaan De Rynck, the senior adviser to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said what came next would be \u201cmore complicated\u201d and that a \u201cdose of realism\u201d was needed. As Jack Blanchard reports in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, De Rynck said: There should be no misunderstanding of the fact that the next phase will be more complicated to negotiate than the withdrawal agreement. The construction of the text for the withdrawal agreement wasn\u2019t always easy \u2014 but compared to the construction of the text for the future relationship agreement, we are talking about two different kinds of exercises. The limitation of time must lead to some dose of realism on what can be achieved. I will be filing more on De Rynck\u2019s speech shortly. We will hear more on Brexit in the Commons later, because Liz Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg are both taking questions. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions in the Commons on next week\u2019s business. Lunchtime: Boris Johnson meets Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, in Downing Street. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The vice-chair of the Manchester United Supporters\u2019 Trust, Ian Stirling, began the \u2018green and gold\u2019 protest against the ownership of the Glazers a decade ago, where United fans carried scarves in the colours of United\u2019s 19th-century precursor Newton Heath to show their discontent at the Americans.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United have given Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r their unequivocal backing after the dismal home defeat by Burnley that prompted calls for change at the club. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team have lost eight times in the Premier League this season and are 30 points behind the leaders, Liverpool, who have two games in hand. But United have no intention of sacking Solskj\u00e6r and will allow him more time to improve and rebuild the team, who are fifth in the table. Most of the fans\u2019 anger at Old Trafford during the game against Burnley, who won there for the first time since 1962, was aimed at the club\u2019s owners, the Glazer family, and the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward. The vice-chair of the Manchester United Supporters\u2019 Trust, Ian Stirling, began the \u2018green and gold\u2019 protest against the ownership of the Glazers a decade ago, where United fans carried scarves in the colours of United\u2019s 19th-century precursor Newton Heath to show their discontent at the Americans. He said dissatisfaction is now coupled with a specific concern about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s plain to see we need investment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we also need an investment strategy. Buying big names like Paul Pogba hasn\u2019t worked. Woodward has said he is happy with the structure, with the scouting network and the recruitment data. Players have to have been identified but where are they? \u201cSupporters are willing to give the club time but it\u2019s how that strategy is demonstrated.

Sweden\u2019s supreme court ruled on Thursday that hunting rights lost in 1993 should be restored to Girjas Sameby, a Sami \u201cvillage\u201d or \u201cdistrict\u201d whose herders graze reindeer over a 19-mile (30km) strip of land stretching from the Norwegian border towards the Baltic Sea. \u201cThis is a historic victory that strengthens our rights over our traditional lands,\u201d Matti Blind-Berg, the district\u2019s chairman, told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a blow for the Swedish state, which will hopefully mean they have to respect Sami rights.\u201d The Sami, who speak a group of languages related to Finnish, have herded reindeer across northern Scandinavia and on Russia\u2019s Kola peninsula for thousands of years. The five judges ruled unanimously that rights stemming from the Sami\u2019s historical use of the territory superseded more recent rights granted by the Swedish state and its agencies. \u201cThe supreme court determines that Girjas Sami district has the sole right to decide on small game hunting and fishing in this area,\u201d Sten Andersson, one of the judges said. The 10-year court case was marred by anger over government lawyers\u2019 use of the word \u201cLapp\u201d \u2013 which many Sami consider offensive and colonialist \u2013 in the district and high courts. The ethnic group has suffered discrimination by the Swedish state, with the Institute for Race Biology from 1922 carrying out humiliating physical examinations of S\u00e1mi men, women and children, and Sami children in the 1930s forcibly taken from the parents, sent to boarding schools and banned from speaking their languages. Girjas Sameby began its legal action against the Swedish state in 2009, six years after a new hunting law gave individual landowners the right to decide on small game hunting and fishing rights on their properties, leading to a significant increase in hunting across the territory. \u201cThis became a massive threat to reindeer husbandry. Hunting and fishing became a disturbing and damagaing factor,\u201d Peter Danowsky, the lawyer who has represented the district since it began preparing the case in 2007, told the Guardian. The district won its case in G\u00e4llivare district and high courts, only for the Swedish state to appeal each time. In its final ruling, the supreme court cited historical evidence showing that by the middle of the 18th century individual S\u00e1mis had established exclusive rights over small game hunting and fishing in their territories. \u201cOur investigation shows that the Swedish crown, when it began to encourage the colonisation of Lapland, was careful to safeguard the Samis\u2019 opportunities for hunting and fishing,\u201d the judges wrote in the judgment. \u201cAnd the hunting and fishing rights that the Sami in the area had at the time of the 1886 law and the following reindeer grazing laws have been transferred to members of the Sami district today.\u201d Danowsky said the ruling extended the legal concept of \u201cprescription from time immemorial\u201d, setting a precedent for other cases in Sweden and internationally. It was the first time that the concept, which bestows a right to property or land use through historical precedent, had been applied in Sweden, he said, \u201cregardless of the fact that the area of land is very vast and the population is very sparse\u201d. \u201cThe fact that the court recognises this right, which is a kind of property right \u2026 is significant, it\u2019s new.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration has completed its rollback of environmental protections for streams, wetland and other bodies of water, a process that has stripped pollution safeguards from drinking water sources used by around a third of all Americans. Clean water protections strengthened under the Obama administration have long been targeted by Donald Trump, who has called it a \u201cvery destructive and horrible rule\u201d. Trump has been backed by ranchers, farming groups and golf course operators, who claim the so-called \u201cWater of the United States\u201d (Wotus) rule impinged upon landowners\u2019 rights. The Obama-era water rule was repealed last year and on Thursday the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a weakened replacement that removes millions of miles of streams and around half of America\u2019s wetlands from federal oversight, potentially allowing pesticides and other pollutants to be dumped into them without penalty. The move has dismayed former EPA staff who worked on the expansion of protections to ephemeral streams that supply drinking water to an estimated 117 million people in the US. \u201cThe new rule is scientifically indefensible and socially unjust,\u201d said Betsy Southerland, who was scientific director of the EPA\u2019s office of water for three decades before departing in 2017. \u201cThis EPA\u2019s Wotus definition, which will limit federal water quality protections to a very small set of waters and wetlands, will result in the impairment of drinking water, fisheries and flood control for communities throughout the US.\u201d The Trump administration had promised the demise of the water rule to industry groups that lobbied against what they saw as costly federal overreach. \u201cThis new rule will provide much-needed clarity and regulatory certainty for companies that site and build infrastructure that delivers essential energy to America\u2019s communities,\u201d said Karen Harbert, chief executive of the American Gas Association. But opponents of the repeal point out that the replacement regime not only scraps the Obama-era rule but also reverses protections reaching back to the 1972 Clean Water Act, such as requirements that landowners seek permits that the EPA considers on a case-by-case basis. The new, far narrower, definition of water protections will maintain safeguards for major rivers such as the Mississippi River and the Colorado River but not short-lived streams that feed into them after it rains or snow melts. About 60% of streams in the US are dry for part of the year but then connect to large rivers following rainfall. Wetlands not situated next to large rivers will also be excluded from protections. People living in the western US are set to be particularly affected by the new rule, with ephemeral streams making up around 89% of Nevada\u2019s stream miles and 94% of Arizona\u2019s, for example. Environmental groups warn that as many as 75 endangered species dependent on temporary streams will be imperilled by the move, while any degradation of wetlands would also harm wildlife and worsen the climate crisis by lessening their ability to store carbon. Trump told the World Economic Forum at Davos this week that the US has \u201camong the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth\u201d, despite widespread contamination with chemicals such as PFAS and neurotoxins such as lead in Americans\u2019 water. The Trump administration has dismantled about 100 environmental rules while in office, including the reversal of a ban on mining companies dumping their waste into rivers. \u201cThe \u2018dirty water rule\u2019 will put clean drinking water for tens of millions of people at risk, especially the low-income communities and communities of colour already disproportionately impacted by polluted water,\u201d said Madeleine Foote, deputy legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cClean, safe drinking water is a basic human right and we should be doing more to protect our water resources, not less,\u201d she added.

      "body": "<p>The 2020<strong> </strong>Grammys <em>almost</em> made it over the finish line without controversy. The nominees for this Sunday\u2019s ceremony boasted unprecedented gender equality. With Lizzo, Lil Nas X and HER among the most garlanded nominees, it would be untarnished by the #GrammysSoWhite criticisms of recent years. The Recording Academy was set to stride confidently into its new future, having publicly addressed its longstanding issues around representation. Two years ago, CEO Neil Portnow said women should \u201cstep up\u201d if they wanted recognition: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up\" title=\"\">resulting outcry</a> led him to step down, and he was replaced by Deborah Dugan. Michelle Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, Tina Tchen, led a taskforce on diversity and inclusion. In December, it published <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/deborah-dugan-grammy-voting-reform-recording-academys-boys-club/\" title=\"\">18 recommendations</a>; the academy promised to implement all but one.</p> <p>Here was a rare music industry model of accountability and reform \u2013 until last weekend. After the academy fired Dugan, citing allegations of misconduct including bullying, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/22/suspended-grammys-chief-deborah-dugan-alleges-sexual-misconduct-in-recording-academy\" title=\"\">filed a 44-page discrimination complaint</a> alleging that she had been sexually harassed by an academy lawyer and a former trustee. She said that Portnow faces a rape allegation, alleged corruption and racial discrimination, and stated that such behaviour was made possible by the academy\u2019s \u201c\u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019 mentality and approach to governance\u201d. Portnow denies the claims; the academy said Dugan \u201cnever raised these grave allegations\u201d during her five-month tenure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c88f5dd80db430603e365c7839529b82199576ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c88f5dd80db430603e365c7839529b82199576ee/1116_101_1498_1498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Dugan, the former Grammys CEO.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Dugan, the former Grammys CEO.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Sussman/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dugan\u2019s specific allegations aside, her comments regarding the culture inside the academy offer a (rarely required) reminder that the music industry is more concerned with flattering optics than systemic change. Women may dominate this year\u2019s four main Grammys categories, but gender parity in awards season only swabs at the festering wound of inequality.</p> <p>This week, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative published its third annual <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shesaid.so/inclusion-in-the-recording-studio-1a289cdb8393\" title=\"\">\u201cInclusion in the recording studio?\u201d</a> report examining the gender and ethnicity of creators across 800 US singles chart hits from 2012 to 2019. Across those eight years, just 21.7% of artists were women. Women fared worse behind the scenes: just 14.4% of 2019\u2019s leading songwriters were female. Of the 800 songs analysed, 56.4% did not feature one female songwriter. Only 2.6% of producers were women. Study leader Dr Stacey L Smith said the music industry had \u201cvirtually erased female producers, particularly women of colour, from the popular charts\u201d.</p> <p>Should it bear repeating, it is not that female musicians, songwriters and producers are less talented \u2013 creativity and technical prowess are not gendered attributes \u2013 but that there are evidently cliffs where opportunity withers and ambitions are stonewalled. In this climate, it was almost refreshing to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/11/this-years-male-dominated-brit-awards-have-an-issue-with-women\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/11/this-years-male-dominated-brit-awards-have-an-issue-with-women\" title=\"\">forthcoming 40th Brit awards\u2019 brazen disregard for female British musicians</a>: out of 25 possible nominations across mixed-gender categories, only one went to a woman, Mabel, and one to Sam Smith, who is non-binary. It offered zero pretence about the fact that male musicians are today\u2019s beneficiaries of British music industry largesse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"921bf4d0cf756cf0ad323b0ea723840f2332d909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/921bf4d0cf756cf0ad323b0ea723840f2332d909/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mabel, the only woman to be nominated in categories where both men and women are eligible.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mabel, the only woman to be nominated in categories where both men and women are eligible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Brits experienced its own public reckoning after the #BritsSoWhite controversy of 2016 when it failed to nominate any black artists. In response, it diversified its voting committee.

      "bodyText": "The 2020 Grammys almost made it over the finish line without controversy. The nominees for this Sunday\u2019s ceremony boasted unprecedented gender equality. With Lizzo, Lil Nas X and HER among the most garlanded nominees, it would be untarnished by the #GrammysSoWhite criticisms of recent years. The Recording Academy was set to stride confidently into its new future, having publicly addressed its longstanding issues around representation. Two years ago, CEO Neil Portnow said women should \u201cstep up\u201d if they wanted recognition: the resulting outcry led him to step down, and he was replaced by Deborah Dugan. Michelle Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, Tina Tchen, led a taskforce on diversity and inclusion. In December, it published 18 recommendations; the academy promised to implement all but one. Here was a rare music industry model of accountability and reform \u2013 until last weekend. After the academy fired Dugan, citing allegations of misconduct including bullying, she filed a 44-page discrimination complaint alleging that she had been sexually harassed by an academy lawyer and a former trustee. She said that Portnow faces a rape allegation, alleged corruption and racial discrimination, and stated that such behaviour was made possible by the academy\u2019s \u201c\u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019 mentality and approach to governance\u201d. Portnow denies the claims; the academy said Dugan \u201cnever raised these grave allegations\u201d during her five-month tenure. Dugan\u2019s specific allegations aside, her comments regarding the culture inside the academy offer a (rarely required) reminder that the music industry is more concerned with flattering optics than systemic change. Women may dominate this year\u2019s four main Grammys categories, but gender parity in awards season only swabs at the festering wound of inequality. This week, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative published its third annual \u201cInclusion in the recording studio?\u201d report examining the gender and ethnicity of creators across 800 US singles chart hits from 2012 to 2019. Across those eight years, just 21.7% of artists were women. Women fared worse behind the scenes: just 14.4% of 2019\u2019s leading songwriters were female. Of the 800 songs analysed, 56.4% did not feature one female songwriter. Only 2.6% of producers were women. Study leader Dr Stacey L Smith said the music industry had \u201cvirtually erased female producers, particularly women of colour, from the popular charts\u201d. Should it bear repeating, it is not that female musicians, songwriters and producers are less talented \u2013 creativity and technical prowess are not gendered attributes \u2013 but that there are evidently cliffs where opportunity withers and ambitions are stonewalled. In this climate, it was almost refreshing to see the forthcoming 40th Brit awards\u2019 brazen disregard for female British musicians: out of 25 possible nominations across mixed-gender categories, only one went to a woman, Mabel, and one to Sam Smith, who is non-binary. It offered zero pretence about the fact that male musicians are today\u2019s beneficiaries of British music industry largesse. The Brits experienced its own public reckoning after the #BritsSoWhite controversy of 2016 when it failed to nominate any black artists. In response, it diversified its voting committee. This year, its 1,445 members comprise 49% female and 24.5% BAME voters, to clear results in one field: half of this year\u2019s nominees are artists of colour. While the refreshed voting board will have helped, this recognition is also inevitable given the recent dominance of British rap \u2013 a diverse, largely independent creative force that has become a commercial giant. Because Brits eligibility doesn\u2019t just depend on artists releasing music during the previous 12 months, but Top 40 success. This disadvantages female performers, who are being signed and promoted at an inferior rate: as industry reporter Rhian Jones identifies in her assessment of this year\u2019s Brits, 2019 analysis by former Basca CEO Vick Bain of UK labels\u2019 public-facing rosters found that fewer than 20% of actively promoted current signings were women.

For views stretching across the brilliant blue sea, visit the Upper Barrakka Gardens \u2013 from here you can take a panoramic lift down to the water\u2019s edge. It\u2019s possible to take a ferry or a traditional boat across the harbour to the smaller Three Cities, which predate Valletta, and are likewise full of beautiful mansions, narrow golden-stone laneways, and packed with sights, from mighty forts to the recently added hands-on <a href=\"http://esplora.org.mt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Esplora</a> science museum and planetarium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf44e6e0e8a7d55b33b2185fed2c6cf2c4014a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf44e6e0e8a7d55b33b2185fed2c6cf2c4014a6/0_174_5912_3547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Take a lift down to the sea from the Upper Barrakka Gardens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a lift down to the sea from the Upper Barrakka Gardens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malta</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The architect Renzo Piano added a new architectural dimension to Valletta when he designed its striking modernist parliament building, city gateway and opera house, where there are regular concerts in what is now an open-air amphitheatre.</p> <p>This dazzling 21st-century architecture is more than matched by the city\u2019s baroque masterpieces.

      "bodyText": "Tall baroque townhouses line narrow, stepped cobbled streets, and views sweep across saturated-blue Mediterranean Sea under periwinkle skies. The Maltese capital Valletta is a rarity, a great city that\u2019s walkable, packed with amazing sights, sunny squares and vibrant street life, all just three hours from the UK by plane. As Malta is an English-speaking country as well as Maltese, you can move through Valletta without facing a language barrier. And with 320 historical sites, the city is dripping in culture \u2013 no wonder it\u2019s a Unesco world heritage site. Sleep in style Valletta has a profusion of lovely boutique hotels, housed in the city\u2019s grand mansions, where terraces and rooftop pools make the most of the glorious views. Choose from historical townhouses, such as Casa Ellul, where rooms have freestanding bathtubs in the glass-covered balconies, or Palazzo Consiglia and Palazzo Prince d\u2019Orange, both in former aristocratic houses and each with underground spas. A city of treasures The Knights of Malta built Valletta as their capital after their victory against the Ottoman Turks following the siege of Malta in 1565. It occupies a narrow peninsula of land, and the knights\u2019 city has remained remarkably preserved. The capital has retained its historic shopfronts and its heritage, yet had a huge makeover in the run-up to its year as European capital of culture in 2018, which saw museums added, restaurants and bars open, and new life breathed into this always beautiful city. Valletta overlooks the huge loop of Malta\u2019s Grand Harbour, which bobs with boats and yachts, and is ringed by forts, fine-art-filled churches and great museums. For views stretching across the brilliant blue sea, visit the Upper Barrakka Gardens \u2013 from here you can take a panoramic lift down to the water\u2019s edge. It\u2019s possible to take a ferry or a traditional boat across the harbour to the smaller Three Cities, which predate Valletta, and are likewise full of beautiful mansions, narrow golden-stone laneways, and packed with sights, from mighty forts to the recently added hands-on Esplora science museum and planetarium. The architect Renzo Piano added a new architectural dimension to Valletta when he designed its striking modernist parliament building, city gateway and opera house, where there are regular concerts in what is now an open-air amphitheatre. This dazzling 21st-century architecture is more than matched by the city\u2019s baroque masterpieces. The city centres on the 16th-century St John\u2019s Co-Cathedral, whose interior is a lavish symphony of gold and intense decoration, and houses the largest painting completed by Caravaggio \u2013 the only work the artist ever signed. Also extraordinary is the Grand Master\u2019s Palace (Republic Street), the historic meeting place for parliament, where you can wander through its dizzyingly grandiose state rooms, the walls hung with sumptuous tapestries and lined by suits of armour. Geek out on history Valletta\u2019s National War Musuem occupies the imposing Fort Saint Elmo, with superb audio-visual exhibits illustrating the islands\u2019 warlike past. Not only was there the epic 16th-century siege, but also the second world war, when such was the islanders\u2019 heroism that the entire population received the George Cross for bravery. Valletta\u2019s National Museum of Archaeology is equally fascinating, showing artefacts found at the island\u2019s prehistoric sites, huge, mysterious structures that predate the Egyptian pyramids. One of the most extraordinary of these is an easy trip from Valletta, the underground \u0126al Saflieni Hypogeum, seemingly a temple dating to at least 3,300 BC, so well preserved that you can still see traces of prehistoric paint. Eat and drink like the locals Malta is not only a cultural powerhouse, but a foodie one too, and this year Michelin has added it to its list of restaurant guides for the first time. You won\u2019t find chain restaurants and identikit places in Valletta, but venues full of charm, history and character. Choices range from fine dining to earthy trattorias. Much-loved local favourites include characterful Rubino, a landmark in the city, dating to 1906, with Maltese dishes such as stuffed sea bass, and Guz\u00e9 Bistro. The latter, in a 16th-century townhouse, serves creative dishes using seasonal local ingredients, such as Gozitan sheep\u2019s cheese with pomegranate and honey. Eat on the bastions of the city at Rampila, or overlooking the sea at the chic converted warehouse The Harbour Club. Valletta\u2019s nightlife has also undergone a renaissance, including in Strait Street, once the red-light district, which was frequented by the many sailors who passed through the busy port. So narrow that you could almost reach across between houses for a handshake, it\u2019s retained its vintage signage, but now has a line of quirky, atmospheric bars, such as Yard 32, with its wide selection of gin and tapas. Other bars are dotted across the city, some with harbour views, such as the charming Bridge Bar (East Street), best on Friday nights, when seating is a cushion on the harbourside steps, and a jazz band plays on the bridge. A city break here is guaranteed to be full of happenstance and contented wandering, and its balmy climate almost guarantees blue skies, with more than 300 days of sunlight a year. Don\u2019t miss out: choose Valletta for your next city break, the unsung hero of Europe. With more 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta offers more to explore",

      "bodyText": "Written about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R&amp;R, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK. Day one: soak up Valletta Start to unwind in Valletta, Malta\u2019s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the sights of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world\u2019s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun. Day two: more spas, speedboats and the \u2018silent city\u2019 Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath. Once you\u2019ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it\u2019s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort &amp; Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellie\u0127a, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices. A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta\u2019s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil \u201csilent city\u201d of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away. Days three and four: go Zen in Gozo On your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it \u201cpomskizillious\u201d and \u201cgromophiberous\u201d. Gozo\u2019s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island\u2019s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable \u201cfarmhouses\u201d with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines. Gozo\u2019s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools. A longer rest If two days isn\u2019t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola\u2019s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo\u2019s coastal salt pans, and the vast \u0120gantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. It\u2019s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged \u2013 there\u2019s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.

Peers voted for commitments on allowing child refugees to come to the UK and for EU citizens to get physical proof of their settled status, but MPs overturned the changes.

Yada yada yada, went Johnson: \u201cI refer the right honourable gentleman to the answer that the British people gave to him four weeks ago.\u201d Pre-election, he was more cautious.

The frightening question is whether most voters don\u2019t much care about everything that makes Labour party members of every faction keep on keeping on. Championing the underdog is in Labour\u2019s DNA. The party itself is mostly middle class \u2013 even if they deny it \u2013 and inspired to do good for others, not themselves. That is a very different proposition from Labour\u2019s foundation as a party of a mass working class rising up to fight for its own rights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7577c34040bc2d4cf4020ba537983d822256bd24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7577c34040bc2d4cf4020ba537983d822256bd24/0_27_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food bank\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stump speeches rattled on about rough sleepers, poor children, inequality, food banks: the fear is that his failure has harmed the potency of those issues.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change came gradually: the party of Harold Wilson was divided on the question of the poor, as powerful unions mostly represented well-paid workers, and were often reluctant to champion the genuinely poor and low paid. It remains the case that most unions representing better paid workers spend little time on the hard grind of recruiting those in greatest need of collective action \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/04/young-people-capitalism-mcstrike-unions\" title=\"\">fast-food workers</a>, care workers or van drivers. Meanwhile, latest figures show that some 84% of people <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/g9c2/lms\" title=\"\">work in the private sector</a>, these days barely knowing what a union is.</p> <p>\u201cThe many not the few\u201d resonated fine with Labour supporters. But in Corbyn\u2019s formulation it sounded like an old fashioned notion of the masses against a small cadre of bosses. The shape of society has changed: it\u2019s more of a diamond shape \u2013 the majority (voters) in a fat middling with the poor a (non-voting) minority at the bottom, and a top soaring away from the rest. This election posed the question: how much does that middle care about the poor? Johnson seems confident that they don\u2019t care very much at all.</p> <p>Although many young working families in the middle of that diamond depend on universal credit top-ups, suspicion of idle \u201cwelfare\u201d claimants vies with empathy for the needy. Voters in four elections have allowed the plight of the poor to worsen. Visit any food bank, stand in line at any Citizens Advice centre and you hear heartbreaking stories of cruel treatment from a wrecked welfare state.</p> <p>This is one of Labour\u2019s many great dilemmas. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown channelled hefty sums into tax credits, lifting a million pensioners and a million children out of poverty, improving their services and creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/04/sure-start-saved-nhs-millions\" title=\"\">Sure Start</a>. But they did it without talking much about it. They talked tough on benefit cheats to certify the valid claims of the rest, which may have confirmed the erroneous idea of widespread fraud. Even in their prime, they barely dared use their power to persuade voters of the value of social security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/boris-johnson-has-turned-politics-into-puppet-show\">Now Boris Johnson has really turned politics into a puppet show | Stewart Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government is confident that not enough voters care, so their budget is unlikely to tackle poverty and repair the welfare state.

      "bodyText": "One-nation Conservatism, whatever it means, does not describe Boris Johnson\u2019s performance at prime minister\u2019s questions yesterday. He was all Bullingdon yahoo, full of triumphalist thuggery, spouting outrageous untruths with a bravado cheered to the roof by his own side. A broken Labour party could only look on in silence as its defeated leader soldiered on, his valid points vanishing into the bluster and braggadocio. Take just one falsehood in Johnson\u2019s stream of unconsciousness: when Jeremy Corbyn mentioned poverty, the prime minister said it had \u201cdiminished by 400,000\u201d. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s senior economic analyst, Adam Corlett, tells me he \u201cstruggled to find anything to back that up\u201d. Instead, the figures show that according to one measure \u2013 the number of households having less than 60% of the contemporary median income \u2013 child poverty is up by 500,000. Johnson didn\u2019t understand Corbyn\u2019s point on the effect of universal credit (UC) on low-paid workers: any Greggs worker earning just over \u00a312,500 a year would see almost all of their \u00a3300 bonus taken away from them owing to a steep taper. Imagine imposing that 75% tax rate on high earners. Corbyn ploughed on: what of the two-child benefit limit, one of the gravest poverty-creating policies? Yada yada yada, went Johnson: \u201cI refer the right honourable gentleman to the answer that the British people gave to him four weeks ago.\u201d Pre-election, he was more cautious. I hear reports from Labour MPs that questions raised with Tories have been greeted with a sotto voce, \u201c80, 80, 80\u201d, trumpeting their majority. Get stuffed, you lost, end of. Is this a fading of poverty as a political issue? Corbyn\u2019s stump speeches rattled on about rough sleepers, poor children, inequality, food banks, social injustice: the fear is that his abject failure has harmed the potency of those very issues. The frightening question is whether most voters don\u2019t much care about everything that makes Labour party members of every faction keep on keeping on. Championing the underdog is in Labour\u2019s DNA. The party itself is mostly middle class \u2013 even if they deny it \u2013 and inspired to do good for others, not themselves. That is a very different proposition from Labour\u2019s foundation as a party of a mass working class rising up to fight for its own rights. The change came gradually: the party of Harold Wilson was divided on the question of the poor, as powerful unions mostly represented well-paid workers, and were often reluctant to champion the genuinely poor and low paid. It remains the case that most unions representing better paid workers spend little time on the hard grind of recruiting those in greatest need of collective action \u2013 fast-food workers, care workers or van drivers. Meanwhile, latest figures show that some 84% of people work in the private sector, these days barely knowing what a union is. \u201cThe many not the few\u201d resonated fine with Labour supporters. But in Corbyn\u2019s formulation it sounded like an old fashioned notion of the masses against a small cadre of bosses. The shape of society has changed: it\u2019s more of a diamond shape \u2013 the majority (voters) in a fat middling with the poor a (non-voting) minority at the bottom, and a top soaring away from the rest. This election posed the question: how much does that middle care about the poor? Johnson seems confident that they don\u2019t care very much at all. Although many young working families in the middle of that diamond depend on universal credit top-ups, suspicion of idle \u201cwelfare\u201d claimants vies with empathy for the needy. Voters in four elections have allowed the plight of the poor to worsen. Visit any food bank, stand in line at any Citizens Advice centre and you hear heartbreaking stories of cruel treatment from a wrecked welfare state. This is one of Labour\u2019s many great dilemmas. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown channelled hefty sums into tax credits, lifting a million pensioners and a million children out of poverty, improving their services and creating Sure Start. But they did it without talking much about it. They talked tough on benefit cheats to certify the valid claims of the rest, which may have confirmed the erroneous idea of widespread fraud. Even in their prime, they barely dared use their power to persuade voters of the value of social security. The government is confident that not enough voters care, so their budget is unlikely to tackle poverty and repair the welfare state. But over the next few years, they may overreach. When austerity was generally accepted as a necessity, general belt-tightening meant extra-tightening for the poorest. Now Johnson has declared austerity to be over, pretending to splash the cash, will his government find it harder to justify a rising tide of poor children \u2013 now nine in every class of 30? The yobbishness of his slapdash behaviour in the Commons yesterday was miserably depressing \u2013 but it may yield a seedling of hope that he will not be as adept at speaking for the nation as he thinks he is now, in this brief halo of victory. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.

      "bodyText": "A rugby union club in Adelaide\u2019s eastern suburbs won a $500,000 grant for facilities including new female change rooms under the Coalition\u2019s sports grant program despite not fielding a women\u2019s team since 2018 when it was embroiled in a sexism controversy. The club, located in the Coalition-held marginal seat of Sturt, was awarded the maximum available grant under the scandal-ridden $100m community sport infrastructure fund just weeks before the 19 May election. Announcing its success in securing the grant, the club thanked the offices of the then Liberal MP Christopher Pyne and the state Liberal deputy leader Vicki Chapman, who is also a club sponsor. It was one of a number of grants that the Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie directed to government-held marginal seats under the program, which the auditor general found prioritised funding in Coalition marginal and target seats while ignoring a merit-based assessment process undertaken by Sport Australia. Sturt was held by the Coalition on a 5.8% margin, and was successfully retained for the Liberal party at the May election by Pyne\u2019s protege, James Stevens. Guardian Australia has been contacted by concerned former members of the club who say the Old Collegians Rugby Union Club does not need new female change rooms if it does not have a women\u2019s team, expressing anger at the lucrative grant despite an alleged culture of mistreatment and misogyny that led to the entire female team quitting in 2018. Rugby SA confirmed that Old Collegians last fielded a women\u2019s team in the state competition in 2018 when they were successful in securing the premiership. According to the club website it is hoping to \u201creinvigorate\u201d the women\u2019s team ahead of the 2020 season, but it has not yet registered a women\u2019s team for the 2020 competition. Sport Australia told Guardian Australia that the grant, awarded in the third round of the program, would support the club to \u201cbuild new amenities and upgrade existing facilities at Linden Park\u201d. \u201cThe project includes the construction of female change rooms and facilities, wheelchair accessible toilets and a multi-purpose space to support broader community sporting activities.\u201d The auditor general report found that 73% of grants awarded in the third round had not been recommended by Sport Australia based on a merit-assessment process that considered community need and increased participation. It is not known if the rugby club\u2019s grant was one of those recommended by Sport Australia. According to the club\u2019s website, the grant will be used for a \u201crefurbishment of our club rooms and adding additional changing rooms\u201d. Guardian Australia has obtained correspondence from 2018 that shows the women\u2019s team and the club committee clashed in 2018 over alleged sexist behaviour towards the senior female players that ultimately led to the entire team leaving. The team has since moved to the Adelaide University Rugby Union Club. Those close to the club say the exodus included as many as 30 active supporters along with about 20 female players. The correspondence shows that the women\u2019s team raised concern about unequal treatment at the club, saying many of the female players did not feel respected. \u201cMany of the girls now think the Committee, or at least some of you, don\u2019t like or respect us, and don\u2019t see us as equals to the men\u2019s teams (or at least don\u2019t intend to treat us the same way), aren\u2019t proud of us, or didn\u2019t think we could/would win. They were startled that members of the committee would be so rude and unpleasant to them,\u201d an email from one of the players to the club\u2019s committee says. One of the key events that led to the exodus was the club banning the women from climbing the club rafters after they won the 2018 premiership \u2013 a tradition that had always been allowed for the male players. A sexual harassment complaint was also made to the club about the treatment of one female player by a male coach, with correspondence showing the incident was investigated. The Old Collegians club declined Guardian Australia\u2019s request for an interview, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The fresh revelations come as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, comes under growing pressure over the government\u2019s handling of the community sport infrastructure program and as Labor steps up calls for McKenzie, who was sport minister at the time, to resign. On Thursday, Morrison said he would take \u201cwhatever action was necessary\u201d once his department determined whether McKenzie had breached ministerial guidelines in her handling of the sports slush fund and in failing to publicly disclose membership of a shooting club that received a $36,000 grant. Morrison has tasked the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Philip Gaetjens, to review McKenzie\u2019s conduct. \u201cI\u2019ll let him do his job and then I will look at that advice and take whatever action is necessary,\u201d Morrison said. Earlier, McKenzie dismissed suggestions she was stepping down. \u201cThe minister is not resigning. She is actively engaging in the process and is confident there has not been a breach in ministerial standards,\u201d a statement from her office said. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said McKenzie needed to resign or be sacked, accusing the government of using the grant program as \u201cparty political funds\u201d. \u201cThe fact is that those oversized cheques represent the illustrated guide to buying your way into power,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThis abuse is rank. It stinks more than a bucket of prawn heads that you have left out on a hot day like today. The stench goes all the way up to the government,\u201d he said. The shadow sports minister, Don Farrell, has also written to Gaetjens asking him to investigate \u201cany role played by the prime minister, his office, and the Liberal Party secretariat in influencing spending decisions\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A year ago, late on a summer evening in Sydney, I found myself peering \u2013 discreetly, I hoped \u2013 through a gap in the bushes at a small nature reserve in the city\u2019s eastern suburbs, not far from Bondi Beach. My heart was racing because I thought I had just seen a leg, pale blue in the moonlight, advancing up a flight of stairs at the <a href=\"https://www.randwick.nsw.gov.au/facilities-and-recreation/beaches-and-coast/ocean-pools/mcivers-ladies-baths\">McIver\u2019s ladies baths</a>. Then, a rustling in the bushes: somebody was climbing up the hill, from the baths to the pathway on which I was stationed. I moved closer to the sound; the swimmer emerged. He was a man: bald, large, his grey T-shirt wet at the neck.</p> <p>As the name suggests, the ladies baths is a space reserved exclusively for women and children. I had heard a rumour, as the Australian summer\u2019s last late heatwave bloomed, that every full moon a group of older women headed to the baths at night to swim naked. I began visiting at full moon, needing \u2013 it was a form of madness, and a distraction from it \u2013 to know if it was true.</p> <p>McIver\u2019s is a natural sloped hollow in a stone shelf, deepened and walled in on the sea edge. Waves crash into the pool, spilling white foam into its far corners where, beneath the surface, small fish and the occasional octopus take shelter. It lies at the foot of a two-storey yellow sandstone cliff face, crowned with railings, a grass bank, a cement pathway and change rooms.</p> <p>On an <a href=\"https://crowdspot.carto.com/builder/5b579455-6e9c-4df1-a79e-a8e4c375a77b/embed\">interactive map</a><a href=\"https://crowdspot.carto.com/builder/5b579455-6e9c-4df1-a79e-a8e4c375a77b/embed\"> called FreeToBe</a>, which asks women to log safe and unsafe areas in Sydney, several women have dropped \u201csafe\u201d pins at McIver\u2019s. \u201cThe safest I have felt as an adult woman,\u201d declares one accompanying comment. Another describes it as \u201cmy favourite place to be a woman in Sydney\u201d. (Comments for other parts of the city include: \u201cMan called me a bitch while I was entering my building\u201d; \u201cI saw a man spit at a woman passing by for no known reason\u201d; \u201cA man going around filming girls sunbathing around the outdoor showers\u201d.)</p> <p>Fanny Durack and Wilhelmina \u201cMina\u201d Wylie, who in 1912 won gold and silver medals respectively for swimming at the first Olympic women\u2019s swimming event in Stockholm, trained at the baths because they weren\u2019t allowed to train with men. <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22006042?q&amp;versionId=26532231\">A 1996 ABC radio</a> story features a young Cate Blanchett as the voice of Durack, arguing the case for mixed bathing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abdf0aa50c3045250dd915d49aa2aef0fb2e97d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abdf0aa50c3045250dd915d49aa2aef0fb2e97d5/1641_1401_2449_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McIver\u2019s Ladies Baths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"592\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McIver\u2019s Ladies Baths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The baths have twice had to fight to remain exclusive to women. In 1995 a local man took the committee that looks after the baths to court on the grounds that the baths defied the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, which applies to services. McIver\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=5055930\">was granted an exemption</a> on the basis it was a place, not a service. In June 2018, the exemption, which had been valid until 2020, was modified to become \u201cindefinite\u201d.</p> <p>In 1946, when the council tried to open McIver\u2019s to men, the mother superior at Brigidine convent, Randwick, came to its defence. She wrote a letter to say that were the baths to become mixed, the nuns and boarders at her school would no longer be permitted to swim there.</p> <p>Brigidine, though far smaller that it was in the postwar years, is still in operation today. What was the main convent building is now a Catholic aged-care facility.</p> <p>There I found Sister Eileen Creagh, one of six Brigidine sisters who came to Australia from Ireland in 1954 to establish the convent. When she was 24, shortly after arriving in Sydney, Creagh and other sisters were taught to swim at McIver\u2019s by Mina Wylie, the Olympic champion. The nuns would hurry their breakfast and travel by tram to get to their lessons on time. They were dressed, even in Australia\u2019s heat, in a cloak, gloves and a black serge habit, made of fabric three yards across and deeply pleated. Creagh laughed, remembering how many clothing hangers she\u2019d use for her habit before she emerged \u201cin an enormous bathing suit \u2013 a one-piece, of course.\u201d</p> <p> One morning at the baths, as the sun illuminated fine rain, Bronwen Morgan, a regular swimmer, described her favourite time to swim. In the morning, she said, light shone off the pool on to the rock face. As the water moved, the hewn rock appeared to wobble and catch fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d06a141ccaab86bad0326cb76aa55656b9bb84c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d06a141ccaab86bad0326cb76aa55656b9bb84c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McIver\u2019s Ladies Baths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McIver\u2019s Ladies Baths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Last January I staked McIver\u2019s out three nights in a row \u2013 the full moon fell on a Sunday, but I thought the big swim might happen on the Saturday. The gate, usually left open, was now being locked after dark. On the Saturday Moggy, a friend, came with me. It was a misty evening and the sky was a spooky almost-green. Just after nightfall a fox skulked past us. A few minutes later her cub followed. There was no full moon swim. The next night I returned alone. I saw the leg and then the wet man who, thinking he had given me a fright, apologised and hurried away.</p> <p>On Monday I arrived while it was still light, hoping to discover the secret entrance the man must have used. Behind a public bathroom and down a hill, a tree formed a low tunnel, at the end of which is McIver\u2019s. Two big orb spiders hovered in their webs above the tunnel. I could just manoeuvre past them. I retraced my movements backwards, made my way up to the path and waited for Moggy: we had decided to swim.</p> <p>A blue-ringed octopus had been spotted in the pool that day. Their bites cause victims to experience a feeling of impending doom and can be fatal. The moon that night was a \u201csuper blood wolf moon\u201d. It all boded well. Together we inched past the spiders, through the secret entrance and down the stairs. We undressed, fussing over where to hang our things and how to place a mobile phone within reach. We dived in.</p> <p>As we came up for air, there was a large splash at the other end of the pool. I squinted at the water and the familiar bald head emerged. Moggy and I looked at each other, folding our arms across our breasts. \u201cHi, are you a man?\u201d I asked. My voice sounded like a child\u2019s. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. Then, \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow did you girls get in here?\u201d We remained silent; the man feigned nonchalance, diving and emerging extravagantly. \u201cYou know this is a place for women,\u201d Moggy said. \u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d he replied, then, maybe realising we were likely to know he was lying, \u201cThe rules change after dark.\u201d And then he swam to the stairs. \u201cYou girls have fun in your safe space,\u201d he said, climbing out. It was our turn to feign nonchalant swimming, glancing up to make sure he was gone. Eventually, we climbed out and sat on the rocks. Across the water, at the edge of Coogee beach, police lights flashed; they reflected red and blue on our wet skin.</p> <p>The last full moon stakeout was windy and drizzly; the park and the baths, deserted. I walked to Coogee promenade, where seagulls hovered above the small hollows their bodies had left in the sand. Nearby, someone laughed loudly. In the small ocean pool at the foot of the Coogee surf lifesaving club three young women in bright swimsuits were swimming and shrieking beneath the pale night sky.<br></p>",

McIver\u2019s is a natural sloped hollow in a stone shelf, deepened and walled in on the sea edge. Waves crash into the pool, spilling white foam into its far corners where, beneath the surface, small fish and the occasional octopus take shelter. It lies at the foot of a two-storey yellow sandstone cliff face, crowned with railings, a grass bank, a cement pathway and change rooms. On an interactive map called FreeToBe, which asks women to log safe and unsafe areas in Sydney, several women have dropped \u201csafe\u201d pins at McIver\u2019s. \u201cThe safest I have felt as an adult woman,\u201d declares one accompanying comment. Another describes it as \u201cmy favourite place to be a woman in Sydney\u201d. (Comments for other parts of the city include: \u201cMan called me a bitch while I was entering my building\u201d; \u201cI saw a man spit at a woman passing by for no known reason\u201d; \u201cA man going around filming girls sunbathing around the outdoor showers\u201d.) Fanny Durack and Wilhelmina \u201cMina\u201d Wylie, who in 1912 won gold and silver medals respectively for swimming at the first Olympic women\u2019s swimming event in Stockholm, trained at the baths because they weren\u2019t allowed to train with men. A 1996 ABC radio story features a young Cate Blanchett as the voice of Durack, arguing the case for mixed bathing. The baths have twice had to fight to remain exclusive to women. In 1995 a local man took the committee that looks after the baths to court on the grounds that the baths defied the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, which applies to services. McIver\u2019s was granted an exemption on the basis it was a place, not a service. In June 2018, the exemption, which had been valid until 2020, was modified to become \u201cindefinite\u201d. In 1946, when the council tried to open McIver\u2019s to men, the mother superior at Brigidine convent, Randwick, came to its defence. She wrote a letter to say that were the baths to become mixed, the nuns and boarders at her school would no longer be permitted to swim there. Brigidine, though far smaller that it was in the postwar years, is still in operation today. What was the main convent building is now a Catholic aged-care facility. There I found Sister Eileen Creagh, one of six Brigidine sisters who came to Australia from Ireland in 1954 to establish the convent. When she was 24, shortly after arriving in Sydney, Creagh and other sisters were taught to swim at McIver\u2019s by Mina Wylie, the Olympic champion. The nuns would hurry their breakfast and travel by tram to get to their lessons on time. They were dressed, even in Australia\u2019s heat, in a cloak, gloves and a black serge habit, made of fabric three yards across and deeply pleated. Creagh laughed, remembering how many clothing hangers she\u2019d use for her habit before she emerged \u201cin an enormous bathing suit \u2013 a one-piece, of course.\u201d One morning at the baths, as the sun illuminated fine rain, Bronwen Morgan, a regular swimmer, described her favourite time to swim. In the morning, she said, light shone off the pool on to the rock face. As the water moved, the hewn rock appeared to wobble and catch fire. Last January I staked McIver\u2019s out three nights in a row \u2013 the full moon fell on a Sunday, but I thought the big swim might happen on the Saturday. The gate, usually left open, was now being locked after dark. On the Saturday Moggy, a friend, came with me. It was a misty evening and the sky was a spooky almost-green. Just after nightfall a fox skulked past us. A few minutes later her cub followed. There was no full moon swim. The next night I returned alone. I saw the leg and then the wet man who, thinking he had given me a fright, apologised and hurried away. On Monday I arrived while it was still light, hoping to discover the secret entrance the man must have used. Behind a public bathroom and down a hill, a tree formed a low tunnel, at the end of which is McIver\u2019s. Two big orb spiders hovered in their webs above the tunnel. I could just manoeuvre past them. I retraced my movements backwards, made my way up to the path and waited for Moggy: we had decided to swim. A blue-ringed octopus had been spotted in the pool that day. Their bites cause victims to experience a feeling of impending doom and can be fatal. The moon that night was a \u201csuper blood wolf moon\u201d. It all boded well. Together we inched past the spiders, through the secret entrance and down the stairs. We undressed, fussing over where to hang our things and how to place a mobile phone within reach. We dived in. As we came up for air, there was a large splash at the other end of the pool. I squinted at the water and the familiar bald head emerged. Moggy and I looked at each other, folding our arms across our breasts. \u201cHi, are you a man?\u201d I asked. My voice sounded like a child\u2019s. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. Then, \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow did you girls get in here?\u201d We remained silent; the man feigned nonchalance, diving and emerging extravagantly. \u201cYou know this is a place for women,\u201d Moggy said. \u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d he replied, then, maybe realising we were likely to know he was lying, \u201cThe rules change after dark.\u201d And then he swam to the stairs. \u201cYou girls have fun in your safe space,\u201d he said, climbing out. It was our turn to feign nonchalant swimming, glancing up to make sure he was gone. Eventually, we climbed out and sat on the rocks. Across the water, at the edge of Coogee beach, police lights flashed; they reflected red and blue on our wet skin. The last full moon stakeout was windy and drizzly; the park and the baths, deserted. I walked to Coogee promenade, where seagulls hovered above the small hollows their bodies had left in the sand. Nearby, someone laughed loudly. In the small ocean pool at the foot of the Coogee surf lifesaving club three young women in bright swimsuits were swimming and shrieking beneath the pale night sky.",

In 2004, Abbas\u2019s father was killed by one of the countless car bombs detonated during the conflict. A few years ago, his 21-year-old cousin was shot in the head by Islamic State.</p> <p>\u201cI used to have that fear when I was in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wake up, you leave the house, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to come back or not. It\u2019s just something I lived with since I was young. I came to Australia to find a little relaxation, but still I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Stability hasn\u2019t been an entirely foreign abstraction since Abbas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/19/newsstory.sport3\">ran away from a Gosford hotel and sought political asylum in 2007</a>. Many a Sydney FC fan \u2013 and probably even former teammate and friend Alessandro Del Piero \u2013 recognise that. But, right now, his family are almost 12,000km away, and at the epicentre of more chaos.</p> <p>With designs on a late-career comeback, the 33-year-old had been due to return this month and sign with an Iraqi Premier League club. When he read about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/suleimani-assassination-two-us-airbases-in-iraq-hit-by-missiles-in-retaliation\">Iran\u2019s missile attack</a>, he pulled out. Not that they\u2019re playing anyway, with all league fixtures postponed indefinitely.</p> <p>Since October, at the dawn of mass political protests, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-protests/four-protesters-two-policemen-killed-as-iraq-unrest-resumes-idUSKBN1ZJ0QQ\">hundreds have been killed</a>. Now Iraq is caught in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/middleeast/iraq-iran-us-troops.html\">exploding US-Iran tensions</a>. So Abbas has stayed put in Sydney: training, eating, calling home.</p> <p>In his adopted country, Abbas is an A-League cult hero and 2007 Asian Cup winner, one still stopped in the street by fans requesting a selfie with the fiery Sydney derby protagonist who somehow returned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/19/friday-focus-ali-abbas-out-to-prove-doubters-wrong-in-sydney-derby\">the awful knee injury that was meant to end his career</a>.</p> <p>That he\u2019s one of precious few foreigners to have thrived on Australia\u2019s rock-hard pitches might be a blessing from Baghdad, where he grew up playing on concrete with the local kids \u2013 back when it was still safe to go outside.</p> <p>A left-footer like Ayad, Abbas left school at 14 in pursuit of the beautiful game. Nothing appears lost on that front, and most of his English was picked up from Australian teammates, first at Marconi Stallions and then Newcastle Jets.</p> <p>By the time he joined Sydney FC in 2012, he had the banter down pat. Del Piero will attest to that, too, given the pair once <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/abbas-rues-bustup-with-del-piero-20130114-2cpe1.html\">almost came to blows</a> in the dressing room with only 202cm of pure Zeljko Kalac between them.</p> <p>The Sky Blues supplied some of the best and worst moments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/09/ali-abbas-official-complaint-alleged-vilification-sydney-derby\">Ali Abbas to launch official complaint over alleged vilification in Sydney derby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latter is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/dec/03/141203arnold2fromgaus\">infamous Sydney derby tackle</a> that ruptured the utility\u2019s ACL and MCL. The former is the moment, 405 days later, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/09/sydney-fc-beat-newcastle-jets-as-ali-abbas-scores-on-comeback-from-injury\">returned and scored </a>against the Jets. Cruel social media taunts from Wanderers fans spiked the intervening 13 months, which he pinned to his locker as rehab inspiration.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know somebody it\u2019s very hateful to say, \u2018I wish you snapped both your legs\u2019,\u201d Abbas says. \u201cDo we really have this kind of human being in this world?\u201d</p> <p>The worst of humanity became apparent to Abbas when a suicide bomber took his father. It was still the worst day of his life, and he keeps the memory stowed safely out of reach. \u201cI try to not think about the bad things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good things stick in my head.\u201d</p> <p>Like how, as a child, he\u2019d accompany Abbas Senior to buy flour to deliver to Baghdad\u2019s bakeries to make Samoon. It\u2019s the reason Abbas can make the traditional flatbread but can\u2019t cook another thing. \u201cMy dad also used to drive the bus for the Iraq national team,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s when my brother started training at clubs.\u201d</p> <p>Ayad, a decade Abbas\u2019s senior, is an Iraqi Premier League winner. He\u2019s also the \u201cmental hero\u201d whose street-smart diplomacy helped mould a sibling who saw a lot of things kids shouldn\u2019t and \u201calways worried you might end up punished\u201d.</p> <p>Thankfully, by the time the then 20-year-old was plucked from an Under-23 camp in Jordan and deposited into the senior squad, the days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/19/iraq.football\">Uday Hussein\u2019s ritual imprisonment and torture of national-team players</a> were over.</p> <p>And so, when Abbas and Iraq won the 2007 Asian Cup, they were not motivated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/23/iraq.suzannegoldenberg\">half-time phone calls from Saddam\u2019s oldest son threatening to cut off their legs</a>, but by the prospect of <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/28/football/iraq-asia-cup-2007-anniversary/index.html\">unifying a violently fractured nation</a> that had grown too used to suffering.</p> <p>The team, made up of Kurds, Sunnis, Shias and Turkmen, overcame daily kidnapping threats and the murder of loved ones to orchestrate one of football\u2019s more remarkable stories.</p> <p>\u201cBack home it was a very bad situation, al-Qaeda<strong> </strong>was in Iraq,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cEvery day 30, 40, 50, 200 people were dying. We thought by playing we could make everyone forget about suffering. So we beat Saudi and it was the highest highlight of my life. If you can put it in a movie I will watch it more than 100 times.\u201d</p> <p>Iraq\u2019s final triumph over regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia is well documented. What isn\u2019t, is the insidious post-tournament threat that prompted Abbas to flee Iraq.</p> <p>In the same way that the brother of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jan/31/sport.comment4\">star Iraq midfielder Nashat Akram</a> was kidnapped for ransom in 2009, Abbas returned home with prize money and a price on his head.</p> <p>\u201cThis is actually the first time I\u2019m going to say it,\u201d he said, before launching into a story about a suspicious figure who approached him near his family home and used one of his friends as bait.</p> <p>\u201cHe starts saying, \u2018you have to help him and his family, he\u2019s your friend\u2019 \u2026 then he actually said the amount of money he wants and started getting angry at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I went to camp in Syria I got a call from my brother with a message that if I don\u2019t pay they\u2019re going to burn the new car I bought my family, and do this and that. My dad had just passed away with a car bomb and I just thought, \u2018do I really want to stay there and make my mum suffer again what she went through with my dad?\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>When he got to Australia for the Olympic qualifier against the Olyroos, he told his mother he wasn\u2019t coming back. Not only that, he was giving up football to earn a living. After initial resistance, Ayad talked her around. \u201cI just wanted to quit football and have a nice life,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So he and two teammates, Ali Mansour and Ali Khadher, snuck into the kitman\u2019s room, took their passports, and left their hotel.</p> <p>At the time \u2013 and much to his later amusement \u2013 Abbas didn\u2019t know who Graham Arnold was, even though his future Sydney FC coach had overseen that Olyroos game and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/im-standing-firm-says-arnold-20070715-gdqmg8.html\">Iraq\u2019s Asian Cup upset of the Socceroos</a>.</p> <p>But his contact with Arnold would continue long after he left Sydney for Pohang Steelers in 2016. Two years later, unbeknownst to most awaiting his impending Socceroos appointment, Iraq attempted to recruit Arnold - via his former player.</p> <p>\u201cTwo days before Arnie took over Socceroos, I had a call from a general in Iraq who\u2019s connected to the Iraqi Federation,\u201d Abbas said.</p> <p>\u201cThey were asking me if he\u2019s interested to take the Iraq national-team job. I said, \u2018let me ask him and see\u2019. Arnie said, \u2018yes, I would love to, but they need to act quick because I\u2019m in talks with the Socceroos\u2019. I was talking to them and everything, and then the next day I heard he signed for the Socceroos. It would\u2019ve been good for Iraq and especially Arnie.\u201d</p> <p>Abbas has been without a club since 2018 when he left Wellington Phoenix. But he believes he has another three years in his legs, if an A-League team will have him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had setbacks in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cThen all of a sudden I find the love of football again.\u201d</p>",

Then he started getting upset, saying \u2018we don\u2019t want them to come and get killed by American soldiers, so we should tell them\u2019. \u201cWe started talking to them, saying \u2018look, man, Baghdad is gone, you should leave\u2019. They just said, \u2018are you sure?\u2019. We watched as they changed their clothes and started going home. When we got to Baghdad we saw the American soldiers pointing guns and everything. It was a very scary moment for me and my family.\u201d Iraq has been no less unnerving since that day. In 2004, Abbas\u2019s father was killed by one of the countless car bombs detonated during the conflict. A few years ago, his 21-year-old cousin was shot in the head by Islamic State. \u201cI used to have that fear when I was in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wake up, you leave the house, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to come back or not. It\u2019s just something I lived with since I was young. I came to Australia to find a little relaxation, but still I can\u2019t.\u201d Stability hasn\u2019t been an entirely foreign abstraction since Abbas ran away from a Gosford hotel and sought political asylum in 2007. Many a Sydney FC fan \u2013 and probably even former teammate and friend Alessandro Del Piero \u2013 recognise that. But, right now, his family are almost 12,000km away, and at the epicentre of more chaos. With designs on a late-career comeback, the 33-year-old had been due to return this month and sign with an Iraqi Premier League club. When he read about Iran\u2019s missile attack, he pulled out. Not that they\u2019re playing anyway, with all league fixtures postponed indefinitely. Since October, at the dawn of mass political protests, hundreds have been killed. Now Iraq is caught in the middle of exploding US-Iran tensions. So Abbas has stayed put in Sydney: training, eating, calling home. In his adopted country, Abbas is an A-League cult hero and 2007 Asian Cup winner, one still stopped in the street by fans requesting a selfie with the fiery Sydney derby protagonist who somehow returned from the awful knee injury that was meant to end his career. That he\u2019s one of precious few foreigners to have thrived on Australia\u2019s rock-hard pitches might be a blessing from Baghdad, where he grew up playing on concrete with the local kids \u2013 back when it was still safe to go outside. A left-footer like Ayad, Abbas left school at 14 in pursuit of the beautiful game. Nothing appears lost on that front, and most of his English was picked up from Australian teammates, first at Marconi Stallions and then Newcastle Jets. By the time he joined Sydney FC in 2012, he had the banter down pat. Del Piero will attest to that, too, given the pair once almost came to blows in the dressing room with only 202cm of pure Zeljko Kalac between them. The Sky Blues supplied some of the best and worst moments. The latter is that infamous Sydney derby tackle that ruptured the utility\u2019s ACL and MCL. The former is the moment, 405 days later, he returned and scored against the Jets. Cruel social media taunts from Wanderers fans spiked the intervening 13 months, which he pinned to his locker as rehab inspiration. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know somebody it\u2019s very hateful to say, \u2018I wish you snapped both your legs\u2019,\u201d Abbas says. \u201cDo we really have this kind of human being in this world?\u201d The worst of humanity became apparent to Abbas when a suicide bomber took his father. It was still the worst day of his life, and he keeps the memory stowed safely out of reach. \u201cI try to not think about the bad things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good things stick in my head.\u201d Like how, as a child, he\u2019d accompany Abbas Senior to buy flour to deliver to Baghdad\u2019s bakeries to make Samoon. It\u2019s the reason Abbas can make the traditional flatbread but can\u2019t cook another thing. \u201cMy dad also used to drive the bus for the Iraq national team,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s when my brother started training at clubs.\u201d Ayad, a decade Abbas\u2019s senior, is an Iraqi Premier League winner. He\u2019s also the \u201cmental hero\u201d whose street-smart diplomacy helped mould a sibling who saw a lot of things kids shouldn\u2019t and \u201calways worried you might end up punished\u201d. Thankfully, by the time the then 20-year-old was plucked from an Under-23 camp in Jordan and deposited into the senior squad, the days of Uday Hussein\u2019s ritual imprisonment and torture of national-team players were over. And so, when Abbas and Iraq won the 2007 Asian Cup, they were not motivated by half-time phone calls from Saddam\u2019s oldest son threatening to cut off their legs, but by the prospect of unifying a violently fractured nation that had grown too used to suffering. The team, made up of Kurds, Sunnis, Shias and Turkmen, overcame daily kidnapping threats and the murder of loved ones to orchestrate one of football\u2019s more remarkable stories. \u201cBack home it was a very bad situation, al-Qaeda was in Iraq,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cEvery day 30, 40, 50, 200 people were dying. We thought by playing we could make everyone forget about suffering. So we beat Saudi and it was the highest highlight of my life. If you can put it in a movie I will watch it more than 100 times.\u201d Iraq\u2019s final triumph over regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia is well documented. What isn\u2019t, is the insidious post-tournament threat that prompted Abbas to flee Iraq. In the same way that the brother of star Iraq midfielder Nashat Akram was kidnapped for ransom in 2009, Abbas returned home with prize money and a price on his head. \u201cThis is actually the first time I\u2019m going to say it,\u201d he said, before launching into a story about a suspicious figure who approached him near his family home and used one of his friends as bait. \u201cHe starts saying, \u2018you have to help him and his family, he\u2019s your friend\u2019 \u2026 then he actually said the amount of money he wants and started getting angry at me. \u201cWhen I went to camp in Syria I got a call from my brother with a message that if I don\u2019t pay they\u2019re going to burn the new car I bought my family, and do this and that. My dad had just passed away with a car bomb and I just thought, \u2018do I really want to stay there and make my mum suffer again what she went through with my dad?\u2019.\u201d When he got to Australia for the Olympic qualifier against the Olyroos, he told his mother he wasn\u2019t coming back. Not only that, he was giving up football to earn a living. After initial resistance, Ayad talked her around. \u201cI just wanted to quit football and have a nice life,\u201d he said. So he and two teammates, Ali Mansour and Ali Khadher, snuck into the kitman\u2019s room, took their passports, and left their hotel. At the time \u2013 and much to his later amusement \u2013 Abbas didn\u2019t know who Graham Arnold was, even though his future Sydney FC coach had overseen that Olyroos game and Iraq\u2019s Asian Cup upset of the Socceroos. But his contact with Arnold would continue long after he left Sydney for Pohang Steelers in 2016. Two years later, unbeknownst to most awaiting his impending Socceroos appointment, Iraq attempted to recruit Arnold - via his former player. \u201cTwo days before Arnie took over Socceroos, I had a call from a general in Iraq who\u2019s connected to the Iraqi Federation,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cThey were asking me if he\u2019s interested to take the Iraq national-team job. I said, \u2018let me ask him and see\u2019. Arnie said, \u2018yes, I would love to, but they need to act quick because I\u2019m in talks with the Socceroos\u2019. I was talking to them and everything, and then the next day I heard he signed for the Socceroos. It would\u2019ve been good for Iraq and especially Arnie.\u201d Abbas has been without a club since 2018 when he left Wellington Phoenix. But he believes he has another three years in his legs, if an A-League team will have him. \u201cI\u2019ve had setbacks in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cThen all of a sudden I find the love of football again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tax authorities in five countries on Thursday staged an unprecedented \u201cday of action\u201d against a multinational financial institution that included raids, demands for information and warning letters to clients. The action \u2013 taken by revenue authorities in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and US \u2013 follows a year-long investigation into the company, which is based in Central America and is believed to have many thousands of clients around the world. It is the first overt action taken by the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, or J5, a body set up in mid-2018 to help revenue authorities fight tax crime and money laundering. Clients of the financial institution \u201cmay be using a sophisticated system to conceal and transfer wealth anonymously to evade their tax obligations and launder the proceeds of crime,\u201d the J5 nations said in a joint statement issued on Thursday evening. Further civil, criminal and regulatory action is expected in each of the member nations as a result of Thursday\u2019s action, the J5 said. It is also understood the J5 has a number of other investigations under way. As part of the investigation the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has used the expertise and investigative powers of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, which has the ability to demand documents and grill people under oath at secret hearings. ATO deputy commissioner Tim Dyce said that as part of the day of action the ATO sent letters to a small number of Australian clients of the company, which he would not name. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be scary for the people who receive the letters,\u201d Dyce told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey won\u2019t expect this. \u201cWe\u2019re starting off with a small number of enquiries and we\u2019ll extend our activities after that. We encourage people to come forward and talk to us if they think they may be affected, and it can result in a faster and slightly less painful resolution.\u201d The investigation was triggered by information obtained by the Netherlands Fiscal Information and Investigation Service. It has a reputation for aggression, mounting 2017 raids on the offices of Swiss bank Credit Suisse that seized millions of euros in cash, as well as gold bars, art and jewellery; sparked additional action in Australia and the UK; and annoyed the Swiss authorities. The current J5 investigation is understood to be unrelated to the Panama Papers leaks, which in 2016 exposed the role of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca in the use of tax havens by the rich and powerful. However, leaks such as the Panama Papers and 2017\u2019s Paradise Papers have helped fuel efforts by taxation authorities to curb the leakage of revenue to tax havens. Australia\u2019s efforts to grapple with the murky world of offshore finance were kickstarted in 2004, when ATO officers seized a laptop containing client information from the Melbourne hotel room of Jersey accountant Phillip Egglishaw. The seizure helped lead to the creation in 2005 of Project Wickenby, an operation involving ATO officers, federal police and other law enforcement agencies that ran until 2015, when its role was taken over by the serious financial crime taskforce. During its decade-long run Wickenby reaped $985m in tax revenue and resulted in 46 convictions.",

      "bodyText": "Forget \u201cno sex please, we\u2019re British\u201d. More a case of \u201cthere will be lots of sex, we\u2019re the British Museum\u201d. But the curator has assured the public the first major UK exhibition to explore Tantra won\u2019t be the \u201cpleasure for the sake of pleasure\u201d kind, nor what Sting suggested he was up to in his seven-hour lovemaking sessions. Instead, the exhibition, announced by the museum on Thursday, will explore Tantra, a set of beliefs and rituals that began in 6th-century India. Curator Imma Ramos said whenever she mentioned she was working on a Tantra exhibition people either said \u201cIs it the Kama Sutra?\u201d or \u201cIs it what Sting practises?\u201d The answer is neither. Sting has long been associated with enjoying marathon tantric sex sessions because of an interview he gave in 1990. He later backtracked, telling the Guardian in 2013 that he was drunk and was just trying to wind up the journalist. Ramos said it was a salacious stereotype and misunderstanding of Tantra in any case, similar to imagining the Kama Sutra was part of it. \u201cTantra is very much about harnessing desire in order to ultimately transcend it and also to embrace all aspects of the body, all aspects of the sensual, to generate power. \u201cIt is a very different approach to the erotic and to the idea of desire. It is not about pleasure for its own sake, which the Kama Sutra is.\u201d Ramos said Tantra was usually, in the west, equated with sex or yoga \u201cbut it should be understood as part of a broader philosophy of transgression\u201d. That said, there will be sex and yoga in the more than 100 objects in the show, just not the stereotypes. Tantra takes its name from sacred instructional texts, often written in the form of a conversation between a god and a goddess. Among the objects on display will be four of the earliest Tantra manuscripts, made in Nepal around the 12th century and loaned by Cambridge University Library. A major thrust of the exhibition will be the importance of divine feminine power and challenging the perception of womanhood as passive and docile. It will be a show with lots of remarkable objects showing fearsome goddesses trampling over fragile men. They include a 9th-century sandstone temple relief from Madhya Pradesh depicting the ferocious goddess Chamunda dancing on a corpse. In the 19th century Tantra became a tool for Indian revolutionaries fighting British colonial rule, with goddesses such as Kali becoming symbols of independence. One striking sculpture from 1890 shows a terrifying four-armed Kali, wearing a garland of decapitated male heads, striding over her naked husband, the god Shiva. A number of contemporary art works by female artists will be on display, curators said, highlighting Tantra\u2019s continuing gender relevance. For example, a canvas by Sutapa Biswas from 1985 on loan from Bradford Museums and Galleries \u2013 the self-explanatory Housewives with Steak-Knives. The final section of the show will focus on the 20th century and how, in the 1960s and 1970s, Tantra was interpreted as a movement that could inspire anti-capitalist and free love ideals. The British Museum has one of the biggest collections of Tantric material in the world so is well-placed to stage such a big exhibition, its director, Hartwig Fischer, said. Tantra had \u201cquite simply changed the world,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cYet it is little-known, or greatly misunderstood, in the west and this exhibition looks to remedy that.\u201d It also has a continuing relevance. \u201cGender, female power, gender fluidity, religious pluralism, mindfulness, wellbeing \u2026 these are all topics that are very much part of the contemporary discourse.\u201d \u2022 Tantra: Enlightenment to Revolution will be at the British Museum, London, 23 April-26 July",

      "body": "<p>Cold open: an Oxford police station. Maybe a guy with a long scarf bicycles past with a pile of books and an oar on each shoulder. Inside, we find a black woman attempting to report a crime to a police inspector, who is theatrically banging his head on the desk and shouting: \u201cBo-ring!\u201d Could she just tell him about how \u2013 . No, she couldn\u2019t, he says, because this is a lovely country, so her experience simply hasn\u2019t happened. He wants us to come together. Why doesn\u2019t she? She needs to stop being the \u2013 what\u2019s the expression? Fly in the ointment? Skeleton in the closet? It\u2019s on the tip of his tongue. In fact, if anything, says the inspector, he has been the victim of a crime. Warming to his theme, he rules that the real criminal is her for raising it.</p> <p>Cue opening titles of ITV\u2019s big new Sunday night detective drama: HATHAWAY.</p> <p>In any sane world \u2013 I know, right? \u2013 this show would already be in production, because that\u2019s the way it has always been, meaning it\u2019s the RIGHT way. First, there was Inspector Morse, starring Inspector Morse, and he was deferentially assisted by Sergeant Lewis. Then, when Morse went to the great whodunnit in the sky, Sergeant Lewis made inspector and, in due course, he got his own show: Lewis. Inspector Lewis was in turn deferentially assisted by Sergeant Hathaway, who I assumed was real, but was apparently played by the actor, musician and thought leader Laurence Fox. In due course, Inspector Lewis himself bowed out, by which point Hathaway had been promoted to inspector.</p> <p>And yet: no eponymous Sunday night show of his own. No deferential sergeant of his own. It\u2019s a scandal. This was the way things were \u2013 but now they are not. Similarly, just as there had always been iconic roles for James Fox back in the day, so there would surely always be the same for his son Laurence.</p> <p>But now, evidently, there aren\u2019t. So I want you to forget everything you think you know about what happened since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/id-never-heard-of-laurence-fox-until-he-started-lecturing-us-about-racism\" title=\"\">Laurence went on Question Time</a> last week and told a mixed-race audience member she was being racist to him by making boring charges of racism. Tempting as it might be to misdiagnose, this is not just the sort of midlife crisis you would expect from one of the lesser telly chefs.</p> <p>No, THIS is the reality: Laurence\u2019s story is a tale from acting\u2019s rust belt, about the hollowing out of the theatrical heartlands, where the job and dignity your father could count on have been stolen. By whom? I don\u2019t know. Sikhs maybe? We\u2019ll get onto that later. For now, it is increasingly clear that the old certainties have evaporated. And there are some people who are going to feel very, very left behind. We should listen to these actors.</p> <p>Indeed, this is why Laurence could be found on Julia Hartley-Brewer\u2019s TalkRadio show by Monday morning, expanding on his QT rant, going: \u201cWe lay all our troubles on the working man. And the working man has had enough of it.\u201d</p> <p>Damn straight. I\u2019ve always felt Laurence has huge second-toughest-at-Rada energy to him. And just like him, I\u2019m sick of these elites who have never done a tough day down t\u2019acting pit. The hardscrabble truth is that the theatrical economy no longer works in the way it did for your daddy or his daddy before him. Or, to put it more specifically re Laurence\u2019s situation: how come HE\u2019S not admiring Hitler in Remains of the Day, while Tony Hopkins has to miss his own dad\u2019s death because he\u2019s got the dinner to serve? Instead, Laurence feels as if his only choice is going on James Delingpole\u2019s podcast to lose his shit that there\u2019s a Sikh in Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 movie. I mean, I guess it\u2019s zeitgeisty. But set against his dad\u2019s zeitgeisty stuff, it\u2019s not exactly sharing some acid and a French chick with Mick Jagger in Performance, is it?</p> <p>And, of course, when hope moves out, Trump moves in. I think this is why Laurence recently announced that he put on a Maga hat and walked round wherever he lives in south London. He says one woman told him he was crazy. A bit like that scene in Die Hard 3 where Bruce Willis has to stand in Harlem wearing a racist sign or everyone\u2019s going to get blown up by villain Jeremy Irons.

      "bodyText": "Cold open: an Oxford police station. Maybe a guy with a long scarf bicycles past with a pile of books and an oar on each shoulder. Inside, we find a black woman attempting to report a crime to a police inspector, who is theatrically banging his head on the desk and shouting: \u201cBo-ring!\u201d Could she just tell him about how \u2013 . No, she couldn\u2019t, he says, because this is a lovely country, so her experience simply hasn\u2019t happened. He wants us to come together. Why doesn\u2019t she? She needs to stop being the \u2013 what\u2019s the expression? Fly in the ointment? Skeleton in the closet? It\u2019s on the tip of his tongue. In fact, if anything, says the inspector, he has been the victim of a crime. Warming to his theme, he rules that the real criminal is her for raising it. Cue opening titles of ITV\u2019s big new Sunday night detective drama: HATHAWAY. In any sane world \u2013 I know, right? \u2013 this show would already be in production, because that\u2019s the way it has always been, meaning it\u2019s the RIGHT way. First, there was Inspector Morse, starring Inspector Morse, and he was deferentially assisted by Sergeant Lewis. Then, when Morse went to the great whodunnit in the sky, Sergeant Lewis made inspector and, in due course, he got his own show: Lewis. Inspector Lewis was in turn deferentially assisted by Sergeant Hathaway, who I assumed was real, but was apparently played by the actor, musician and thought leader Laurence Fox. In due course, Inspector Lewis himself bowed out, by which point Hathaway had been promoted to inspector. And yet: no eponymous Sunday night show of his own. No deferential sergeant of his own. It\u2019s a scandal. This was the way things were \u2013 but now they are not. Similarly, just as there had always been iconic roles for James Fox back in the day, so there would surely always be the same for his son Laurence. But now, evidently, there aren\u2019t. So I want you to forget everything you think you know about what happened since Laurence went on Question Time last week and told a mixed-race audience member she was being racist to him by making boring charges of racism. Tempting as it might be to misdiagnose, this is not just the sort of midlife crisis you would expect from one of the lesser telly chefs. No, THIS is the reality: Laurence\u2019s story is a tale from acting\u2019s rust belt, about the hollowing out of the theatrical heartlands, where the job and dignity your father could count on have been stolen. By whom? I don\u2019t know. Sikhs maybe? We\u2019ll get onto that later. For now, it is increasingly clear that the old certainties have evaporated. And there are some people who are going to feel very, very left behind. We should listen to these actors. Indeed, this is why Laurence could be found on Julia Hartley-Brewer\u2019s TalkRadio show by Monday morning, expanding on his QT rant, going: \u201cWe lay all our troubles on the working man. And the working man has had enough of it.\u201d Damn straight. I\u2019ve always felt Laurence has huge second-toughest-at-Rada energy to him. And just like him, I\u2019m sick of these elites who have never done a tough day down t\u2019acting pit. The hardscrabble truth is that the theatrical economy no longer works in the way it did for your daddy or his daddy before him. Or, to put it more specifically re Laurence\u2019s situation: how come HE\u2019S not admiring Hitler in Remains of the Day, while Tony Hopkins has to miss his own dad\u2019s death because he\u2019s got the dinner to serve? Instead, Laurence feels as if his only choice is going on James Delingpole\u2019s podcast to lose his shit that there\u2019s a Sikh in Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 movie. I mean, I guess it\u2019s zeitgeisty. But set against his dad\u2019s zeitgeisty stuff, it\u2019s not exactly sharing some acid and a French chick with Mick Jagger in Performance, is it? And, of course, when hope moves out, Trump moves in. I think this is why Laurence recently announced that he put on a Maga hat and walked round wherever he lives in south London. He says one woman told him he was crazy. A bit like that scene in Die Hard 3 where Bruce Willis has to stand in Harlem wearing a racist sign or everyone\u2019s going to get blown up by villain Jeremy Irons. (Sidenote: a contempo version of that is exactly the sort of part Laurence should have had. But they have skipped him and gone straight for Tom Hiddleston, haven\u2019t they? The shits.) As for what attracted Fox to Trump, maybe it was the president\u2019s deathless comment: \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d And putting my own public school heritage to use, I want to attain the levels of empathy Laurence rose to on Question Time. So I\u2019ll just inform him definitively that a huge amount of his bitterness springs from the fact he went to a minor public school. (Harrow.

      "bodyText": "Transparency International announced yesterday that New Zealand is the least corrupt country in the world. This is excellent news, but New Zealand cannot afford to rest on its laurels. Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index assesses whether countries have a corrupt judiciary and public sector. Some other aspects where corruption can also occur, such as political funding, are not included in the index. New Zealand\u2019s international reputation for political integrity has taken a battering recently. The country\u2019s minister of Justice, Andrew Little, admitted last month: \u201cLike many democracies around the world, ours is vulnerable to those abroad who would seek to interfere in our democratic processes and influence the outcome.\u201d Responding to these very concerns, from 2018-2019 the New Zealand parliament held an extraordinary, highly controversial inquiry into foreign interference. It is obvious the country engaging in the political interference activities in New Zealand is China, but politicians and officials avoided mentioning this. Last month the New Zealand parliament passed new legislation to restrict foreign political donations. Yet New Zealand continues to feature in international discussion of China\u2019s political interference activities, profiled as a nation which is under threat from political interference and is struggling to adequately deal with it. A Financial Times article this month said New Zealand was \u201con the edge of viability as a member\u201d of its allied relationships because of its \u201csupine\u201d attitude to China and \u201ccompromised political system\u201d. New Zealand is frequently described as \u201cthe soft underbelly\u201d of the Five Eyes, an accusation which some of New Zealand\u2019s political pundits strongly reject. But perceptions matter, and the behaviour of some of New Zealand\u2019s politicians does nothing to dispel international concerns. New Zealand National party MP Todd McClay was featured in a report by Freedom House as an example of how the Chinese government forges relationships with foreign politicianswho promote Beijing\u2019s views in local media. McClay spouted China\u2019s official line on Uighur mass detention in an interview, saying \u201cthe existence and purpose of vocational training centres is a domestic matter for the Chinese government\u201d. McClay has never retracted these remarks. \u201cVocational training centres\u201d is the term the Chinese government uses to describe its detention of an estimated 1 million Uighurs in concentration camps. In 2019, two major leaks of official documents revealed China has placed the Uighur population under mass surveillance and internment, without charge. McClay is also infamous for receiving NZ$150, 000 (US$99,000) from a China-based businessman, Lang Lin. The funds were given via Lang\u2019s New Zealand-registered company Inner Mongolia Rider Horse. New Zealand law allows donations via New Zealand-registered companies, even if they are foreign-owned. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said Lang\u2019s donation was \u201coutside the spirit of the law\u201d. But the country\u2019s new legislation on electoral funding did not include changes to this massive loophole. New Zealand prides itself on being known as the easiest place in the world to set up a company. It continually ranks first in the world for ease of doing business. When the Panama Papers were released in 2016, New Zealand was described as \u201cat the heart\u201d of global money laundering. The ease for foreigners to set up a company in the country is one of the reasons why money launderers have been attracted to do business there. New Zealand\u2019s damaged political reputation persists, in part because neither the present Coalition government nor the main opposition party, National, have given a clear signal that they are serious about addressing China\u2019s political interference activities. In 2019, the leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges, attracted international ridicule when on a visit to China he unwittingly met with the head of China\u2019s secret police. Bridges gave a craven interview with Chinese broadcaster CGTN where he repeated Chinese government talking points. The New Zealand National party MP who famously hid his 15 years serving in Chinese military intelligence, Jian Yang, is possibly now more well known internationally than he is in New Zealand. Between 2008-2017, the New Zealand National party received at least NZ$1.3 million (US$855,000) in political donations from figures associated with China\u2019s United Front Work Department.

From these, the team were able to produce a digital reconstruction of Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract, and reproduce it through 3D printing.</p> \n<p>However, mummification, burial and a long stretch of time had taken their toll: the tongue was shrivelled and the soft palate was missing \u2013 with the team having to virtually fill in the latter. They then coupled their model to an electronic larynx and loudspeaker.</p> \n<p>The vocal tract filters sound produced from air that has passed through the larynx, with the resulting sound unique to each person. The position of different components of the vocal tract can then produce particular words or other vocalisations.</p> \n<p>Howard said: \u201cOur larynx sound is electronic and if that sound were produced by Nesyamun, he would be passing lung air outwards via his larynx where his vocal folds would be vibrating to create the same effect.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the insect-sting theory is correct, the last gasp of Nesyamun may have been expected to be \u201cow!\u201d or \u201cargh!\u201d, but the team found that the vocalisation produced sounded rather like \u201ceeuuughhh.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bebfc6bc3fc8546277ee575c246c9a7b6c63a8ac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bebfc6bc3fc8546277ee575c246c9a7b6c63a8ac/0_5_939_1032/910.jpg\" alt=\"A cross-section of the 3D printed replica of the vocal tract of a mummy held in Leeds City Museum.\" width=\"910\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cross-section of the 3D printed replica of the vocal tract of a mummy held in Leeds City Museum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scientific Report</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But then, as Howard pointed out, the sound is more specifically that of Nesyamun lying in his coffin after mummification.</p> \n<p>To better put their finger on the sound produced from Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract, the team analysed data and recordings from modern men and said the mummy\u2019s sound fell somewhere between the vowels in \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cbed\u201d.</p> \n<p>Howard said the dimensions of Nesyamun\u2019s larynx and vocal tract suggest his voice would be slightly higher pitched than the average man today.</p> \n<p>Nesyamun\u2019s voice, the team wrote, would have been crucial to his work: he would have had to talk, chant or sing as part of his role as a priest, incense bearer and scribe at the temple of Karnak in Thebes. But it would also have been important after death.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery Egyptian hoped that after death their soul would be able to speak, in order for them to recite the so-called \u2018negative confession\u2019 telling the gods of judgement that they had led a good life,\u201d said the study co-author Prof Joann Fletcher of the department of archaeology at the University of York. \u201cOnly if the gods agreed could the deceased soul pass through into eternity \u2013 if they failed the test they died a second, permanent death.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fletcher added those who passed the test were termed \u201ctrue of voice\u201d \u2013 a phrase that appears in Nesyamun\u2019s coffin inscriptions alongside his name.</p> \n<p>Prof John Schofield, an archaeologist and co-author of the study also at the University of York, said the team\u2019s approach could offer the public a new way to engage with the past.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is just the sheer excitement and the extra dimension that this could bring to museum visits, for example, or site visits to Karnak,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe idea of going to a museum and coming away having heard a voice from 3,000 years ago is the sort of thing people might well remember for a long time.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to try to do next is develop a computer model that will allow us to move [the vocal tract] around and form different vowel sounds and hopefully, ultimately words,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis [current sound] is never a sound he would have made in life, but from it we can create sounds that would have been made during his lifetime.\u201d</p> \n<p>Schofield added the approach could also be applied to other preserved human remains \u2013 such as the iron age bog bodies found in Denmark and beyond.</p> \n<p>Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo who was not involved in the work, said the study was \u201camazingly cool\u201d, adding that it would be a useful comparison to make 3D-models from living humans to explore the accuracy of the approach.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis study gives us a unique aural insight into the past and connects us intimately with Nesyamun, giving him a voice in the 21st century,\u201d she said.</p>",

Nesyamun lived under the pharaoh Rameses XI, who reigned around the beginning of the 11th century BC. Nesyamun\u2019s mummy, currently in Leeds City Museum, has been the subject of much scrutiny: it was unwrapped in 1824, with subsequent work revealing that he was in his 50s when he died. His death, which some suggested to have been from strangulation, was later proposed to be caused by an allergic reaction, possibly a result of an insect sting to the tongue \u2013 an unfortunate demise but one experts say may explain why the mummy had his tongue sticking out, but had no damage to the bones around his neck. But while Nesyamun may have been unfortunate in death, he was lucky thereafter: his mummy was moved shortly before a bombing raid on Leeds in 1941 that destroyed the museum it had been in and many of its artefacts. Now a team of researchers have 3D-printed a reproduction of Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract to hear what his voice would have sounded like. \u201cWhat we have done is to create the sound of Nesyamun as he is in his sarcophagus,\u201d said the study co-author Prof David Howard, head of the department of electronic engineering at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cIt is not a sound from his speech as such, as he is not actually speaking.\u201d Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the team revealed that they took the mummy to Leeds General Infirmary and carried out a series of CT scans.

However, mummification, burial and a long stretch of time had taken their toll: the tongue was shrivelled and the soft palate was missing \u2013 with the team having to virtually fill in the latter. They then coupled their model to an electronic larynx and loudspeaker. The vocal tract filters sound produced from air that has passed through the larynx, with the resulting sound unique to each person. The position of different components of the vocal tract can then produce particular words or other vocalisations. Howard said: \u201cOur larynx sound is electronic and if that sound were produced by Nesyamun, he would be passing lung air outwards via his larynx where his vocal folds would be vibrating to create the same effect.\u201d If the insect-sting theory is correct, the last gasp of Nesyamun may have been expected to be \u201cow!\u201d or \u201cargh!\u201d, but the team found that the vocalisation produced sounded rather like \u201ceeuuughhh.\u201d But then, as Howard pointed out, the sound is more specifically that of Nesyamun lying in his coffin after mummification. To better put their finger on the sound produced from Nesyamun\u2019s vocal tract, the team analysed data and recordings from modern men and said the mummy\u2019s sound fell somewhere between the vowels in \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cbed\u201d. Howard said the dimensions of Nesyamun\u2019s larynx and vocal tract suggest his voice would be slightly higher pitched than the average man today. Nesyamun\u2019s voice, the team wrote, would have been crucial to his work: he would have had to talk, chant or sing as part of his role as a priest, incense bearer and scribe at the temple of Karnak in Thebes. But it would also have been important after death. \u201cEvery Egyptian hoped that after death their soul would be able to speak, in order for them to recite the so-called \u2018negative confession\u2019 telling the gods of judgement that they had led a good life,\u201d said the study co-author Prof Joann Fletcher of the department of archaeology at the University of York. \u201cOnly if the gods agreed could the deceased soul pass through into eternity \u2013 if they failed the test they died a second, permanent death.\u201d Fletcher added those who passed the test were termed \u201ctrue of voice\u201d \u2013 a phrase that appears in Nesyamun\u2019s coffin inscriptions alongside his name. Prof John Schofield, an archaeologist and co-author of the study also at the University of York, said the team\u2019s approach could offer the public a new way to engage with the past. \u201cIt is just the sheer excitement and the extra dimension that this could bring to museum visits, for example, or site visits to Karnak,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of going to a museum and coming away having heard a voice from 3,000 years ago is the sort of thing people might well remember for a long time.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019d like to try to do next is develop a computer model that will allow us to move [the vocal tract] around and form different vowel sounds and hopefully, ultimately words,\u201d he said. \u201cThis [current sound] is never a sound he would have made in life, but from it we can create sounds that would have been made during his lifetime.\u201d Schofield added the approach could also be applied to other preserved human remains \u2013 such as the iron age bog bodies found in Denmark and beyond. Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo who was not involved in the work, said the study was \u201camazingly cool\u201d, adding that it would be a useful comparison to make 3D-models from living humans to explore the accuracy of the approach. \u201cThis study gives us a unique aural insight into the past and connects us intimately with Nesyamun, giving him a voice in the 21st century,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Very few MPs were taking any chances with the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Which is why the Commons chamber was almost entirely empty for the ministerial statement about it. Some clearly appear to believe the risk of contagion is so high that even talking about it can spread the disease.</p> <p>Fortunately the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is more selfless than many. And more fearless. One of the more charming things about Matt \u2013 other than his gullibility: he consistently remains the only person in the entire country who believes Boris Johnson will actually build 40 new hospitals \u2013 is his tireless dedication to the cause. Tigger doesn\u2019t just wear his NHS badge on the lapel of his suit; he has it attached to his pyjamas in bed at night. As does his Pooh bear teddy.</p> <p>Matt is so hands-on and lives and breathes the NHS so much that he now rather considers himself to be the nation\u2019s doctor-in-chief, rather than a politician with no clinical experience. So for his Commons statement, he tried to adopt the serious yet deeply reassuring bedside tone of a disaster movie superhero who was preventing widespread panic before going back into the contaminated danger zone to singlehandedly save the planet.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it turned out that Tigger didn\u2019t actually have anything worthwhile to divulge. All he had was the same information that was readily available to anyone following the news. The coronavirus was primarily confined to Wuhan city in China, which was now in lockdown. There had been 511 cases confirmed with 17 fatalities, though it was possible these figures could rise. No shit. Isolated cases had been reported in the US and Japan, but none confirmed in the UK so far. But he was ready if there were as the UK was upgrading its risk level from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d. He said it in a way that made \u201clow\u201d sound like a red alert. Either no one had bothered to tell him there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/increased-likelihood-coronavirus-uk-health-secretary-matt-hancock\">four suspected cases in Scotland </a>or he just didn\u2019t want to worry anyone. \u201cMost people do recover,\u201d he added, trying not to sound too disappointed. It\u2019s hard to be appreciated as a proper saviour unless there\u2019s some jeopardy.</p> <p>After advising a few MPs, who were concerned about the wellbeing of their Chinese constituents, that the best way to avoid the coronavirus was not to travel to Wuhan or have anything to do with someone who had just returned from there, Matt then donned his white coat to give one-to-one consultations. He told the shadow health secretary, Sharon Hodgson, that there was no need for her or anyone else to worry if they were suffering from a cough as the disease typically took 10 to 14 days to gestate. Something I found particularly reassuring, as I had been up half the night hacking my guts out and had been prone to the odd hypochondriacal thought. Nice to know Matt\u2019s got my back.</p> <p>There was also no need at present \u2013 at present \u2013 for anyone to wear face masks or hazmat suits, but if anyone was at all concerned, they were to ring the NHS 111 helpline and Dr Matt would personally be on standby to take any calls throughout the weekend. For once, though, his surgery was almost empty, so the entire consultation session was over in a record 15 minutes. Most ministerial statements last a minimum of 45 minutes.</p> <p>But if Matt was disappointed at the lack of referrals, he was too professional to show it. He had done his bit to keep the country safe and that\u2019s what counted. If only he could show the same diligence in other areas of his job, then people might not be dying unnecessarily owing to hospitals missing their A&amp;E and cancer targets.</p> <p>There had been a rather fuller house for international trade departmental questions earlier in the day. Then there had been no risk of imminent death and many MPs had come along out of curiosity as they suspected the session might be something of a collector\u2019s item. With the withdrawal agreement having passed both houses \u2013 sorry, child refugees, you\u2019ll just have to take your chances \u2013 Brexit is now a done deal, which means that we\u2019re about to get down to the much trickier, hard graft of negotiating new trade deals. And as even Boris Johnson can see that the last person you would want in charge of this is someone as catastrophically dim as Liz Truss, it\u2019s likely her days are numbered with a reshuffle imminent.</p> <p>Still, you have to give Truss credit. If this was to be her last outing at the dispatch box, then she was going to go out in the style on which her reputation had been built: confusion and incompetence. She opened by heralding a new dawn of UK-US trade. She had no idea how any such deal could be agreed without first having established what levels of alignment the UK would be keeping with the EU, but she was certain that the new agreement would mean no tariffs on car exports to the US. She then added in the same breath that the UK should be free to impose a digital service tax if it wanted to, even though the US had insisted it would impose tariffs on cars if we did. Go figure.</p> <p>I\u2019ll miss Truss when she\u2019s gone, even if few others will. She\u2019s been very good to me. But then I said much the same when Liam Fox was sacked from the same job. My one consolation is that her successor will almost certainly be no better. There may be numbers on the Tory benches, but there isn\u2019t much talent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Very few MPs were taking any chances with the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Which is why the Commons chamber was almost entirely empty for the ministerial statement about it. Some clearly appear to believe the risk of contagion is so high that even talking about it can spread the disease. Fortunately the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is more selfless than many. And more fearless. One of the more charming things about Matt \u2013 other than his gullibility: he consistently remains the only person in the entire country who believes Boris Johnson will actually build 40 new hospitals \u2013 is his tireless dedication to the cause. Tigger doesn\u2019t just wear his NHS badge on the lapel of his suit; he has it attached to his pyjamas in bed at night. As does his Pooh bear teddy. Matt is so hands-on and lives and breathes the NHS so much that he now rather considers himself to be the nation\u2019s doctor-in-chief, rather than a politician with no clinical experience. So for his Commons statement, he tried to adopt the serious yet deeply reassuring bedside tone of a disaster movie superhero who was preventing widespread panic before going back into the contaminated danger zone to singlehandedly save the planet. Unfortunately, it turned out that Tigger didn\u2019t actually have anything worthwhile to divulge. All he had was the same information that was readily available to anyone following the news. The coronavirus was primarily confined to Wuhan city in China, which was now in lockdown. There had been 511 cases confirmed with 17 fatalities, though it was possible these figures could rise. No shit. Isolated cases had been reported in the US and Japan, but none confirmed in the UK so far. But he was ready if there were as the UK was upgrading its risk level from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d. He said it in a way that made \u201clow\u201d sound like a red alert. Either no one had bothered to tell him there were four suspected cases in Scotland or he just didn\u2019t want to worry anyone. \u201cMost people do recover,\u201d he added, trying not to sound too disappointed. It\u2019s hard to be appreciated as a proper saviour unless there\u2019s some jeopardy. After advising a few MPs, who were concerned about the wellbeing of their Chinese constituents, that the best way to avoid the coronavirus was not to travel to Wuhan or have anything to do with someone who had just returned from there, Matt then donned his white coat to give one-to-one consultations. He told the shadow health secretary, Sharon Hodgson, that there was no need for her or anyone else to worry if they were suffering from a cough as the disease typically took 10 to 14 days to gestate. Something I found particularly reassuring, as I had been up half the night hacking my guts out and had been prone to the odd hypochondriacal thought. Nice to know Matt\u2019s got my back. There was also no need at present \u2013 at present \u2013 for anyone to wear face masks or hazmat suits, but if anyone was at all concerned, they were to ring the NHS 111 helpline and Dr Matt would personally be on standby to take any calls throughout the weekend. For once, though, his surgery was almost empty, so the entire consultation session was over in a record 15 minutes. Most ministerial statements last a minimum of 45 minutes. But if Matt was disappointed at the lack of referrals, he was too professional to show it. He had done his bit to keep the country safe and that\u2019s what counted. If only he could show the same diligence in other areas of his job, then people might not be dying unnecessarily owing to hospitals missing their A&amp;E and cancer targets. There had been a rather fuller house for international trade departmental questions earlier in the day. Then there had been no risk of imminent death and many MPs had come along out of curiosity as they suspected the session might be something of a collector\u2019s item. With the withdrawal agreement having passed both houses \u2013 sorry, child refugees, you\u2019ll just have to take your chances \u2013 Brexit is now a done deal, which means that we\u2019re about to get down to the much trickier, hard graft of negotiating new trade deals. And as even Boris Johnson can see that the last person you would want in charge of this is someone as catastrophically dim as Liz Truss, it\u2019s likely her days are numbered with a reshuffle imminent. Still, you have to give Truss credit. If this was to be her last outing at the dispatch box, then she was going to go out in the style on which her reputation had been built: confusion and incompetence. She opened by heralding a new dawn of UK-US trade. She had no idea how any such deal could be agreed without first having established what levels of alignment the UK would be keeping with the EU, but she was certain that the new agreement would mean no tariffs on car exports to the US. She then added in the same breath that the UK should be free to impose a digital service tax if it wanted to, even though the US had insisted it would impose tariffs on cars if we did. Go figure. I\u2019ll miss Truss when she\u2019s gone, even if few others will. She\u2019s been very good to me. But then I said much the same when Liam Fox was sacked from the same job. My one consolation is that her successor will almost certainly be no better. There may be numbers on the Tory benches, but there isn\u2019t much talent.",

There is no stunning here: the cattle is slaughtered according to the rules of halal, which in most interpretations means that the animal should be conscious when it dies. The floor glistens with water; it is washed down between each kill so the animals can\u2019t smell the blood, although they may notice the carcasses of their brethren, dangling from hoists around them.</p> \n<p>The killing must be quick and well done, says one slaughterhouse employee, in his early twenties. He doesn\u2019t like to think about what he does, he says. But it\u2019s a job.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/two-billion-and-rising-the-global-trade-in-live-animals-in-eight-charts\">Two billion and rising: the global trade in live animals in eight charts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The reputation of slaughterhouses in the Middle East is poor among animal welfare campaigners. Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farmings says that in his 28-year career \u201cthere is nothing I have seen as awful as slaughterhouses\u201d in the Middle East. Investigation after investigation has exposed filthy conditions, little or no concern for animal welfare, badly trained staff, and, above all, the practice of halal slaughter, which often means animals are killed without being stunned first.</p> \n<p>Live animal exports to the Middle East have risen steadily over the past two decades, particularly from Europe. Trade to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia has risen steeply over the last fifteen years. In just one year, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkeys-animal-production-surges-86-percent/1056721\">Turkey </a><a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkeys-animal-production-surges-86-percent/1056721\">went from importing $600m (\u00a3457m) </a><a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkeys-animal-production-surges-86-percent/1056721\"> worth of animals in </a><a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkeys-animal-production-surges-86-percent/1056721\">2016 to $1.2bn in 2017</a>.</p> \n<p>There are a number of reasons for the rise, but it is mainly due to an increasing demand for meat and dairy products, and rapidly warming climate pressuring water-stressed nations. Those nations that can afford the political or financial cost are increasingly looking to avoid rearing animals from birth, the more water-intensive option.</p> \n<p>As growing populations continue to demand freshly-killed, Middle Eastern nations are increasingly leaning on live imports to meet this need, and reshaping the global marketplace in the process.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec2ea8f009e534d387daf9c9659b94a1c369803\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec2ea8f009e534d387daf9c9659b94a1c369803/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Yemeni boy with livestock at a market in the capital Sana'a, Yemen, on 6 August 6 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live goats, sheep and cattle are sold in advance of Eid al-Adha at markets across the Middle East such as this one in Sana\u2019a, Yemen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s a region where meat is often seen as a status symbol of a family\u2019s ability to provide, and serving meat to a hungry guest is considered a demonstration of hospitality and generosity. The Islamic high holiday Eid al-Adha \u2013 which translates as festival of sacrifice, honouring the biblical figure Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his only son \u2013 requires that families slaughter a live animal, often a cow, sheep or goat, and distribute the meat between family, friends and neighbours, and the needy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-global-live-animal-export-trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-global-live-animal-export-trade&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-global-live-animal-export-trade</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Middle East\u2019s growing middle class has also swelled demand, along with overall population growth.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant increase in the middle class bracket across the Middle East over the last two decades,\u201d says Emily Hawthorne, from private global intelligence firm Stratfor. \u201cThere\u2019s the status symbol that comes from a live sheep \u2013 or better yet, a live cow or goat \u2013 for Eid al-Adha, as well as for weddings and festivals; the growth of the Middle Eastern middle class has a lot to do with this.

      "bodyText": "Cows are waiting in pens, on sweet-smelling fresh straw. They have come to Lebanon from Spain, from Romania. In the one end of the alley are two pens packed with enormous Brahman cattle, standing well over six feet with their distinctive humps, all the way from Brazil. \u201cThey are the most aggressive,\u201d says one of the slaughterhouse staff. \u201cIt\u2019s just their personalities.\u201d As the Beirut traffic continues its usual honking chaos outside, the animals wait to be slaughtered. When the time comes they go, one at a time, through the hatch into the gleaming tiled kill room. \u201cThey don\u2019t see each other being killed,\u201d says our guide. They are put on a hoist and tugged up by their legs, and then their throat is slit. There is no stunning here: the cattle is slaughtered according to the rules of halal, which in most interpretations means that the animal should be conscious when it dies. The floor glistens with water; it is washed down between each kill so the animals can\u2019t smell the blood, although they may notice the carcasses of their brethren, dangling from hoists around them. The killing must be quick and well done, says one slaughterhouse employee, in his early twenties. He doesn\u2019t like to think about what he does, he says. But it\u2019s a job. The reputation of slaughterhouses in the Middle East is poor among animal welfare campaigners. Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farmings says that in his 28-year career \u201cthere is nothing I have seen as awful as slaughterhouses\u201d in the Middle East. Investigation after investigation has exposed filthy conditions, little or no concern for animal welfare, badly trained staff, and, above all, the practice of halal slaughter, which often means animals are killed without being stunned first. Live animal exports to the Middle East have risen steadily over the past two decades, particularly from Europe. Trade to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia has risen steeply over the last fifteen years. In just one year, Turkey went from importing $600m (\u00a3457m) worth of animals in 2016 to $1.2bn in 2017. There are a number of reasons for the rise, but it is mainly due to an increasing demand for meat and dairy products, and rapidly warming climate pressuring water-stressed nations. Those nations that can afford the political or financial cost are increasingly looking to avoid rearing animals from birth, the more water-intensive option. As growing populations continue to demand freshly-killed, Middle Eastern nations are increasingly leaning on live imports to meet this need, and reshaping the global marketplace in the process. It\u2019s a region where meat is often seen as a status symbol of a family\u2019s ability to provide, and serving meat to a hungry guest is considered a demonstration of hospitality and generosity. The Islamic high holiday Eid al-Adha \u2013 which translates as festival of sacrifice, honouring the biblical figure Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his only son \u2013 requires that families slaughter a live animal, often a cow, sheep or goat, and distribute the meat between family, friends and neighbours, and the needy. The Middle East\u2019s growing middle class has also swelled demand, along with overall population growth. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant increase in the middle class bracket across the Middle East over the last two decades,\u201d says Emily Hawthorne, from private global intelligence firm Stratfor. \u201cThere\u2019s the status symbol that comes from a live sheep \u2013 or better yet, a live cow or goat \u2013 for Eid al-Adha, as well as for weddings and festivals; the growth of the Middle Eastern middle class has a lot to do with this. This, for example, is why you see Gulf countries playing a huge part [in] live imports from Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan.\u201d Australia recently enacted a three-month ban on live exports to the Middle East, after a furore over animal welfare concerns. But when one exporting country pulls back, others step forward. \u201cIn the midst of a growing demand from Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait and other Gulf countries for Eid al-Adha, [other] countries supplement gaps in supply,\u201d says Hawthorne, listing India, Pakistan and Iran as potential live exporters willing to step in when Australia and other big exporters bail out. \u201cLive export is a thing where you see \u2013 political proclivities aside \u2013 people need to import what communities [are] demanding,\u201d she says. Ironically, the warming climate also plays a role in the trade: the lack of water across the Middle East means that it is cheaper to import animals rather than raise them from birth.

The Wanderers should suit him rather more than the sluggish surface at Port Elizabeth and this time there is no reason for Du Plessis to restrict his use on the grounds he wants to save him for another day. Philander, 34, has been a wonderful throwback. In the 21st century it is very rare to find an opening bowler in Test cricket who barely bowls at 80mph but such is the magic in his wrist and fingers that if there is movement for the new ball, Philander will find it. He has taken 222 wickets at 22.29 in Test cricket. His batting average is higher than that (24.51), which means he can be regarded as a formidable all-rounder. Next summer he heads to Somerset as a Kolpak cricketer, one of the last ones since new Kolpaks will not be permitted after next July, which will be a much-needed relief to South African cricket. Root must decide how many pacemen to play at the Wanderers and who will be the most effective. Especially if the forecast suggests rain interruptions and gloomy conditions they are expected to dispense with their spinner, even though Dom Bess was so successful in Port Elizabeth. In 1995 and 1999 England made do with Graeme Hick and Michael Vaughan providing semi-professional spin; in 2005, 2010 and 2016 they had Ashley Giles, Graeme Swann and Moeen Ali respectively. None of them managed to take more than two wickets in an innings. Root himself may decide to take on the burden of providing the spin option with a little help from Joe Denly. The statistics now suggest \u2013 as does the naked eye \u2013 that Root can, at least, be regarded as a superior bowler to Hick and Vaughan. Mark Wood and Jofra Archer are unlikely to play in the same side, which would be a shame. Moreover Chris Woakes, a blameless spectator throughout this series, could yet be drafted into the side if doubts about the fitness of Wood or Archer remain. There will be much justifiable sympathy for Bess if he is omitted but it is infinitely preferable to be left out after taking six wickets for 87 runs in your previous Test rather than 0 for 110. Come what may his stock has risen rapidly on this tour and he is guaranteed a trip to Sri Lanka, which will surely include a place in the final XI in Galle in two months\u2019 time. Win toss..and bat (probably). There is grass but there should be pace throughout.",

Perez, who is currently the bishop of Cleveland, replaces Charles Chaput, a conservative who was at odds with Francis\u2019s more liberal positions on leading issues, including homosexuality and abortion. Chaput offered his resignation in September \u2013 church law dictates that bishops must do so when they turn 75 \u2013 but a pope can choose to decline the offer. In this case, the ultra-traditionalist Chaput has been allowed to leave, with Perez assuming the role. In a statement on Twitter, Perez said he was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Pope Francis for the appointment. \u201cIt is with great joy tinged with a sense of sadness that I accept the appointment,\u201d Perez said. Perez, who speaks English and Spanish, was born in Miami and raised in West New York.

He is also the chair of the bishops\u2019 committee on cultural diversity, and the former chair of the bishops\u2019 sub-committee for Hispanic affairs. Francis and Chaput were perceived to be as foes as the pope has sought to liberalize \u2013 relatively \u2013 the Catholic church. Chaput, who was previously served as the archbishop of Denver, was the first person of Native American background to be appointed an archbishop in the US. He has been an opponent of LGBTQ rights \u2013 in a 2011 interview he said \u201ca relationship between two people of the same sex is not in line with the teachings of the church and the teachings of the gospel, and is therefore wrong\u201d.

All women stood against it and the bill was withdrawn after our protests,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they dare to try again, we will fight against it again.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the Cumhuriyet newspaper, Dr Adem S\u00f6z\u00fcer, the head of Istanbul University\u2019s criminal and criminal procedure law department, said the new bill was likely to increase rates of violence against women and children because it \u201clegitimises the mentality that women are objects to possess or exist for sexual satisfaction\u201d.</p> <p>Protests against the proposed legislation were held around the country this month. A date for a second reading in parliament has not yet been set.</p> <p>\u201cMarry your rapist\u201d clauses are present in legislation relating to sexual consent in many countries in the Middle East and Latin America.

      "bodyText": "Turkey\u2019s ruling party has begun a second attempt at introducing a law to grant rapists amnesty as long as they marry their victim, four years after a similar bill sparked outrage at home and internationally. The legislation, which was first debated by parliament on 16 January, would give men suspended sentences for child sex offences if the two parties get married and the age difference between them is less than 10 years. Opposition parties and women\u2019s rights groups have been quick to point out that the bill in effect legitimises child marriage and statutory rape in a country where the legal age of consent is 18. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s conservative Justice and Development party (AKP) has said the proposal is designed to deal with Turkey\u2019s widespread child marriage problem. However, Fidan Ataselim, the general secretary of the activist group We Will Stop Femicide, said the new bill was an attempt by the government to erase evidence of Turkey\u2019s growing epidemic of violence against girls and women. The group, which has tracked gender-related violence and deaths since Turkish authorities stopped doing so in 2009, estimates that more than 2,600 women have been murdered in the last decade, and the number of killings has increased steadily each year. According to the UN, 38% of Turkish women have suffered physical or sexual violence from a partner. \u201cIn 2016 the government introduced a [similar] draft law on amnesty for child abuse perpetrators. All women stood against it and the bill was withdrawn after our protests,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they dare to try again, we will fight against it again.\u201d Writing in the Cumhuriyet newspaper, Dr Adem S\u00f6z\u00fcer, the head of Istanbul University\u2019s criminal and criminal procedure law department, said the new bill was likely to increase rates of violence against women and children because it \u201clegitimises the mentality that women are objects to possess or exist for sexual satisfaction\u201d. Protests against the proposed legislation were held around the country this month. A date for a second reading in parliament has not yet been set. \u201cMarry your rapist\u201d clauses are present in legislation relating to sexual consent in many countries in the Middle East and Latin America. In recent years such loopholes have been closed after protests against them in Lebanon, Jordan and Tunisia. Turkey appears to have travelled in the opposite direction. After abolishing such laws in 2005, a 2016 bill that would have allowed the release from prison of men guilty of assaulting a minor if the aggressor married the victim and the act was committed without \u201cforce or threat\u201d provoked widespread fury and was eventually defeated. Ankara insisted that the bill\u2019s intention was distorted by critics. \u201cThere are people who get married before reaching the legal age. They just don\u2019t know the law,\u201d the then prime minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said at the time, adding that the measure aimed to \u201cget rid of this injustice\u201d. His comments were echoed by the justice minister Bekir Bozda\u011f, who said marriages involving minors were \u201cunfortunately a reality\u201d in Turkey but the men involved \u201cwere not rapists or sexual aggressors\u201d.",

The <a href=\"https://www.louisealder.co.uk/\">soprano Louise Alder</a> and <a href=\"https://josephmiddleton.com/\">pianist Joseph Middleton</a> start with Rachmaninov and end with Britten, taking in Sibelius, Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Medtner on the way; the music\u2019s geographical progress mirrors the journey Alder\u2019s great-grandparents made as refugees in 1916, from Odessa to Finland, Norway and finally Britain. Alder describes it as a \u201cmeandering sleigh ride\u201d, though if that conveys the unhurried way in which these well-chosen songs lead into one another it doesn\u2019t quite do justice to the focus with which they come across. Alder is in glorious voice, her soprano fresh and untethered; the assurance of youth and the doubt born of experience come across equally convincingly. Her high notes gleam, and her words are direct and communicative, whether in Russian, Swedish, German or French.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0d2b6756fcb28090e02f5080ff5877f3a5fad5e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d2b6756fcb28090e02f5080ff5877f3a5fad5e0/0_0_900_892/500.jpg\" alt=\"Louise Alder/Joseph Middleton: Lines Written During a Sleepless Night album art work\" width=\"500\" height=\"496\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louise Alder/Joseph Middleton: Lines Written During a Sleepless Night album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Middleton\u2019s playing fills in everything those words can\u2019t say, perfectly calibrated to support Alder but huge in its expressive scope.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a really lovely disc from two of classical song\u2019s brightest artists. The soprano Louise Alder and pianist Joseph Middleton start with Rachmaninov and end with Britten, taking in Sibelius, Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Medtner on the way; the music\u2019s geographical progress mirrors the journey Alder\u2019s great-grandparents made as refugees in 1916, from Odessa to Finland, Norway and finally Britain. Alder describes it as a \u201cmeandering sleigh ride\u201d, though if that conveys the unhurried way in which these well-chosen songs lead into one another it doesn\u2019t quite do justice to the focus with which they come across. Alder is in glorious voice, her soprano fresh and untethered; the assurance of youth and the doubt born of experience come across equally convincingly. Her high notes gleam, and her words are direct and communicative, whether in Russian, Swedish, German or French. Middleton\u2019s playing fills in everything those words can\u2019t say, perfectly calibrated to support Alder but huge in its expressive scope. There will be discoveries here for all but the most dedicated song aficionados, from Rachmaninov\u2019s dreamy sensuousness and Sibelius\u2019s melancholic ardour, to Tchaikovsky\u2019s French numbers, which have an arch, almost salon-ish tinge.

      "body": "<p>The day before Ledell Lee was executed on 20 April 2017, he talked to the BBC from death row. He said that while he could not prevent the state of Arkansas from killing him, he had a message for his executioners: \u201cMy dying words will always be, as it has been: \u2018I am an innocent man\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Almost two years after Lee was strapped to a gurney and injected with a lethal cocktail of drugs, it looks increasingly likely he was telling the truth: he went to his death an innocent man. New evidence has emerged that suggests Lee was not guilty of the brutal murder of a woman in 1993 for which his life was taken.</p> <p>The deceased inmate\u2019s sister Patricia Young <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/ledell-lee-foia-complaint\">lodged a lawsuit</a> on Thursday with the circuit court of Pulaski county, Arkansas, petitioning city authorities and the local police department in Jacksonville to release crime scene materials to her family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/13/detroit-conviction-dismissed-gerry-thomas\">'Finally going home': Detroit man cleared of crimes after 30 years in prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ACLU and the Innocence Project, who are investigating the case on the family\u2019s behalf, believe state-of-the-art forensic examination of the materials, including DNA testing and fingerprint analysis, could definitively prove Arkansas did indeed execute an innocent man.</p> <p>An 81-page filing in the lawsuit provides damning new evidence that key aspects of the prosecution case against Lee were deeply flawed. The complaint includes expert opinion from a number of world-leading specialists who find glaring errors in the way forensic science and other evidence was interpreted.</p> <p>The lawsuit also includes a bombshell affidavit from Lee\u2019s post-conviction attorney who admits to having struggled with substance abuse and addiction throughout the years in which he represented him.</p> <p>Lawyers who prepared the filing, led by Cassandra Stubbs of the ACLU and the Innocence Project\u2019s Nina Morrison, conclude: \u201cIt is now clear that the state\u2019s forensic experts from trial misinterpreted the evidence in plain sight, and their flawed opinions were further distorted by the state in its zeal to convict [Lee] of the crime. The new evidence raises deeply troubling questions about the shaky evidentiary pillars on which the state executed Ledell Lee.\u201d</p> <p>Innocence has always been the achilles heel of America\u2019s death penalty: how to justify judicially killing prisoners who may have been wrongfully convicted. The question is far from academic: since 1973 no fewer than 167 death row inmates have been exonerated.</p> <p>The most harrowing question is whether innocent prisoners have been executed before the flawed nature of their convictions emerged. In recent years, there have been several cases that, with near certainty, suggest that innocent men have been put to death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73012895625a0de40c7a2728ee0e455dffdeee82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73012895625a0de40c7a2728ee0e455dffdeee82/0_115_4192_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this picture from April 2017 Ledell Lee, second top right, is shown with other Arkansas inmates scheduled for execution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In this picture from April 2017 Ledell Lee, second top right, is shown with other Arkansas inmates scheduled for execution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arkansas department of corrections/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/letter-from-witness-casts-further-doubt-on-2004-texas-execution/2015/03/09/d9ebdab8-c451-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html\">Cameron Todd Willingham</a> executed in Texas in 2004 for allegedly having caused a fire that killed his three young daughters. After the execution, further evidence emerged that conclusively showed that he could not have set the fire.</p> <p>The Columbia Human Rights Law Review carried out a groundbreaking investigation in which it concluded Carlos DeLuna was innocent when he was executed \u2013 also by Texas \u2013 in 1989. The six-year study discovered that the convicted prisoner had almost certainly been confused with another man, a violent criminal who shared the name Carlos.</p> <p>Now Ledell Lee looks as though he may be added to the grim rollcall of the wrongly executed. He relentlessly insisted he was not guilty from the moment he was arrested less than two hours after the brutally beaten body of Debra Reese was discovered in her home in Jacksonville on 9 February 1993.</p> <p>The difficulties with the case against Lee began almost immediately. He was picked up nowhere near the crime scene and was not in possession of any possessions that could be linked to the break-in at Reese\u2019s home.</p> <p>The only evidence against him was inconclusive at best. There were two eyewitnesses, but they gave conflicting reports of the suspect\u2019s identification.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In recent years, there have been several cases that, with near certainty, suggest innocent men have been put to death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The crime scene was shocking, with blood splattered over the walls and floor. Yet when Lee was arrested on the same day detectives could find no blood on his clothes or body including under his fingernails and nothing was found in a forensic search of his house.</p> <p>Given the paucity of evidence, it is not surprising that it took two trials to find Lee guilty and sentence him to death. The first trial collapsed after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.</p> <p>The ACLU and Innocence Project took up Lee\u2019s case very late in the day having been asked to get involved shortly before his scheduled execution date. What they discovered when they opened the case records astounded even these experienced death penalty lawyers.</p> <p>Very quickly they established there were major problems with the prosecution case against Lee. One area that especially concerned them was the inadequacy of Lee\u2019s legal representation, both during the second trial in which defense attorneys inexplicably failed to call alibi witnesses that could have placed Lee elsewhere at the time of the murder, and in terms of the help he received at the appeal stage of his case.</p> <p>At one post-conviction hearing, a lawyer working for the state of Arkansas approached the judge and raised concerns about Lee\u2019s attorney, Craig Lambert. \u201cYour honor, I don\u2019t do this lightly, but I\u2019m going to ask that the court require him to submit to a drug test,\u201d the counsel said. \u201cHe\u2019s just not with us \u2026 His speech is slurred.\u201d</p> <p>In an affidavit obtained since Lee\u2019s execution, signed by Lambert in October, the lawyer admits: \u201cI was struggling with substance abuse and addiction in those years. I attended inpatient rehab. Ledell\u2019s case was massive and I wasn\u2019t in the best place personally to do what was necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Partly as a result of poor legal representation, terrible errors were made in Lee\u2019s defense \u2013 both at trial and for years afterwards during the appeals process. The complaint goes into detail about these \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d shortcomings.</p> <p>One of the key examples relates to the marks found on the victim\u2019s cheek. The state\u2019s experts mistakenly interpreted the marks as having come from a pattern on a rug in Reese\u2019s bedroom where she had been beaten to death with a wooden tire club.</p> <p>In fact, the filing says, the pattern on the body\u2019s cheek did not match that on the rug. Instead it was consistent with the murderer stomping on Reese\u2019s face directly with his shoe.</p> <p>That is critically significant because the shoes that Lee was wearing that day, which the state used during the trial as evidence against him, were incompatible in the composition of their soles with the injury pattern on Reese\u2019s face.</p> <p>To establish this point, an affidavit is provided by Michael Baden, former chief pathologist for New York who is recognized internationally as a leading forensic pathologist. He concludes: \u201cThe soles of Mr Lee\u2019s sneakers have a much more closely spaced pattern than was transferred in the cheek imprint.\u201d</p> <p>That inconsistency is just one of many that were uncovered when Baden and four other specialists were invited to review the case.</p> <p>Lee was executed in a flurry. When the state of Arkansas realized its supply of one of its three lethal drugs, the sedative midazolam, was about to expire at the end of 2017 with no hope of replacing it due to a global ban on medicines being sent to the US for use in executions, it went into overdrive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4f1d0782357820dfca081a91d6eee377cc6d38f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4f1d0782357820dfca081a91d6eee377cc6d38f/0_0_2027_1431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters outside the state capitol in Little Rock in April 2017 voice their opposition to the executions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters outside the state capitol in Little Rock in April 2017 voice their opposition to the executions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kelly P.

      "bodyText": "The day before Ledell Lee was executed on 20 April 2017, he talked to the BBC from death row. He said that while he could not prevent the state of Arkansas from killing him, he had a message for his executioners: \u201cMy dying words will always be, as it has been: \u2018I am an innocent man\u2019.\u201d Almost two years after Lee was strapped to a gurney and injected with a lethal cocktail of drugs, it looks increasingly likely he was telling the truth: he went to his death an innocent man. New evidence has emerged that suggests Lee was not guilty of the brutal murder of a woman in 1993 for which his life was taken. The deceased inmate\u2019s sister Patricia Young lodged a lawsuit on Thursday with the circuit court of Pulaski county, Arkansas, petitioning city authorities and the local police department in Jacksonville to release crime scene materials to her family. The ACLU and the Innocence Project, who are investigating the case on the family\u2019s behalf, believe state-of-the-art forensic examination of the materials, including DNA testing and fingerprint analysis, could definitively prove Arkansas did indeed execute an innocent man. An 81-page filing in the lawsuit provides damning new evidence that key aspects of the prosecution case against Lee were deeply flawed. The complaint includes expert opinion from a number of world-leading specialists who find glaring errors in the way forensic science and other evidence was interpreted. The lawsuit also includes a bombshell affidavit from Lee\u2019s post-conviction attorney who admits to having struggled with substance abuse and addiction throughout the years in which he represented him. Lawyers who prepared the filing, led by Cassandra Stubbs of the ACLU and the Innocence Project\u2019s Nina Morrison, conclude: \u201cIt is now clear that the state\u2019s forensic experts from trial misinterpreted the evidence in plain sight, and their flawed opinions were further distorted by the state in its zeal to convict [Lee] of the crime. The new evidence raises deeply troubling questions about the shaky evidentiary pillars on which the state executed Ledell Lee.\u201d Innocence has always been the achilles heel of America\u2019s death penalty: how to justify judicially killing prisoners who may have been wrongfully convicted. The question is far from academic: since 1973 no fewer than 167 death row inmates have been exonerated. The most harrowing question is whether innocent prisoners have been executed before the flawed nature of their convictions emerged. In recent years, there have been several cases that, with near certainty, suggest that innocent men have been put to death. They include Cameron Todd Willingham executed in Texas in 2004 for allegedly having caused a fire that killed his three young daughters. After the execution, further evidence emerged that conclusively showed that he could not have set the fire. The Columbia Human Rights Law Review carried out a groundbreaking investigation in which it concluded Carlos DeLuna was innocent when he was executed \u2013 also by Texas \u2013 in 1989. The six-year study discovered that the convicted prisoner had almost certainly been confused with another man, a violent criminal who shared the name Carlos. Now Ledell Lee looks as though he may be added to the grim rollcall of the wrongly executed. He relentlessly insisted he was not guilty from the moment he was arrested less than two hours after the brutally beaten body of Debra Reese was discovered in her home in Jacksonville on 9 February 1993. The difficulties with the case against Lee began almost immediately. He was picked up nowhere near the crime scene and was not in possession of any possessions that could be linked to the break-in at Reese\u2019s home. The only evidence against him was inconclusive at best. There were two eyewitnesses, but they gave conflicting reports of the suspect\u2019s identification. The crime scene was shocking, with blood splattered over the walls and floor. Yet when Lee was arrested on the same day detectives could find no blood on his clothes or body including under his fingernails and nothing was found in a forensic search of his house. Given the paucity of evidence, it is not surprising that it took two trials to find Lee guilty and sentence him to death. The first trial collapsed after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The ACLU and Innocence Project took up Lee\u2019s case very late in the day having been asked to get involved shortly before his scheduled execution date. What they discovered when they opened the case records astounded even these experienced death penalty lawyers. Very quickly they established there were major problems with the prosecution case against Lee. One area that especially concerned them was the inadequacy of Lee\u2019s legal representation, both during the second trial in which defense attorneys inexplicably failed to call alibi witnesses that could have placed Lee elsewhere at the time of the murder, and in terms of the help he received at the appeal stage of his case. At one post-conviction hearing, a lawyer working for the state of Arkansas approached the judge and raised concerns about Lee\u2019s attorney, Craig Lambert. \u201cYour honor, I don\u2019t do this lightly, but I\u2019m going to ask that the court require him to submit to a drug test,\u201d the counsel said. \u201cHe\u2019s just not with us \u2026 His speech is slurred.\u201d In an affidavit obtained since Lee\u2019s execution, signed by Lambert in October, the lawyer admits: \u201cI was struggling with substance abuse and addiction in those years. I attended inpatient rehab. Ledell\u2019s case was massive and I wasn\u2019t in the best place personally to do what was necessary.\u201d Partly as a result of poor legal representation, terrible errors were made in Lee\u2019s defense \u2013 both at trial and for years afterwards during the appeals process. The complaint goes into detail about these \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d shortcomings. One of the key examples relates to the marks found on the victim\u2019s cheek. The state\u2019s experts mistakenly interpreted the marks as having come from a pattern on a rug in Reese\u2019s bedroom where she had been beaten to death with a wooden tire club. In fact, the filing says, the pattern on the body\u2019s cheek did not match that on the rug. Instead it was consistent with the murderer stomping on Reese\u2019s face directly with his shoe. That is critically significant because the shoes that Lee was wearing that day, which the state used during the trial as evidence against him, were incompatible in the composition of their soles with the injury pattern on Reese\u2019s face. To establish this point, an affidavit is provided by Michael Baden, former chief pathologist for New York who is recognized internationally as a leading forensic pathologist. He concludes: \u201cThe soles of Mr Lee\u2019s sneakers have a much more closely spaced pattern than was transferred in the cheek imprint.\u201d That inconsistency is just one of many that were uncovered when Baden and four other specialists were invited to review the case. Lee was executed in a flurry. When the state of Arkansas realized its supply of one of its three lethal drugs, the sedative midazolam, was about to expire at the end of 2017 with no hope of replacing it due to a global ban on medicines being sent to the US for use in executions, it went into overdrive. It announced plans to kill eight prisoners in 11 days. The declaration prompted revulsion from around the US and the world and accusations that the state was engaging in conveyor-belt executions. It was in that climate that attempts by the ACLU and the Innocence Project to have materials gathered at the crime scene of Reese\u2019s murder released for DNA testing fell on deaf ears. Though the lawyers presented a strong argument that DNA testing could be crucial in casting doubt on Lee\u2019s conviction and pointing towards the real killer, a federal district court denied the request on grounds that Lee had \u201csimply delayed too long\u201d in asking for the materials. It is too late now for Lee. But his lawyers hope that it is not too late to get to the bottom of the case posthumously. The city of Jacksonville is in possession of a rich array of crime scene materials including \u201cNegroid\u201d hairs collected from Reese\u2019s bedroom and fingernail scrapings likely to contain DNA from the actual killer \u2013 Lee or otherwise. \u201cThis evidence can now be tested with state-of-the-art methods unavailable at trial, and compared to Mr Lee\u2019s unique DNA profile,\u201d the filing says. After a welter of legal challenges, Arkansas succeeded in killing four prisoners in one week, including the first double execution held in the US in a single day since 2001. The first of the four to die was Ledell Lee. Should Arkansas now agree belatedly to hand over the crime scene materials for testing, he may yet be proven to have been, just as he always said he was, an innocent man.",

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has sought to reassure business that there will be no wholesale dumping of EU regulations as he pledged there would be no divergence after Brexit for the sake of it. Speaking at the CBI lunch in Davos, the chancellor addressed the question of whether the UK would stay aligned with the EU rulebook \u2013 seen as a crucial issue by aerospace and automotive companies in the UK. \u201cWe are leaving the EU, the single market and the customs union,\u201d Javid said. \u201cAnd we are doing that so that we can have control of our rules and laws.\u201d But pressed in a question and answer session as to how ministers would act in practice, Javid said: \u201cWe won\u2019t diverge just for the sake of it\u201d. Earlier in the speech, he said the government would \u201calways protect the interests of British businesses\u201d as the country left the EU. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll maintain high standards \u2013 not because we are told to, but because we want to. It\u2019s what the British people want.\u201d Businesses in some key sectors of the economy were alarmed by an interview given by the chancellor to the Financial Times at the weekend in which he said companies had to adjust to the new reality of life outside the single market and the customs union. But over the past few days, Javid has refined his line and has been making clear that the government will only use the freedom to diverge if it thinks the change is worthwhile, and after the pros and cons have weighed up. Javid also made clear in his speech to UK business leaders at the World Economic Forum that the government had an eye on markets in the rest of the world. He said 90% of global growth in the next decade was going to come from outside Europe. \u201cThat creates huge opportunities. The UK has deep ties of history, language and culture with many of the countries driving this new growth. \u201cAnd our businesses already have fantastic trading relationships abroad. So we will reach out to the rest of the world at the same time as staying close to Europe.\u201d Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, said the White House expected to conclude a US-UK trade deal this year, while Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, said there were \u201cfar fewer issues between the UK and the US than there are between either of us and the EU\u201d. Javid said the decisive general election result provided a clean break that would allow the government to start tackling some of Britain\u2019s deep-seated economic problems. The UK was deficient in skills and infrastructure and had a growing productivity gap with the rest of the world. These were the same problems as when he first became an MP in 2010, he told the CBI lunch, adding that the country needed a \u201ccourse correction\u201d. \u201cIn Britain, there are too many people who feel hopeless and let down by the way politics and economics has worked. There is a sense of anger and betrayal in some communities. \u201cWe need to be honest with ourselves about why that\u2019s happened.

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday night Ed Woodward discovered another problem with the appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r as Manchester United\u2019s manager. The Norwegian, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2010/mar/24/manchester-united-bayern-munich-1999\" title=\"\">hero of the Camp Nou in 1999</a>, is all but unimpeachable even if his team play lumpen football and a series of ill-conceived decisions have exposed an unsuitability for top-level management.</p> \n<p>And so United\u2019s fans\u2019 ire must be directed elsewhere, and while the club\u2019s executive vice-chairman has been in the firing line for much of his near-seven years running the club, Solskj\u00e6r is not David Moyes, Louis van Gaal or Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, a hired hand who doubles as a human shield for Woodward. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna die, Ed Woodward is gonna die\u201d, as sung during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 home defeat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">by Burnley</a>, is a repurposed chant historically aimed at Manchester City, less a threat than a vivid, unseemly expression of hatred.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/23/manchester-united-standing-by-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-after-burnley-defeat-not-facing-sack\">Manchester United standing by Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r after Burnley defeat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Neil Ashton, the former Sun journalist and Sky Sports presenter whose new communications consultancy recently took on United as a client, with improving Woodward\u2019s status a key goal, has some job on his hands to repair the relationship between the club\u2019s de facto CEO and its supporters. \u201c[Woodward]\u2019s a guy that absolutely loves Manchester United,\u201d Ashton said last week. \u201cI want to change perception of not only himself but the ownership of the club.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woodward, though he rarely speaks on the record, is the frontman for the unpopular Glazer family, who will mark 15 years of ownership of United in May. Malcolm Glazer\u2019s leveraged buyout of United was valued at \u00a3790m at the time and leading the gripes against them is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/04/glazers-manchester-united\" title=\"\">\u00a31bn-plus drained from the club</a> in interest costs and dividends to Glazer\u2019s children; Glazer Sr died in May 2014. A November conference call for the New York Stock Exchange revealed the club\u2019s net debts were \u00a3384.5m, an increase of \u00a3137.1m on the previous year. The original debt saddled on the club in 2005 was \u00a3525m.</p> \n<p>A prominent accusation against the Glazers is that their ownership has leeched off the club\u2019s glorious history, and that without Sir Alex Ferguson in charge for the first eight years of their reign, they would have no business to speak of. Ferguson worked in close cahoots with David Gill, the former chief executive who stepped down in the same summer of 2013 and was effectively replaced by Woodward.</p> \n<p>The new man\u2019s rise was hardly without trace, since the Chelmsford-born former Bristol University physics graduate, a chartered accountant and former investment banker, had been a close ally of the Glazers since he advised them on that 2005 takeover when working for JP Morgan Chase. Woodward soon joined the club\u2019s commercial operation to become a star employee as United the asset was sweated heavily to help pay off what were cripplingly high-interest loans in the early years of the new ownership.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0733a13057991e84b2cf2d7f1dd66909d3e1a5da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0733a13057991e84b2cf2d7f1dd66909d3e1a5da/0_395_2702_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plane carries a message over Old Trafford in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plane carries a message over Old Trafford in October.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Operating from London, Woodward and Richard Arnold, United\u2019s group managing director who is an old friend from both Chelmsford and Bristol, pioneered a global and regional approach to marketing and sponsorship that sees United-endorsed soft drinks in Nigeria and nutritional supplements in Japan alongside worldwide deals with blue-chip companies such as Aon and Uber.</p> \n<p>The success of that strategy, since copied by United\u2019s peer clubs among the football elite, keeps United high in the revenue leagues and has made Woodward a rich man. He earns a reported \u00a33.15m a year, and possesses 539,000 Class A shares in Manchester United plc, valued at $10.8m, on which he receives healthy dividends. In the Old Trafford stands, however, he is decried as a leading architect of the club\u2019s fall from grace. It is not that United have not spent money \u2013 around \u00a3840m has been lavished on transfers since Ferguson retired and the club pays out the second-highest wage bill in football \u2013 but that it has been wasted on folly and failure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"142d5f40-8de5-40cb-bc98-bb28468ac056\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though Ferguson carried the can for Moyes\u2019s disastrous succession, Woodward is held responsible for the past three managerial appointments. Van Gaal was described by Woodward as \u201cthe perfect choice\u201d in the May 2014 press release that announced his arrival. Two years later, Mourinho was \u201csimply the best\u201d. Solskj\u00e6r, as his full-time appointment was confirmed last March, was the \u201cright person to take Manchester United forward\u201d.</p> \n<p>Time has proven each of those statements to be ill-fated. Last June Van Gaal described Woodward as someone with \u201czero understanding of football who was previously an investment banker\u201d to hit upon a widely held view. Despite his long involvement in the game, Woodward has never been the \u201cfootball man\u201d in the fashion that his predecessor, Gill, himself a chartered accountant and a former management consultant, became accepted as.</p> \n<p>Since that first 2013 summer in charge, when Gill\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s contacts books were abandoned by the new broom, United have struggled dreadfully in the transfer market, getting burned on flops such as \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, while enduring rocky \u2013 and costly \u2013 relationships with super-agents such as Jorge Mendes and Mino Raiola.</p> \n<p>A long-trailed appointment of a technical director who would be responsible for transfer business has never come to pass, and so Woodward is in the public firing line for transfer sagas such as the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/manchester-united-baulk-sporting-bruno-fernandes-80-million-valuation\" title=\"\">haggling over the Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes</a>. As with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s failings and the whims of the Glazers, it puts him in the centre of the Manchester United storm.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday night Ed Woodward discovered another problem with the appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r as Manchester United\u2019s manager. The Norwegian, the hero of the Camp Nou in 1999, is all but unimpeachable even if his team play lumpen football and a series of ill-conceived decisions have exposed an unsuitability for top-level management. And so United\u2019s fans\u2019 ire must be directed elsewhere, and while the club\u2019s executive vice-chairman has been in the firing line for much of his near-seven years running the club, Solskj\u00e6r is not David Moyes, Louis van Gaal or Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, a hired hand who doubles as a human shield for Woodward. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna die, Ed Woodward is gonna die\u201d, as sung during the 2-0 home defeat by Burnley, is a repurposed chant historically aimed at Manchester City, less a threat than a vivid, unseemly expression of hatred. Neil Ashton, the former Sun journalist and Sky Sports presenter whose new communications consultancy recently took on United as a client, with improving Woodward\u2019s status a key goal, has some job on his hands to repair the relationship between the club\u2019s de facto CEO and its supporters. \u201c[Woodward]\u2019s a guy that absolutely loves Manchester United,\u201d Ashton said last week. \u201cI want to change perception of not only himself but the ownership of the club.\u201d Woodward, though he rarely speaks on the record, is the frontman for the unpopular Glazer family, who will mark 15 years of ownership of United in May. Malcolm Glazer\u2019s leveraged buyout of United was valued at \u00a3790m at the time and leading the gripes against them is the \u00a31bn-plus drained from the club in interest costs and dividends to Glazer\u2019s children; Glazer Sr died in May 2014. A November conference call for the New York Stock Exchange revealed the club\u2019s net debts were \u00a3384.5m, an increase of \u00a3137.1m on the previous year. The original debt saddled on the club in 2005 was \u00a3525m. A prominent accusation against the Glazers is that their ownership has leeched off the club\u2019s glorious history, and that without Sir Alex Ferguson in charge for the first eight years of their reign, they would have no business to speak of. Ferguson worked in close cahoots with David Gill, the former chief executive who stepped down in the same summer of 2013 and was effectively replaced by Woodward. The new man\u2019s rise was hardly without trace, since the Chelmsford-born former Bristol University physics graduate, a chartered accountant and former investment banker, had been a close ally of the Glazers since he advised them on that 2005 takeover when working for JP Morgan Chase. Woodward soon joined the club\u2019s commercial operation to become a star employee as United the asset was sweated heavily to help pay off what were cripplingly high-interest loans in the early years of the new ownership. Operating from London, Woodward and Richard Arnold, United\u2019s group managing director who is an old friend from both Chelmsford and Bristol, pioneered a global and regional approach to marketing and sponsorship that sees United-endorsed soft drinks in Nigeria and nutritional supplements in Japan alongside worldwide deals with blue-chip companies such as Aon and Uber. The success of that strategy, since copied by United\u2019s peer clubs among the football elite, keeps United high in the revenue leagues and has made Woodward a rich man. He earns a reported \u00a33.15m a year, and possesses 539,000 Class A shares in Manchester United plc, valued at $10.8m, on which he receives healthy dividends. In the Old Trafford stands, however, he is decried as a leading architect of the club\u2019s fall from grace. It is not that United have not spent money \u2013 around \u00a3840m has been lavished on transfers since Ferguson retired and the club pays out the second-highest wage bill in football \u2013 but that it has been wasted on folly and failure. Though Ferguson carried the can for Moyes\u2019s disastrous succession, Woodward is held responsible for the past three managerial appointments. Van Gaal was described by Woodward as \u201cthe perfect choice\u201d in the May 2014 press release that announced his arrival. Two years later, Mourinho was \u201csimply the best\u201d. Solskj\u00e6r, as his full-time appointment was confirmed last March, was the \u201cright person to take Manchester United forward\u201d. Time has proven each of those statements to be ill-fated. Last June Van Gaal described Woodward as someone with \u201czero understanding of football who was previously an investment banker\u201d to hit upon a widely held view. Despite his long involvement in the game, Woodward has never been the \u201cfootball man\u201d in the fashion that his predecessor, Gill, himself a chartered accountant and a former management consultant, became accepted as. Since that first 2013 summer in charge, when Gill\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s contacts books were abandoned by the new broom, United have struggled dreadfully in the transfer market, getting burned on flops such as \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, while enduring rocky \u2013 and costly \u2013 relationships with super-agents such as Jorge Mendes and Mino Raiola. A long-trailed appointment of a technical director who would be responsible for transfer business has never come to pass, and so Woodward is in the public firing line for transfer sagas such as the current haggling over the Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes. As with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s failings and the whims of the Glazers, it puts him in the centre of the Manchester United storm.",

      "bodyText": "Quentin Tarantino has joined Martin Scorsese in voicing discontent at the dominance of franchise and superhero films, suggesting there is a \u201cwar for movies\u201d taking place between \u201coriginal\u201d film-making and blockbuster \u201ccommercial product\u201d. Tarantino told the news site Deadline: \u201cThe commercial product that is owned by the conglomerates, the projects everybody knows about and has in their DNA, whether it be the Marvel Comics, the Star Wars, Godzilla and James Bond, those films never had a better year than last year.\u201d However, he said the \u201cworld domination\u201d of such films was foiled as \u201ca lot of original movie [content] came out and demanded to be seen, and demanded to be seen at the theatres.\u201d Although not citing his own film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (which has been nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture and best director), Tarantino bracketed himself with \u201ccinema that doesn\u2019t fall into that blockbuster IP [intellectual property] status\u201d, and added, \u201cI\u2019m really proud to be nominated with the other films.\u201d Tarantino also suggested \u201coriginal\u201d film-making was in \u201ccombat\u201d with movies such as Avengers: Endgame and Star Wars, and that the success of such features \u2013 which are likely to include fellow Oscar-nominated work such as Joker, 1917 and Little Women \u2013 was vital to keep the blockbusters at bay. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t done it this year, it might have been the last stand for movies like that.\u201d Tarantino\u2019s remarks follow the furore sparked by Martin Scorsese in October, who described superhero movies as \u201cnot cinema\u201d, and later said the dominance of the franchises \u201cfills [him] with terrible sadness\u201d. Scorsese\u2019s position was supported by film-makers including Francis Ford Coppola and Ken Loach, while key figures in franchise film-making, such as Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and Avengers director Joss Whedon, defended their work. Like Scorsese, Tarantino signalled his commitment to theatrically released drama, and summarised a conversation he had had with Sony Pictures chair Tom Rothman. He said, paraphrasing Rothman: \u201cIf this movie [Once Upon a Time in Hollywood] is a hit, we will show people they need to go to the movie theatre to see it. There will be an interest in it, and it\u2019s going to come out, and people are going to leave their houses to see it. That\u2019s how the industry will judge whether or not it\u2019s a success.\u201d Taranatino added: \u201cI still had to make the movie, though. There were so many ways along the line we could have f\u2019d up. But we made the film and [Rothman] made the theatrical run a success.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As the Australian Open staggers towards the end of an eventful first week through hail, heat and polluted dust bombs, there was relief for Dominic Thiem, encouragement for Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev and confirmation that world No 1 Rafael Nadal is still dangerous away from clay. Actually, when the dirt fell in an overnight deluge that briefly held Melbourne in an ochre embrace, it very much looked like a clay-court tournament until attendants power-hosed away gobbets and blankets of sticky dust, delaying the start by two hours in many cases. They call Australia the Lucky Country. As in life, so in tennis \u2013 for some but not everyone. As much as the first slam of the season is supposed to be an outdoor tournament \u2013 like all the majors \u2013 the delineation between the haves and have-nots has been impossible to ignore in a continent famously \u2018girt by sea\u2019 where the elements can be cruel under the sun, or hailstones. After Medvedev sped into the third round past the Spanish qualifier, Pedro Martinez, in a touch over two hours under the roof on Margaret Court Arena, he was asked if he was glad to have avoided the chaos whirring around them. \u201cI was lucky that it was raining at the beginning, so we had to close the roof,\u201d the Russian said. \u201cAt the same time, I like to play outdoors. I like to play indoors. I just like hard courts. As soon as the roof is closed, everything is different. It gets hotter, more humid inside. The ball goes faster. The sound of the ball, even, is different. Today, it was to my advantage. Sometimes it can be not to your disadvantage. Playing on Rod Laver or Court 3, it\u2019s going to be completely different. You just have to adjust.\u201d When John Millman suggested he wanted to play Federer on a smaller court than Rod Laver \u2013 the Swiss\u2019s home away from home for most of his 20 visits here \u2013 he was joking \u2026 sort of. When the Australian shocked Federer and tennis by beating him in the fourth round of the 2018 US Open, it was on the tournament\u2019s biggest court, Arthur Ashe.

Babies, infants and older people, as well as smokers and heavy drinkers, are at higher risk.

As a parent of a toddler, I\u2019m not immune to Paw Patrol pester power. But I find the cinema outings soulless and depressing: three-year-olds disappearing into gawping trances, parents into the glow of their phones.</p> <p>The new film feels like a cut-price knockoff of Pixar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/28/animation.family\">Cars</a>, with a dull plot about a rally tournament where the star driver is a flashy but nice kid called the Whoosh (voiced by Joseph Motiki) and the Paw Patrol gang\u2019s job is to crew the pitstop during the race. The villain is mega-sneaky racing driver Cheetah (Addison Holley), who introduces yet another irritatingly repetitive Paw Patrol catchphrase: \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, cheat \u2019em!\u201d When the Whoosh crashes out after being nobbled by Cheetah, firefighter pup Marshall (Lukas Engel) must take his place behind the wheel.</p> <p>Can Marshall dodge Cheetah\u2019s dirty tricks and overcome his lack of confidence to take first place? All the usual believe-in-yourself, hard-work-wins messages apply, alongside some screechy tyre-burning action.

      "bodyText": "They sure do churn em out. Here\u2019s another episode of Nickelodeon\u2019s animated TV show about a team of rescue dogs, jazzed up and padded out into a 48-minute cinema package. As a parent of a toddler, I\u2019m not immune to Paw Patrol pester power. But I find the cinema outings soulless and depressing: three-year-olds disappearing into gawping trances, parents into the glow of their phones. The new film feels like a cut-price knockoff of Pixar\u2019s Cars, with a dull plot about a rally tournament where the star driver is a flashy but nice kid called the Whoosh (voiced by Joseph Motiki) and the Paw Patrol gang\u2019s job is to crew the pitstop during the race. The villain is mega-sneaky racing driver Cheetah (Addison Holley), who introduces yet another irritatingly repetitive Paw Patrol catchphrase: \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, cheat \u2019em!\u201d When the Whoosh crashes out after being nobbled by Cheetah, firefighter pup Marshall (Lukas Engel) must take his place behind the wheel. Can Marshall dodge Cheetah\u2019s dirty tricks and overcome his lack of confidence to take first place? All the usual believe-in-yourself, hard-work-wins messages apply, alongside some screechy tyre-burning action. But there\u2019s zero here for adults: Paw Patrol is action with stabilisers, training little kids up for big kid bangs. It\u2019s so aggressively targeted at pre-schoolers that in no sense can you call it a family movie. And parents who\u2019ve forked out for a flashing Paw Patrol toothbrush may blow a piston at the running gag about the Whoosh being a walking product placement, constantly mugging for the camera in his own branded merch. Paw Patrol: Ready, Race, Rescue! is released in the UK on 24 January.",

According to prosecutors, the gang had also allegedly made profits by producing fake family reunification documents, charging migrants $10,000-15,000 (\u00a37,000-10,000) for the paperwork that would help their relatives reach Europe.

Prosecutors in Palermo had asked that they receive life sentences.</p> <p>\u201cThe first move by authorities in the fight against traffickers is to arrest boat drivers, the men at the helm of the vessels carrying migrants,\u201d said Cinzia Pecoraro, an immigration lawyer. \u201cThey can get sentences of up to 15 years in prison. But if a migrant drowns during the crossing, then the boat drivers are held responsible for that death. The fact is that boat drivers have nothing to do with migrant smuggling.\u201d</p> <p>Gigi Omar Modica, a judge at the court of Palermo who in September 2016 took the decision to drop smuggling charges against two boat drivers, said people charged with smuggling were often migrants themselves who had been coerced into the role. \u201cSmugglers almost always force boat drivers to sail, sometimes threatening them with a gun,\u201d said Modica.</p> <p>Investigations against boat drivers are based on the testimony of other passengers, who, as stated in recent verdicts from court cases, were persuaded to testify against the men at the helm of the vessels in exchange for permits to stay in Italy.</p> <p>The failure of the Italian government to manage the human-trafficking phenomenon was also pointed out last June by the US government.

Countless migrants ended up under investigation for having friended a suspected smuggler on Facebook or were arrested upon their landing because of incriminating photos received on WhatsApp.</p> <p>\u201cWe are doing everything wrong,\u201d said Simona Fernandez, president of Associazione Salam, a non-profit organisation carrying out migrant reception projects. \u201cAnd countless innocent refugees are paying the highest price of our stubbornness. They came to Europe to seek asylum. They have found instead jail.\u201d</p>",

Prosecutors in Palermo had asked that they receive life sentences. \u201cThe first move by authorities in the fight against traffickers is to arrest boat drivers, the men at the helm of the vessels carrying migrants,\u201d said Cinzia Pecoraro, an immigration lawyer. \u201cThey can get sentences of up to 15 years in prison. But if a migrant drowns during the crossing, then the boat drivers are held responsible for that death. The fact is that boat drivers have nothing to do with migrant smuggling.\u201d Gigi Omar Modica, a judge at the court of Palermo who in September 2016 took the decision to drop smuggling charges against two boat drivers, said people charged with smuggling were often migrants themselves who had been coerced into the role. \u201cSmugglers almost always force boat drivers to sail, sometimes threatening them with a gun,\u201d said Modica. Investigations against boat drivers are based on the testimony of other passengers, who, as stated in recent verdicts from court cases, were persuaded to testify against the men at the helm of the vessels in exchange for permits to stay in Italy. The failure of the Italian government to manage the human-trafficking phenomenon was also pointed out last June by the US government. The Department of State\u2019s 2019 Trafficking in Persons report downgraded Italy to tier 2, citing the fact that the country \u201cdoes not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking\u201d. In the absence of reliable data and mug shots of suspected traffickers, the authorities have come to rely on social media to identify smugglers. Countless migrants ended up under investigation for having friended a suspected smuggler on Facebook or were arrested upon their landing because of incriminating photos received on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are doing everything wrong,\u201d said Simona Fernandez, president of Associazione Salam, a non-profit organisation carrying out migrant reception projects. \u201cAnd countless innocent refugees are paying the highest price of our stubbornness. They came to Europe to seek asylum. They have found instead jail.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>40. Blow Out (1993)</strong></h2> <p>Save a riotous airing on 1994\u2019s Live at the Astoria, Pablo Honey\u2019s closer rarely intrudes on Radiohead lore. A shame \u2013 because it\u2019s a tantalising finale: the sound of a nervous band storming the city limits and glimpsing Valhalla.</p> <h2><strong>39. The Daily Mail (2011)</strong></h2> <p>Culling this weirdo jamboree from the tranquil King of Limbs was a no-brainer. As a stand-alone, though, it\u2019s irresistible, suggesting an unlikely kinship between Radiohead and the venerable pop cynic Randy Newman: musical-theatre flair weaponised against tabloid hysteria.</p> <h2><strong>38. Spectre (2015)</strong></h2> <p>The band\u2019s rejected Bond theme has assumed the identity of a curiously viable Radiohead song. Thom Yorke is persuasive \u2013 if not exactly suave \u2013 in character as the secret agent, but credit Jonny Greenwood, as we often must, with its emotive thwack.</p> <h2><strong>37. Kid A (2000)</strong></h2> <p>Driven to despair by OK Computer\u2019s runaway success, Yorke faced a perilous choice: sacrifice his sanity in exchange for astronomical fame or persuade Ed O\u2019Brien to get into Autechre. On Kid A, the second option won out: sequestered away with Greenwood, Yorke produced much that haunts and a little \u2013 like the title track \u2013 that gleams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28f490c4956e4278b52641580a30da40cc84520a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28f490c4956e4278b52641580a30da40cc84520a/0_64_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yorke performing in Manchester in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yorke performing in Manchester in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>36. Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box (2001)</strong></h2> <p>After decrying consumerism, swerving into outre avant-rock and selling millions of records anyway, Radiohead learned the hard way that condemning society would just make them even richer. Trying a new tack, the Amnesiac opener layers anxious ticks and gamelan-style chimes before gently lampooning a \u201creasonable man\u201d with an uneasy conscience.</p> <h2><strong>35. Burn the Witch (2016)</strong></h2> <p>Once the band\u2019s secret weapon, Greenwood is now a garlanded composer and Radiohead\u2019s melodic powerhouse. Finally entrusted to build an arrangement from scratch, he turned the live favourite Burn the Witch into this orchestral jaunt. The iffy tour version \u2013 shorn of strings and charm \u2013 attests to his handiwork on the recording.</p> <h2><strong>34. Creep (1993)</strong></h2> <p>Radiohead\u2019s biggest hit is so beautiful and corny, it is impossible to accept it on its own terms. \u201cI want you to notice when I\u2019m not around,\u201d Yorke broods, a perfect lyric he probably hates. In the end, the band\u2019s disavowal of the song sent its credibility full circle. Nowadays, Creep is a joke, but we\u2019re all blissfully in on it.</p> <h2><strong>33. Scatterbrain (2003)</strong></h2> <p>An unsung gem from Hail to the Thief, Scatterbrain prescribes halting rhythms and deconstructed chords to a narrator fretting over his identity. As birds and newspaper pages thrash in a gale, Yorke, too, longs for chaos. The tantalising, unresolved chords mock him, but enchant us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9266ac27638c436293ca1e288bc5dfc6a476945e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9266ac27638c436293ca1e288bc5dfc6a476945e/0_0_1280_455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radiohead \u2026 2016 vintage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"355\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radiohead \u2026 2016 vintage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>32. Just (1995)</strong></h2> <p>Post-Creep, Radiohead were poised between grunge and Britpop. Just is a time capsule at the crossroads: hailstorm distortion meets perky hooks, wily vocals and \u2013 Yorke\u2019s mischievous challenge to Greenwood \u2013 an absurd pageant of guitar chords. The chorus flips the grunge ethos on its head, swapping self-loathing for theatrical vitriol.</p> <h2><strong>31. 2+2=5 (Live at Earls Court) (2004)</strong></h2> <p>As the Iraq war protests floundered, Yorke sporadically logged on to radiohead.com to denounce New Labour and the warmongering \u201cthief\u201d in the White House. 2+2=5 is his polemical anthem for the era of mass-broadcast deception and enhanced interrogation techniques, captured thrillingly in this Com Lag EP version.</p> <h2><strong>30. Morning Bell (2000)</strong></h2> <p>Kid A\u2019s unorthodox breakup song was later resurrected as Morning Bell/Amnesia (\u201clike a recurring dream,\u201d <a href=\"http://taminogruber.com/icyeyes/spinwithagrin.htm\" title=\"\">Yorke observed</a>), but keep room in your heart for the cold-sweats original. Only a melody so blissfully innocent could withstand such jittery, nightmarish contortions.</p> <h2><strong>29. No Surprises (1997)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5CVsCnxyXg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5CVsCnxyXg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>No Surprises.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Radiohead\u2019s most misunderstood protagonist has it made: the house, the garden, the heart full up \u201clike a landfill\u201d, the \u201cjob that slowly kills you\u201d\u2026 and how lovely it all sounds. Can a radical conscience coexist with suburban comforts, No Surprises asks? For all that it soothes, this one is pessimistic.</p> <h2><strong>28. Lucky (1995)</strong></h2> <p>The Bends had vamped and snarled for the gallery, but Lucky \u2013 recorded for a War Child compilation \u2013 signalled deeper concerns and higher stakes. Creeping riffs, melodic blasts and shameless melodrama laid the groundwork for OK Computer while cementing the band\u2019s partnership with the producer Nigel Godrich.</p> <h2><strong>27. There There (2003)</strong></h2> <p>After the divisive Kid A/Amnesiac era, Hail to the Thief\u2019s lead single felt diplomatic \u2013 no more sacrilegious than Blur\u2019s experiments at around the same time. Its hooks and arrangement were deceptively crafty, though, making its turbulent climax hard to shake.</p> <h2><strong>26. Where I End and You Begin (2003)</strong></h2> <p>Sequenced in the mid-album swamp of Hail to the Thief, Where I End and You Begin is a maligned masterclass in broody synthpop. With Yorke \u201cup in the clouds\u201d and Greenwood making spaceship sounds, the rhythm section straps in and goes full New Order, hurtling towards an ecstatic climax.</p> <h2><strong>25. Everything in Its Right Place (2000)</strong></h2> <p>Where OK Computer declared \u201cI am born again\u201d, Kid A dives straight into obfuscation: its opener\u2019s choppy vocal gibberish more closely resembles the \u201cunborn chicken voices\u201d plaguing the Paranoid Android. Like David Byrne before him, Yorke had renounced his authorship to flirt with self-erasure, yielding to gorgeously sunlit synths.</p> <h2><strong>24. Harry Patch (In Memory Of) (2009)</strong></h2> <p>A later-career treasure, Radiohead\u2019s tribute to the last surviving combat soldier of the first world war shows how much ground they have barely touched. With just a funereal, cinematic string section for company, Yorke sends his falsetto out over the trenches, an innocent witness to \u201cdemons coming up from the ground\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>23. Daydreaming (2016)</strong></h2> <p>Beneath the tiptoeing pianos, Daydreaming is a gut-wrencher. In a lyric some have linked to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/20/thom-yorkes-ex-partner-rachel-owen-dies-at-48\" title=\"\">late long-term partner</a>, Yorke finds himself sleepwalking \u201cbeyond the point of no return\u201d, before repeating a mournful mantra, \u201cHalf of my life\u201d, played in reverse. The timeline matches that relationship\u2019s duration and, equally, the lifespan of Radiohead.</p> <h2><strong>22. Subterranean Homesick Alien (1997)</strong></h2> <p>Plunged into a shimmering dreamscape, Yorke observes a fleet of aliens surveying humanity. What, the interlopers wonder, is up with these oddballs? In fact, it\u2019s all an excuse for Yorke\u2019s alienated narrator to ask himself: am I the problem or is society? Radiohead exist to petition for the second option; here, however, was sweet ambiguity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db8b982f2b31f185d2e52a1313e887d579bfc203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db8b982f2b31f185d2e52a1313e887d579bfc203/0_61_2015_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The band circa 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The band circa 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>21. A Wolf at the Door (2003)</strong></h2> <p>Insufficiently radical to some, Hail to the Thief staged a hit-and-miss venture into a new songwriting idiom. Among the hits, far and away the zaniest track was the album closer: a nightmarish waltz resembling a mutant Bends castoff, capped by a curmudgeonly rap about capitalist thugs and politicians taking cream pies to the face.</p> <h2><strong>20. Like Spinning Plates (2000)</strong></h2> <p>After hearing their song I Will being rewound on tape, Yorke decided the backwards version was \u201cmiles better\u201d and recast it as Like Spinning Plates. A complementary piano version, from the I Might Be Wrong live album, brings its spectral beauty into focus. Once you\u2019ve heard it, the original becomes indispensable.</p> <h2><strong>19. Motion Picture Soundtrack (2000)</strong></h2> <p>On an album bound to futuristic threats and technologies, Motion Picture Soundtrack\u2019s melancholy harmonium, fluttering harps and rolling, beatless expanse suggest a return to uncorrupted Eden. Tellingly, it originates from the band\u2019s youthful origins as On a Friday.</p> <h2><strong>18. Weird Fishes/Arpeggi (2007)</strong></h2> <p>Nigel Godrich settles into cruise control on this In Rainbows highlight, a rare haven from the band\u2019s omnipresent dread. Instead, Weird Fishes/Arpeggi evokes an all-too-perfect harmony: cascading arpeggios enchant while fragmentary lyrics caution against the lure of false prophets.</p> <h2><strong>17. True Love Waits (2016)</strong></h2> <p>Even when they\u2019re not facing the abyss, Radiohead songs tend to operate in its general vicinity, albeit without revealing what led there. But True Love Waits \u2013 sketched on an earlier live album and perfected 15 years later \u2013 conceals nothing: the abyss, listener, is love. \u201cI\u2019d drown my beliefs to have your babies,\u201d Yorke confesses woefully, wonderfully.</p> <h2><strong>16. Airbag (1997)</strong></h2> <p>After The Bends, the smart money had Radiohead scaling up for festival supremacy. OK Computer\u2019s opener took the bait then veered left: first the brain-melting deluge, then ripples of funk, a sexy drum lurch and some Maxinquaye basslines. Yorke \u2013 summoned \u201cback to save the universe\u201d \u2013 presides over the melee like a despairing god.</p> <h2><strong>15. Videotape (2007)</strong></h2> <p>On In Rainbows, Radiohead\u2019s cosiest album, Videotape is refreshingly, passionately despondent. Yorke vaguely evokes horrors \u2013 surveillance-state ennui, digital isolation, the gaze of an unforgiving deity \u2013 in a death-row drawl. Then, a change of heart: perhaps it was \u201cthe most perfect day I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, after all.</p> <h2><strong>14. Polyethylene (Pt 1 &amp; 2) (1997)</strong></h2> <p>Radiohead\u2019s greatest (although, somehow, not first) antiplastic jeremiad, this Paranoid Android B-side thrashes and struts like The Bends\u2019 glam evil twin. Far from the ham-fisted Fake Plastic Trees, Polyethylene is all malevolent snarl, bouncing off the walls in defiance of middle-class ecological hubris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3784536eeb0af7ab00ae5f287d54cdfede165a42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3784536eeb0af7ab00ae5f287d54cdfede165a42/0_2002_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thom Yorke in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Yorke in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>13. Knives Out (2001)</strong></h2> <p>The impenetrable Amnesiac debunked industry rumours that Radiohead were primed for a bankable comeback \u2013 but amid that album lay this meat-and-potatoes rocker, its scurrying riffs, mystic ambience and cannibalistic lyrics qualifying as glorious light relief.</p> <h2><strong>12. Street Spirit (Fade Out) (1995)</strong></h2> <p>Yorke once compared it to \u201cstaring the fucking devil right in the eyes\u201d and knowing \u201che\u2019ll get the last laugh\u201d. Street Spirit makes for a spectacular showdown \u2013 a grand, doomed surrender. If you need a chaser, consider another vintage Yorke quote: \u201cIf I was happy, I\u2019d be in a fucking car advert.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>11. Sail to the Moon (2003)</strong></h2> <p>Yorke\u2019s lullaby for his infant son has a distinctly bad-dreams vibe about it. Someone should probably have a word. Still, his good intent shines. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be president,\u201d Yorke rasps over writhing guitars. \u201cOr in the flood, you\u2019ll build an ark and sail us to the moon.\u201d For young Noah, big sustainable footwear to fill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b0c77951f21561a3e5a533d37a410089fbb13852\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0c77951f21561a3e5a533d37a410089fbb13852/0_24_2466_3081/800.jpg\" alt=\"Early 90s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early 90s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>10. My Iron Lung (1994)</strong></h2> <p>A dig at Creep\u2019s annoying popularity, My Iron Lung uses catchy hooks and brawny riffs to rally against commercialisation. It risks sounding bratty \u2013 it <em>is</em> bratty \u2013 but from insolence they fashioned a new identity: stadium-rock agitators declaring war on hypocrisy and greed \u2013 particularly their own.</p> <h2><strong>9. Exit Music (For a Film) (1997)</strong></h2> <p>Bewildering, still, that Radiohead composed this monstrous ballad for Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1996 flick Romeo + Juliet, partly because it\u2019s a high-stakes blockbuster of its own. Yorke has never sounded gloomier, with poisonous murmurs rising to a bloodcurdling fever pitch.</p> <h2><strong>8. The National Anthem (2000)</strong></h2> <p>At first conjuring arthouse delirium \u2013 improv skronk, transistor radio babble, warbling ondes martenot \u2013 Kid A\u2019s jazz-rock monster morphs into an electrical storm of brilliantly layered tension. Like a Mingus requiem, The National Anthem\u2019s power lies in the staggering weight of what is unresolved.</p> <h2><strong>7. Nude (2007)</strong></h2> <p>In Rainbows\u2019 online release prompted a global listening event anticipated unlike any since. Three tracks in, the magic happened. After kicking around in Radiohead lore for more than a decade, Nude had found stunning form, first by channelling Bj\u00f6rk \u2013 choppy coos, weeping strings \u2013 and then in a finale as bright and penetrating as dawn.</p> <h2><strong>6. Idioteque (2000)</strong></h2> <p>Yorke says he poured his most stubborn anxieties into Idioteque, which may explain why this pumping club tune \u2013 a formal anomaly \u2013 feels like Radiohead\u2019s chaotically distilled superego. Ecological dread, big-tech menace and catastrophic panic prevail, but that shiver-inducing synth sample doles out propaganda for hope.</p> <h2><strong>5. Karma Police (1997)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uYWYWPc9HU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1uYWYWPc9HU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Karma Police.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Part literary dystopia, part John Lennon in a Pixies T-shirt, Karma Police is an enduringly odd superhit: at once relatable, inscrutable and chilling. Such nuance is now Radiohead\u2019s bread and butter, but only so because Yorke learned, after much saccharine bumbling, to consolidate his bleak and mawkish impulses into one.</p> <h2><strong>4. Pyramid Song (2001)</strong></h2> <p>Since Kid A skimped on promo, Pyramid Song technically followed up the hit single No Surprises. For casual fans, a few surprises: lyrics alluding to Hermann Hesse\u2019s Siddhartha, piano seemingly exhumed from ancient civilisation and a newly spiritual Yorke, swimming with \u201cblack-eyed angels\u201d and a shoal of exes towards some nebulous afterlife. Torture for some; otherwise, cult-making.</p> <h2><strong>3. Reckoner (2007)</strong></h2> <p>Rock orthodoxy holds that a great band\u2019s nerve centre resides in a single genius \u2013 two at a push. Radiohead\u2019s greatest ensemble piece kills the myth for good. At first innocuous, Reckoner unspools a full house of virtuoso performances engulfed by Godrich\u2019s winter-blanket production. It soothes then soars.</p> <h2><strong>2. How to Disappear Completely (2000)</strong></h2> <p>Few admit it, but Radiohead\u2019s home turf is the desperately uncool milieu of avant garde balladry. How to Disappear Completely, a masterpiece of the form, orchestrates a stage-fright reverie with fragments of Robert Wyatt and Penderecki. In Kid A\u2019s supposedly cold heart it is pure affirmation: melancholy and light.</p> <h2><strong>1. Paranoid Android (1997)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHiGbolFFGw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fHiGbolFFGw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The video for Paranoid Android.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Britpop plunged from grace, Radiohead planted a revolutionary flag in the mountaintop. With OK Computer\u2019s salvo, they shed the skin of insurgent oddballs, ditched grungy radio rock and electrified the popular imagination. Paranoid Android draws less from contemporaries than their ancestors, notably \u2013 audaciously \u2013 within prog. The seven-minute odyssey plunders rock\u2019s then-forbidden city with burbling basslines and guitar wizardry so breathtaking nobody bothered to revoke Greenwood\u2019s daytime-radio visa. Elevated by Yorke\u2019s apocalyptic babbling and heavenly falsetto, we witness operatic scale and drama (\u201cThe dust and the screaming! The yuppies networking!\u201d) in a ludicrously catchy anthem. Paranoid Android stormed the castle and raised the drawbridge on rock\u2019s imperial era.</p>",

      "bodyText": "40. Blow Out (1993) Save a riotous airing on 1994\u2019s Live at the Astoria, Pablo Honey\u2019s closer rarely intrudes on Radiohead lore. A shame \u2013 because it\u2019s a tantalising finale: the sound of a nervous band storming the city limits and glimpsing Valhalla. 39. The Daily Mail (2011) Culling this weirdo jamboree from the tranquil King of Limbs was a no-brainer. As a stand-alone, though, it\u2019s irresistible, suggesting an unlikely kinship between Radiohead and the venerable pop cynic Randy Newman: musical-theatre flair weaponised against tabloid hysteria. 38. Spectre (2015) The band\u2019s rejected Bond theme has assumed the identity of a curiously viable Radiohead song. Thom Yorke is persuasive \u2013 if not exactly suave \u2013 in character as the secret agent, but credit Jonny Greenwood, as we often must, with its emotive thwack. 37. Kid A (2000) Driven to despair by OK Computer\u2019s runaway success, Yorke faced a perilous choice: sacrifice his sanity in exchange for astronomical fame or persuade Ed O\u2019Brien to get into Autechre. On Kid A, the second option won out: sequestered away with Greenwood, Yorke produced much that haunts and a little \u2013 like the title track \u2013 that gleams. 36. Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box (2001) After decrying consumerism, swerving into outre avant-rock and selling millions of records anyway, Radiohead learned the hard way that condemning society would just make them even richer. Trying a new tack, the Amnesiac opener layers anxious ticks and gamelan-style chimes before gently lampooning a \u201creasonable man\u201d with an uneasy conscience. 35. Burn the Witch (2016) Once the band\u2019s secret weapon, Greenwood is now a garlanded composer and Radiohead\u2019s melodic powerhouse. Finally entrusted to build an arrangement from scratch, he turned the live favourite Burn the Witch into this orchestral jaunt. The iffy tour version \u2013 shorn of strings and charm \u2013 attests to his handiwork on the recording. 34. Creep (1993) Radiohead\u2019s biggest hit is so beautiful and corny, it is impossible to accept it on its own terms. \u201cI want you to notice when I\u2019m not around,\u201d Yorke broods, a perfect lyric he probably hates. In the end, the band\u2019s disavowal of the song sent its credibility full circle. Nowadays, Creep is a joke, but we\u2019re all blissfully in on it. 33. Scatterbrain (2003) An unsung gem from Hail to the Thief, Scatterbrain prescribes halting rhythms and deconstructed chords to a narrator fretting over his identity. As birds and newspaper pages thrash in a gale, Yorke, too, longs for chaos. The tantalising, unresolved chords mock him, but enchant us. 32. Just (1995) Post-Creep, Radiohead were poised between grunge and Britpop. Just is a time capsule at the crossroads: hailstorm distortion meets perky hooks, wily vocals and \u2013 Yorke\u2019s mischievous challenge to Greenwood \u2013 an absurd pageant of guitar chords. The chorus flips the grunge ethos on its head, swapping self-loathing for theatrical vitriol. 31. 2+2=5 (Live at Earls Court) (2004) As the Iraq war protests floundered, Yorke sporadically logged on to radiohead.com to denounce New Labour and the warmongering \u201cthief\u201d in the White House. 2+2=5 is his polemical anthem for the era of mass-broadcast deception and enhanced interrogation techniques, captured thrillingly in this Com Lag EP version. 30. Morning Bell (2000) Kid A\u2019s unorthodox breakup song was later resurrected as Morning Bell/Amnesia (\u201clike a recurring dream,\u201d Yorke observed), but keep room in your heart for the cold-sweats original. Only a melody so blissfully innocent could withstand such jittery, nightmarish contortions. 29. No Surprises (1997) Radiohead\u2019s most misunderstood protagonist has it made: the house, the garden, the heart full up \u201clike a landfill\u201d, the \u201cjob that slowly kills you\u201d\u2026 and how lovely it all sounds. Can a radical conscience coexist with suburban comforts, No Surprises asks? For all that it soothes, this one is pessimistic. 28. Lucky (1995) The Bends had vamped and snarled for the gallery, but Lucky \u2013 recorded for a War Child compilation \u2013 signalled deeper concerns and higher stakes. Creeping riffs, melodic blasts and shameless melodrama laid the groundwork for OK Computer while cementing the band\u2019s partnership with the producer Nigel Godrich. 27. There There (2003) After the divisive Kid A/Amnesiac era, Hail to the Thief\u2019s lead single felt diplomatic \u2013 no more sacrilegious than Blur\u2019s experiments at around the same time. Its hooks and arrangement were deceptively crafty, though, making its turbulent climax hard to shake. 26. Where I End and You Begin (2003) Sequenced in the mid-album swamp of Hail to the Thief, Where I End and You Begin is a maligned masterclass in broody synthpop. With Yorke \u201cup in the clouds\u201d and Greenwood making spaceship sounds, the rhythm section straps in and goes full New Order, hurtling towards an ecstatic climax. 25. Everything in Its Right Place (2000) Where OK Computer declared \u201cI am born again\u201d, Kid A dives straight into obfuscation: its opener\u2019s choppy vocal gibberish more closely resembles the \u201cunborn chicken voices\u201d plaguing the Paranoid Android. Like David Byrne before him, Yorke had renounced his authorship to flirt with self-erasure, yielding to gorgeously sunlit synths. 24. Harry Patch (In Memory Of) (2009) A later-career treasure, Radiohead\u2019s tribute to the last surviving combat soldier of the first world war shows how much ground they have barely touched. With just a funereal, cinematic string section for company, Yorke sends his falsetto out over the trenches, an innocent witness to \u201cdemons coming up from the ground\u201d. 23. Daydreaming (2016) Beneath the tiptoeing pianos, Daydreaming is a gut-wrencher. In a lyric some have linked to his late long-term partner, Yorke finds himself sleepwalking \u201cbeyond the point of no return\u201d, before repeating a mournful mantra, \u201cHalf of my life\u201d, played in reverse. The timeline matches that relationship\u2019s duration and, equally, the lifespan of Radiohead. 22. Subterranean Homesick Alien (1997) Plunged into a shimmering dreamscape, Yorke observes a fleet of aliens surveying humanity. What, the interlopers wonder, is up with these oddballs? In fact, it\u2019s all an excuse for Yorke\u2019s alienated narrator to ask himself: am I the problem or is society? Radiohead exist to petition for the second option; here, however, was sweet ambiguity. 21. A Wolf at the Door (2003) Insufficiently radical to some, Hail to the Thief staged a hit-and-miss venture into a new songwriting idiom. Among the hits, far and away the zaniest track was the album closer: a nightmarish waltz resembling a mutant Bends castoff, capped by a curmudgeonly rap about capitalist thugs and politicians taking cream pies to the face. 20. Like Spinning Plates (2000) After hearing their song I Will being rewound on tape, Yorke decided the backwards version was \u201cmiles better\u201d and recast it as Like Spinning Plates. A complementary piano version, from the I Might Be Wrong live album, brings its spectral beauty into focus. Once you\u2019ve heard it, the original becomes indispensable. 19. Motion Picture Soundtrack (2000) On an album bound to futuristic threats and technologies, Motion Picture Soundtrack\u2019s melancholy harmonium, fluttering harps and rolling, beatless expanse suggest a return to uncorrupted Eden. Tellingly, it originates from the band\u2019s youthful origins as On a Friday. 18. Weird Fishes/Arpeggi (2007) Nigel Godrich settles into cruise control on this In Rainbows highlight, a rare haven from the band\u2019s omnipresent dread. Instead, Weird Fishes/Arpeggi evokes an all-too-perfect harmony: cascading arpeggios enchant while fragmentary lyrics caution against the lure of false prophets. 17. True Love Waits (2016) Even when they\u2019re not facing the abyss, Radiohead songs tend to operate in its general vicinity, albeit without revealing what led there. But True Love Waits \u2013 sketched on an earlier live album and perfected 15 years later \u2013 conceals nothing: the abyss, listener, is love. \u201cI\u2019d drown my beliefs to have your babies,\u201d Yorke confesses woefully, wonderfully. 16. Airbag (1997) After The Bends, the smart money had Radiohead scaling up for festival supremacy. OK Computer\u2019s opener took the bait then veered left: first the brain-melting deluge, then ripples of funk, a sexy drum lurch and some Maxinquaye basslines. Yorke \u2013 summoned \u201cback to save the universe\u201d \u2013 presides over the melee like a despairing god. 15. Videotape (2007) On In Rainbows, Radiohead\u2019s cosiest album, Videotape is refreshingly, passionately despondent. Yorke vaguely evokes horrors \u2013 surveillance-state ennui, digital isolation, the gaze of an unforgiving deity \u2013 in a death-row drawl. Then, a change of heart: perhaps it was \u201cthe most perfect day I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, after all. 14. Polyethylene (Pt 1 &amp; 2) (1997) Radiohead\u2019s greatest (although, somehow, not first) antiplastic jeremiad, this Paranoid Android B-side thrashes and struts like The Bends\u2019 glam evil twin. Far from the ham-fisted Fake Plastic Trees, Polyethylene is all malevolent snarl, bouncing off the walls in defiance of middle-class ecological hubris. 13. Knives Out (2001) The impenetrable Amnesiac debunked industry rumours that Radiohead were primed for a bankable comeback \u2013 but amid that album lay this meat-and-potatoes rocker, its scurrying riffs, mystic ambience and cannibalistic lyrics qualifying as glorious light relief. 12. Street Spirit (Fade Out) (1995) Yorke once compared it to \u201cstaring the fucking devil right in the eyes\u201d and knowing \u201che\u2019ll get the last laugh\u201d. Street Spirit makes for a spectacular showdown \u2013 a grand, doomed surrender. If you need a chaser, consider another vintage Yorke quote: \u201cIf I was happy, I\u2019d be in a fucking car advert.\u201d 11. Sail to the Moon (2003) Yorke\u2019s lullaby for his infant son has a distinctly bad-dreams vibe about it. Someone should probably have a word. Still, his good intent shines. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be president,\u201d Yorke rasps over writhing guitars. \u201cOr in the flood, you\u2019ll build an ark and sail us to the moon.\u201d For young Noah, big sustainable footwear to fill. 10. My Iron Lung (1994) A dig at Creep\u2019s annoying popularity, My Iron Lung uses catchy hooks and brawny riffs to rally against commercialisation. It risks sounding bratty \u2013 it is bratty \u2013 but from insolence they fashioned a new identity: stadium-rock agitators declaring war on hypocrisy and greed \u2013 particularly their own. 9. Exit Music (For a Film) (1997) Bewildering, still, that Radiohead composed this monstrous ballad for Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1996 flick Romeo + Juliet, partly because it\u2019s a high-stakes blockbuster of its own. Yorke has never sounded gloomier, with poisonous murmurs rising to a bloodcurdling fever pitch. 8. The National Anthem (2000) At first conjuring arthouse delirium \u2013 improv skronk, transistor radio babble, warbling ondes martenot \u2013 Kid A\u2019s jazz-rock monster morphs into an electrical storm of brilliantly layered tension. Like a Mingus requiem, The National Anthem\u2019s power lies in the staggering weight of what is unresolved. 7. Nude (2007) In Rainbows\u2019 online release prompted a global listening event anticipated unlike any since. Three tracks in, the magic happened. After kicking around in Radiohead lore for more than a decade, Nude had found stunning form, first by channelling Bj\u00f6rk \u2013 choppy coos, weeping strings \u2013 and then in a finale as bright and penetrating as dawn. 6. Idioteque (2000) Yorke says he poured his most stubborn anxieties into Idioteque, which may explain why this pumping club tune \u2013 a formal anomaly \u2013 feels like Radiohead\u2019s chaotically distilled superego. Ecological dread, big-tech menace and catastrophic panic prevail, but that shiver-inducing synth sample doles out propaganda for hope. 5. Karma Police (1997) Part literary dystopia, part John Lennon in a Pixies T-shirt, Karma Police is an enduringly odd superhit: at once relatable, inscrutable and chilling. Such nuance is now Radiohead\u2019s bread and butter, but only so because Yorke learned, after much saccharine bumbling, to consolidate his bleak and mawkish impulses into one. 4. Pyramid Song (2001) Since Kid A skimped on promo, Pyramid Song technically followed up the hit single No Surprises. For casual fans, a few surprises: lyrics alluding to Hermann Hesse\u2019s Siddhartha, piano seemingly exhumed from ancient civilisation and a newly spiritual Yorke, swimming with \u201cblack-eyed angels\u201d and a shoal of exes towards some nebulous afterlife. Torture for some; otherwise, cult-making. 3. Reckoner (2007) Rock orthodoxy holds that a great band\u2019s nerve centre resides in a single genius \u2013 two at a push. Radiohead\u2019s greatest ensemble piece kills the myth for good. At first innocuous, Reckoner unspools a full house of virtuoso performances engulfed by Godrich\u2019s winter-blanket production. It soothes then soars. 2. How to Disappear Completely (2000) Few admit it, but Radiohead\u2019s home turf is the desperately uncool milieu of avant garde balladry. How to Disappear Completely, a masterpiece of the form, orchestrates a stage-fright reverie with fragments of Robert Wyatt and Penderecki. In Kid A\u2019s supposedly cold heart it is pure affirmation: melancholy and light. 1. Paranoid Android (1997) As Britpop plunged from grace, Radiohead planted a revolutionary flag in the mountaintop. With OK Computer\u2019s salvo, they shed the skin of insurgent oddballs, ditched grungy radio rock and electrified the popular imagination. Paranoid Android draws less from contemporaries than their ancestors, notably \u2013 audaciously \u2013 within prog. The seven-minute odyssey plunders rock\u2019s then-forbidden city with burbling basslines and guitar wizardry so breathtaking nobody bothered to revoke Greenwood\u2019s daytime-radio visa. Elevated by Yorke\u2019s apocalyptic babbling and heavenly falsetto, we witness operatic scale and drama (\u201cThe dust and the screaming! The yuppies networking!\u201d) in a ludicrously catchy anthem. Paranoid Android stormed the castle and raised the drawbridge on rock\u2019s imperial era.",

The match is over on the Melbourne Arena, where tournament organisers have again granted Kyrgios his wish of playing in front of the riff-raff who don\u2019t have tickets for the two main show courts, which means Harriet Dart gets to enjoy the grander surroundings of Rod Laver. The qualifier, Britain\u2019s sole survivor in the singles after Heather Watson was soundly beaten by Belgium\u2019s Elise Mertens earlier, has a daunting second-round assignment against the Wimbledon champion, Simona Halep. That match is scheduled to start at 7pm local time/8am GMT, and is followed by Rafael Nadal\u2019s <strike> rout of </strike> sorry meeting with Argentina\u2019s Federico Delbonis. There are also two matches under the lights on Margaret Court: Stan Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, against Italy\u2019s Andreas Seppi and Elina Svitolina, the fifth seed, versus the American Lauren Davis. And all of this with plenty still going on in the day session.

      "bodyText": "After a day of dirt deluges, deciding-set arm-wrestles and defeats for the remaining Brits in the singles, it\u2019s time to wrap up the blog. But spare a thought for poor Elina Svitolina and Lauren Davis, who are only five games into their match at 11.35pm Melbourne time, with Svitolina, the fifth seed, leading 3-2. Thanks for your company today, Tumaini will be back tomorrow, when the highlight should be Naomi Osaka v Coco Gauff round II. Hopefully these will keep you going in the meantime. Bye! Nadal speaks: First time playing in the evening here, different conditions. Tough match, I lost a lot of opportunities on the break points. But I found a way to win the second set and I played more relaxed in the third. For her [the ballgirl] it was not a good moment. She\u2019s super brave. The ball was straight on her head. Nadal is looking the best he has all match. Serving for it, he races to 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, but he must already be thinking about the handshake when he makes a mess of the next point. Lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice though, and Nadal completes victory on the second match point. He shakes hands with Delbonis \u2013 before once again checking on the ballgirl. A convincing end to what had been an unconvincing match for Nadal. But it\u2019s enough to put the 2009 champion into the third round and a meeting with fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta. Nadal decides it\u2019s time to do something about that, breaking for 3-1. Could that kickstart a sprint through the third set? Quite possibly, because he holds for 4-1 and then zips to 15-30 on Delbonis\u2019s serve. Nadal then cracks a ball into the cheek of a ballgirl \u2013 and then gives her a kiss to apologise. Maybe the pain was worth it. It doesn\u2019t distract Nadal, who bags a second consecutive break for 5-1. Meanwhile Karen Khachanov is bent over on Court 3, sucking for air, after a draining 10-8 final-set tie-break win over Mikael Ymer. Khachanov plays Kyrgios next. There are two matches currently taking place, just an hour short of midnight in Melbourne ... but there\u2019s still one yet to start, Elina Svitolina v Lauren Davis, who are walking on to Margaret Court. How hard it is on them. Meanwhile Khachanov and Ymer are embarking on a fifth-set tie-break \u2013 it\u2019s the first to 10 remember \u2013 while Nadal, serving first in this third set, is 6-3, 7-6, 1-1 against Delbonis. Speaking of Kyrgios, he said of his mid-match ranting at his box: \u201cI was being a bit of dickhead to them and I apologised as soon as I got back into the locker room.\u201d It\u2019s all going on. There\u2019s been a quick turnaround on Margaret Court, where Stan Wawrinka is taking in the applause of the crowd after charging from a break down to win three games on the spin and see off Andreas Seppi 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Taylor Fritz has come back from the brink, defeating Kevin Anderson 6-2 in the fifth from two sets behind to set up a meeting with another five-set survivor Dominic Thiem, and Yulia Putintseva has recovered from the disappointment of being broken when serving for the match to take out last year\u2019s semi-finalist Danielle Collins 7-5 in the third. Nadal puts more daylight between him and Delbonis with an ace for 5-2 and then fires a forehand into the net for 5-3. Delbonis pulls off a winning volley, 5-4. But the odds are stacked against the Argentinian because Nadal has two points on serve to take the set. And that the top seed does. He has a two-set lead but he\u2019s been made to work for it. Delbonis gets the tie-break under way, and takes the first point on serve. Elsewhere, Andreas Seppi has struck first in the deciding set against Stan Wawrinka and leads 4-3, while Danielle Collins has saved match point to break Yulia Putintseva back for 5-5. The cheers on Rod Laver bring my attention back to Nadal though, where a perfectly measured lob gives him the first mini-break for 3-2. They change ends with Nadal 4-2 ahead ... Gasps as Nadal makes a complete hash of the smash on the opening point. His wife winces. But he quickly makes amends, winning the next three points \u2013 make that four \u2013 as Delbonis hits long on game point. It\u2019s tie-break time! 5-5, 30-30 ... and the pressure gets to Delbonis, as he hands Nadal a break point. But the Argentinian regains his composure and drills down an ace. Deuce. Nadal has won only one of 18 break points. And the world No 1 pays for the profligacy as Delbonis holds. The underdog has earned himself at least a tie-break in this second set. Nadal, having dropped only five games in the opening round against Hugo Dellien, has conceded five games in the second set against another South American clay-courter, Federico Delbonis, and must hold serve at 4-5 to prevent this match becoming one set all. There\u2019s a sniff of danger for Nadal at 15-30 but an assured overhead gets him back to 30-all. Nadal nudges ahead for 40-30, but Delbonis dispatches a forehand volley for deuce. The Argentinian just isn\u2019t going away in this set. But he does eventually back down in this game. It\u2019s 5-5. \u201cMaybe the Australian Open is a far stretch for Rublev,\u201d replies Johan Denis, \u201cbut I can imagine myself a hell of a quarter-final between two very hot Russians ... and I also believe outside the Big Three Medvedev has the best chance now, and not a small one.\u201d I\u2019ve given up attempting to force down my late breakfast, so I\u2019m fully focused on the tennis, and here\u2019s a quick summary from around the grounds, where three men\u2019s matches are going the distance: Stan Wawrinka has predictably been taken to a fifth in his tussle Andreas Seppi, who\u2019s claimed the fourth set 6-3; Kevin Anderson has surrendered a two-set lead against the American Taylor Fritz (understandable from Anderson, who\u2019s playing his first event since Wimbledon last year); and Karen Khachanov and Mikael Ymer are locked at two games all in their decider. And there\u2019s one women\u2019s match still on court, with the time approaching 10.30pm in Melbourne: the American 26th seed Danielle Collins, a semi-finalist last year, trails 4-2 in the third against Yulia Putintseva. A report for your perusal. It\u2019s the second consecutive year there\u2019ll be no British player in the third round of the singles. How Andy Murray is missed. So another encouraging performance from Kyrgios, who was very focused for the most part against a potentially tricky, experienced campaigner. It\u2019s clear how much Kyrgios is enjoying his tennis at the moment, and he now awaits the winner of the Karen Khachanov v Mikael Ymer match ... and possibly Nadal after that. Khachanov and Ymer have just entered a fifth set, which could be to the benefit Kyrgios, who probably hopes they continue to take lumps out of each other into the night. And Nadal is now 6-3, 2-2 up on Delbonis. Kyrgios is one of three Australian men into round three, joining Alexei Popyrin and John Millman. A contended Kyrgios says: It\u2019s epic. You guys are awesome. That\u2019s why I request playing on this court. I definitely lost my way in the third set and could have gone to a very dark place in the fourth but I somehow pulled it away. I\u2019m just happy to get through, that could have been very interesting if it had gone to a fifth set. I\u2019m not thinking ahead, there are a lot of Aussies still in the draw, but I\u2019m taking it one match at a time. Kyrgios seems to have recovered his focus after launching that post-third set missive at his box. And right on time, he secures a hard-earned break right at the business end of the fourth set to lead Simon 6-5. So he\u2019s serving for the match. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, three match points. But he\u2019s a bit too keen to pull the trigger, 40-15. A huge second-serve ace settles matters \u2013 his 28th ace of the day \u2013 but this was not only a performance of power, he showed real variation. Kyrgios lets out a roar, shakes hands with his opponent, before jumping in to the air and throwing his sweat bands into the stands. David Goffin is limping to the net to shake hands with Pierre-Hugues Herbert after outlasting the Frenchman over three hours and five sets, 6-1, 6-4, 4-6, 1-6, 6-3. The Belgian doesn\u2019t look happy, though it\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s because of how he\u2019s feeling physically or because he\u2019s just put out his good friend. \u201cThis year I count on Thiem, Medvedev or Rublev to take a slam,\u201d emails Johan Denis. Can you see it happening in Australia, Johan? I think Dominic Thiem\u2019s best opportunity will always be the French Open, Daniil Medvedev certainly has a chance this tournament, possibly the best of anyone outside the Big Three, and Andrey Rublev has been the player of 2020 so far, but is it too soon for the 22-year-old to do it over two weeks of best-of-five tennis? Back to current matters, and Nadal takes the first set 6-3 on his fourth set point. It took 20 minutes to get to 1-all between Nadal and Delbonis but 20 minutes later it\u2019s 5-2 Nadal, with Delbonis serving to stay in the set. But I\u2019m a little bit distracted/disgusted by my late breakfast. It looked quite nice when I whizzed it together in the Nutribullet at 6am this morning, but it\u2019s now turned into an unappealing sludge not dissimilar in appearance to that which covered the courts in Melbourne earlier. Hopefully Nadal can do the business quickly so I can escape for an early lunch. The top seed hears my plea, bringing up two set points on Delbonis\u2019s serve, but then upsets me by missing both. Delbonis digs deep for 5-3. Wawrinka \u2013 the man who defeated Nadal in the 2014 final \u2013 wins the third set, 6-3. In fact Wawrinka\u2019s still the last major winner outside the Big Three, after his US Open victory in 2016. That\u2019s 12 straight slams for tennis\u2019s great triumvirate. And so far there\u2019s no real sense that this tournament will witness a significant shift in the natural order. Do feel free to get in touch with your title picks or any other musings, either via email or tweet @KatyMurrells. Nadal decides he\u2019s had enough of messing around, and holds in a fraction of the time it took Delbonis to do the same. It\u2019s 2-1 Nadal early on. Wawrinka is ripping through the third set against Seppi, leading 4-6, 7-5, 5-2. Further afield, Kevin Anderson, the two-time grand slam finalist who is playing his first event since Wimbledon, is in charge against Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 7-6 (5), 4-2 ahead; Karen Khachanov, the dangerous but inconsistent Russian, is two sets to one up against the young Swede Mikael Ymer; the usually steady Belgian David Goffin was two sets to the good against Pierre-Hugues Herbert but is now into a fifth; and the American Danielle Collins is a set down to Yulia Putintseva. Delbonis holds! Kyrgios still leads the match, by the way, 6-2, 6-4, 4-6. Fifteen minutes gone on Rod Laver, and they\u2019re still only in the second game, with Nadal 1-0 up on serve. Nadal, once again wearing a florescent pink sleeveless number, is blinding me but not Delbonis who is holding firm at deuce. The seventh deuce of the game. An eighth deuce predictably follows. So time to tell you that it\u2019s not going all Nick Kyrgios\u2019s way on Melbourne Arena, where, from 4-2 up in the third, he\u2019s dropped four games in a row to concede the set 6-4 to Gilles Simon. Apparently his box told him to \u201cstay tough\u201d, which didn\u2019t go down too well. \u201cAbsolutely flying colours,\u201d was the response. \u201cSo creative. So creative. So creative. Out of all the things you could say: \u2018Stay tough.\u2019 Thanks, man. Thanks. That\u2019s what I get on every break point. Wow. Wow. Wow. \u2018Stay tough,\u2019 yep. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. Shit. Shit.\u201d Perfect timing from Stan Wawrinka, breaking at the end of the second set to level against Andreas Seppi 4-6, 7-5. This one could go the distance. Seppi has played some of the best matches of his career at the Australian Open, stunning Roger Federer in 2015 and reaching the fourth round four times, and Wawrinka is not quite the Wawrinka of old, who won the title in 2014. Though of course the Swiss deserves huge credit for his return from injury. If his body holds up, he can still do some damage here. Verdasco is still capable of pulling off a result, and could make life difficult for Zverev. And from one Spanish bull to another, because Rafael Nadal is now under way on Rod Laver against Federico Delbonis. The Argentinian is also a left-hander who prefers playing on clay but that\u2019s where the similarities end: Delbonis has never been beyond the third round of a major, while Nadal is going for slam number 20 here, which would draw him level with Roger Federer\u2019s record. So the GOAT may not be the GOAT for much longer. As for the score, Kyrgios is still very much in charge, leading 6-2, 6-4, 4-2. Elsewhere, Carla Suarez Navarro has played her final match at the Australian Open. The Spaniard, who is retiring at the end of the year, has lost 6-3, 7-5 to Iga Swiatek. Svetlana Kuznetsova, who did so well in the first round against the French Open runner-up Marketa Vondrousova, hasn\u2019t been able to repeat that in round two, losing 6-3, 6-1 to the feisty Italian Camila Giorgi, who\u2019ll next play Angelique Kerber. And victory for Fernando Verdasco, the former semi-finalist coming from a set down to defeat Nikoloz Basilashvili 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4 and set up a third-round meeting with Alex Zverev. Fun and games on Melbourne Arena, meanwhile, and this time it\u2019s not only Kyrgios getting involved. Halep speaks. \u201cIt was a little bit dangerous,\u201d she says of the match. \u201cI lost focus. She started to play very well at the end but I\u2019m happy I went through. I like to play under pressure, it\u2019s more fun and excitement, but I would prefer to finish the matches when I have a chance.\u201d Halep is then asked about her pledge to donate to the bushfire fund every time she has a pop at her coach Darren Cahill. \u201cI owe money today for sure. He\u2019s counting. I\u2019m afraid to ask. But it\u2019s a nice thing to do.\u201d And what of her chances of becoming a three-time grand slam champion? \u201cIt would sound really nice but I\u2019m still far to think about this title.\u201d Halep is rattled. She looks in a rush to finish this but Dart is calmly taking her time between points and holds courtesy of a couple of wonderful winners. Halep will again have to serve for the match ... A rally of tight angles at 30-15, and Halep eventually goes just wide. She looks at her coach Darren Cahill for confirmation of the call. 30-all. She\u2019s screaming at Cahill after the next point because Halep plants another forehand into the net and it\u2019s break point, 30-40. Dart, however, gets a bit too excited, going for a backhand winner with the odds stacked against her, and unsurprisingly she doesn\u2019t make it. Deuce. Followed by Halep\u2019s advantage, another match point to add to the one the Romanian had a couple of games ago. Dart is giving it all she has, stepping into the court and hammering away at Halep, and the Brit is rewarded for her efforts. Deuce. But it\u2019s quickly followed by a third match point ... and Halep again blinks! Deuce. A fourth match point. And this time Dart\u2019s forehand loops well long and with that, British interest in the singles is over. A disappointing final point from Dart but she showed quite some fight in the second set against the two-time grand slam champion and former Australian Open finalist. The end is seemingly nigh for Dart, but she digs out a wonderful winner while standing deep in the right-hand corner to hold for a 5-2 deficit. But Halep is now serving for the match. At 30-all, Dart has a chance as she steps into the court to put away the short ball ... but she misses. It\u2019s 40-30, match point. Halep does all the hard work, moving from one side to t\u2019other, before thwacking into the net. Deuce. Break point! And Halep again nets! Dart\u2019s box - including Britain\u2019s Fed Cup captain Anne Keothavong, applaud energetically. Dart reduces her arrears to 6-2, 5-3. But is this anything more than a final flourish from the Brit? Even Lleyton Hewitt is applauding. What a difference a year makes. Dart is in serious danger now on Rod Laver. Halep hurries through another game, holding serve to love, and it\u2019s 6-2, 4-0. But I\u2019m a little distracted by my rumbling stomach (I could really do with some breakfast) and Kyrgios\u2019s chattering and chuntering on Melbourne Arena, where he\u2019s unhappy about something or other, I think he may have been pulled up by the shot clock. It matters not, though, because he soon has set point at 40-30. A 216kph serve settles matters. Kyrgios leads 6-2, 6-4 and they\u2019ve been playing for only just over an hour. Halep still has a hold over Dart, breaking the Brit at the start of the second set and then backing that up for 6-2, 2-0. Make that 3-0. Meanwhile Simon is serving to stay in the second set of his match against Kyrgios at 5-3 down. Judging by the shorts Kyrgios is wearing he\u2019s planning a trip to the beach when this match is done. Simon holds to 15, rounding things off with an ace, to force Kyrgios to serve the set out. Stan is not the man on Margaret Court, where he\u2019s shaking his head and shrugging as Seppi serves for the opening set at 5-4. And that\u2019s from 3-0 down. And Seppi seals the set comfortably! Wawrinka slumps into his chair and sucks an energy gel. He may need a few more of those to turn this around. Kyrgios isn\u2019t letting up in the second set. He\u2019s clobbered and cranked his way to a 6-2, 3-1 lead. Does the 35-year-old Simon have enough in the tank to stop the onslaught? The Frenchman does at least hold for 3-2. But Kyrgios is looking good to move a step closer to a potential fourth-round meeting with Rafael Nadal. It\u2019s been blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it tennis on Rod Laver, where Dart, having broken back for 1-1 after dropping her serve in the opening game, hasn\u2019t got on the board since. It\u2019s 5-1 Halep and Dart is serving to stay in the set at 30-all. The world No 173 digs in to hold. But she\u2019ll now have to break Halep if she\u2019s to inconvenience the former world No 1 for any longer in this set. Halep hurtles to 30-0. She\u2019s got her game face on and is looking extremely focused. That said, she then prods a simple forehand long \u2013 followed by a routine backhand! 30-all. Dart has Halep on a piece of string on the next point, and is rewarded with a break chance! 30-40. But Halep then does what grand slam champions do, seeing off the danger and securing the set from her second advantage when Dart\u2019s return flops into the tramlines. Wawrinka whizzed into a 3-0 lead against Seppi but it\u2019s now back on serve, with the champion of six years ago 3-2 ahead. And I should have mentioned that Monfils wrapped up his win, cutting the 6ft 11in Ivo Karlovic down to size, 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4, 7-5. And speaking of giants, John Isner is through, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 against the Chilean qualifier Alejandro Tabilo. So what of Kyrgios and Wawrinka? Kyrgios\u2019s match has belatedly appeared on Eurosport with the Australian leading the 35-year-old Frenchman Gilles Simon 4-2 in the first set. He then biffs a backhand return down the line to secure the double break for 5-2. Melbourne Arena rises to applaud the 23rd seed, the player who Australia now loves to love. I mentioned Halep\u2019s contribution to the bushfire relief effort but it was Kyrgios who kickstarted tennis\u2019s response by pledging to donate A$200 for every ace he hits and he\u2019s gained countless more fans as a result. He seems to be playing with real pride and patriotism at Melbourne Park this year. And he secures the set 6-2 after 27 minutes by cracking a forehand winner past a helpless Simon. Just as I was checking in on the early stages of Nick Kyrgios v Gilles Simon and Stan Wawrinka v Andreas Seppi, Dart breaks back to love! That was unexpected. Though she certainly doesn\u2019t look weighed down by nerves as she skips around the court and breathes freely. That\u2019s already one more game than she won against Sharapova last year. Halep won the toss, and will receive first. The Romanian has pledged to give A$200 to the bushfire fund every time she gives her Australian coach Darren Cahill any grief while on court. Given Halep\u2019s tendency to vent at Cahill during matches, her wallet could be a fair bit lighter by the end of the tournament. She\u2019s looking fairly serene right now though, attacking from 40-30 down on Dart\u2019s serve in an entertaining opening game to break for 1-0. So what does Dart make of today\u2019s challenge? \u201cIt\u2019s just another tennis match,\u201d she says calmly. \u201cHalep\u2019s a great champion and it\u2019s an opportunity to see where my level\u2019s at. I like to keep my tactics close to my chest, so hopefully you\u2019ll see it on the court.\u201d We won\u2019t have to wait much longer to find out, because they\u2019re just finishing their warm-up ... The night session is upon us. What a walk for Harriet Dart. Though this isn\u2019t the first time the British qualifier has stepped on to Rod Laver Arena. She did so last year as well ... before being marmalised 6-0, 6-0 by Maria Sharapova. And is doesn\u2019t get any easier today, because she\u2019s up against the reigning Wimbledon champion and former world No 1, Simona Halep. Dart is the only British player left in the singles after Heather Watson\u2019s earlier exit. No pressure, Harriet ... Monfils breaks Karlovic, literally and perhaps figuratively. The Frenchman leads 6-5 and will serve for the match. The in-form young Russian Andrey Rublev, tipped for perhaps the top 10 this year, has just notched up his 10th consecutive win of 2020, defeating Japan\u2019s Yuichi Sugita 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (5). Meanwhile Gael Monfils, who seems positively youthful at 33 compared to his 40-year-old opponent Ivo Karlovic, are involved in a right old battle on the 1573 Arena. It\u2019s 5-5 in the fourth set, with Monfils leading 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4, 5-5. Elsewhere on the women\u2019s side, Garbine Muguruza, unseeded in Melbourne after an absolutely terrible 2019, is showing signs of remembering who she actually is after a battling 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory over the Australian Ajla Tomljanovic; Karolina Pliskova, still the receiver of tennis\u2019s great backhanded compliment of being the best women\u2019s player not to have won a slam, won tidily, 6-3, 6-3 against the German Laura Siegemund; the sixth seed Belinda Bencic overcame the former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 7-5, 7-5 in a see-sawing match; Donna Vekic, Maria Sharapova\u2019s conqueror, won again, this time in straight sets against Alize Cornet; the 20-year-old American CiCi Bellis, ranked in the top 50 as a teenager but now 600 in the world and playing her first grand slam event in two years after four surgeries, knocked out the 20th seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 6-4; and the 2016 champion Angelique Kerber and the ninth seed Kiki Bertens won\u2019t have been too popular, because they both saw off Australian wildcards in straight sets. Kerber beat Priscilla Hon 6-3, 6-2, while Bertens defeated Arina Rodionova, 6-3, 7-5. As touched on in the preamble, Heather Watson suffered a one-sided defeat by Belgium\u2019s 16th seed, Elise Mertens, 6-3, 6-0. Watson is the world No 75, so there\u2019s no shame in losing to a player significantly higher than her in the rankings, but having produced a gutsy performance against Kristyna Pliskova in the first round, she\u2019ll be disappointed not to have shown more fight against Mertens, who she beat in Hobart only last week. But I digress. Five matches have been completed on the men\u2019s side so far: Dominic Thiem was in plenty of trouble, two sets to one down against Australia\u2019s Alex Bolt, before finishing with a flourish, 6-2, 5-7, 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-2; Alex Zverev secured a welcome straight-sets win, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-5 over Egor Gerasimov of Belarus; the Latvian enigma that is Ernests Gulbis, who upset the rising Canadian F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime in round one, bumped out the former Brit Aljaz Bedene also in straight sets; there\u2019s been another win for the exciting young Australian Alexei Popyrin, 6-2, 7-6, 6-2 against Spain\u2019s Jaume Munar; while last year\u2019s US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev got a bloodied nose \u2013 quite literally \u2013 but came through 7-5, 6-1, 6-3 against the Spanish qualifier Pedro Mart\u00ednez. What\u2019s happened so far, you say? Well not quite as much as expected, because of the murky torrential rain that chucked down mud and dust on Melbourne Park and the rest of the city. Plenty of quips on social media about the clay court season coming early this year ... Only on the covered show courts did play start on time, with action on the outside courts delayed for several hours until the storm subsided and a clean-up operation involving power hoses and squeezy mops was finished. Why covers couldn\u2019t have been put on the courts during the rain storm, who knows. G\u2019day! Or more accurately good evening, given the clock has ticked past 6pm in Melbourne and the night session begins in just over half an hour\u2019s time when the man of the people Nick Kyrgios faces the Frenchman Gilles Simon. The match is over on the Melbourne Arena, where tournament organisers have again granted Kyrgios his wish of playing in front of the riff-raff who don\u2019t have tickets for the two main show courts, which means Harriet Dart gets to enjoy the grander surroundings of Rod Laver. The qualifier, Britain\u2019s sole survivor in the singles after Heather Watson was soundly beaten by Belgium\u2019s Elise Mertens earlier, has a daunting second-round assignment against the Wimbledon champion, Simona Halep. That match is scheduled to start at 7pm local time/8am GMT, and is followed by Rafael Nadal\u2019s rout of sorry meeting with Argentina\u2019s Federico Delbonis. There are also two matches under the lights on Margaret Court: Stan Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, against Italy\u2019s Andreas Seppi and Elina Svitolina, the fifth seed, versus the American Lauren Davis. And all of this with plenty still going on in the day session. Sit tight!",

      "bodyText": "A woman has gone on trial accused of murdering her \u201cviolent and controlling\u201d father following a family row. Nursery worker Jessica Breeze has denied murder, telling police that she had been trying to protect her mother after her father attacked them. The 20-year-old is accused of stabbing Colin Brady, 49, in the back at the family home in Middlesbrough in June, when she was 19. The stabbing occurred following an argument in which he had repeatedly hit his daughter and threatened to kill her and his partner, the jury heard. Breeze wept in the dock as details of how her father had died from blood loss were revealed in Teesside crown court. The kitchen knife penetrated his left lung and although paramedics took him to the nearby James Cook University hospital, he could not be saved. Breeze\u2019s mother, Kelly, said Brady \u201clooked like a zombie\u201d as he walked through to the living room before he collapsed on the sofa and asked his daughter what she had done. The mother and daughter both rang the emergency services and the defendant told the call handler that her father had been attacking them with a knife, which she took off him. But her mother\u2019s account varied. She said Brady had been aggressive towards them and had threatened to cut his own throat. After she was arrested, Breeze told police her father had a history of violence and she had not meant to harm him. Nick Dry, prosecuting, said: \u201cWhat happened that night was the culmination of a troubled and volatile relationship between father and daughter, characterised by frequent arguments, not infrequent violence and regular disharmony within the household. \u201cColin Brady was a man with a violent past, no-nonsense, controlling and intolerant of departures from the rules of his house, quick-tempered and not slow to use or threaten physical force if crossed.\u201d The jury heard that an argument broke out while the family were sharing a takeaway, after Breeze\u2019s parents found out she had been secretly seeing her boyfriend when she had said she had been at work. Brady allegedly hit his daughter several times, and her mother intervened, at which point he also attacked her, shouting: \u201cI swear down on my mother\u2019s life, I am going to kill the pair of you.\u201d The court heard that Brady then picked up a knife and asked if they wanted him to cut his own throat, before the women fled upstairs. Shortly after, the jury was told, Brady threatened to smash the family\u2019s cars up, and as he walked to the front door his daughter stabbed him. In her defence statement, Jessica Breeze said she was \u201cfoggy\u201d about what had happened and could not remember getting the knife. However, Dry urged the jury to look at the evidence dispassionately, saying: \u201cAlthough it may have been necessary for her to use some force to defend herself or her mother, what she did by plunging a large kitchen knife in the back of her father, as he walked away, coat on, heading for the door having signalled his intention to leave the house, cannot be said to be reasonable, even allowing for the obvious distress at the time. \u201cSympathy is not a defence to murder. Criminal trials are not popularity contests.\u201d",

And the people who enable this illicit activity and the misery it inflicts must be held personally to account. \u2022Tom Keatinge is director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute",

It was a contest that proved the cliche about matches of two halves. For two sets Kyrgios was the focused and ruthless version of himself that could frighten the entire grand slam draw.

The Australian pounced instantly, breaking the world No 61 in the first game. As in his round one win over Lorenzo Sonego, it was Kyrgios\u2019s composure and efficiency that stood out in the first set. In the seventh game he broke again, charging Simon\u2019s second serve and thumping a backhand winner down the line. In 27 minutes there were only two unforced errors, and plenty of productive forays to the net.</p> <p>Not for the first time, Australian fans imposed themselves on the contest in irritating style, with chants that were a day late and a dollar short. As early as his third service game, Simon was made to wait as one bright spark led a round of \u201cIf you\u2019re Aussie and you know it clap your hands\u201d. To his credit, the Frenchman was merely bemused by the inane impositions. To judge by his interactions with the press, Kyrgios has a very active cringe reflex. It probably got a workout tonight.</p> <p>The second set started identically to the first: Kyrgios broke serve and bounced excitedly back to his chair, then carried the momentum into a series of clinical service games. This was the smarter, focused, energy-saving tennis he had so often failed to deliver in the past, instead letting matches drag on too long, wandering his way into briar patches. Now it was Simon losing his rag, screaming to the heavens and slapping his racquet against his head. The set had slipped away from him in 39 minutes.</p> <p>Like clockwork, Kyrgios began the third set with another break, established by a long rally and a gorgeous, curling forehand winner. Simon, on the other hand, still couldn\u2019t take a trick: twice he was caught off guard by innocuous tweeners that Kyrgios saved for low-stakes moments, committing unforced errors in response. The result seemed a foregone conclusion, which is always dangerous territory for Kyrgios.</p> <p>Sure enough, the night changed complexion soon after and with it, Kyrgios\u2019s mood. Still boyish and agile at 35, Simon wore his younger opponent down and claimed two breaks to take the set in 54 minutes. As he is wont to do, Kyrgios attributed this sudden and dramatic reversal in his fortunes to a few anodyne words of encouragement from his corner: \u201cOf all the things you could say to me: \u2018stay tough\u2019?\u201d he barked. \u201cEvery break point \u2013 stay tough.\u201d This formulation, he ranted, was not only unhelpful, but \u201cmind-boggling.\u201d The effect certainly was.</p> <p>To his credit, by 5-5 in the fourth set, Kyrgios had calmed himself by a decisive measure and mounted his counterattack. He conjured three break points, lifting most of the 10,500 fans inside Melbourne Arena to their feet. Simon dug in again, saving each of them, but then double-faulted to gift Kyrgios another opportunity. He took it, then the match, holding a finger to his ear to ratchet up the applause before firing an ace down the middle to seal it.</p> <p>Afterwards, Kyrgios issued an apology to his corner for the outburst. \u201cI was being a bit of a dickhead to them,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cI apologised as soon as I went back into the locker room. They don\u2019t deserve that. They do a lot of things for me on and off the court \u2026 my behaviour towards my box tonight was not acceptable. In my next match, I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of Kyrgios now, most likely, are 16th seed Karen Khachanov and world No 1 Rafael Nadal, the latter of whom had his service routine mocked by Kyrgios tonight \u2013 just one in a series of highly entertaining but inadvisable moves by the local hero. Neither Khachanov nor Nadal would relish playing an inspired Kyrgios. But both know his frailties, as evidenced tonight when the civil war between Good Nick and Bad Nick flared up again inside Kyrgios\u2019s head. If those two personas could play against each other, it would either revolutionise or end tennis.</p> <p>Two points of greater interest occurred off the court. Before it began, in the bowels of Melbourne Park, Kyrgios paced nervously, staring at the floor, the signature headphones pulled tight over his ears, determinedly avoiding small talk with milling players and officials.

Here again was proof that despite what the critics claim, despite what Kyrgios himself sometimes claims, the game really does matter to him. The fourth set reconfirmed that view.</p> <p>The other was the atmosphere in Kyrgios\u2019s entourage. In the past, the tone has tended to be set by Kyrgios\u2019s brother, Christos, his loudest backer but occasionally a distracting one.

      "body": "<p>A year ago, on 23 January 2019, Juan Guaid\u00f3, chairman of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled national assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/jan/23/venezuela-opposition-leader-juan-guaido-declares-himself-interim-president-video\" title=\"\">proclaimed himself president</a> of the country and vowed to remove Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s pretender government was swiftly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/feb/19/donald-trumps-direct-appeal-to-venezuelan-military-to-back-opposition-leader-juan-guaido-video\" title=\"\">recognised by the Trump administration</a>, as well as by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Brazil, and eventually some 50 countries in total. As street protests flared in Caracas, it seemed to many outside Venezuela that Maduro\u2019s days in office were numbered \u2013 and with them those of Chavismo, the radical left-populist movement that first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/on-the-road-venezuela-20-years-after-hugo-chavez-rise\" title=\"\">surged to power in 1998</a> under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Yet, one year on, Maduro remains firmly ensconced in the presidential Miraflores Palace. And not only has the US-backed attempt at regime change failed to dislodge him, but it is now Guaid\u00f3\u2019s position at the head of the Venezuelan opposition that is looking shaky.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fact of US backing for Guaid\u00f3\u2019s coup attempt was itself a major factor in rallying support for Maduro</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why did predictions of Maduro\u2019s imminent departure prove so ill-founded? The mismatch was partly the product of wishful thinking on the part of international establishment opinion. There has been a through-the-looking-glass aspect to much coverage of Venezuela over the past year, as if the reality were simply whatever the opposition said it was, rather than a political struggle it was the media\u2019s job to analyse and explain. But it is also clear that the US-sponsored drive towards regime change in Venezuela was premised on a series of miscalculations.</p> <p>It was based, firstly, on an overestimation of the popular appeal of the Venezuelan opposition. A fringe politician before being elevated to the chairmanship of the national assembly, Guaid\u00f3 was always something of an ersatz figurehead, better at cultivating a following on Twitter than among ordinary Venezuelans. The confrontational strategy advocated by Guaid\u00f3 and his political mentor, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, was in part designed precisely to compensate for their lack of a broad support base, ratcheting up the pressure so the situation more closely matched the fever pitch of their anti-Chavista rhetoric.</p> <p>After failing to topple Maduro last January as planned, other debacles followed, notably an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/apr/30/venezuela-opposition-leader-juan-guaido-claims-coup-underway-live-news\" title=\"\">abortive army putsch</a> on 30 April. This effort was very clearly concerted with US officials, including John Bolton, then national security adviser, who lamented that senior Venezuelan officials who were <a href=\"https://www.hughhewitt.com/ambassador-john-bolton-on-uprising-in-venezuela/\" title=\"\">supposed to have changed sides</a> had not done so. This pointed to another major miscalculation: the opposition had clearly exaggerated the degree of discontent with Maduro within the army, and officials in Washington either didn\u2019t know better or didn\u2019t care to question this misleading view.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest miscalculation of all, both by the Venezuelan opposition and the Trump administration, was to underestimate the resilience of Chavismo. Amid a desperate economic situation, and with a population suffering from unemployment, hunger and police repression, Maduro\u2019s popularity had plummeted, his support dwindling even in loyal constituencies. Yet discontent with Maduro was one thing; getting behind the Venezuelan opposition quite another.

      "bodyText": "A year ago, on 23 January 2019, Juan Guaid\u00f3, chairman of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled national assembly, proclaimed himself president of the country and vowed to remove Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s pretender government was swiftly recognised by the Trump administration, as well as by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Brazil, and eventually some 50 countries in total. As street protests flared in Caracas, it seemed to many outside Venezuela that Maduro\u2019s days in office were numbered \u2013 and with them those of Chavismo, the radical left-populist movement that first surged to power in 1998 under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Yet, one year on, Maduro remains firmly ensconced in the presidential Miraflores Palace. And not only has the US-backed attempt at regime change failed to dislodge him, but it is now Guaid\u00f3\u2019s position at the head of the Venezuelan opposition that is looking shaky. Why did predictions of Maduro\u2019s imminent departure prove so ill-founded? The mismatch was partly the product of wishful thinking on the part of international establishment opinion. There has been a through-the-looking-glass aspect to much coverage of Venezuela over the past year, as if the reality were simply whatever the opposition said it was, rather than a political struggle it was the media\u2019s job to analyse and explain. But it is also clear that the US-sponsored drive towards regime change in Venezuela was premised on a series of miscalculations. It was based, firstly, on an overestimation of the popular appeal of the Venezuelan opposition. A fringe politician before being elevated to the chairmanship of the national assembly, Guaid\u00f3 was always something of an ersatz figurehead, better at cultivating a following on Twitter than among ordinary Venezuelans. The confrontational strategy advocated by Guaid\u00f3 and his political mentor, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, was in part designed precisely to compensate for their lack of a broad support base, ratcheting up the pressure so the situation more closely matched the fever pitch of their anti-Chavista rhetoric. After failing to topple Maduro last January as planned, other debacles followed, notably an abortive army putsch on 30 April. This effort was very clearly concerted with US officials, including John Bolton, then national security adviser, who lamented that senior Venezuelan officials who were supposed to have changed sides had not done so. This pointed to another major miscalculation: the opposition had clearly exaggerated the degree of discontent with Maduro within the army, and officials in Washington either didn\u2019t know better or didn\u2019t care to question this misleading view. But perhaps the biggest miscalculation of all, both by the Venezuelan opposition and the Trump administration, was to underestimate the resilience of Chavismo. Amid a desperate economic situation, and with a population suffering from unemployment, hunger and police repression, Maduro\u2019s popularity had plummeted, his support dwindling even in loyal constituencies. Yet discontent with Maduro was one thing; getting behind the Venezuelan opposition quite another. The fact of US backing for Guaid\u00f3\u2019s coup attempt was itself a major factor in rallying support for Maduro: Venezuelans have good reasons to hesitate before opting for a government glued together in Miami and Washington. Once the initial drive for regime change fizzled out, the Venezuelan opposition camp also ran into other problems. Last June two of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s aides were mired in a corruption scandal, and more sleaze came to the surface in December over ties between nine Venezuelan opposition members and a Colombian businessman who was facing US sanctions. Another dent to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s image came in September when photographs surfaced of him alongside members of one of Colombia\u2019s rightwing paramilitary groups. But the most damaging blow came on 5 January 2020, when the national assembly voted to replace Guaid\u00f3 as chair with a rival oppositionist, Luis Parra. This deprived Guaid\u00f3 of his already slender constitutional claim to the de facto presidency. Accounts of what happened next are highly contested: Guaid\u00f3 claims he was barred from entering the national assembly, and was filmed climbing the fence that surrounds the building; other opposition deputies, however, reportedly entered freely, and many of them voted for Parra. Later that day, Guaid\u00f3 held a parallel vote in the offices of an opposition newspaper, El Nacional, that reinstated him as national assembly chair. A week later, on 13 January, the US made its feelings clear by imposing sanctions on several opposition deputies who had voted for Parra, as well as on Parra himself. Behind these manoeuvres lies a highly significant division within the opposition, between those still committed to regime change at all costs and those willing to negotiate with Maduro to find some kind of political solution to Venezuela\u2019s crisis. Guaid\u00f3 represents the former group, but with the regime-change strategy stalled, the initiative last year began to shift to the latter camp. In May 2019 and again in July, talks brokered by Norway were held between representatives of Maduro and the opposition. It was partly to break the momentum of these talks that the Trump administration announced a new and even more punitive round of sanctions last August. Aimed at tightening the screws on the Maduro government, they amount, like all sanctions, to collective punishment for the entire population, and have undoubtedly made an already dire situation much worse.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Opera and thermal baths, Italy Listening to Puccini and other Italian opera classics while sparkling stars lit the night skies was just the tonic I needed last summer. I stumbled on the lovely resort of Salsomaggiore Terme when I was driving around the verdant hills of Emilia-Romagna. I thought I might stay a day to enjoy the thermal waters \u2013 but ended up staying a week. The town is full of natural water fountains, belle \u00e9poque buildings, peaceful cafes and eateries. The elegant Grand Hotel (doubles from \u20ac120 B&amp;B), where I stayed, offered open-air tai chi classes in the gardens, and all kinds of mud and relaxation treatments are available at most hotels in the town. Nigel The forest treatment, Czech Republic I\u2019ve enjoyed several wellness breaks in the forested Beskydy mountains in the east of the country, around Ostrava, where there are several spa and treatment hotels with forest trails to walk or bike during the day, before soaks in a hot tub or soothe your feet in a Kneipp bath (water tank with herbal extracts) at night. \u010celadenec is one of the best, but I\u2019ve enjoyed a stay down the road at Miura, too. There are wolves, lynx and bears in the woods, though you are more likely to spot woodpeckers and owls. Tasty grilled freshwater fish will supply your omega 3, and if you are there in summer, the Colours Festival in Ostrava (15-18 July) will feed your inner culture vulture. If you want to ditch wellness temporarily, Modr\u00e1 My\u0161 in the old town does a mean cocktail or two. \u2022 Two-night package at Miura \u00a3405 full board with massages and spa (miura.cz); two-night packages at \u010celadenec from \u00a3270 Rose Marwood Sensory walking, Black Forest, Germany My wife, two young children and I spent a day on a barefoot sensory trail at Park mit Allen Sinnen (Park with all Senses). It\u2019s in Singersbach, 48km north-east of Freiburg. It involved walking for several kilometres barefoot over grass, sand, wood chips, stone, mud and more while exploring all five senses. Among the sensual experiences were hollowed-out trees with objects inside to feel with your hands and guess what they were, colourful flowers to see and smell, secret scents to guess, and relaxation huts full of sights, sounds and smells. We then washed our feet at the washing station and enjoyed an ice-cream. \u2022 Adult \u20ac6, child \u20ac4, parkmitallensinnen.de Sandip Khodiara Something to digest, County Mayo, Ireland I found the health retreat at Cloona Health Retreat, near Westport on the west coast of Ireland, to be authentic, kindly, effective and refreshing. It offers gentle detox and was partly inspired by Tibetan monks who had become refugees in the UK after the Chinese invasion of their country and had worked on restoring Cloona Mill in the late 1960s. The retreat specialises in improving diet and resting the digestive system. There are lots of skilled practitioners on hand, offering extra treatments such as Tibetan bowl therapy and deep tissue massage. The place is in lovely countryside close to the sea. I loved my five-day retreat there, and lost weight, even though I didn\u2019t go on one of its specific weight-loss retreats. \u2022 Five-day retreat \u20ac720pp full-board, optional extras \u20ac30-\u20ac70, cloona.ie Joan Surf and yoga, Jersey Drift in Jersey is a wellness retreat with a real emphasis on the group experience. I wanted to experience something a bit different from a typical spa and wasn\u2019t disappointed. I learned to surf, improved my yoga immensely and got to appreciate the delights of organic vegetarian cooking. Accommodation is in bunk beds in a Martello tower but has a touch of luxury and a roof terrace for breathtaking views of the bay. The whole experience left me with an appreciation of nature and fully pressed the reset button ready for the new decade. \u2022 Next retreat 26-29 June, from \u00a3660 full-board, including transfers, three nights\u2019 accommodation, yoga and surfing, driftretreat.co.uk martin colegate Hiking and healing, Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, France After a break-up last summer, I booked a yoga and walking retreat with Make Some Breathing Space in the French Alps on a bit of a whim. It was the best thing I ever could have done. The people, the walks, the views, the food, the wild swims, the yoga instructors ... everything was incredible and so healing. A highlight included hiking to the Italian border at 2,800 metres. Yoga was twice daily (a mix of hatha, yin, and restorative), there was a hot tub, and three delicious meals a day. A wonderful experience. \u2022 From \u00a3850 for six nights in chalet accommodation, including transfers, full-board, guided hikes (tailored by ability), makesomebreathingspace.com Caitlin Bateman Yoga and meditation, Italy The most healing experience I have ever had on holiday was in Puglia, with Kaliyoga.

      "body": "<p>In the months after the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton went into the woods. They became almost comic, the sightings of her that would pop up on social media, as the woman who had exercised uncommon influence over American political life, who had in fact won the popular vote and nearly became president, reduced to a soul-searching wanderer in the wilderness, wearing fleece and wondering what went wrong. People asked her for selfies in public locales whose mundanity stood in contrast to her former power. Here she was, the woman who had watched Osama bin Laden die in real time, who had led one of the first major fights for healthcare reform, who had sat with presidents and prime ministers and extracted from them commitments to do things that they did not want to do. Here she was, once one of the world\u2019s most powerful people, walking on a low-altitude beginners\u2019 hiking trail. Here she was, the former senator and secretary of state and very nearly the first female president, in a supermarket outside her tony suburb, posing with a fan in front of a stack of organic apples.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/23/revealed-e-mails-show-that-nra-shaped-gun-policy-at-interior-department\">Revealed: e-mails show that NRA shaped gun policy at interior department</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a degree of schadenfreude in the sharing of these pictures of Clinton during the months following the 2016 presidential election. Even those most alert to the coming dangers and needless suffering that would be imposed by a Donald Trump presidency seemed a bit giddy at how far she had fallen, relieved to see her knocked from her perch of power. Much of the hate, of course, came from Republicans, people who resented the moments of her political career, fleeting and sporadic as they were, that seemed aimed at reducing the suffering of working people, or inching the nation towards justice. The rest of the hate came from liberals and leftists, people who had voted for Clinton in 2016 begrudgingly or with reserve, who considered their support of her against Trump as a kind of harm reduction.</p> <p>Some of the left\u2019s hostility to her was revived this week when an excerpt from an interview she conducted for a new Netflix documentary series, Hillary, was released by the Hollywood Reporter. In the interview, Clinton offers commentary on perhaps the one person in American political life it is most dangerous for her to comment on: her 2016 Democratic primary rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. She said that \u201cnobody likes him\u201d in Washington. She said he has accomplished little in his career. She said that other politicians are disinclined to work with him.</p> <p>All of this may or may not be true, but it\u2019s not clear why Clinton would say it. If these comments were meant to harm Sanders\u2019 chances of winning the Democratic primary, they are more likely to do the opposite. Sanders\u2019 own pitch to voters relies heavily on his outsider status in Washington, and tends to aestheticize his grumpy temperament as a sign of integrity. Many voters, alienated by Washington, will hear that a candidate is disliked there and think: good. Disapproval from Clinton may itself be seen as a virtue from a certain class of liberal voters, among whom her reputation is not good.</p> <p>Because though she is hated passionately and without reserve on the right, the Democratic party and those roughly aligned with it rightly have at best a very ambivalent relationship toward Hillary. Ambivalence might be the most that she deserves. Her political career was long, and over her three decades of activity in national politics she was frequently on the wrong side of history. Many of her positions seemed motivated more by political convenience than by principle. She was too cozy with corporate interests as a senator, and she was too comfortable with military intervention as secretary of state. She seemed inscrutable; it was difficult to know what she really thought, perhaps because so many people who interpreted her career as pundits and commentators insisted that what she said was never what she really meant.</p> <p>Over these decades, Clinton became an avatar of the Democratic party\u2019s worst impulses: its frightened run to the center during the 90s and 2000s, its comfort with compromise and acquiescence, its elites\u2019 preoccupation with convention and procedure at the expense of taking important moral stands or being accountable to its base. Hillary became a symbol of corruption, centrism and cynicism. At times, she really deserved it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is what is so maddening: she makes it clear sexism can happen to women who are also bad people, or who have made bad choices</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At other times, she didn\u2019t. It is impossible to deny the reality that Clinton, as an uncommonly powerful woman, was also the object of tremendous sexist vitriol, a passionate fixation on her that animated even the legitimate grievances against her with an intensity unseen in critiques of similar male politicians. The media fixated on her thick ankles, and then they fixated on her masculine pantsuits. It became a common party joke to make strange and morbid speculations about her sex life. Her personal virtues were interpreted as suspicious: intelligence morphed into cunning, determination became ambition, resolve morphed into stubbornness, care and studiousness became dishonesty and scheming. Among the most fixated and rancorous of her critics, even valid complaints about her seem undergirded with a passion that is more psychological than moral.</p> <p>This is what is so maddening about Hillary Clinton: she makes it clear that sexism can happen to women who are also bad people, or who have made bad choices. She makes it clear that righteous anger can also contain misogynist contempt. She makes it clear that sexist double standards often mean not only that good women are held unfairly responsible, but that bad women are held responsible where bad men are not. The role of sexism in our reactions to Clinton is complex, as complex as the messy reality that all of us who have been wronged have in fact done wrong ourselves. But complexity is something our political media, in particular, are ill-equipped to describe. Clinton\u2019s example requires us to hold multiple inconvenient, contradictory thoughts in our minds at the same time: that sexism can be unjust even when it is directed at women who are themselves perpetrators of injustice; that sometimes bigotry is wielded even against people who are not impeccable or particularly deserving of sympathy. But even when its targets are unlikable, sexism, still, is wrong.</p> <p>For her part, Clinton has turned into another kind of figure that our culture has difficulty parsing: a woman who is not just old, but old and angry. Her long career was punctuated with humiliations: the defeat of her healthcare reform effort, her husband\u2019s public affairs, her loss of the 2008 presidential primary. And it was capped with the greatest humiliation of all: her loss, on a constitutional technicality, to a racist, sexist, boorish man, who outmatched even her in cynicism but possessed none of her intellect. She is angry at these humiliations, and she seems committed to her anger, directing it unhelpfully at some of the wrong people, uselessly at some of the right ones.</p> <p>Still, there is something disarming about this version of Hillary, even as she kicks dirt bitterly at an old rival, and throws destructive bombs into the political conversation. The woman who has given interviews since the 2016 election is vulnerable, angry, resentful and tired, nothing at all like the consultant-polished entity she was before, speaking in vague, noncommittal terms that were so rigorously inoffensive that they hardly had any content. Now that her political career is over and she is no longer seeking power, the aura of suspicion and dishonesty about her has dissipated, and people no longer reflexively disbelieve her. Her statements are unvarnished, sometimes even frankly resentful. She says the kind of thing that would be disastrous if she were actually in power. To the voters who hate her, she seems comfortable letting them know that she hates them, too. For better and frequently for worse, Clinton has shed the pretense of trying to be liked. Finally, we feel sure she\u2019s saying what she means.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Hillary became a symbol of corruption, centrism and cynicism. At times, she really deserved it. At other times, she didn\u2019t. It is impossible to deny the reality that Clinton, as an uncommonly powerful woman, was also the object of tremendous sexist vitriol, a passionate fixation on her that animated even the legitimate grievances against her with an intensity unseen in critiques of similar male politicians. The media fixated on her thick ankles, and then they fixated on her masculine pantsuits. It became a common party joke to make strange and morbid speculations about her sex life. Her personal virtues were interpreted as suspicious: intelligence morphed into cunning, determination became ambition, resolve morphed into stubbornness, care and studiousness became dishonesty and scheming. Among the most fixated and rancorous of her critics, even valid complaints about her seem undergirded with a passion that is more psychological than moral. This is what is so maddening about Hillary Clinton: she makes it clear that sexism can happen to women who are also bad people, or who have made bad choices. She makes it clear that righteous anger can also contain misogynist contempt. She makes it clear that sexist double standards often mean not only that good women are held unfairly responsible, but that bad women are held responsible where bad men are not. The role of sexism in our reactions to Clinton is complex, as complex as the messy reality that all of us who have been wronged have in fact done wrong ourselves. But complexity is something our political media, in particular, are ill-equipped to describe. Clinton\u2019s example requires us to hold multiple inconvenient, contradictory thoughts in our minds at the same time: that sexism can be unjust even when it is directed at women who are themselves perpetrators of injustice; that sometimes bigotry is wielded even against people who are not impeccable or particularly deserving of sympathy. But even when its targets are unlikable, sexism, still, is wrong. For her part, Clinton has turned into another kind of figure that our culture has difficulty parsing: a woman who is not just old, but old and angry. Her long career was punctuated with humiliations: the defeat of her healthcare reform effort, her husband\u2019s public affairs, her loss of the 2008 presidential primary. And it was capped with the greatest humiliation of all: her loss, on a constitutional technicality, to a racist, sexist, boorish man, who outmatched even her in cynicism but possessed none of her intellect. She is angry at these humiliations, and she seems committed to her anger, directing it unhelpfully at some of the wrong people, uselessly at some of the right ones. Still, there is something disarming about this version of Hillary, even as she kicks dirt bitterly at an old rival, and throws destructive bombs into the political conversation. The woman who has given interviews since the 2016 election is vulnerable, angry, resentful and tired, nothing at all like the consultant-polished entity she was before, speaking in vague, noncommittal terms that were so rigorously inoffensive that they hardly had any content. Now that her political career is over and she is no longer seeking power, the aura of suspicion and dishonesty about her has dissipated, and people no longer reflexively disbelieve her. Her statements are unvarnished, sometimes even frankly resentful. She says the kind of thing that would be disastrous if she were actually in power. To the voters who hate her, she seems comfortable letting them know that she hates them, too. For better and frequently for worse, Clinton has shed the pretense of trying to be liked. Finally, we feel sure she\u2019s saying what she means. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly an extraordinary development.

Panic in Wuhan as China bars 11m residents from leaving Supermarket shelves are bare and the sense of panic is palpable in Wuhan after the Chinese city of 11 million people was put on lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Public transport out of the city has been suspended in response to the outbreak, which has now killed 17 people and infected almost 600 in China and spread to three other Asian countries and the US. However, the World Health Organization has so far refrained from declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. US case.

Trump has said he will speak at an anti-abortion demonstration in Washington on Friday, organised by the group March for Life.

Once again, the major problem in labor markets is a slowing pace of job creation, associated with this sluggish economic expansion, rather than an accelerating pace of automation-induced job destruction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/22/jeff-bezos-hacking-allegations-saudi-arabia-us-uk-support\">The Jeff Bezos hacking allegations destroy the myth of a new Saudi Arabia | David Wearing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the 1970s, when industrial competition began to heat up and economic growth rates deteriorated, unemployment levels in many countries first rose and then stubbornly refused to fall. Politicians began to push for weakened job protections and scaled-back unemployment benefits.</p> <p>Workfare came to serve as the main response to job loss. Outside of a few countries that still provide generous benefits to the unemployed, such as France, few workers can afford to remain unemployed for long. Job-losers tend to join young labour-market entrants in part-time, temporary or no-contract work.</p> <p>In most countries, these \u201cnon-standard\u201d workers have few legal protections and are economically precarious. They are forced to moderate their demands in slow-growing economies. Workers who are not protected by powerful unions or labor laws find it difficult to pressure employers to raise their wages or improve working conditions.</p> <p>As long as underemployment persists, inequality is likely to intensify. An expanding gap between the growth of real wages and productivity levels has contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/g20/topics/employment-and-social-policy/The-Labour-Share-in-G20-Economies.pdf\">9% shift</a> from labor income to capital income in the G20 countries over the past 50 years.</p> <p>In sluggish economies periodically racked by economic crisis and austerity, it is easier to blame the resulting social deterioration on robots, or on vulnerable sections of the workforce such as immigrants, women, and racial or religious minorities, than to face its true causes.</p> <p>Given the winding down of the industrial-growth engine \u2013 which has accompanied the spread of productive capacities around the world \u2013 restoring previously prevailing rates of economic growth will prove difficult if not impossible.

The best explanation for this worsening economic stagnation is that, since the 1970s, more and more countries adopted export-led growth strategies, built up manufacturing sectors and began to compete in global markets. That led in turn to heightened competition, making fast-paced industrial expansion \u2013 and fast-paced economic growth \u2013 much more difficult to achieve. In this context, countries with high levels of robotization are not necessarily the ones that have lost the most industrial jobs. On the contrary, Germany, Japan and South Korea have some of the highest levels of robots per manufacturing worker but also boast higher manufacturing employment shares. In Germany and Japan, automation helps firms preserve jobs in manufacturing in the face of intense international competition. Chinese firms have been investing heavily in robotics in the past few years, to preserve jobs as domestic wages rise and competition from even lower-cost countries intensifies. Meanwhile, no other sector has replaced industry as a major economic growth engine. In country after country, slowing industrial expansion has been accompanied by falling rates of economic growth. Some services like wholesale trade have seen spurts of rapid productivity growth, but these fail to coalesce into sustained, sector-wide efficiency gains like those endemic to manufacturing over the history of its development. The wider environment of slowing growth explains the prevailing low labor demand largely by itself. Once again, the major problem in labor markets is a slowing pace of job creation, associated with this sluggish economic expansion, rather than an accelerating pace of automation-induced job destruction. From the 1970s, when industrial competition began to heat up and economic growth rates deteriorated, unemployment levels in many countries first rose and then stubbornly refused to fall. Politicians began to push for weakened job protections and scaled-back unemployment benefits. Workfare came to serve as the main response to job loss. Outside of a few countries that still provide generous benefits to the unemployed, such as France, few workers can afford to remain unemployed for long. Job-losers tend to join young labour-market entrants in part-time, temporary or no-contract work. In most countries, these \u201cnon-standard\u201d workers have few legal protections and are economically precarious. They are forced to moderate their demands in slow-growing economies. Workers who are not protected by powerful unions or labor laws find it difficult to pressure employers to raise their wages or improve working conditions. As long as underemployment persists, inequality is likely to intensify. An expanding gap between the growth of real wages and productivity levels has contributed to a 9% shift from labor income to capital income in the G20 countries over the past 50 years. In sluggish economies periodically racked by economic crisis and austerity, it is easier to blame the resulting social deterioration on robots, or on vulnerable sections of the workforce such as immigrants, women, and racial or religious minorities, than to face its true causes. Given the winding down of the industrial-growth engine \u2013 which has accompanied the spread of productive capacities around the world \u2013 restoring previously prevailing rates of economic growth will prove difficult if not impossible. Unless we find some way to share the work that remains, beggar-thy-neighbor politics really will tear our societies apart.

      "body": "<p>In the fall of 2017, a National Rifle Association lobbyist named Benjamin Cassidy left his job at the influential gun group. His next stop: a top position at the US interior department, which oversees hundreds of millions of acres of federal land across the country.</p> <p>Once in office, it didn\u2019t take Cassidy long to use his new government gig to provide his longtime NRA colleagues with special access to the powerful federal agency, as revealed by previously unreleased communications obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The messages underscore the potent influence that industry lobbyists and conservative organizations enjoy at a government agency where many key leaders are former lobbyists and conservative activists themselves. The NRA has made the most of this dynamic during the Trump presidency, leveraging its connections to shape policy outcomes and personnel decisions at the interior department.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/teachers-and-school-staff-to-be-given-weapons-training-white-house-says\">Trump administration drops age limit proposal for guns after NRA files suit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017, for instance, Susan LaPierre, a prominent NRA member and the wife of NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, was appointed by the head of the interior department to the board of the National Parks Foundation, a congressionally chartered organization that supports park programs.</p> <p>The interior secretary, David Bernhardt, has also made multiple appearances on NRA media channels in recent years, and in June he announced a proposal to open more than 1.4m acres of national wildlife refuge land to hunting and fishing activities. The NRA celebrated the move, calling it a \u201cproposal supported and encouraged by the NRA\u201d. </p> <p>Just this week, Bernhardt tweeted that \u201cRespecting our second amendment is fundamental to our constitutional republic. We\u2019re expanding opportunities to enjoy hunting and recreational shooting on our wonderful public lands.\u201d</p> <p>But Benjamin Cassidy is the official that most embodies the NRA\u2019s influence at the interior department.</p> <p>Starting in October 2017, and for months afterward, Cassidy served as a key contact for the gun group inside the interior department, helping the NRA translate its priorities into action from his perch at the agency\u2019s external affairs office. The NRA spent roughly $30m helping Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016. With assistance from its former lobbyist, Cassidy, it has since reaped rewards in the realm of federal public land and wildlife policy.</p> <p>In one instance, emails show, he sought to arrange a sitdown between Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, and Chris Cox, a top NRA official. (An interior department spokesperson said Bernhardt did not attend any such meeting.)</p> <p>In another case, he appears to have helped an NRA official join the International Wildlife Conservation Council (IWCC), an advisory body set up by the department to help shape policy regarding \u201cinternational recreational hunting\u201d. In a December 2017 email, Erica Rhoad, the director of hunting policy at NRA, wrote to Cassidy: \u201cBen, Attached please find two nominations for the IWCC.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cassidy replied. Rhoad, who was one of the nominees, eventually obtained the position she sought on the IWCC, which was stacked with pro-hunting advocates. The IWCC would go on to promote big-game trophy hunting overseas, a longtime NRA priority. In 2018, conservationists sued to disband the council, and their case is ongoing.</p> <p>Most significantly, Cassidy was in regular communication with NRA about recreational shooting policy on federal lands. Almost immediately after joining DOI in October 2017, for instance, Cassidy reached out to Susan Recce, director of the NRA\u2019s conservation, wildlife and natural resources program, asking her to weigh in on an interior department plan to limit recreational shooting at the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona, a plan the NRA was keenly interested in.</p> <p>\u201cHi Susan! Hope you are great!\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cDo you have a quick moment to hop on the phone and discuss recreational shooting in the sonoran desert? We have a [deadline] that is due today.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cacd27d6850217564588683a225f1751922af587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cacd27d6850217564588683a225f1751922af587/0_0_5500_3660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Target shooting in the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona is controversial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Target shooting in the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona is controversial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Target shooting in the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona is controversial \u2013 it has damaged archeological artifacts, destroyed saguaro cacti, and harmed other natural and cultural resources.</p> <p>Recce replied with an NRA plan to leave more of the monument open to target shooting.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, Cassidy kept Recce updated on the progress of that target-shooting plan and others, including a proposal to restrict target shooting on public lands in Utah, which the NRA opposed.</p> <p>In the case of the Sonoran Desert national monument, the NRA got what it wanted. In March 2018, the department signed its final plan, which aligned almost perfectly with the NRA\u2019s request, leaving roughly 90% of the monument open to recreational shooting.</p> <p>Susan Recce thanked Cassidy for his help in a note that testifies to their close ties.\u201cI appreciate you riding herd over the agency plans affecting recreational shooting,\u201d she wrote to him in a January 2018 email, using a cowboy term to describe his role taking the lead on target shooting issues.</p> <p>In August 2019, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and other conservation groups sued the interior department over the issue, and their lawsuit is working its way through the courts.</p> <p>Under federal ethics guidelines, government employees are prohibited from giving \u201cpreferential treatment to any private organization or individual\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the Trump administration considered an anti-environment lobbyist like Ben Cassidy qualified to oversee our public lands speaks volumes about who it values and how it operates,\u201d said congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, in a statement. \u201cMr Cassidy weakened endangered species rules, lobbied against the Antiquities Act from inside the government, almost certainly violated his ethics pledge, and generally treated public service as a chance to dispense political favors to his friends.\u201d</p> <p>Cassidy himself became uncomfortable with his ongoing relationship with the NRA. In an October 2018 email to an NRA staffer, he informed the gun group that he could no longer work directly with it.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, due to the ethics ban, I am unable to work with the NRA on issues for one more year,\u201d he wrote. He suggested the NRA get in touch with other officials at the department instead.</p> <p>But it was too late. In April 2019, the interior department\u2019s inspector general opened an investigation into allegations that Cassidy\u2019s conduct had violated federal ethics rules, including the White House\u2019s own ethics pledge. That investigation is currently active.</p> <p>Not long afterward, Cassidy quietly stepped down from his post. In July 2019, he took a new job: director of government affairs at Safari Club International, a powerful national organization that promotes trophy hunting in the United States and overseas.</p> <p>In a statement, the interior department said it \u201cwill not comment on Mr Cassidy\u2019s motives or reasoning on leaving the department\u201d. Neither the NRA nor Cassidy\u2019s new employer responded to a request for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the fall of 2017, a National Rifle Association lobbyist named Benjamin Cassidy left his job at the influential gun group. His next stop: a top position at the US interior department, which oversees hundreds of millions of acres of federal land across the country. Once in office, it didn\u2019t take Cassidy long to use his new government gig to provide his longtime NRA colleagues with special access to the powerful federal agency, as revealed by previously unreleased communications obtained by the Guardian. The messages underscore the potent influence that industry lobbyists and conservative organizations enjoy at a government agency where many key leaders are former lobbyists and conservative activists themselves. The NRA has made the most of this dynamic during the Trump presidency, leveraging its connections to shape policy outcomes and personnel decisions at the interior department. In 2017, for instance, Susan LaPierre, a prominent NRA member and the wife of NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, was appointed by the head of the interior department to the board of the National Parks Foundation, a congressionally chartered organization that supports park programs. The interior secretary, David Bernhardt, has also made multiple appearances on NRA media channels in recent years, and in June he announced a proposal to open more than 1.4m acres of national wildlife refuge land to hunting and fishing activities. The NRA celebrated the move, calling it a \u201cproposal supported and encouraged by the NRA\u201d. Just this week, Bernhardt tweeted that \u201cRespecting our second amendment is fundamental to our constitutional republic. We\u2019re expanding opportunities to enjoy hunting and recreational shooting on our wonderful public lands.\u201d But Benjamin Cassidy is the official that most embodies the NRA\u2019s influence at the interior department. Starting in October 2017, and for months afterward, Cassidy served as a key contact for the gun group inside the interior department, helping the NRA translate its priorities into action from his perch at the agency\u2019s external affairs office. The NRA spent roughly $30m helping Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016. With assistance from its former lobbyist, Cassidy, it has since reaped rewards in the realm of federal public land and wildlife policy. In one instance, emails show, he sought to arrange a sitdown between Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, and Chris Cox, a top NRA official. (An interior department spokesperson said Bernhardt did not attend any such meeting.) In another case, he appears to have helped an NRA official join the International Wildlife Conservation Council (IWCC), an advisory body set up by the department to help shape policy regarding \u201cinternational recreational hunting\u201d. In a December 2017 email, Erica Rhoad, the director of hunting policy at NRA, wrote to Cassidy: \u201cBen, Attached please find two nominations for the IWCC.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Cassidy replied. Rhoad, who was one of the nominees, eventually obtained the position she sought on the IWCC, which was stacked with pro-hunting advocates. The IWCC would go on to promote big-game trophy hunting overseas, a longtime NRA priority. In 2018, conservationists sued to disband the council, and their case is ongoing. Most significantly, Cassidy was in regular communication with NRA about recreational shooting policy on federal lands. Almost immediately after joining DOI in October 2017, for instance, Cassidy reached out to Susan Recce, director of the NRA\u2019s conservation, wildlife and natural resources program, asking her to weigh in on an interior department plan to limit recreational shooting at the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona, a plan the NRA was keenly interested in. \u201cHi Susan! Hope you are great!\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cDo you have a quick moment to hop on the phone and discuss recreational shooting in the sonoran desert? We have a [deadline] that is due today.\u201d Target shooting in the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona is controversial \u2013 it has damaged archeological artifacts, destroyed saguaro cacti, and harmed other natural and cultural resources. Recce replied with an NRA plan to leave more of the monument open to target shooting. In the weeks that followed, Cassidy kept Recce updated on the progress of that target-shooting plan and others, including a proposal to restrict target shooting on public lands in Utah, which the NRA opposed. In the case of the Sonoran Desert national monument, the NRA got what it wanted. In March 2018, the department signed its final plan, which aligned almost perfectly with the NRA\u2019s request, leaving roughly 90% of the monument open to recreational shooting. Susan Recce thanked Cassidy for his help in a note that testifies to their close ties.\u201cI appreciate you riding herd over the agency plans affecting recreational shooting,\u201d she wrote to him in a January 2018 email, using a cowboy term to describe his role taking the lead on target shooting issues. In August 2019, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and other conservation groups sued the interior department over the issue, and their lawsuit is working its way through the courts. Under federal ethics guidelines, government employees are prohibited from giving \u201cpreferential treatment to any private organization or individual\u201d. \u201cThe fact that the Trump administration considered an anti-environment lobbyist like Ben Cassidy qualified to oversee our public lands speaks volumes about who it values and how it operates,\u201d said congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, in a statement. \u201cMr Cassidy weakened endangered species rules, lobbied against the Antiquities Act from inside the government, almost certainly violated his ethics pledge, and generally treated public service as a chance to dispense political favors to his friends.\u201d Cassidy himself became uncomfortable with his ongoing relationship with the NRA. In an October 2018 email to an NRA staffer, he informed the gun group that he could no longer work directly with it. \u201cUnfortunately, due to the ethics ban, I am unable to work with the NRA on issues for one more year,\u201d he wrote. He suggested the NRA get in touch with other officials at the department instead. But it was too late. In April 2019, the interior department\u2019s inspector general opened an investigation into allegations that Cassidy\u2019s conduct had violated federal ethics rules, including the White House\u2019s own ethics pledge. That investigation is currently active. Not long afterward, Cassidy quietly stepped down from his post. In July 2019, he took a new job: director of government affairs at Safari Club International, a powerful national organization that promotes trophy hunting in the United States and overseas. In a statement, the interior department said it \u201cwill not comment on Mr Cassidy\u2019s motives or reasoning on leaving the department\u201d. Neither the NRA nor Cassidy\u2019s new employer responded to a request for comment.",

In the decade before 2019, at least one British player \u2013 usually Andy Murray \u2013 hung around for the first weekend. On Thurday Dart followed Heather Watson, who lost 6-3, 6-0 on a tiny outside court to the 16th seed, Elise Mertens, whom she had beaten in the quarter-finals in Hobart only a week ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/23/australian-open-dart-halep-kyrgios-simon-rafael-nadal-live-tennis\">Australian Open: Kyrgios v Simon, Halep overcomes Dart \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halep paid tribute to Dart after winning 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 17 minutes in the evening on Rod Laver Arena. \u201cIt was a little bit dangerous,\u201d Halep said of a tight finish in which Dart fought back from 1-4 down to make her sweat at 4-5. \u201cI lost focus and she started to play very well at the end.\u201d</p> <p>Before stepping on to the tournament\u2019s biggest stage \u2013 the scene of her scoreless embarrassment against Maria Sharapova a year ago \u2013 Dart said her performance would indicate where her game was heading.</p> <p>Afterwards, she took no pleasure in being the last British survivor, and said: \u201cAll of us expect a lot from ourselves. We are competing in a grand slam. There are no easy matches. We are playing against the highest level players in the world, and it\u2019s incredibly tough. Every match, every opponent is very good. It\u2019s something that is still so new to me, playing all these big tournaments. To keep putting myself in situations where I am playing big players, big moment, that\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>For stretches in the first set and the start of the second, the Londoner struggled to find rhythm, but nor was she allowed to by an opponent who has travelled a journey that would appeal to her own sense of hard-won spoils. Halep moved steadily then quickly through the rankings from 723 in 2007 to 80 three years later, and on to No 1 in 2017. Her unquestionable high point so far \u2013 after breaking through to win the French Open in 2018 \u2013 arrived last summer when she played as near to perfect as it is possible in this maddening game, hitting Serena Williams off Centre Court in two lightning quick sets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/simona-halep-on-her-fearless-defeat-of-serena-williams\" title=\"\">in the Wimbledon final</a>.</p> <p>In her eight years on the Tour, 23-year-old Dart \u2013 who regards herself as a late bloomer \u2013 has risen from 811 to 121 last year, and campaigned here at 173, winning each of her three qualifying matches in two sets. The form was there, as she showed in beating Misaki Doi in a late-night dogfight in round one, and she now will edge back towards her career-high ranking.</p> <p>When Halep ended a longish game with a drop shot to break at the start of the second, the finish line looked as if it was about to rush at the British player. Her few successes had been close to the net, and the Romanian pinned her deep with booming forehands to either wing.</p> <p>Then, in fine British tradition, Dart went down in a fighting fireball of resistance, holding, for only the second time, to love for 1-4, again to stay in town at 2-5 and finally breaking her tormentor for 4-5.</p> <p>Against all the previous indicators, the ball began to go where Dart intended and she fashioned another break point as Halep wobbled in sight of safety. Dart saved three match points but overcooked her final forehand. Her personal victory was the manner of her leaving \u2013 and maybe that she had won two more games and lasted 21 minutes longer than Williams did at Wimbledon.</p> <p>Halep said of Dart: \u201cShe\u2019s definitely top 70, 60 at the moment. She can play a very high level of tennis because she\u2019s very smart. She has a good feeling of the court, also good touching with the racket. I feel she can improve a lot very soon.

      "bodyText": "The British are going home early again, beaten but mildly encouraged at the end of four days of struggle in singles at the Australian Open, and Harriet Dart at least waved goodbye with a spirited flourish against the former world No 1 Simona Halep. This, nonetheless, is the second year on the spin there will be no British player in either singles draw in the third round. In the decade before 2019, at least one British player \u2013 usually Andy Murray \u2013 hung around for the first weekend. On Thurday Dart followed Heather Watson, who lost 6-3, 6-0 on a tiny outside court to the 16th seed, Elise Mertens, whom she had beaten in the quarter-finals in Hobart only a week ago. Halep paid tribute to Dart after winning 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 17 minutes in the evening on Rod Laver Arena. \u201cIt was a little bit dangerous,\u201d Halep said of a tight finish in which Dart fought back from 1-4 down to make her sweat at 4-5. \u201cI lost focus and she started to play very well at the end.\u201d Before stepping on to the tournament\u2019s biggest stage \u2013 the scene of her scoreless embarrassment against Maria Sharapova a year ago \u2013 Dart said her performance would indicate where her game was heading. Afterwards, she took no pleasure in being the last British survivor, and said: \u201cAll of us expect a lot from ourselves. We are competing in a grand slam. There are no easy matches. We are playing against the highest level players in the world, and it\u2019s incredibly tough. Every match, every opponent is very good. It\u2019s something that is still so new to me, playing all these big tournaments. To keep putting myself in situations where I am playing big players, big moment, that\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d For stretches in the first set and the start of the second, the Londoner struggled to find rhythm, but nor was she allowed to by an opponent who has travelled a journey that would appeal to her own sense of hard-won spoils. Halep moved steadily then quickly through the rankings from 723 in 2007 to 80 three years later, and on to No 1 in 2017. Her unquestionable high point so far \u2013 after breaking through to win the French Open in 2018 \u2013 arrived last summer when she played as near to perfect as it is possible in this maddening game, hitting Serena Williams off Centre Court in two lightning quick sets in the Wimbledon final. In her eight years on the Tour, 23-year-old Dart \u2013 who regards herself as a late bloomer \u2013 has risen from 811 to 121 last year, and campaigned here at 173, winning each of her three qualifying matches in two sets. The form was there, as she showed in beating Misaki Doi in a late-night dogfight in round one, and she now will edge back towards her career-high ranking. When Halep ended a longish game with a drop shot to break at the start of the second, the finish line looked as if it was about to rush at the British player. Her few successes had been close to the net, and the Romanian pinned her deep with booming forehands to either wing. Then, in fine British tradition, Dart went down in a fighting fireball of resistance, holding, for only the second time, to love for 1-4, again to stay in town at 2-5 and finally breaking her tormentor for 4-5. Against all the previous indicators, the ball began to go where Dart intended and she fashioned another break point as Halep wobbled in sight of safety. Dart saved three match points but overcooked her final forehand. Her personal victory was the manner of her leaving \u2013 and maybe that she had won two more games and lasted 21 minutes longer than Williams did at Wimbledon. Halep said of Dart: \u201cShe\u2019s definitely top 70, 60 at the moment. She can play a very high level of tennis because she\u2019s very smart. She has a good feeling of the court, also good touching with the racket. I feel she can improve a lot very soon. But the serve, I think it\u2019s important for her to improve because it\u2019s a little bit too slow.\u201d Watson\u2019s exit was more painful to watch. Nursing a minor abdominal strain, which she will rest at home for a few days, she was disappointed after a good start to the week. \u201cMy level wasn\u2019t there today, my movement,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a millimetre or a second too slow to everything. I was letting her dictate. As the match went on, she played better and was more aggressive. I am just not happy with my performance at all.\u201d",

They are the stronger muscle group, easier to train, easier to activate, and so they can become dominant. Athletes often stabilise the knee with these muscles, underusing hamstring and gluteal muscles which can lead to an imbalance.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cRelated to quadriceps dominance is becoming ligament dominant. When we land or when we absorb force, what we should be doing is activating all the muscles around the knee joint to protect, control and stabilise the joints, rather than just the quadriceps, which act at the front of the knee. But if we don\u2019t do that, whether it\u2019s a weakness or an imbalance, then we can increase the stress on the ligament.</p> <p>\u201cNow, the ligament is only so strong and putting a lot of force through it and changing direction, there comes a point when eventually it fails if it is not adequately supported by the muscles.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cThe third issue relates to limb dominance. Football is a sport where we typically have a kicking limb and a non-kicking limb. And, again from a training perspective, they might develop differently. If you think about it typically, if you\u2019re right-footed, the left limb is going to be doing an awful lot more of the stabilising tasks when you\u2019re kicking a ball. But then also changing direction you tend to push off on your dominant limb.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cAnd then along with that comes the trunk and core. If you think of the trunk, everything in relation to changing direction or stopping/starting is trying to slow down the body. If we aren\u2019t able to keep well aligned and well structured as we change direction, if our trunk flexes while we\u2019re doing that, it shifts our weight, which changes the line with which the force goes through the joint.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>So would specific neuromuscular training programmes, which focus on rectifying an athlete\u2019s imbalances, reduce their risk of injury?

      "body": "<p> Myanmar has been ordered by the United Nations\u2019 highest court to prevent genocidal violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority and preserve any evidence of past crimes.</p> \n<p>In a momentous and unanimous decision, the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague imposed emergency \u201cprovisional measures\u201d on the country \u2013 intervening in its domestic affairs by instructing the government of Aung San Suu Kyi to respect the requirements of the 1948 genocide convention.<br><br>Declaring that there was prima facie evidence of breaches of the convention, the court warned that the estimated 600,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a> remaining in Myanmar were \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d to attacks by the military.</p> \n<p>The ruling amounts to outright rejection of the Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/12/myanmar-military-incapable-of-looking-into-abuses-court-told\">defence of her country</a> against accusations of systematic human rights abuses and war crimes during a three-day hearing at the ICJ last month. Even the judge nominated by Myanmar for the hearing voted against the country.</p> \n<p>The ICJ\u2019s orders are binding on Myanmar and create legal obligations that must be enforced. The provisional measures imposed by the court require the government to prevent genocidal acts, ensure military and police forces do not commit genocide, preserve evidence of genocidal acts and report back on its compliance within four months.</p> \n<p>The orders are automatically sent to the UN security council, where Myanmar\u2019s response will be assessed. The country receives diplomatic support from China, which is one of the five permanent members of the council.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6999998-430b-4795-b87b-75d0257a63dc\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For Aung San Suu Kyi, awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991 for non-violent democracy and human rights campaigns,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/international-court-to-rule-on-rohingya-genocide-safeguards\">the ICJ ruling</a> ordering Myanmar to prevent genocidal violence against its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a>&nbsp;Muslim minority marks another devastating blow to her reputation.</p>\n    <p>She may have calculated, as many commentators believe, that defending her country\u2019s reputation abroad would play well at home.</p>\n    <p>Defeat at The Hague, however, could demonstrate even to her Buddhist and nationalist supporters that her authority is diminished.</p>\n    <p>The ICJ only hears actions between states and does not issue warrants for arrest. There could, however, be consequences for Myanmar\u2019s leaders in future.</p>\n    <p>Separate claims have been lodged in both the International Criminal Court and Argentina\u2019s courts over torture and other war crimes. The interim ICJ orders preventing genocide may encourage judges elsewhere to take action against individuals.</p>\n    <p>Dr Andrew Fagan, the director of Essex University\u2019s human rights centre, said: \u201cThe ruling\u2026 marks a definitive stage in Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s horrific fall from grace.

      "bodyText": "Myanmar has been ordered by the United Nations\u2019 highest court to prevent genocidal violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority and preserve any evidence of past crimes. In a momentous and unanimous decision, the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague imposed emergency \u201cprovisional measures\u201d on the country \u2013 intervening in its domestic affairs by instructing the government of Aung San Suu Kyi to respect the requirements of the 1948 genocide convention. Declaring that there was prima facie evidence of breaches of the convention, the court warned that the estimated 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar were \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d to attacks by the military. The ruling amounts to outright rejection of the Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s defence of her country against accusations of systematic human rights abuses and war crimes during a three-day hearing at the ICJ last month. Even the judge nominated by Myanmar for the hearing voted against the country. The ICJ\u2019s orders are binding on Myanmar and create legal obligations that must be enforced. The provisional measures imposed by the court require the government to prevent genocidal acts, ensure military and police forces do not commit genocide, preserve evidence of genocidal acts and report back on its compliance within four months. The orders are automatically sent to the UN security council, where Myanmar\u2019s response will be assessed. The country receives diplomatic support from China, which is one of the five permanent members of the council. The case was brought to the ICJ by the Gambia, a predominantly Muslim west African state that alleges Myanmar has breached the genocide convention, which was enacted after the Holocaust. Prof Philippe Sands QC, who acted as counsel for the Gambia, said: \u201cOn the cusp of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the court\u2019s clear and forceful order, which is binding, is a significant day for international law, the rights of individuals and groups, and the meaningful obligation of every state and person to desist from any act that could plausibly be characterised as genocide.\u201d The decision was read out by the court president, Abdulqawi Yusuf. Alongside him sat 16 of the 17 judges who heard the case, all wearing black robes and white lace cravats. For just over an hour, Yusuf read out the ICJ\u2019s findings in a clear and deliberate speech that culminated in the court\u2019s four remarkable conclusions. Across the crowded camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where more than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017, the result was welcomed by those who were able to follow the news. Internet restrictions across the camps are understood to have prevented many from doing so. Khin Maung, 24, founder of the Rohingya Youth Association, said: \u201cPeople are discussing and talking to each other. People did not sleep the whole night. This is one of the exciting things for us. If the court did not decide [to call for] provisional measures, our life [would have been] lost. \u201cIn every way we are limited. Our children, the upcoming generation, I am very sorry there is no school for them. I am crying for that issue. There are religious leaders and community leaders talking to each other. Good news will spread quickly around the camps.\u201d Mohammed Arfaat, a Rohingya peace builder, actor and singer, described Thursday as a historic day. \u201cBefore I thought we will not get back our rights and justice from the Myanmar government,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a long time, I\u2019m really happy for the Gambia and other people who are doing hard work for us.\u201d Thursday\u2019s ruling dealt only with the Gambia\u2019s request for \u201cprovisional measures\u201d, the equivalent of a restraining order for states. The complaint is one of the first attempts to use the international justice system to help the Rohingya people. The ICJ imposed provisional measures on Serbia in relation to preventing genocide in the 1990s but this is the first time they have been unanimous and so wide-ranging. Even the ad hoc judge chosen by Myanmar expressed judgement against the country. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s decision to attend the court in person astounded human rights groups. Once an international icon representing peaceful defiance of military dictatorship, the 74-year-old has seen her reputation plummet as she repeatedly defended her country\u2019s army in the aftermath of the Rohingya exodus. She urged ICJ judges to dismiss allegations that Myanmar committed genocide and instead allow the country\u2019s court martial system to deal with any human rights abuses. A Myanmar government-appointed panel, the Independent Commission of Enquiry, said on Monday it had found no evidence of genocide. Rohingya leaders have branded the investigation a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. The ICJ only hears cases brought by one state against another. It has jurisdiction to hear complaints of breaches of the genocide convention even if the aggrieved state is not directly affected by violence or refugees. Dr Simon Adams, executive director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said: \u201cThis is the first step on a path to justice for the Rohingya.

      "bodyText": "Tests by a US government agency on common weedkilling products made with the chemical glyphosate have found some formulations sold to the public to be genotoxic, meaning they are damaging to human DNA. But the government scientists at the National Toxicology Program (NTP) say the danger probably lies with added ingredients in the products \u2013 not glyphosate. One of the world\u2019s best-known glyphosate-based products is Monsanto\u2019s Roundup weedkiller. Monsanto\u2019s German owner Bayer AG is currently mired in litigation brought by tens of thousands of cancer patients who claim exposure to Monsanto\u2019s Roundup and other similar glyphosate-based formulated products made by Monsanto caused their cancers. Three trial juries have agreed with the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the products cause cancer. Jury selection is under way this week in two new trials, one in California and one in Missouri. Monsanto, which brought glyphosate-based herbicides to the market in the 1970s and was acquired by German chemicals giant Bayer in 2018, has long asserted its products do not cause cancer. The NTP, which is a division of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), has been running cell-based tests to evaluate the genotoxic and cell death potential of nine \u201chigh-use\u201d agricultural glyphosate-based formulations, four residential-use glyphosate-based formulations and weedkilling chemicals sometimes included in glyphosate-based products.

The results, which are preliminary, showed genotoxic effects with some formulations but not with the pure glyphosate. Glyphosate did not cause cell death, nor DNA changes in the tests run by NTP, she said. People are rarely exposed to glyphosate by itself. Human exposure to glyphosate usually occurs in the form of glyphosate-based formulations, according to the NTP. The group of scientists doing the NTP tests found genotoxic effects with glyphosate-based formulations (GBFs) that include chemicals called surfactants, which help absorption of glyphosate into plants, plus the weedkilling chemicals diquat dibromide, mesotrione and metolachlor, which are found in some of the products.

Scruggs said the scientists have not been able to specifically study the surfactants used in the products because manufacturers do not have to disclose what is considered to be confidential business information. Product labels typically refer to surfactants only as \u201cother ingredients\u201d. NTP scientists cannot say if the genotoxic effects are due to the other herbicides mixed in with glyphosate or the surfactants. \u201cThese results suggest that while glyphosate alone lacks genotoxic activity, the genotoxicity of GBFs may require further evaluation,\u201d the NTP said in a summary of its work.

A Bayer spokesman, Chris Loder, said the tests showed the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the results were negative for genotoxicity. Regulatory reviews support such findings, he said. The NTP tests were launched after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) backs the safety of glyphosate but has not required in-depth carcinogenicity testing of the full glyphosate-based formulated product, focusing research requirements on glyphosate alone. Internal EPA documents from early 2016 show agency officials seeking to understand the makeup of formulations and asking Monsanto to provide copies of studies analyzing the safety of its fully formulated products. Other internal communications between EPA and Monsanto show that a key ingredient traditionally used in Roundup products for many years was polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA). In 2016 European regulators banned the use of POEA in glyphosate-based herbicides due to concerns about toxicity.

What lets the narrative down is its reliance on the conventional tropes of the ghost-story genre. The sound of dripping, the rank smell, the empty house, the dark forest, the mysterious phone call, the \u201cwoman in white\u201d \u2026 it\u2019s the stuff of a thousand campfires and Hollywood films. Why rely on these tired old warhorses when, with such an atmospheric setting and strong characters, there\u2019s so much else here to draw on? The book is at its best when it focuses on those objects that, though not creepy in themselves, hold a talismanic power for their owners: Lauren\u2019s mother\u2019s decade-old lipstick, which Lauren puts on in secret, or the pocketknife hinged into an antler that Niall has kept hidden away.</p> <p>Perhaps our ideas of what is \u201cscary\u201d have ossified over the years, leaving even imaginative novelists such as Toon feeling they must cleave to convention. There are plenty of readers who love the grand old archetypes of spookiness, and there\u2019s certainly room on the bookshelves for well-written tales like this one.

      "bodyText": "After nine women and children were shot dead by cartel gunmen in the barren hills of Mexico\u2019s Sierra Madre Occidental, 100 members of their fundamentalist Mormon community fled the country for the United States. Cousins Juli\u00e1n and Adrian LeBar\u00f3n lost nine close relatives in the ambush, but they never considered leaving the country of their birth. Instead, they have launched a quixotic campaign for justice \u2013 not just for their slain kin, but for the many thousands of people murdered or vanished amid Mexico\u2019s cartel violence. \u201cWe have to overcome our fears and do whatever we can to put a stop to this shit,\u201d Juli\u00e1n told the Guardian. The two cousins \u2013 nut farmers from the high plains of Chihuahua state \u2013 make unlikely anti-crime activists. But they hope that they can help persuade others to rise up and pressure their public officials to put an end to the bloodletting. It is no small ambition in a country which last year saw its highest number of homicides since records began \u2013 and where mass killings fall quickly from the news cycle. Victims of the drug wars are often seen as complicit in their own deaths, and their families left to suffer in silence. But Juli\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n argues that Mexico has endured enough suffering \u2013 and has precious little left to lose. \u201cPeople have to experience enough fear, enough pain, in order for them to say: what else can they do to me?\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s happened to me.\u201d In Mexico, victims\u2019 relatives and anti-crime activists often end up being targeted themselves, but the LeBar\u00f3n clan has stubbornly refused to keep quiet, speaking out against both organized crime \u2013 and the security policies of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. LeBar\u00f3n recognizes that such outspokenness is only possible because of his family\u2019s binational status: their ancestors moved to Mexico in the late 1800s to avoid US polygamy laws, and almost of all of the clan retains US nationality. Partly because of that, the massacre dominated headlines around the world and prompted the US president to call on Twitter for \u201cWAR\u201d against Mexico\u2019s cartels. \u201cWe have dual citizenship. We have the protection of the FBI and Donald Trump\u2019s tweets that scare the bejesus out of some people. Who the hell else is going to say something?\u201d he said, between sips of macchiato in a crowded Mexico City Starbucks. \u201cThey kill four women yesterday in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and tomorrow it\u2019s not going to be news. [But] they killed three women and some kids from our family and it\u2019s international news,\u201d he said. But the family\u2019s relative privilege, also brings responsibility with it, he argued. \u201cWe\u2019re the face and the voice of those women \u2013 and everyone that\u2019s suffering in Mexico.\u201d The LeBar\u00f3n family first rose to national prominence in 2009, when they refused to pay a ransom after a 16-year-old from their community was kidnapped. The boy\u2019s elder brother Benjam\u00edn LeBar\u00f3n led a brief campaign to demand action by the authorities and encouraging others to resist extortion \u2013 before he and his brother were murdered. Two years later, Juli\u00e1n joined an anti-violence caravan led by the poet Javier Sicilia who hoped the cross-country convoy of victims would force Mexicans to face up to the devastating impact of the violence. On Thursday, LeBar\u00f3n will march again with Sicilia who has called for new peace caravans across the country which will converge on the national palace this Sunday. The new campaign is itself a bleak indicator of the limited progress successive governments have made towards establishing rule of law. Crime statistics have continued to break new records every year: 35,588 people were murdered in 2019 and some 62,000 people have vanished since the current war on drugs was launched in 2006. Sicilia confessed that he had never planned to organize another national protest, but told the Guardian: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t take so many more deaths, especially what happened to the LeBar\u00f3ns \u2013 women and children murdered in such a repugnant, outrageous way.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo, promised to end the militarized strategy of his predecessors in favor of a vaguely defined strategy of moral renovation and addressing what he considers the root causes of violence: poverty and corruption. But so far, his promise of \u201chugs not bullets\u201d has proved ineffectual: the massacre of the Mormons came just days after gunmen from different groups massacred 13 policemen and besieged an entire city. Meanwhile a new national security force has focused more on stopping Central American migrants than catching drug traffickers. \u201cThe president has every right to hug people who are attacking him, but he has a monopoly on the use of force and the tools of security,\u201d said LeBar\u00f3n. \u201cHe has absolutely no right whatsoever to ask any citizen to embrace people that are murdering his family.\u201d He is at pains to stress that he is not an opponent of Amlo, who has twice met members of the LeBar\u00f3n family since the massacre, and promised that the case will not languish in impunity. But the family\u2019s activism \u2013 and speculation that Donald Trump might push some kind of intervention against Mexican cartels \u2013 has stoked a visceral reaction from the president\u2019s most ardent supporters. Hashtags telling the LeBar\u00f3ns to leave Mexico have surged on social media.

George McKay\u2019s <strong>Senseless Acts of Beauty</strong> is a wonderful history of the forgotten counterculture that sparked this clampdown, from the free festivals of the 70s to the Dongas tribe who occupied Twyford Down to halt a bypass. Land, and who controls it, lay at the heart of this uprising.</p> <p>The 1,000-year history of that struggle between the landowners and the landless was first spelled out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/fight-for-british-forests-access\" title=\"\">Marion Shoard</a>\u2019s <strong>This Land Is Our Land</strong>, a seminal work that helped inspire efforts to give the public greater access to our countryside.

      "bodyText": "Recent government proposals to criminalise aspects of trespass have forced the intertwined issues of land and power back into focus. But the question of who owns land in Britain has been bound up with wealth, inequality and exclusion for centuries. Traveller communities are likely to be worst affected by the government\u2019s plans, so a good place to start is Damian Le Bas\u2019s The Stopping Places, a lyrical memoir about life on the road. Le Bas\u2019s journey is a quest to rediscover his Romany roots, and along the way explore the challenges and prejudices facing Travellers. Rightwing populism needs a marginalised group to blame for society\u2019s ills, and we\u2019ve been here before: in the 1990s, the Conservatives introduced the Criminal Justice Act to crack down on Gypsies, anti-roads protesters and raves. George McKay\u2019s Senseless Acts of Beauty is a wonderful history of the forgotten counterculture that sparked this clampdown, from the free festivals of the 70s to the Dongas tribe who occupied Twyford Down to halt a bypass. Land, and who controls it, lay at the heart of this uprising. The 1,000-year history of that struggle between the landowners and the landless was first spelled out in Marion Shoard\u2019s This Land Is Our Land, a seminal work that helped inspire efforts to give the public greater access to our countryside. It can be read alongside Fay Godwin\u2019s Our Forbidden Land, a collection of extraordinary monochrome photographs of Britain\u2019s closed-off landscapes, from MoD sites behind barbed wire fences to grouse moors defended by gamekeepers and \u201ckeep out\u201d signs. Godwin was president of the Ramblers\u2019 Association, and it was thanks to her organisation that we now have a partial right to roam across 10% of England and Wales. Much remains off-limits, however, and one of the reasons why is the prestige that comes with owning land \u2013 none more so than the sporting estate. Such pretensions are memorably skewered in Roald Dahl\u2019s Danny the Champion of the World, in which a boy and his father poach pheasants from the local bigwig\u2019s wood. After his father is caught in a mantrap \u2013 the epitome of the landowning gentry\u2019s desire to exclude the great unwashed \u2013 Danny hatches a cunning plan to get his own back. Since devolution, Scottish politics has taken a very different path to England\u2019s \u2013 on land as on so much else. Andy Wightman\u2019s magnum opus The Poor Had No Lawyers is an essential guide to who owns Scotland and why land reform has flowered there in recent years. And for a bitingly witty history of the Highland clearances, take a look at John McGrath\u2019s play The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black, Black Oil. Exclusion from the land can be viewed through the prism of race as well as class. Official surveys show that BME communities are much less likely to visit the countryside than white Britons. The Forestry Commission\u2019s appointment of Zakiya Mckenzie as a writer-in-residence is one recent nod towards trying to decolonise the countryside. Mckenzie\u2019s poem \u201cWriter in the Forest\u201d explores feelings of belonging in nature: \u201cThis land that I own as every part of myself / Yet know I have no ultimate claim to contend\u201d. It\u2019s a philosophy that we urgently need to embrace: that the Earth does not ultimately belong to us \u2013 rather, we belong to the Earth. \u2022 Who Owns England? by Guy Shrubsole is published by William Collins (RRP \u00a320).

To the surprise of the other multilateral institutions, Malpass turned down his invitation to attend despite being in Europe this week for the UK government\u2019s Africa investment summit in London. In the past, World Bank presidents have played a prominent role at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, taking the opportunity to make the case for concerted action to tackle global poverty. The heads of other major international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UN, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Trade Organization and the International Labour Organisation, attended the Davos event. One source said Malpass\u2019s decision not to attend the World Economic Forum reflected the Bank\u2019s go-it-alone approach under his presidency. \u201cHe has effectively declared UDI [unilateral declaration of independence],\u201d the source said. \u201cWe saw it at last year\u2019s G7 summit in France. President [Emmanuel] Macron wanted a collective statement from the international organisations but Malpass vetoed it. He wouldn\u2019t have the word multilateralism in the statement.\u201d A spokesman for the World Economic Forum said Malpass, who was Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to head the World Bank, had been invited. The next two most senior officials at the Washington-based institution \u2013 Axel van Trotsenburg, the bank\u2019s managing director, and Philippe Le Hou\u00e9rou, the head of the bank\u2019s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation \u2013 are also notable absentees from Davos. By a tradition that stretches back to the 1940s, the US chooses the head of the bank while the European nations pick the managing director of the IMF. Since taking over less than a year ago, Malpass\u2019s prioritisation of programmes for individual countries has led to suspicions in other international bodies that the bank is in effect being run from the White House. \u201cThere is no attempt to reach out to other institutions to look for system-level policy coherence,\u201d according to one official in Davos. Those more sympathetic to Malpass said he was a shy man who did not know how to do smalltalk and hated events such as Davos. A World Bank spokesman said: \u201cThe World Bank Group is focused squarely on efforts to alleviate poverty and boost living standards. We sent senior technical experts on climate and water to the World Economic Forum to participate in discussions on how to improve development outcomes in these priority areas. \u201cWorld Bank Group president Malpass has just returned from the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020, where he met with over 10 leaders of several African countries to discuss challenges they face. He also engaged with private-sector clients and partners on local currency financing, capital markets, green financing and country-specific reforms that could be made to unlock private investment in developing countries.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Before we leave you for the night, let\u2019s briefly recap the day\u2019s events: Three US firefighters were killed on Thursday after their waterbombing plane crashed about 1.30pm while they battled bushfires in southern New South Wales. The cause of the crash is unknown. The tragedy brings the death toll to 32. Homes are reportedly lost at Moruya and Bermagui after fires once again tore through the NSW south cast. The RFS is yet to confirm the extent of the damage A fire near the Pialligo forest threatened homes and forced the closure of Canberra airport. It has since reopened, but several flights were cancelled and the city was once again blanketed by thick smoke. People in NSW and the ACT were asked to conserve energy until 8pm tonight because of the pressure \u201cextreme weather\u201d is taking on the grid. In Victoria, Melbourne was blanketed in brown rain and play at the Australian Open has been pushed back due to the weather. In slightly happier news: The RSPCA says it has set up a special hotline for people with domestic animals affected by the bushfires, and is working on a suite of support services. The RSPCA acting CEO, Tegan McPherson, says the organisation will look after pet welfare, while supporting other agencies to work with commercial livestock and wildlife. \u201cWhether it\u2019s food, water, shelter, property visits or basic pet care supplies like collars and leads to get you back on your feet, we are here for the pets and people of Victoria \u2013 now and in the months to come.\u201d This is Luke Henriques-Gomes taking over from Amy Corderoy. Thanks to Amy for all her work. Here is a statement from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a warning of damaging winds gusting up to 90kmh for more or less everywhere along the NSW coast from the Hunter all the way to the Victorian border. Canberra\u2019s airport has reopened, but only Qantas is operating, with a limited service, AAP reports. Virgin and Singapore Airlines have cancelled flights for the rest of the day. But the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has urged people to avoid the airport, so it\u2019s unclear how many people will actually be flying. \u201cIf you have a flight booked it\u2019s best to stay where you are and to contact your airline for updates on your flight schedule,\u201d Barr said. Most of the attention has been on NSW today, but there are also dangerous fires still burning in Victoria. The Buldah fire near the border is now at Watch &amp; Act. The South Coast Register is reporting that a grass fire has approached to within 200m of Moruya hospital. That\u2019s on the south bank of the Moruya River - the RFS site is showing the fire has crossed the river. Three US residents have died in NSW when a C-130 water bombing aeroplane crashed today. Canberra airport has been closed for long periods of the day, and parts of the ACT choked with toxic black smoke, due to the bushfires burning there. Thankfully, the Beard fire has been downgraded to \u201cwatch and act\u201d. However, the ACT Emergency Services Agency website is still down. Emergency information can be found on its social media accounts, or via ABC local radio. People in NSW and the ACT have been asked to conserve energy until 8pm tonight because of pressure \u201cextreme weather\u201d is taking on the grid. Energy-saving measures include not setting your air-conditioner above 24C, and turning off unnecessary appliances. There are currently 3 fires in NSW at emergency level. In Victoria, Melbourne has been blanketed in brown rain and play at the Australian Open has been pushed back due to the weather. Government buildings in Canberra are being told to turn down the air-con to help ease the load on the grid in NSW and the ACT. Public servants were told that \u201cextreme weather conditions\u201d necessitated the power-saving measures be put in place until 7pm tonight. This includes: Increasing temperature settings Turning off unused equipment and lighting Closing blinds to keep rooms cooler Encouraging staff to continue these practices once they leave work. Good news out of Canberra. The Beard fire has been downgraded from emergency alert to watch and act status. Residents in the suburbs of Beard, Oaks Estate, and Crestwood are now being advised to stay indoors to avoid hazardous smoke and to avoid the area if they\u2019re not already there. Those in Pialligo and the Brindabella Business Park should monitor conditions, stay up-to-date, and follow police directions to safely exit the area. \u201cThe fire is burning within containment lines close to Beard, Harman and Oaks Estate. The fire is currently 424 hectares in size,\u201d the emergency services agency said. \u201cFirefighters are on scene. Helicopters are water-bombing and providing aerial surveillance.\u201d The ESA has also sent out a bit more information about its website, which is still down, making it hard for residents to access critical information about the fires. It says the error is due to their website service provider Amazon. The problem is affecting the ESA and Amazon\u2019s other clients. \u201cWe are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,\u201d the ESA said. \u201cPlease continue to stay up to date via ESA Facebook and local media.\u201d We\u2019ve just heard from ACT emergency services agency commissioner Georgeina Whelan, who held a press conference in Canberra. She said the Beard fire \u2013 the product of two fires that have merged in the area near the ACT-NSW border \u2013 is still burning out of control and is 425 hectares in size. But there\u2019s some positive news. \u201cIt is burning within containment lines, which is very good news,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are aware that you are concerned about the smoke that is emanating from the fire, that is because of the recycling centre at Beard ... it is producing dangerous levels of smoke which are also reducing visibility and air quality.\u201d Whelan also spoke about the problems with the ESA website, which have taken it offline for some users. She says the issue is affecting other websites, not just the ESA, and tells people to follow the ESA on Facebook and listen to its updates on ABC radio Canberra. RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has confirmed that all three people who died in the downed C-130 this afternoon were American residents. Fitzsimmons said their deaths will impact fire fighters world-wide. \u201cThe firefighting fraternity, as we keep saying, is a tight-knit family, a fairly small family, and the crew on board were well known, not just to their colleagues here inAustralia, but we\u2019re reminded that a number of our US colleagues that are embedded in some of the incident management teams now, including in the high country, actually had personal relationships with them,\u201d he said. Fire authorities have no idea what caused the water-bombing C-130 plane to crash suddenly this afternoon, RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says. \u201cWe simply lost contract with the machine and the flight tracker we used stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no indication at this stage of what\u2019s caused the accident.\u201d He has acknowledged that the grounding of the large air tankers is likely to impact fire-fighting capabilities on the ground in NSW. Fitzsimmons has said it took \u201cquite some time\u201d to locate the wreckage of the C-130. \u201cIt\u2019s impacted heavily with the ground and initial reports are that there was a large fireball associated with the impact of the plane as it hit the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still an active fire ground and it was very difficult to locate the wreckage.\u201d Coulson Aviation, which has provided water-bombing aircraft to NSW over the past four or five years, has grounded its large air tankers as a precaution. \u201cCoulsons have grounded their large air tankers this afternoon and, indeed, as a mark of respect and as welfare for the rest of their crews operating large air tankers here in New South Wales and interstate in Victoria, have grounded the operations pending review to ensure that there\u2019s nothing systemic like a fuel problem or something,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cWe\u2019ve [also] got the military helping us with the evaluation of the fuel to rule that out.\u201d The owners of Coulson Aviation will fly to Australia from Canada as soon as possible, he said. Three people have died in a fiery crash involving a C-130 water bombing aeroplane, the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, has confirmed. The plane went down at 1.30pm. \u201cTragically, there appears to be no survivors as a result of the crash down in the Snowy Monaro area,\u201d he said. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is addressing the media in NSW: There are in excess of 70 aircraft that have been used today alone, and today is a stark and horrible reminder of the dangerous conditions that our volunteers, emergency services personnel ... undertake daily. We have more than 1,700 volunteers and personnel on the field today. There are five fires, one in the ACT and four in New South Wales, currently at emergency warning level. However, she said, authorities were confident that conditions would ease over the next few hours. To make matters worse in Canberra, the ACT\u2019s emergency services agency\u2019s website has just crashed. It\u2019s showing only a \u201c503 service error\u201d. Not great timing. The website displays the agency\u2019s crucial incident map of various fires, car crashes, and other emergencies across the territory. It\u2019s also the main source for emergency alert information for those trying to gauge whether to go or stay. It looks like the ESA\u2019s Twitter account is still active. That account is pretty regular with its updates. And, of course, you can tune in to the emergency broadcaster, ABC Canberra, for local information. 7 News is reporting that the wreckage of the downed C-130 has been found. There\u2019s a steady stream of people arriving at the Moruya showgrounds which has been reopened as an evacuation centre. For a lot of people, it\u2019s becoming a home away from home. One woman from Congo, just south of here, told me it was her third time here since New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cOur plan has been to leave early and we\u2019ve been leaving early often lately,\u201d she said. Margaret, whose husband suffers from dementia, lives on the south side of town. She was here for five days after new year and has just arrived back. \u201cI can\u2019t take of him at home when this is happening. I don\u2019t like being here but I can\u2019t be there either,\u201d she said. The wind has been incredible for the past few hours. The sky is looking ominous outside the Moruya showground where our reporter on the ground, Michael McGowan, captured this image. NSW residents have been asked to turn off any unnecessary appliances and keep airconditioners to 24C between 4 and 8pm today. Temperatures in Sydney are expected to remain as high as 40C during that time. You can see the plumes of thick black smoke coming from the recycling centre in Beard in this image provided by the ACT emergency services agency. We\u2019re getting reports that the Pialligo fire in Canberra has hit an industrial recycling centre, sending thick black smoke into the air. The ACT\u2019s emergency services agency said the fire had hit the recycling centre on Underwood Street. The fire was now producing \u201cdangerous levels\u201d of smoke, which the ESA said would reduce visibility and air quality. It advised residents to stay inside, close all windows and doors, turn off their air conditioning and evaporative coolers, and stay away from the area if they are not there already. The area between Fyshwick and Queanbeyan, where the fire is burning, is one of a handful of industrial zones in Canberra. Meanwhile, in the nearby Brindabella business park, authorities are understood to be evacuating office workers building by building. A relief centre has been set up in Dickson, in the city\u2019s inner-north, for those who can\u2019t get back to their homes. The relief centre is at Dickson College. The latest advice from the ESA: \u201cThe fire is travelling in an easterly direction towards Beard, Oaks Estate and west Queanbeyan, including Crestwood. This fire has crossed the Molonglo River near Beard. The fire is out of control. Firefighters are on scene. However, under current conditions, the fire is difficult to control.\u201d The aerial mud that fell on Melbourne in an extended deluge overnight was joined by a fresh burst of rain on Thursday to delay play on the outside courts at the Australian Open. Concerns about air pollution remain high as well, as the elements combine to bedevil the first grand slam tournament of the year. Staff had to power-blast the red carpet of dust and muck from the uncovered courts, pushing back the scheduled start of play to 2pm. There were further interruptions for rain as the card was squeezed again. It\u2019s quite a fluid situation here in Moruya on the New South Wales south coast. The massive Clyde Mountain fire is approaching at quite a clip thanks to incredibly strong westerly winds, and the Rural Fire Service says homes in the town are at risk. RFS crews are defending properties north of the town. A few minutes ago the main street was pretty well deserted as a (by now familiar) red sky came over. I\u2019ve just stopped in at the golf club and although it\u2019s quiet they say they\u2019re staying open. A few extremely keen golfers were even still out on the course. Some more on the reported crash of the air tanker from AAP: Five road ambulances and two rescue helicopters are en route after receiving reports of a plane crash in Peak View, a NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority is yet to receive confirmation a crash has occurred, a spokesman said. The NSW Rural Fire Service has said it is investigating after contact was lost with the large air tanker working in the Snowy Monaro area this afternoon. Local ground crews have reported it may have crashed, and helicopters are in the area searching for the missing aircraft. The two fires near the Canberra airport have merged. The Buldah fire in East Gippsland has moved up to emergency warning level, and residents are advised to seek shelter. There are several road closures across the ACT as a result of the fire. From the ACT: The conditions in Canberra are pretty abysmal. Video from the Brindabella business park, which was threatened by the Pialligo fire, shows the strong winds ripping through the trees and thick blankets of smoke. The business park sits right next to Canberra airport and has offices for a number of government departments and the big corporate accounting firms Deloitte and KPMG. It\u2019s understood that a number of office workers have been treated for smoke inhalation after being evacuated. The speed of the fire had caused considerable concern, and spot fires are still being put out. Warnings have also been issued for Oaks Estate, a relatively isolated suburb near the ACT-NSW border. Oaks Estate is the most disadvantaged suburb in Canberra and locals have accused the government of treating it as a \u201cleper colony\u201d and creating \u201cdisadvantage by design\u201d by leaving \u201cvulnerable men with complex mental health and drug problems\u201d in the suburb\u2019s ageing public housing complexes without proper access to the rest of the city. There is no direct bus line between Oaks Estate and Canberra. An emergency warning has been issued for a fire burning in Glen Allen in NSW. People in New Line and Creewah roads have been advised to seek shelter. A dust storm has just hit Mildura, too. The chief of the defence force, Angus Campbell, says reservists will transition from full-time service on 1 February ahead of the order being revoked on 7 February. He said reservists typically would have served for 28 days full-time continuously. \u201cI want to emphasise to you all, please, that you should see this as an appropriate transition in the form of service being invited of our reserve component, not a change to the effort being offered by the Australian defence force to assist in this time of national bushfire concern.\u201d He said the ADF was helping with the fires in Canberra and aircraft would be available if needed. The Australian Open has been suspended due to the brown rain messing up the courts in Melbourne. The Box Hill fire has been reduced to watch and act level. There has also been a lot of criticism in the past few days over whether the charities people have donated to in response to the bushfire crisis have been getting that money out to the victims of the fires. Morrison said the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and St Vincent de Paul remain \u201ctrusted, respected and good-hearted\u201d, but he said he had heard they needed more support to get the millions of dollars out to those affected. He said the federal government was building a \u201cdatabase capability\u201d to make it easier for charities to connect with the fire victims, and state governments would also help to get funds to those who need it. In a press conference, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the compulsory callout for the ADF reservists in response to the bushfire would expire on 7 February, 28 days since the callout was made. \u201cNow I want to stress absolutely that this does not mean, in any way, shape or form that you\u2019re going to see any significant change at all in the level of the defence force deployment to support the recovery effort with these bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just simply moving into a non-compulsory callout phase for reservists.\u201d He said the power to call them out remains there if needed, and defence would move to recovery and rebuilding. He said the number of personnel deployed went from 890 in December to 6,500 this month. An emergency warning has been issued for a fire on Badja Forest Road, Countegany, in the Snowy region. If you want some background on why the fire conditions have worsened in New South Wales and the ACT today, and why it\u2019s a bit calmer in Victoria (aside from the brown rain in Melbourne), you can read a piece I wrote earlier here. People in Brindabella business park in the ACT are being advised to stay where they are. It is safe there. In New South Wales, there are five fires at emergency warning level, and are listed as out of control. They are: Adaminaby complex in the Snowy region Big Jack Mountain Road, Rocky Hall, in the Bega Valley area Clyde Mountain in the Eurobodalla region Janpieter Road, Box Hill Piallago avenue grass fire in Fairbairn near the ACT. Another five fires are at watch and act stage. In Victoria, where conditions are cooler, just one fire is at watch and act level, the Buldah fire in East Gippsland. Canberra airport is closed and has been holding flights in and out of the nation\u2019s capital on Thursday as emergency services issued an emergency warning for a bushfire near Beard, Oaks Estate and West Queanbeyan. Residents have been advised to seek shelter. \u201cThe fire may pose a threat to all lives directly in its path. People in these suburbs are in danger and need to seek immediate shelter as the fire approaches,\u201d the ACT emergency services agency said. The fire started on Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures caused the situation to deteriorate. Canberra airport closed after the fires and has said it is holding flights in order to facilitate aerial firefighting efforts. A total fire ban has been issued for the territory for Thursday, with a number of fires burning, including a second fire near the airport in the suburb of Pialligo that is at watch and act level, and burning trees near Monash.",

      "bodyText": "There is just one meaningful football game left this season, and teams have already moved on to planning for next year. With that in mind, here are the biggest questions this coming offseason. Will we get more surprise retirements? Luke Kuechly shocked the NFL last week when he retired at the age of just 28. Kuechly was the latest in a line of magnificent players who have quit football before the game has taken too much of a toll on their bodies. Will others follow suit? Players are more aware than ever about the effects of playing football. Each individual has his limits, but there are more incentives than ever for players to quit early: players are making more money more quickly; smart players and agents are focusing on guaranteed dollars rather than the overall value of the deal; there is a never-ending stream of broadcasters ready to throw dollars at retired stars to be analysts. And that\u2019s before we get to health and family reasons. Who\u2019s next? There has been speculation about a trio of top quarterbacks, but they\u2019re likely to stick around. Tom Brady is set to return, whether with the Patriots or not. Philip Rivers looks like he\u2019s out of Los Angeles but will pursue options elsewhere. There has been speculation about Drew Brees, though he\u2019s coming off such a spectacular season it would be a true shock if he were to quit. One name to monitor: Cam Newton. Newton\u2019s time in Carolina looks like it\u2019s over. He has interests outside of football, and has spent multiple seasons fighting nagging injuries. His physical running style has a clear and obvious shelf life. Here\u2019s a thought: what if he doesn\u2019t retire for good but instead takes a year-long sabbatical? Will Andrew Luck return? Which brings us to Andrew Luck. Did Luck retire retire last year? Or will he return at some point? As soon as Luck made his shock announcement during a preseason game in August, talk immediately turned to when and if he would return. Luck left the game because he was in too much pain, and it was too taxing to go through the physical and mental drain necessary just to get on the field. Only he can answer whether he\u2019s in a different place as we approach the offseason. Similar questions will be asked of Kuechly moving forward, as they were of Rob Gronkowski and Calvin Johnson before him. We want to see all-time greats on the field again, particularly when we lose them in their prime. Could Luck pioneer a new career strategy: play through your first contract, sign the second, take a sabbatical, recharge, then return? It\u2019s plausible. What rule changes will the league implement? The NFL pretending it implemented reviewable pass interference calls and then just ignoring them all year has become an underappreciated story. It\u2019s evident the league tried to appease the online mob after last year\u2019s NFC championship game disaster but had no real intention of reversing on-field pass interference calls. Expect the NFL to set that rule on fire this offseason and pretend it never happened. Elsewhere, the league is looking into rules that could make the onside kick a real, actual play again.

Adding in the 4th-and-15 play would introduce a fascinating strategic wrinkle to the game and an ample opportunity for late-game entertainment, which is the whole point of this enterprise. How will the league handle the lack of minority hires? The league has once again come under criticism, rightly, for the lack of minority coaching and general manager hires during the latest carousel. The NFL has a race problem when it comes to hiring. It\u2019s not necessarily about racism, a distinction that\u2019s important and often gets lost in this discussion. Last year I wrote in detail about why minority coaches had been overlooked. In short: teams were skewing towards young, offensive coaches \u2013 offensive coordinators and quarterback coaches.

We\u2019ve seen coaches pulled from the college ranks, retreads return, and a special teams coach plucked from near-obscurity in the hopes that close proximity to Bill Belichick and Nick Saban might unlock some magic dust.

He relishes painting the city\u2019s famous sights \u2013 the Gateway of India, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel \u2013 no less than its underworld dens and the dealers, soaks and dissipated heiresses who inhabit them.

The NSW Rural Fire Service said in a statement that \u201ccontact had been lost with a Large Air Tanker which was working in the Snowy Monaro area\u201d on Thursday afternoon. The premier of NSW, Gladys Berejiklian, confirmed that three people had died, and expressed condolences to the families of the firefighters on board. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons later confirmed that all three were Americans embedded along with firefighters from other countries in the RFS teams. The plane was a C-130 Hercules, owned and operated by Coulson Aviation, a Canadian company that the RFS contracts to conduct waterbombing in Australia. \u201cTragically this afternoon, shortly before 1.30pm, we lost contact with one of our large air tankers \u2013 a C-130 water bombing aeroplane that we\u2019ve been using here in New South Wales for some years now, under contract,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cIt\u2019s impacted heavily with the ground and initial reports are that there was a large fireball associated with the impact of the plane as it hit the ground. \u201cThere is no indication at this stage of what has caused the accident [and] it would serve us all well not to speculate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still an active fireground and it will take some time with the use of ground crews and a number of aerial surveillance platforms to try to locate the wreckage.\u201d Publicly available flight tracking sites Flightradar24 and Flightaware showed a Lockheed C-130 Hercules plane flying over Namadgi National park near Canberra at 1.30pm. The plane then abruptly stopped and disappeared from tracking. Fitzsimmons said other air tankers, including those interstate, had been grounded to make sure there were no \u201csystemic\u201d faults. \u201cAs a precaution, Coulsons have grounded their large air tankers this afternoon, and, indeed, as a mark of respect and as welfare for the rest of their crews operating large air tankers here in New South Wales and interstate in Victoria.\u201d \u201cHaving spoken personally with the owner and operator of Coulsons \u2026 the owners will be on the first available flight out of Canada they can get on.

Like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/coronavirus-virus-spreading-through-china-should-people-be-worried\">passed human to human</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>At the nearby Walmart, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of Chinese life. On a busy morning at a so-called \u201cwet market\u201d in the Shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very Cantonese part of Shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. Slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies.</p> \n<p>Just a few minutes away at the nearby Walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. It has your average western supermarket vibe \u2013 white daylight lighting, sterile and clean.</p> \n<p>Staff at the meat counter in Walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. So why the huge difference in foot traffic?</p> \n<p>Molly Maj, a corporate communications representative for Walmart, says \u201cthe average customer in China still prefers fresh meat\u201d over other options.</p> \n<p>One reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to China in recent years. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eb341d6a43a605b2b606f339d611ee998a23939\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb341d6a43a605b2b606f339d611ee998a23939/0_0_5926_3956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food for sale at a food market in Sichuan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wet\u2019 markets are a huge part of life in China but have been linked to disease outbreaks.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators.

Pigs were held in dismal conditions for as long as five days before being slaughtered on the Hong Kong side, greatly enhancing the possibility of disease transmission, says Pfeiffer.<br><br>The recent shortages due to the ASF outbreak have doubled and tripled prices for fresh pork at wet markets across Hong Kong. Farms in Hong Kong itself can usually supply about 300 pigs a day. Land use and environmental restrictions prevent any increase in production. The result is further worries about Hong Kong\u2019s reliance on mainland China beyond its <a href=\"https://www.wsd.gov.hk/en/publications-and-statistics/pr-publications/the-facts/index.html\">water</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clpgroup.com/nuclearenergy/eng/energy/energy2_4.aspx\">energy</a> dependence.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany years ago, we had imports from all over Asia of live animals, but eventually the entire supply was monopolised by mainland China,\u201d said Helena Wong, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council panel on food safety and environmental hygiene. \u201cThey killed all their competitors and monopolised the supply of live pig and chicken.\u201d</p> \n<p>More than 6,000 pigs at the Sheung Shui slaughterhouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/hong-kong-culls-6000-pigs-after-african-swine-fever-found\">were culled in May 2019</a> after ASF was found among animals brought in from China.

      "bodyText": "Each evening, under cover of darkness, hundreds of live pigs from farms across China are trucked through the rusting gates of a cluster of mildew-stained quarantine and inspection buildings in the Qingshuihe logistics zone in Shenzhen. Overnight they are checked for illness, primarily the African swine fever (ASF) that is expected to kill off a quarter of the world\u2019s pigs, and reloaded on to ventilated trucks with dual mainland China and Hong Kong licence plates. Before sunrise the caravan makes its way five-and-a-half miles south to the border at Man Kam To, a small customs and immigration checkpoint, where the pigs go through further visual health checks before crossing into Hong Kong. They are bound for Sheung Shui slaughterhouse, the largest of three abattoirs in the territory. Once there they will be checked again before being dispatched in less than 24 hours under new rules meant to prevent the spread of ASF. It\u2019s a lot of effort to get fresh meat from the 1,400 pigs that cross the border each day. The appetite for freshly slaughtered \u2018warm meat\u2019 For various reasons, the Chinese prefer freshly slaughtered pig, chicken and beef over chilled or frozen meat that has been slaughtered before being shipped. That desire is at the heart of why diseases such as avian flu in poultry and ASF have been so difficult to eradicate, with huge movements of live animals from all over the country \u2013 from farm to slaughterhouse to market \u2013 on a daily basis making controlling the spread of disease incredibly difficult. A recent coronavirus outbreak in China has been linked to a wet market in Wuhan, eastern China. Like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being passed human to human. But despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of Chinese life. On a busy morning at a so-called \u201cwet market\u201d in the Shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very Cantonese part of Shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. Slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies. Just a few minutes away at the nearby Walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. It has your average western supermarket vibe \u2013 white daylight lighting, sterile and clean. Staff at the meat counter in Walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. So why the huge difference in foot traffic? Molly Maj, a corporate communications representative for Walmart, says \u201cthe average customer in China still prefers fresh meat\u201d over other options. One reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to China in recent years. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do. The habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators. They say they can tell the quality of fresh meat by its smell, colour and how it feels to the touch. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking with my students I say: \u2018The term warm meat, fresh meat, sounds disgusting to me, I grew up [in Germany] with chilled meat, that\u2019s all I know,\u201d Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at City University in Hong Kong and an expert on diseases related to animal husbandry, says. \u201cSo I ask them why and they come up with all sorts of vague things like the soup tastes better or that it is a trust issue, knowing it is a live animal at the other end and not some diseased animal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all very subjective.\u201d An \u2018utter disaster\u2019 for disease Wet markets are central to the perception that fresh meat is better, says Pfeiffer. They evoke nostalgia among shoppers, many of whom come from rural areas where all they knew were wet markets and no refrigeration. Where a wet market feels familiar a supermarket can seem alien and out of place. \u201cI actually believe that it is an important thing for the older generation to go to the wet market and chat,\u201d says Pfeiffer. However, the way the animal trade operates in China is \u201can utter disaster\u201d, for animal disease and welfare, he adds. A year ago, before rising concerns about the spread of ASF, nearly 4,000 pigs crossed daily with less scrutiny. Pigs were held in dismal conditions for as long as five days before being slaughtered on the Hong Kong side, greatly enhancing the possibility of disease transmission, says Pfeiffer. The recent shortages due to the ASF outbreak have doubled and tripled prices for fresh pork at wet markets across Hong Kong. Farms in Hong Kong itself can usually supply about 300 pigs a day. Land use and environmental restrictions prevent any increase in production. The result is further worries about Hong Kong\u2019s reliance on mainland China beyond its water and energy dependence. \u201cMany years ago, we had imports from all over Asia of live animals, but eventually the entire supply was monopolised by mainland China,\u201d said Helena Wong, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council panel on food safety and environmental hygiene. \u201cThey killed all their competitors and monopolised the supply of live pig and chicken.\u201d More than 6,000 pigs at the Sheung Shui slaughterhouse were culled in May 2019 after ASF was found among animals brought in from China. Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council is now trying to figure out how much it owes traders and farmers in compensation. Massive culls of poultry due to avian flu in imported mainland chickens in the last decade also led to large compensation bills and, eventually, to ending live chicken imports in early 2016. \u201cWe as taxpayers have to give that money,\u201d said Wong. \u201cSo now we are in a big crisis because in the past few years we have experienced avian flu and now African swine fever.\u201d A future beyond \u2018warm meat\u2019 for Hong Kong Disease outbreaks have raised wider questions about the sustainability of Chinese consumers\u2019 appetite \u2013 both on the mainland and in Hong Kong \u2013 for what is often called \u201cwarm\u201d meat. For Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China, a deeper issue driving the live animal trade is a cultural disconnect about animal welfare. \u201cThe main problem is the indifference or perception of people who simply regard animals as food, tools, or as things that people can do anything they want to,\u201d she said. \u201cIn particular, there is no perception of farm animals as having feelings, or being capable of feeling pain or suffering.\u201d Hong Kong may find it difficult to switch to a different model. There is almost no chance of farm expansion to support larger scale production within Hong Kong and, although the government is looking at possibilities of live imports from other Asian countries, the ports do not have adequate facilities to cope with large numbers. \u201cTo a large extent, if we insist on fresh food, we have to rely on China,\u201d said Wong. \u201cIf we can change and make certain concessions, Hong Kong has always been an open market for importing food items from many parts of the world. It is only for the provision of live animals that we are monopolised by the mainland farms.\u201d Reporting assistance from Zhong Yunfan.",

I would rather have a desktop/tower, if it was possible to get a more sensitive keyboard, but I have Parkinson\u2019s and find that the keys are way too hard to use because they require a deeper push than laptop keyboards. Your earlier suggestion of getting an external monitor for a laptop sounds like a winner. How is the connection made? Richard The short answer is that you should buy a desktop PC. With a laptop, you are more or less stuck with the keyboard fitted by the manufacturer, and the quality varies from average to mediocre. With a desktop PC, you can take your pick from dozens of USB and Bluetooth keyboards. These range from keyboards with flat, island-style isolated keys to full mechanical keyboards aimed at professionals and gamers. Some USB keyboards have extra-large keys with big letters for children and for grown-ups with vision and other problems. There\u2019s also a programmable membrane keyboard, Helpikeys, that doesn\u2019t have keys at all. Helpikeys works with a variety of keyboard overlays, and people can create custom keyboards with its Layout Builder software. There are lots of flat keyboards that might suit you. The wireless Bluetooth options include the Microsoft Modern (\u00a385.76 on Amazon.co.uk) and Microsoft Surface (\u00a371.99) keyboards, plus similar models from Fenifox (\u00a336.99) and Jelly Comb (\u00a329.99). Personally, I\u2019d go for the silver Cherry KC 6000 Slim wired USB keyboard (\u00a328.66), though there are cheaper wired options. Either way, consider contacting AbilityNet, a charity that provides specialist advice on technology to \u201cpeople of any age, living with any disability or impairment\u201d. AbilityNet may also be able to offer you free IT support at home through its network of volunteers. It\u2019s a wonderful resource for older people and those with disabilities. Desktop or laptop? There are some good reasons for buying a laptop. The main ones are, first, that you need to use your PC while out and about, or at least in different rooms; and second, that you don\u2019t have room for a desktop monitor and external keyboard. Size is no longer a disqualification because you can get tiny mini PCs that will attach to the back of a monitor. However, it\u2019s pretty hard to use a desktop without some sort of desk or table and a chair, and those take up valuable floor space. If you have room for a desktop, there are lots of reasons to buy one. Desktops generally run faster than laptops because they can use faster processors that run hotter.

Desktops are easier to expand, update and repair \u2013 you can usually add extra memory, bigger drives and faster graphics cards \u2013 so they should last longer. And if your system is set up correctly, desktops have better ergonomics than laptops, so they are better for your health. Laptop as desktop Most laptops let you plug in an external monitor or screen display, a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, a mouse, headphones, ethernet adapter, and external USB hard drives for backups and extra storage. Microsoft Windows supports multiple displays as standard, so the main problem is picking a cable to connect the second screen to your laptop. For most purposes, we\u2019ve already left behind VGA and DVI connections. Modern TV sets and monitors have HDMI ports, and sometimes others such as DisplayPort.

      "body": "<p>The picture on the front of my new album, Farinelli, features me in a beard. Perhaps some people will be surprised to see my cascading curls and kohl-rimmed eyes combined with neatly trimmed facial hair. But not me. Changing my appearance is simply a part of my profession. Like all performers, I take on a different guise every time I step out on to the stage.</p> <p>Farinelli is one of the most famous castratos of all time. His powerful and beautiful singing thrilled 18th-century Europe and soothed the depression of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_V_of_Spain\">Spanish king</a>. He was by all accounts an exceptional human being: highly intelligent, kind, cultured, wise and politically astute. But did he have a beard? Certainly not. The impact of having been castrated as a boy on his physical development would have prevented him growing one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e768cf3ce1aa6687741808b0a396b25d14b6b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e768cf3ce1aa6687741808b0a396b25d14b6b48/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farinelli album Cecilia Bartoli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But when getting ready to go out on stage as a hero warrior, a general or a king, he might well have had to attach a beard to his chin. Just as every night, he put a shepherd\u2019s staff or a sword in his hand, a crown or a feathered helmet on his head, or changed into a suit of armour, or a lavish gown.</p> <p>My new album is dedicated to \u2013 and named after \u2013 the celebrated singer. But I am not speaking about the man, born Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi in Andria, Italy, in January 1705. Nor is the album about current sociopolitical topics, such as issues of gender identity, or about anatomy. It is about art and music. More precisely, Farinelli is about the transformation artists undergo on stage. Through music written for \u2013 and performed by \u2013 Farinelli, I am trying to show how the astounding qualities of his voice and his profound musicianship allowed him to transmit the Egyptian queen Cleopatra\u2019s sensuality as convincingly as the virility of heroic warriors from mythical times.</p> <p>We will, unfortunately, never be able to know the actual sound of Farinelli\u2019s voice, the wonderful impact of which was testified to by many contemporaries. The songs on my album were all written for him and consequently intended to bring out the most striking features of his musicianship. Therefore, they tell us quite precisely about Farinelli\u2019s unusual vocal range (around three octaves), his masterful singing technique (virtuosic passages and extended slow phrases which competitors could not keep up with), his exceptional breath control (some phrases ranging between 40 seconds and a minute) and his powers as an interpreter (the depth of emotion expressed in these arias).</p> <p>Singing these arias today is a challenge for any singer. The breath issue also puts women at a disadvantage: our lungs are generally smaller than those of men and we really have to learn how to be thrifty with the stream of air we emit. However, the real difficulties are the long arching vocal lines and the intensity of feeling within the music. It is possible to trace a change in Farinelli\u2019s arias over the 17 years of his public stage career: they moved from being demonstratively acrobatic to more elaborate in form, slower and far more profound.

      "bodyText": "The picture on the front of my new album, Farinelli, features me in a beard. Perhaps some people will be surprised to see my cascading curls and kohl-rimmed eyes combined with neatly trimmed facial hair. But not me. Changing my appearance is simply a part of my profession. Like all performers, I take on a different guise every time I step out on to the stage. Farinelli is one of the most famous castratos of all time. His powerful and beautiful singing thrilled 18th-century Europe and soothed the depression of a Spanish king. He was by all accounts an exceptional human being: highly intelligent, kind, cultured, wise and politically astute. But did he have a beard? Certainly not. The impact of having been castrated as a boy on his physical development would have prevented him growing one. But when getting ready to go out on stage as a hero warrior, a general or a king, he might well have had to attach a beard to his chin. Just as every night, he put a shepherd\u2019s staff or a sword in his hand, a crown or a feathered helmet on his head, or changed into a suit of armour, or a lavish gown. My new album is dedicated to \u2013 and named after \u2013 the celebrated singer. But I am not speaking about the man, born Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi in Andria, Italy, in January 1705. Nor is the album about current sociopolitical topics, such as issues of gender identity, or about anatomy. It is about art and music. More precisely, Farinelli is about the transformation artists undergo on stage. Through music written for \u2013 and performed by \u2013 Farinelli, I am trying to show how the astounding qualities of his voice and his profound musicianship allowed him to transmit the Egyptian queen Cleopatra\u2019s sensuality as convincingly as the virility of heroic warriors from mythical times. We will, unfortunately, never be able to know the actual sound of Farinelli\u2019s voice, the wonderful impact of which was testified to by many contemporaries. The songs on my album were all written for him and consequently intended to bring out the most striking features of his musicianship. Therefore, they tell us quite precisely about Farinelli\u2019s unusual vocal range (around three octaves), his masterful singing technique (virtuosic passages and extended slow phrases which competitors could not keep up with), his exceptional breath control (some phrases ranging between 40 seconds and a minute) and his powers as an interpreter (the depth of emotion expressed in these arias). Singing these arias today is a challenge for any singer. The breath issue also puts women at a disadvantage: our lungs are generally smaller than those of men and we really have to learn how to be thrifty with the stream of air we emit. However, the real difficulties are the long arching vocal lines and the intensity of feeling within the music. It is possible to trace a change in Farinelli\u2019s arias over the 17 years of his public stage career: they moved from being demonstratively acrobatic to more elaborate in form, slower and far more profound. I am glad that I waited so long into my own career before I tackled this repertoire because today, I have not only the technical means but also the musical and emotional maturity required to bring these pieces back to life.

Impeachment is a theoretical, like, that\u2019s great, that there was a sentiment in the House that went that direction, but functionally it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are pro-Trump have doubled down every step along the way where he\u2019s done something you would think would shoot him in the foot. He\u2019s [like] a petulant two-year-old, just celebrating the negative.\u201d For Margaret Dos Santos, 66, an immigrant from Chile and an undecided voter who lives in Longwood, healthcare and social security take precedence over impeachment in her decision-making process. \u201cI voted for [Trump] hoping there would be some changes but it hasn\u2019t been done,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see what comes. I\u2019m not really happy with what we have, but the economy is doing better. \u201cI don\u2019t watch TV very much and I haven\u2019t been watching the impeachment. For retired people like me, the things we worry about are our wellbeing, Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d Zoila Sagadraca, a travel agent from Winter Park who immigrated to the US from Peru 19 years ago, is another more outraged by Trump\u2019s record in office than his alleged misdeeds over Ukraine that led to his impeachment. \u201cAmerica is not getting great because of his ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cHis own persona is false, he\u2019s a fraud. People don\u2019t see it because they don\u2019t want to read. But you don\u2019t have to be a journalist, or a lawyer or a writer, you\u2019ve just got to be interested in who is the president, who\u2019s the person that will influence the country where you live.\u201d For Maggie O\u2019Halloran, director of education at a Winter Park holistic school, impeachment is about accountability. \u201cIn terms of the media, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s important for us to only focus on impeachment. There are a lot of other things going on as relevant to the future, but it is taking up a lot of bandwidth,\u201d she said.\ufeff",

Speaking on the fringes of the annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, Moritz said PwC staff could be demoted or sacked for their involvement in the affair.</p> \n<p>The head of PwC\u2019s tax advisory team for Angola and Portugal, Jaime Esteves, has stepped down, telling Portugal\u2019s <a href=\"https://observador.pt/2020/01/21/pwc-jaime-esteves-deixa-de-liderar-departamento-de-fiscalidade-da-firma-que-trabalhava-com-isabel-dos-santos/\">Observador newspaper</a> that given the \u201cseriousness of the Luanda Leaks\u2019 claims\u201d, he had decided to surrender his leadership of the team. </p> \n<p>The Luanda Leaks reveal PwC acted for at least 20 companies owned by Dos Santos, her husband and their associates. It provided tax advice, consultancy and auditing services to entities in Malta, Luxembourg, Angola, Portugal and the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>Among the companies audited by PwC are several named in or connected to an asset freeze imposed by Angola\u2019s attorney general in December, on Dos Santos, her husband, an associate and their businesses. Prosecutors allege the couple drained more than $1bn from public funds through transactions with state companies including Sonangol and the national diamond exporter Sodiam.</p> \n<p>PwC replaced another big firm as Sonangol\u2019s auditor for the 2016 annual accounts, and was due to audit the books for 2017. During this period, PwC had also been retained to provide advice on a Sonangol restructuring initiated by Dos Santos when she was appointed to lead the company in June 2016.</p> \n<p>During her time at the helm, Dos Santos spent $115m on consultants. The money was paid to a Dubai consultancy run by a friend, which in turn made payments to well known firms retained to advise Sonangol. These included Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey and PwC.</p> \n<p>After Dos Santos left Sonangol, the rival firm <a href=\"http://www.sonangol.co.ao/English/AboutSonangolEP/AccountsAndReport/Pages/Accounts-and-Report.aspx\">KMPG was hired in January 2018</a> to replace PwC as auditor. Sonangol\u2019s new management said PwC\u2019s contract had been terminated early, citing conflict of interest.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe termination of the contract is based on the fact that the award of the contract to PwC constituted a conflict of interest, since the same company had already been contracted as a consultant for the transformation process,\u201d the news agency <a href=\"https://www.angop.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/economia/2017/11/49/Sonangol-PwC-agree-end-contract,5963e628-e8e0-4a0d-9d98-1230388d50bc.html\">Angop reported</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny professional services firm needs to think very hard about the reputational risk of accepting both forms of business from the same customer,\u201d said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cIt is no secret that the environment in Angola is very challenging when it comes to ethical business practices.\u201d</p> \n<p>Moritz has made tackling corruption a priority under his leadership. He is a member of the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative, a group that bills itself as the leading business voice on anti-corruption and transparency matters.

      "bodyText": "PwC, the global accounting firm battling to distance itself from a financial scandal engulfing Africa\u2019s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, was auditing the books of Angola\u2019s state oil company during a period that is now under criminal investigation. Critics says PwC\u2019s work for Sonangol, the government-owned oil group that underpins Angola\u2019s economy, raises conflict of interest concerns because the firm appears to have been retained to check the company\u2019s accounts while at the same time collecting fees to advise on a major restructure. PwC\u2019s work took place while Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola\u2019s former president, was chair of Sonangol. She was sacked from her role in November 2017, soon after her father retired. Sonangol\u2019s new management subsequently terminated PwC\u2019s audit contract, according to its annual reports. \u201cThere is a clear conflict of interest,\u201d said Prem Sikka, a professor at the University of Sheffield, who has advised policymakers on reforming the accountancy sector. \u201cThere should be a major investigation into this.\u201d It comes as Angola\u2019s attorney general has reportedly announced that Dos Santos has been named as a formal suspect in the criminal investigation. The complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass an estimated $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) fortune at the expense of the Angolan state have been revealed this week in the Luanda Leaks investigation, based on a huge cache of documents leaked from her business empire. The files reveal extensive use of the biggest global accounting firms by her businesses, with London-headquartered PwC emerging as one of the favoured advisers. Angolan prosecutors allege $38m in suspect payments were authorised in November 2017 by Dos Santos, on the day she was sacked as chair of Sonangol. Dos Santos says the payments were for consultancy work provided by blue chip firms \u2013 including PwC. A criminal inquiry into the transactions was opened by Angolan prosecutors in September last year. The businesswoman denies all wrongdoing and says she is the subject of a \u201cpolitically motivated witch-hunt\u201d. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by PwC. The firm declined to comment on its work for Sonangol. In an earlier statement, a spokesman said PwC was in the process of ending all engagements for Dos Santos and members of her family. Bob Moritz, the chairman of PwC since 2016, told reporters on Tuesday that from a reputational perspective, the revelations about his firm\u2019s ties to Dos Santos were the worst thing to have happened under his leadership. Speaking on the fringes of the annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, Moritz said PwC staff could be demoted or sacked for their involvement in the affair. The head of PwC\u2019s tax advisory team for Angola and Portugal, Jaime Esteves, has stepped down, telling Portugal\u2019s Observador newspaper that given the \u201cseriousness of the Luanda Leaks\u2019 claims\u201d, he had decided to surrender his leadership of the team. The Luanda Leaks reveal PwC acted for at least 20 companies owned by Dos Santos, her husband and their associates. It provided tax advice, consultancy and auditing services to entities in Malta, Luxembourg, Angola, Portugal and the Netherlands. Among the companies audited by PwC are several named in or connected to an asset freeze imposed by Angola\u2019s attorney general in December, on Dos Santos, her husband, an associate and their businesses. Prosecutors allege the couple drained more than $1bn from public funds through transactions with state companies including Sonangol and the national diamond exporter Sodiam. PwC replaced another big firm as Sonangol\u2019s auditor for the 2016 annual accounts, and was due to audit the books for 2017. During this period, PwC had also been retained to provide advice on a Sonangol restructuring initiated by Dos Santos when she was appointed to lead the company in June 2016. During her time at the helm, Dos Santos spent $115m on consultants. The money was paid to a Dubai consultancy run by a friend, which in turn made payments to well known firms retained to advise Sonangol. These included Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey and PwC. After Dos Santos left Sonangol, the rival firm KMPG was hired in January 2018 to replace PwC as auditor. Sonangol\u2019s new management said PwC\u2019s contract had been terminated early, citing conflict of interest. \u201cThe termination of the contract is based on the fact that the award of the contract to PwC constituted a conflict of interest, since the same company had already been contracted as a consultant for the transformation process,\u201d the news agency Angop reported. \u201cAny professional services firm needs to think very hard about the reputational risk of accepting both forms of business from the same customer,\u201d said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cIt is no secret that the environment in Angola is very challenging when it comes to ethical business practices.\u201d Moritz has made tackling corruption a priority under his leadership. He is a member of the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative, a group that bills itself as the leading business voice on anti-corruption and transparency matters. It was assembled by the World Economic Forum, which organises Davos. Dos Santos denies her fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption, and she and her husband have rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, saying their wealth is the result of decades of hard work, and that moves to freeze their assets in Angola are part of a politically motivated \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d by her father\u2019s successor as president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o. \u201cThere is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, it\u2019s completely unfounded,\u201d Dos Santos told BBC News. \u201cI can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.\u201d The revelation will add fuel to demands for regulators to break up the big four audit firms, PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte. Critics say audits can be compromised if a firm responsible for checking the books of a business is also receiving often much larger fees for advising that business on matters such as tax schemes, cost-cutting and restructuring. In April 2019, following a series of accounting scandals, Britain\u2019s competition regulator proposed a shake-up. A report by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stopped short of recommending the full breakup of the big four, but said their auditing arms should operate at arm\u2019s length from tax advice and other services. Building on similar views expressed in the Kingman review of audit regulation and the Brydon review of audit quality, the CMA said there should be rule changes to support greater competition for audit work. But the Queen\u2019s speech, which followed the landslide victory for Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories in the UK general election in December, was criticised by Sir John Kingman, chair of one of the reviews, for making only a \u201cvague reference\u201d to his proposals for a new independent watchdog for the industry or measures to challenge the big four\u2019s domination. The government only made the commitment to develop proposals on company audit and corporate reporting \u201cincluding a stronger regulator with all the powers necessary to reform the sector\u201d, without agreeing to set a timetable.",

Whatever is good makes people feel better in some way. This is alarmingly close to the economist\u2019s recursive reasoning wherein everything that is good adds \u201cutility\u201d. The persuasiveness of such statements depends on no one unpacking exactly what \u201cutility\u201d, or \u201chappiness\u201d for that matter, consists of. Yet Layard\u2019s expedient sweeping of big questions under the rhetorical rug gives rise to methodological incoherence. He relies on world happiness surveys as the basis of his data, and all the correlations and causal inferences he extrapolates. How can happiness be meaningfully measured across all countries, regions, classes, genders, religions and ethnicities, and always mean the same thing? Layard says that we can trust people\u2019s statements about their mental state because there is a \u201cgood correlation\u201d between what they say, and \u201cobjective measurements taken from the brain\u201d. This, the footnote suggests, refers to a 1990 neuroscientific experiment by Richard Davidson: test subjects were shown short emotional films and the electrical activity in their brains measured. Yet this concerns not the background \u201clife satisfaction\u201d that Layard is trying to assess, but transitory emotional responses to a stimulus. It doesn\u2019t back up Layard\u2019s methodology. It just invokes, as the book often does, the irresistible authority of brain science.</p> <p>Layard is no less slapdash in drawing his inferences. Where he finds a correlation, he immediately infers causation. Findings show that a child\u2019s happiness is strongly correlated with which primary and secondary school she attends. The author concludes that teachers and classroom methods are the main drivers of childhood happiness. He does not entertain the alternative hypothesis that attendance at a specific school is correlated with other social factors giving rise to emotional problems, such as poverty. This approach becomes jarringly recursive. We are told that mental illness, defined as being diagnosed with depression or anxiety, is a strong cause of unhappiness. This is to say, suffering is caused by suffering. Layard goes further, asserting that mental illness is a bigger factor in unhappiness than low incomes. He declines to consider whether, mental illness being correlated with low incomes, poverty brings with it circumstances that make people unwell. By the time he is trumpeting the alleged successes of CBT, Layard\u2019s handling of the data is verging on propagandistic.</p> <p>What, though, is the hard sell in aid of? Politically, it seems, the answer is third way communitarianism. Layard rejects \u201cextreme liberalism\u201d in favour of \u201creciprocal obligation\u201d. The \u201cdecline of deference\u201d may have gone too far, contributing to the rise of \u201cpopulism\u201d. \u201cHealthy competition\u201d is \u201chealthy\u201d but not the \u201cbe-all-and-end-all\u201d. Redistribution is good, but \u201cthe proportion of GNP which is raised in taxes has to be taken as given\u201d \u2013 no raising taxes on profits or wealth. The poor should be given services, not cash transfers, since \u201cpeople\u2019s choices are inefficient \u2013 they fail to choose what will in fact make them happiest\u201d. Welfare should be workfare. The author celebrates his role in persuading New Labour to offer young people low-paying jobs on pain of losing benefits, as this would make them happier than the rut of dependence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7fbf6d3b9de9a615b8045d409e05e4d81fa4855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7fbf6d3b9de9a615b8045d409e05e4d81fa4855/0_212_5036_3022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The author concludes that teachers are the main drivers of childhood happiness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author concludes that teachers are the main drivers of childhood happiness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One byproduct of the author\u2019s breezy confidence that \u201cwe\u201d know what happiness is, and that it is what life is for, is thus a creeping paternalism. This extends from the workplace to the home. Layard is astonished to find that people are least happy in the company of the boss, and that work is among the least pleasurable things we can do. He blames the problem on management philosophy. Bosses should inspire, value and pursue employee wellbeing. They should be trained to notice and inquire about possible mental health issues. As though employees might not dread that conversation. Or worry about bosses extending their reach into what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/the-happiness-industry-by-william-davies-review\" title=\"\">William Davies </a>calls the \u201csurveillance, management and government of our feelings\u201d. The obviously diverging interests of labour and capital are tellingly elided in this book. As to the potentially diverging interests of wives and husbands, the book genuinely suggests that not only can CBT solve marital grief, but it can also fix domestic abuse. The state, that is, should prescribe CBT to keep violently abusive relationships together. Much else in the book is humane, but this is verging on sinister.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/01/lynne-segal-violence-against-women-men-insecure\" title=\"\">Lynne Segal</a> has suggested that the \u201chappiness agenda\u201d ought to be named the \u201cmisery agenda\u201d. She reasons that it adapts citizens to the causes of their misery, rather than addressing them.

He does not entertain the alternative hypothesis that attendance at a specific school is correlated with other social factors giving rise to emotional problems, such as poverty. This approach becomes jarringly recursive. We are told that mental illness, defined as being diagnosed with depression or anxiety, is a strong cause of unhappiness. This is to say, suffering is caused by suffering. Layard goes further, asserting that mental illness is a bigger factor in unhappiness than low incomes. He declines to consider whether, mental illness being correlated with low incomes, poverty brings with it circumstances that make people unwell. By the time he is trumpeting the alleged successes of CBT, Layard\u2019s handling of the data is verging on propagandistic. What, though, is the hard sell in aid of? Politically, it seems, the answer is third way communitarianism. Layard rejects \u201cextreme liberalism\u201d in favour of \u201creciprocal obligation\u201d. The \u201cdecline of deference\u201d may have gone too far, contributing to the rise of \u201cpopulism\u201d. \u201cHealthy competition\u201d is \u201chealthy\u201d but not the \u201cbe-all-and-end-all\u201d. Redistribution is good, but \u201cthe proportion of GNP which is raised in taxes has to be taken as given\u201d \u2013 no raising taxes on profits or wealth. The poor should be given services, not cash transfers, since \u201cpeople\u2019s choices are inefficient \u2013 they fail to choose what will in fact make them happiest\u201d. Welfare should be workfare. The author celebrates his role in persuading New Labour to offer young people low-paying jobs on pain of losing benefits, as this would make them happier than the rut of dependence. One byproduct of the author\u2019s breezy confidence that \u201cwe\u201d know what happiness is, and that it is what life is for, is thus a creeping paternalism. This extends from the workplace to the home. Layard is astonished to find that people are least happy in the company of the boss, and that work is among the least pleasurable things we can do. He blames the problem on management philosophy. Bosses should inspire, value and pursue employee wellbeing. They should be trained to notice and inquire about possible mental health issues. As though employees might not dread that conversation. Or worry about bosses extending their reach into what William Davies calls the \u201csurveillance, management and government of our feelings\u201d. The obviously diverging interests of labour and capital are tellingly elided in this book. As to the potentially diverging interests of wives and husbands, the book genuinely suggests that not only can CBT solve marital grief, but it can also fix domestic abuse. The state, that is, should prescribe CBT to keep violently abusive relationships together. Much else in the book is humane, but this is verging on sinister. Lynne Segal has suggested that the \u201chappiness agenda\u201d ought to be named the \u201cmisery agenda\u201d. She reasons that it adapts citizens to the causes of their misery, rather than addressing them. This book seems determined to prove that point. \u2022 Can We Be Happier? by Richard Layard with George Ward is published by Pelican (RRP \u00a322). To buy a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

The Witcher video game series has sold more than 40m copies worldwide, and Henry Cavill\u2019s portrayal of lead character Geralt, who travels the mythical landscape slaughtering demonic beasts for cash, is highly influenced by the game\u2019s depiction.

In a lot of ways, now that channels such as Amazon and Netflix have the capacity and expertise to commission such projects, video games make much more sense in TV than in film.

But game stories don\u2019t work like that. They are very long <em>and</em> highly episodic, split into self-contained levels, quests or missions, the overriding story accompanied by dozens of side-quests and branchings. This is much more analogous to TV. The writing process behind epic narrative games also matches the TV system \u2013 with a team of writers working collaboratively on overarching plotlines, but also individually on separate episodes or elements.</p> <p>So will The Witcher pave the way for other big video game TV adaptations? It has certainly demonstrated that the storytelling format of games can be replicated.

Pine nuts, for example, are also high in zinc, and are known as <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7913877/Try-expert-tips-boost-sex-life-help-better-nights-sleep.html\" title=\"\">\u201cvegan oysters\u201d</a>.</p> <p><strong>No, they\u2019re not.</strong> Perhaps not widely, but that\u2019s what Dr Eleanor Draeger, a freelance sex education consultant, calls them. If you don\u2019t fancy pine nuts, then asparagus is also suitable for vegans and boasts high levels of potassium, which can increase your sex drive. Also, it has a phallic shape, as a reminder.</p> <p><strong>Are you suggesting I eat asparagus out of season, just to get some fleeting libido boost?</strong> No, of course not. Why not have an avocado instead? Spanish avocados are in season and have lots of vitamin B6, which boosts testosterone production.</p> <p><strong>You know what</strong><strong> is lowering my libido right now? All the drought and murder that the </strong><strong>media </strong><strong>claims avocado-eaters </strong><strong>are responsible for. Thanks, but no thanks. </strong>That\u2019s more South American avocados, but fine. Try pomegranate juice as an alternative. In a 2007 study, 47% of subjects had improved erections after drinking pomegranate juice over a period of four weeks.</p> <p><strong>How would you even go about assessing something like that?</strong> Using the International Index of Erectile Function, of course. Thanks to this study, pomegranate juice is sometimes known as \u201cred Viagra\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Intriguing, but I just tried to order some pomegranate juice online, and I think real Viagra might be cheaper. </strong>So is cheap red wine which, being absolutely laced with the antioxidant resveratrol, really helps to get the blood pumping, if you know what I mean. That\u2019s why they call it \u201cthe other red Viagra\u201d.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s </strong><strong>dry January, mate.</strong> Chillies, then \u2013 the sensation of hot chilli on the tongue releases endorphins, which means you\u2019re already halfway to being horny.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t really like spicy food.</strong> OK.

      "bodyText": "Name: Aphrodisiacs. Age: As old as food. Appearance: Poised to turn up on Valentine\u2019s Day menus across the nation. It\u2019s just a fancy word for foods that give you the horn, yeah? If you must put it that way. Such as oysters, for instance. Oysters are a recognised aphrodisiac \u2013 they contain a lot of zinc, which plays a part in the production of testosterone, but they\u2019re not acceptable to vegans, or people who hate oysters. Are there any vegan aphrodisiacs? Of course. Pine nuts, for example, are also high in zinc, and are known as \u201cvegan oysters\u201d. No, they\u2019re not. Perhaps not widely, but that\u2019s what Dr Eleanor Draeger, a freelance sex education consultant, calls them. If you don\u2019t fancy pine nuts, then asparagus is also suitable for vegans and boasts high levels of potassium, which can increase your sex drive. Also, it has a phallic shape, as a reminder. Are you suggesting I eat asparagus out of season, just to get some fleeting libido boost? No, of course not. Why not have an avocado instead? Spanish avocados are in season and have lots of vitamin B6, which boosts testosterone production. You know what is lowering my libido right now? All the drought and murder that the media claims avocado-eaters are responsible for. Thanks, but no thanks. That\u2019s more South American avocados, but fine. Try pomegranate juice as an alternative. In a 2007 study, 47% of subjects had improved erections after drinking pomegranate juice over a period of four weeks. How would you even go about assessing something like that? Using the International Index of Erectile Function, of course. Thanks to this study, pomegranate juice is sometimes known as \u201cred Viagra\u201d. Intriguing, but I just tried to order some pomegranate juice online, and I think real Viagra might be cheaper. So is cheap red wine which, being absolutely laced with the antioxidant resveratrol, really helps to get the blood pumping, if you know what I mean. That\u2019s why they call it \u201cthe other red Viagra\u201d. It\u2019s dry January, mate. Chillies, then \u2013 the sensation of hot chilli on the tongue releases endorphins, which means you\u2019re already halfway to being horny. I don\u2019t really like spicy food. OK. What about a) walnuts, b) cherries or c) saffron? a) I\u2019m allergic, b) they exacerbate my gout and c) I broke up with someone called Saffron last year, and I\u2019m still not over it.

      "body": "<p>Domestic workers in Qatar must give their employers advance notice before leaving the country, in a new policy that campaigners say raises concerns for those trapped in abusive situations.</p> <p>As pressure mounts on Qatar to tackle labour exploitation ahead of the 2022 World Cup, it <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/20/qatar-end-abusive-exit-permits-most-migrant-workers\">announced last week</a> that it was abolishing restrictions on leaving the country for nearly all migrant workers, who previously had to obtain their employer\u2019s permission.</p> <p>But the new decision stipulates that the workers are instead required to inform their employer of their intention to leave 72 hours in advance of their departure.</p> <p>Campaigners are concerned about the implications of the new requirement in a state with 300,000 citizens which <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/beirut/media-centre/news/WCMS_645168/lang--en/index.htm\">hosts</a> 175,000 domestic workers \u2013 over half of whom are women, mostly from Asia and Africa.</p> <p>Rothna Begum, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said the new requirement is \u201cquite problematic\u201d, and amounts to \u201can appeasement to the employers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn doing so, they haven\u2019t really thought through what it means, because it could still be an exit permit through the back door \u2013 which means that effectively domestic workers could still be trapped in the country,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>The Qatari ministry of interior <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/concerns-and-confusion-mount-over-impact-qatars-decision-end-exit-permits\">tweeted last week</a> that domestic workers who fail to notify their employer will be deprived of \u201ctheir rights such as financial obligations, travel tickets and return to work again before the lapse of four years from the date of departure.\u201d</p> <p>The Twitter message has since been deleted, and Qatari officials have denied that domestic workers could face financial penalties over any failures to inform their employers.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to protect the rights of both employers and domestic workers, domestic workers must notify employers at least 72 hours prior to their departure in order to protect their rights and ensure that they receive their financial benefits. However, any reports suggesting financial penalties for workers failing to notify their employer are patently false and misinformed,\u201d a government spokesperson told HRW.</p> <p>Begum said workers are left feeling confused, and that the requirement suggests to employers that they could say no, or that they may have some control over the workers\u2019 movements.</p> <p>\u201cEven more problematic\u201d, Begum said, is a worker who wishes \u201cto leave an abusive situation feeling that they have to inform their employer, or workers who are worried about retaliation, who then may face being confined in the home, [because] the employer now knows they want to leave who may then go and take steps to prevent them from leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Those steps \u201ccould include confining them in the household or taking other steps such as, for instance, filing trumped-up charges against them, so they\u2019re really then trapped in the country, because if you have [a] criminal case against you, you\u2019re not allowed to leave the country.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas McGeehan, director of <a href=\"https://fairsq.org/\">Fair/Square</a>, a human rights research and advocacy organisation with expertise in migrant workers\u2019 rights, said the new requirement amounts to seeking permission from the employer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem because this has been really well documented how appalling the abuses of domestic workers are \u2026 we\u2019re talking about in some cases serious physical, psychological, sexual abuses in Qatar,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re talking about relationships of extreme control and domination. The idea that a domestic worker is going to be happy to simply inform their employer that they\u2019re leaving completely neglects the relationships there and the seriousness of the abuses.\u201d</p> <p>A 2013 Guardian investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/revealed-qatars-world-cup-slaves\">found</a> abuse and exploitation of migrant workers preparing the emirate for the 2022 games.

      "bodyText": "Domestic workers in Qatar must give their employers advance notice before leaving the country, in a new policy that campaigners say raises concerns for those trapped in abusive situations. As pressure mounts on Qatar to tackle labour exploitation ahead of the 2022 World Cup, it announced last week that it was abolishing restrictions on leaving the country for nearly all migrant workers, who previously had to obtain their employer\u2019s permission. But the new decision stipulates that the workers are instead required to inform their employer of their intention to leave 72 hours in advance of their departure. Campaigners are concerned about the implications of the new requirement in a state with 300,000 citizens which hosts 175,000 domestic workers \u2013 over half of whom are women, mostly from Asia and Africa. Rothna Begum, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said the new requirement is \u201cquite problematic\u201d, and amounts to \u201can appeasement to the employers\u201d. \u201cIn doing so, they haven\u2019t really thought through what it means, because it could still be an exit permit through the back door \u2013 which means that effectively domestic workers could still be trapped in the country,\u201d she told the Guardian. The Qatari ministry of interior tweeted last week that domestic workers who fail to notify their employer will be deprived of \u201ctheir rights such as financial obligations, travel tickets and return to work again before the lapse of four years from the date of departure.\u201d The Twitter message has since been deleted, and Qatari officials have denied that domestic workers could face financial penalties over any failures to inform their employers. \u201cIn order to protect the rights of both employers and domestic workers, domestic workers must notify employers at least 72 hours prior to their departure in order to protect their rights and ensure that they receive their financial benefits. However, any reports suggesting financial penalties for workers failing to notify their employer are patently false and misinformed,\u201d a government spokesperson told HRW. Begum said workers are left feeling confused, and that the requirement suggests to employers that they could say no, or that they may have some control over the workers\u2019 movements. \u201cEven more problematic\u201d, Begum said, is a worker who wishes \u201cto leave an abusive situation feeling that they have to inform their employer, or workers who are worried about retaliation, who then may face being confined in the home, [because] the employer now knows they want to leave who may then go and take steps to prevent them from leaving.\u201d Those steps \u201ccould include confining them in the household or taking other steps such as, for instance, filing trumped-up charges against them, so they\u2019re really then trapped in the country, because if you have [a] criminal case against you, you\u2019re not allowed to leave the country.\u201d Nicholas McGeehan, director of Fair/Square, a human rights research and advocacy organisation with expertise in migrant workers\u2019 rights, said the new requirement amounts to seeking permission from the employer. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem because this has been really well documented how appalling the abuses of domestic workers are \u2026 we\u2019re talking about in some cases serious physical, psychological, sexual abuses in Qatar,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re talking about relationships of extreme control and domination. The idea that a domestic worker is going to be happy to simply inform their employer that they\u2019re leaving completely neglects the relationships there and the seriousness of the abuses.\u201d A 2013 Guardian investigation found abuse and exploitation of migrant workers preparing the emirate for the 2022 games. Research by Amnesty in 2014 alleged that domestic workers in Qatar had in some cases faced physical and sexual abuse, and in others, treatment that amounted to \u201cforced labour and human trafficking\u201d. Despite the reforms, Qatar\u2019s controversial kafala visa sponsorship system, which ties migrant workers to their employers, remains intact, according to HRW. It said kafala, under which workers cannot change employers without a certificate, \u201cfacilitates the abuse and exploitation of migrant workers\u201d. Qatar has expressed intentions to reform the system later this year. Under kafala, Begum said, \u201cif you flee your employer you can be charged with absconding, [and you are] liable to arrest and risk of deportation.\u201d \u201cNow in the case of a domestic worker, absconding is literally leaving the house of the employer, so you\u2019re living in your employer\u2019s house and the act of escaping your employer can then lead to criminal charges against you,\u201d she said. \u201cThat essentially means that a lot of domestic workers may be trapped in their employer\u2019s household because leaving without permission is not allowed.\u201d Houtan Homayounpour, head of the International Labour Organization project office in Qatar, however, sounded optimistic about the new reforms. \u201cThis is a huge milestone for Qatar,\u201d he said. \u201cWith these reforms all workers, with the exception of military personnel and a very small number of staff in key posts, are free to leave Qatar without having to obtain the permission of their employer. Domestic workers now simply have to inform their employer that they will be leaving and do not have to ask for their approval.\u201d He added: \u201cThe removal of exit permits and the introduction of free labour market mobility [in the coming weeks] will practically mark the end of the kafala system in the State of Qatar.\u201d",

Forest covers about half of the country (in the UK, it\u2019s 13%). And this vast swathe of trees \u2013 over three million hectares of conifer, birch, white alder and aspen \u2013 has more than doubled in size since the 1920s.</p> <p>My own foray into these immense woodlands was a four-day tour of the Vidzeme region, which covers central and northern Latvia. Despite being home to the capital, Riga, Vidzeme is characterised by forest, rolling hills (including Mount Gaizi\u0146\u0161, Latvia\u2019s highest point at 311 metres), morainal lakes, the cliff-lined Gauja River and historic towns with medieval castles. It is a proud region, known as the \u201ccradle of Latvian culture\u201d for its rich artistic heritage.</p> <p>I was on a short small group tour of the country with guide Amanda Kokorevi\u010da of <a href=\"https://experiencebaltics.com/find/tours/\" title=\"\">Experience Baltics</a>.

      "bodyText": "In Japan it\u2019s called shinrin-yoku (forest bathing); in Norway it\u2019s friluftsliv (appreciation of outdoors activity and nature). But in Latvia there\u2019s no special term for it. \u201cWe don\u2019t need one \u2013 this is just normal behaviour for Latvians,\u201d said Sigita Kl\u0113tniece, our walk leader in a crisp, cold Gauja national park in the country\u2019s north-east. We stood and breathed deeply, as light dappled through the snow-speckled pines. \u201cLet being in the forest relax you,\u201d said Sigita. \u201cListen to the sounds and sense nature around you.\u201d It felt like the forest was a spiritual place, where Latvians came to meditate. Latvia is one of Europe\u2019s greenest nations. Forest covers about half of the country (in the UK, it\u2019s 13%). And this vast swathe of trees \u2013 over three million hectares of conifer, birch, white alder and aspen \u2013 has more than doubled in size since the 1920s. My own foray into these immense woodlands was a four-day tour of the Vidzeme region, which covers central and northern Latvia. Despite being home to the capital, Riga, Vidzeme is characterised by forest, rolling hills (including Mount Gaizi\u0146\u0161, Latvia\u2019s highest point at 311 metres), morainal lakes, the cliff-lined Gauja River and historic towns with medieval castles. It is a proud region, known as the \u201ccradle of Latvian culture\u201d for its rich artistic heritage. I was on a short small group tour of the country with guide Amanda Kokorevi\u010da of Experience Baltics. The forest was captivating: quiet trails among soaring trees and abundant wildlife. Equally fascinating were the people we met: the local pioneers using Latvia\u2019s forest to create a new wave of green tourism and eco-friendly business. Latvia\u2019s tourism board is fully behind this shift. It wants to encourage visitors away from Riga, which is popular with both rowdy British stag-dos and city breakers enticed by the medieval old town and art nouveau architecture. It wants tourists to use Riga as a launch pad for trips into Latvia\u2019s green lands for bird-watching, forest hiking and bog walks. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame many tourists are in a mad rush, visiting Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in just a few days,\u201d said Amanda, as we arrived at M\u0101lpils , a classical 19th-century manor with baroque-style grounds and now a design hotel and restaurant. \u201cBut things are changing \u2013 people are becoming more interested in Latvia\u2019s nature.\u201d The next day, after lunch at stylish Cafe Zeit, housed in a former Soviet factory, we arrived at the Woodcraft Museum in the riverside village of L\u012bgatne. Ponytailed proprietor Rihards demonstrated how he makes bowls using locally harvested wood and traditional techniques. Even the peppermint leaves floating in my tea cup were from the local woods. Forest foraging is almost a national sport in Latvia, with mushrooms, berries, herbs, leaves for tea and birch sap juice on the menu. With half of the nation\u2019s forests state-owned, and favourable public access laws, filling your basket is completely legal. Families are even permitted to take one Christmas tree from the forest every December. As we checked in that evening at HE Vanadzi\u0146\u0161 \u2013 a contemporary restaurant and hotel next to C\u0113sis\u2019s old town \u2013 I wondered whether the owner had personally felled the tree decorating the reception. \u201cMy grandmother taught me how to forage,\u201d said Sigita the following day, as we set off on foot past sandstone cliffs into Gauja national park \u2013 the oldest and largest of the four in Latvia. \u201cAnd we pass on that knowledge and passion to our children.\u201d Sadly we had missed the August-October mushroom season, but the forest still provided. While we picked wild cranberries, a family with a young daughter collected pine cones for a Christmas wreath and others filled large containers with spring water. This closeness to the forest is rooted in Latvia\u2019s history: for centuries the forest has represented safety and security for Latvians, particularly in the 1600s and 1700s when people fled to the woods during conflicts between the Russian, German and Swedish empires. That afternoon, as we explored the towns of C\u0113sis and Valmiera, the Latvian love of nature was still clear. At Valmiermui\u017ea brewery a \u201cforest cola\u201d \u2013 made with cranberries, pine blossom and heather \u2013 was lauded as a new children\u2019s drink, while at Veikali\u0146\u0161, a pop-up shop selling handcrafted produce from 35 creatives, the shelves were stocked with items such as biodegradable reed straws and textiles made from recycled linen. \u201cThanks to the younger generation, more and more Latvians are buying ethically sourced, eco-friendly goods,\u201d said Lelde, the shop\u2019s founder. J\u0101nis, a moustachioed ice-cream maker from near Dunte, echoed this when we visited his farm. \u201cLatvians love local produce,\u201d he told us, as we tucked in to his Gogelmogels ice-cream. He gets milk from his neighbour\u2019s cows, eggs from his own chickens, and flavourings such as sea buckthorn and bee pollen from his fields. Later I headed for the sauna at Lantus, a farmhouse where guests can experience a traditional Latvian bathing ritual. This turned out to be a part-aromatherapy part-massage treatment: the masseur covered my face with pungent eucalyptus leaves before pummeling my body with leafy twigs of birch and oak. Half an hour later I emerged from the sauna, covered in leaf fragments. \u201cYour body and soul should feel cleansed,\u201d said Amanda, glowing from her own treatment. That sums up what the forest means to Latvians. \u2022 The trip was provided by the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia (latvia.travel).

The rapporteurs, who are investigating the death of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018, said a WhatsApp account in the prince\u2019s name sent two messages to Bezos revealing confidential information about Bezos\u2019s private life.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Police stop people leaving stricken Chinese city Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you a taste of the best stories and features from the Guardian this Thursday morning. Residents of Wuhan have been thrown into panic after authorities placed the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak into lockdown, banning all outgoing modes of transport and advising people not to leave unless it was an emergency. People reported that supermarket shelves were being emptied and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and locked themselves at home amid an outbreak that has left at least 17 people dead and infected almost 600 more across China, Asia and the US. Petrol stations were also overwhelmed by demand as drivers stocked up on fuel and it was reported that pharmacies had sold out of face masks. Videos posted online showed highway routes out of the city had also been blocked and special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. \u201cI am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn\u2019t serious so no one thought it was a big deal,\u201d said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker. In the US, doctors are using robots to treat a man in Washington state who contracted the virus after visiting China. Pacific nations that are just recovering from a deadly spate of measles are now ramping up biosecurity measures to cope with possible cases of coronavirus. Follow how the outbreak has developed and spread at our timeline here. * * * \u2018Sardonic message\u2019 \u2013 The United Nations has called for US authorities to investigate evidence that Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss and owner of the Washington Post, had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The UN special rapporteurs \u2013 Agn\u00e8s Callamard and David Kaye \u2013 were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the apparent targeting of Bezos and what appeared to be an \u201ceffort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia\u201d. The rapporteurs, who are investigating the death of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018, said a WhatsApp account in the prince\u2019s name sent two messages to Bezos revealing confidential information about Bezos\u2019s private life. A message sent in November 2018, shortly after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, included a \u201csardonic message\u201d along with a picture of a woman resembling a woman with whom Bezos was conducting an affair. The rapporteurs also warned world leaders in Davos who might be meeting Saudi delegates that their electronic security was \u201cfragile\u201d. * * * \u2018Hopeful vision\u2019 \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey says Labour has to appeal to aspirational voters with a more \u201chopeful vision\u201d if it is to win another election as she steps up her leadership campaign. Speaking to the Guardian for the second part of our series on the future of the party, the candidate identified as the heir to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s brand of leftwing politics says \u201cthe only way we ever win\u201d is by appealing to a broad coalition of voters. She praised the policies in the party\u2019s much-criticised manifesto but hinted that strategists failed to present them with one clear message and suggested she would shake up Labour\u2019s organisation. We also look at what the election loss means for Momentum, the 40,000-strong organisation that rose to prominence in the party during the Corbyn era. * * * Trump \u2018cheat\u2019 \u2013 The lead prosecutor at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump has described the case as a national crisis and said the president tried to \u201ccheat\u201d his way to re-election. But although Adam Schiff evoked constitutional history and the global promise of US democracy to outline his case against the US president on day two of the trial in Washington, Republicans remained unmoved about the need for any new evidence. Here are five key takeaways from the day. As he prepared to return from Davos, Trump stepped up his bid for another term by indicating he would increase the number of countries subject to a travel ban to the US, cut Medicare payments and attend an anti-abortion event. * * * Judge \u2018outdated\u2019 \u2013 Family court judges could be forced to undergo training on the appropriate way to deal with sexual assault cases after a woman complained about a judge\u2019s \u201coutdated\u201d views on what constituted rape. The woman has won an appeal after judge Robin Tolson said her allegations of domestic sexual violence were \u201cuntrue\u201d, and that she was \u201cnot raped\u201d because the woman \u201ctook no physical steps\u201d to stop the man. * * * Firefighters killed \u2013 Three Americans have been killed after an air tanker they were flying crashed while tackling bushfires in New South Wales. The plane went missing in the Snowy mountains area near the border with Victoria as fires flared again in Australia amid soaring temperatures. Many American and Canadian firefighters have been in Australia to help during the fire emergency. Follow all the latest updates at our blog here. * * * Roman ruined \u2013 Scientists studying human remains from Herculaneum, one of the Roman towns buried after the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79, have found that the heat was so intense that one victim\u2019s brain turned to glass. Experts say the vitrified brains belonged to a man of about 25 who was found in the 1960s lying face-down on a wooden bed under a pile of volcanic ash. Brain tissue is rarely discovered intact but they believe that temperatures reached 520C during the eruption, igniting body fat and vaporising soft tissue. Today in Focus podcast: Peak meat \u2013 is veganism the future? Marco Springmann, a public health expert, tells Anushka Asthana why cutting out animal products is the best route to a healthy diet \u2013 and why veganism is good for the planet. Plus: Alex Hern on the Guardian\u2019s exclusive story of how the Amazon chief, Jeff Bezos, allegedly had his phone hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message apparently sent from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Lunchtime read: Can Harry and Meghan become influencers-in-chief? They are instantly recognisable, already have millions of online followers and until recently worked for a very well-known firm. So it seems a no-brainer that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will be able to make a comfortable living as online \u201cinfluencers\u201d, monetising their fame on social media through product endorsement and the like. But although some digital and marketing experts think the couple can take their place alongside the likes of the Obamas in the influencer elite, others aren\u2019t so sure. Elle Hunt checks out what\u2019s in store for the semi-detached royals. Sport Manchester City made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the Guardian can reveal. Burnley have a famous first win at Old Trafford since 1962, but the loss for Manchester United spoke of their callowness and inability to turn possession into goals. The Australian Open needs some drama that does not involve sodden red dust falling out of the sky or players choking on polluted air \u2013 and Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka will surely provide it on day five. In rugby, the report that led to Saracens being relegated found the club\u2019s owner, Nigel Wray, broke the rules by entering into ventures totalling \u00a31.3m with England players Maro Itoje, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Chris Ashton. Tom Kohler-Cadmore accepts he was \u201c100% in the wrong\u201d to be part of the sordid WhatsApp group that emerged during Alex Hepburn\u2019s rape trial and is now trying to prevent young cricketers from doing the same. Business Elon Musk is on course for a $50bn payout after his technology company, Tesla, surged in value past the $100bn mark.

      "bodyText": "BP has successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law, clearing the way for major infrastructure projects to bypass checks. US government documents show BP America lobbied in favour of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to dilute legislation, which could make it easier for new projects, such as oil pipelines and power plants, to move forward with far less federal review of their impact on the environment. Many green groups fear the changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) will increase greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the climate crisis. The changes, unveiled by Trump this month, would narrow the list of projects that require an environmental impact assessment and in some cases eliminate the need for federal agencies to consider the cumulative effects of projects, including the impact on the climate crisis. BP said in a letter to the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) in August 2018 that streamlining the Nepa process would \u201cdirectly benefit BP\u2019s operations in the US\u201d. The letter was discovered by Greenpeace\u2019s investigation unit. BP is planning to increase its business in the US after agreeing to pay $10.5bn (\u00a38bn) to buy BHP Billiton\u2019s shale business last year. Mel Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said BP\u2019s support for weakening environmental checks was \u201cdespicable, but not surprising\u201d. The oil firm\u2019s lobbying efforts have emerged amid reports that it plans to \u201cout-do\u201d the climate action of Royal Dutch Shell with a set of new emissions targets. Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s new chief executive, is preparing to announce plans to expand its climate targets to include emissions produced from the fuels and products it sells and not just from its own operations, according to Reuters. The plans are likely to appear at odds with BP\u2019s support for the American Petroleum Institute which it expresses in the CEQ letter. The API, a trade body for oil and gas producers, told the CEQ that emissions from fossil fuel products \u201cshould not be considered part of \u2018indirect\u2019 effects\u201d under future environmental checks. Michael Sommers, who heads the API, has taken the lead in criticising the \u201cendless and repetitive reviews\u201d required by Nepa, arguing that the laws had been \u201cmisused to delay and derail development, which hurts job creation, reduces tax revenue and saps investments in communities across the country\u201d. BP has also called for air quality checks to be scrapped and to limit the changes government agencies can demand to help mitigate the environmental impact of major projects. It said companies should be allowed to pay for their own environmental assessments because the personnel constraints within some government agencies have had a significant impact on their ability to undertake the review \u201cin a timely manner\u201d. In terms of air quality reviews, BP argued that third-party reviews were unnecessary and should be scrapped in favour of a review undertaken by the company which leveraged \u201cthe project proponent\u2019s expertise\u201d. Its letter to the CEQ said BP supported more than 125,000 jobs in the US, and the company\u2019s operations contributed $85bn to the American economy in 2017 alone.

      "body": "<p>\u2018You don\u2019t expect the most eventful year of your life to be in your late 40s,\u201d says Paul Sinha. \u201cNo one expects that.\u201d He thought the extraordinary parts of his story \u2013 quitting medicine to become a standup (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/13/gayrights.comedy\">comedy\u2019s only gay Asian former GP</a>, as he was once known), an Edinburgh Comedy award nomination, and fame on an ITV quiz show, The Chase \u2013 were behind him. But that was to reckon without what 2019 had in store.</p> <p>His <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48640653\">diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease</a> was front-page news in June, which was almost as shocking to the 49-year-old as the diagnosis. \u201cAt no stage until then did I have an idea of who I was in terms of celebrity,\u201d says Sinha. Suddenly, his face was emblazoned across the tabloids, while he tried to process the life-changing news about his health. Seven months on, he has turned the experience \u2013 and others in a 12-month period in which Sinha was married, humiliated on Dave TV\u2019s Taskmaster, <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2019/09/08/44279/sinhas_a_winner!\">crowned UK quiz champion for the first time</a>, and treated to \u201cthe most extraordinary month of my comedy career\u201d at the New Zealand comedy festival \u2013 into a new touring show. \u201cI have,\u201d he says over hot chocolate on the eve of his tour, \u201ca <em>lot</em> of material.\u201d</p> <p>The show is called Hazy Little Thing Called Love, a title that survives the set he prepped for last year\u2019s fringe \u2013 before his diagnosis blew that plan off course. He might have known something was up when, on Taskmaster, he found himself \u201ccompletely unable to perform any tasks that were put in front of me\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t until New Zealand in May that Sinha was forced to face up to his deteriorating health. He was at his standup peak, playing to sell-out crowds in a country where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/26/bradley-walsh-the-chase\">The Chase</a> is watched daily by millions. \u201cIt was the most positive experience of my life,\u201d he says, but at the same time, \u201cmy health was falling apart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5731252ba092d1cde6c5c578cbd97b69431c5cd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5731252ba092d1cde6c5c578cbd97b69431c5cd7/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I had a fall.

I had a fall at three in the morning. I knew in my heart of hearts, being a trained doctor, that I had one of the big three: Parkinson\u2019s, motor neurone disease or multiple sclerosis. And I knew Parkinson\u2019s was the likely one.\u201d</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t \u2013 and still doesn\u2019t \u2013 know was what the future held for him. So, in lieu of the fringe, he honeymooned early with his now husband, \u00ad\u00ad\u00adOliver. (They married in December.) After that, he experienced \u201cthe most intensely creative period of my life\u201d (a side effect, he thinks, of his Parkinson\u2019s drugs) during which he wrote his new show in three weeks flat. Sinha now describes that show as a career best. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire and ferocity about the material, because I\u2019m going for laughs in some pretty bleak places.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that has changed most since the diagnosis,\u201d he goes on, \u201cis that I\u2019ve lost my fear. I\u2019ve always been one of those comics who doesn\u2019t say much on panel shows because I\u2019m terrified of saying the wrong thing or offending the wrong person. But now, I\u2019ve lost all that. I\u2019ve got the exaggerated carpe diem that a lot of people get with their diagnosis.\u201d</p> <p>In the past, he says, he has fretted about what kind of comedian he is, who comes to see him, and why. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on telly, you\u2019re defined by what you do on telly,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople look at you and go: \u2018He\u2019s that guy that answers questions on a quiz.\u2019 It\u2019s been a battle to make my compromises with that and still be the comedian I want to be.\u201d</p> <p>In part, that\u2019s about audiences: Sinha wanted \u201cyoung, hip and aspirational\u201d and he got senior-citizen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/26/bradley-walsh-the-chase\">fans of The Chase</a>. But now, \u201cI\u2019ve lost my anxiety about that. If you\u2019ve bought a ticket to see me perform, you\u2019re heroes in my book. You\u2019re better than the people who didn\u2019t buy tickets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bd8149ce370478574c3ee6e0893418d2d1865c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bd8149ce370478574c3ee6e0893418d2d1865c2/141_0_1133_680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Sinha on ITV\u2019s The Chase\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facing the cameras \u2026 Paul Sinha on ITV\u2019s The Chase.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s no longer trying, either, to right the world\u2019s wrongs through comedy. Once, his material was political as well as personal: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/25/paul-sinha-review\">a memorable 2010 routine</a> recounted his contretemps on live radio with the deputy chairman of the BNP. But the last few years, says Sinha, \u201chave knocked the stuffing out of me\u201d, politically speaking. \u201cWhen I started off as the first openly gay Asian comedian, there were certainties and a clear imagined enemy to rail against. I now realise that the old assumptions, that comedy involved standing on stage and talking to people who shared your metropolitan values, aren\u2019t necessarily true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost the will to talk about [politics],\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it seems when you open your mouth to air a sincerely held opinion these days, you\u2019re making enemies. Some comedians are financially successful enough to not be too bothered about that. I\u2019m not one of them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a personal, storytelling comedian \u2013 that\u2019s really who I am.\u201d And when your personal stories are as dramatic as Sinha\u2019s \u2013 well, who needs politics? \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I know what\u2019s <em>eventually</em> going to happen.

But that was to reckon without what 2019 had in store. His diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease was front-page news in June, which was almost as shocking to the 49-year-old as the diagnosis. \u201cAt no stage until then did I have an idea of who I was in terms of celebrity,\u201d says Sinha. Suddenly, his face was emblazoned across the tabloids, while he tried to process the life-changing news about his health. Seven months on, he has turned the experience \u2013 and others in a 12-month period in which Sinha was married, humiliated on Dave TV\u2019s Taskmaster, crowned UK quiz champion for the first time, and treated to \u201cthe most extraordinary month of my comedy career\u201d at the New Zealand comedy festival \u2013 into a new touring show. \u201cI have,\u201d he says over hot chocolate on the eve of his tour, \u201ca lot of material.\u201d The show is called Hazy Little Thing Called Love, a title that survives the set he prepped for last year\u2019s fringe \u2013 before his diagnosis blew that plan off course. He might have known something was up when, on Taskmaster, he found himself \u201ccompletely unable to perform any tasks that were put in front of me\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t until New Zealand in May that Sinha was forced to face up to his deteriorating health. He was at his standup peak, playing to sell-out crowds in a country where The Chase is watched daily by millions. \u201cIt was the most positive experience of my life,\u201d he says, but at the same time, \u201cmy health was falling apart.\u201d \u201cI was limping through the streets of Auckland. I had a fall at three in the morning. I knew in my heart of hearts, being a trained doctor, that I had one of the big three: Parkinson\u2019s, motor neurone disease or multiple sclerosis. And I knew Parkinson\u2019s was the likely one.\u201d What he didn\u2019t \u2013 and still doesn\u2019t \u2013 know was what the future held for him. So, in lieu of the fringe, he honeymooned early with his now husband, Oliver. (They married in December.) After that, he experienced \u201cthe most intensely creative period of my life\u201d (a side effect, he thinks, of his Parkinson\u2019s drugs) during which he wrote his new show in three weeks flat. Sinha now describes that show as a career best. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire and ferocity about the material, because I\u2019m going for laughs in some pretty bleak places.\u201d \u201cThe thing that has changed most since the diagnosis,\u201d he goes on, \u201cis that I\u2019ve lost my fear. I\u2019ve always been one of those comics who doesn\u2019t say much on panel shows because I\u2019m terrified of saying the wrong thing or offending the wrong person. But now, I\u2019ve lost all that. I\u2019ve got the exaggerated carpe diem that a lot of people get with their diagnosis.\u201d In the past, he says, he has fretted about what kind of comedian he is, who comes to see him, and why. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on telly, you\u2019re defined by what you do on telly,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople look at you and go: \u2018He\u2019s that guy that answers questions on a quiz.\u2019 It\u2019s been a battle to make my compromises with that and still be the comedian I want to be.\u201d In part, that\u2019s about audiences: Sinha wanted \u201cyoung, hip and aspirational\u201d and he got senior-citizen fans of The Chase. But now, \u201cI\u2019ve lost my anxiety about that. If you\u2019ve bought a ticket to see me perform, you\u2019re heroes in my book. You\u2019re better than the people who didn\u2019t buy tickets.\u201d He\u2019s no longer trying, either, to right the world\u2019s wrongs through comedy. Once, his material was political as well as personal: a memorable 2010 routine recounted his contretemps on live radio with the deputy chairman of the BNP. But the last few years, says Sinha, \u201chave knocked the stuffing out of me\u201d, politically speaking. \u201cWhen I started off as the first openly gay Asian comedian, there were certainties and a clear imagined enemy to rail against. I now realise that the old assumptions, that comedy involved standing on stage and talking to people who shared your metropolitan values, aren\u2019t necessarily true.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve lost the will to talk about [politics],\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it seems when you open your mouth to air a sincerely held opinion these days, you\u2019re making enemies. Some comedians are financially successful enough to not be too bothered about that. I\u2019m not one of them. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a personal, storytelling comedian \u2013 that\u2019s really who I am.\u201d And when your personal stories are as dramatic as Sinha\u2019s \u2013 well, who needs politics? \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I know what\u2019s eventually going to happen.

The Druggist of Auschwitz is a \u201cdocumentary\u201d novel. The Child of Auschwitz is described as historical fiction. The Librarian of Auschwitz is based on \u201can incredible true story\u201d. As for the latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/22/tattooist-auschwitz-heather-morris-review-lale-sokolov\">The Tattooist of Auschwitz</a>, it is the real-life story of how a Slovakian Jew fell in love with a girl he was tattooing in the camp. In other words, they are all novels that are not prepared to take the risk of being works of the imagination, and therefore exist in some no man\u2019s land between fact and fancy.</p> <p>How we feel about novels making claims to be true, over and above what we mean by imaginatively true, will tell us how we feel about novels altogether. It isn\u2019t new for writers or their publishers to make such declarations. Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe was sold on the assurance that his \u201cLife and strange surprizing adventures\u201d were \u201cwritten by himself\u201d and therefore authentic. Moll Flanders the same. And that was 300 years ago. But the novel has evolved considerably since then and it hasn\u2019t been thought necessary to assure us that Thomas Hardy based Jude the Obscure on a real Dorsetshire loser who wasn\u2019t able to kill a pig. That we are returning to fact to justify fiction is the sure sign that the novel no longer commands the respect it did.</p> <p>Only when a story avowedly tells of something that really happened, it seems, are we willing to grace it with our credulity and tears. Ironically, a number of these works have been criticised by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum for failing to live up to their own promises of authenticity. Heather Morris\u2019s The Tattooist of Auschwitz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/07/the-tattooist-of-auschwitz-attacked-as-inauthentic-by-camp-memorial-centre\">the Memorial complains</a>, \u201ccontains numerous errors and information inconsistent with the facts, as well as exaggerations, misinterpretations and understatements\u201d.</p> <p>The publisher\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cHeather is a fiction writer, not a historian\u201d \u2013 is a disingenuous attempt to have it both ways. Either you\u2019re aiming to tell the historical truth or you aren\u2019t. The classic defence of novels and films of this sort, that they are \u201cbased\u201d on real events, is no defence at all. \u201cBased\u201d conceals a world of subterfuge, giving the author access to the best of both worlds \u2013 \u201ctruth\u201d in the historical sense and \u201ctruth\u201d in the imaginative \u2013 while having to bear responsibility for neither.</p> <p>The question we have to ask is why readers are so eager to enter into this shady contract. What is it about \u201chistorical truth\u201d that licenses them to be moved in a way that \u201cimaginative truth\u201d no longer seems to? The Tattooist of Auschwitz fulfils two of the classic expectations of kitsch. By sweetening the horrors of the camps (\u201cI tattooed a number on her arm. She tattooed her name on my heart\u201d) it answers to Milan Kundera\u2019s claim that \u201ckitsch is the absolute denial of shit\u201d. And in its faux historicism \u2013 right down to the inclusion of photographs of the actual tattooist whose story the novel borrows \u2013 it angles for those double tears that are the hallmark of kitsch: weeping over the suffering of others and weeping a second time over our capacity to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"277facd8579efd2a18a8b1ff83fae1b700777bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277facd8579efd2a18a8b1ff83fae1b700777bab/274_395_5726_3435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farcical Fuhrer \u2026Hitler as an imaginary friend in Jojo Rabbit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farcical Fuhrer \u2026Hitler as an imaginary friend in Jojo Rabbit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Searchlight Pictures/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To be clear: it is not my argument that the Holocaust should be approached as though it is the Holy of Holies.

An early copy of Lord Russell of Liverpool\u2019s The Scourge of the Swastika, complete with grainy, semi-sadomasochistic photographs, falls into the boy\u2019s hands when he is of an age to be susceptible to its imagery. Thereafter, his imagination riots in the hell of Buchenwald.</p> <p>But there is all the difference in the world between pornographic exploitation of the Holocaust and a dramatisation of how reading about it can be deranging. The forms in which we receive and process images of the camps are integral now to what the Holocaust means to us. There is nothing titillating about their study.</p> <p>Nor is there blasphemy in disturbing the solemn hush with parody and satire. If we are to know and bear witness while accepting Levi\u2019s injunction against \u201cunderstanding\u201d, we need all our wits about us. Sometimes the comedy just isn\u2019t comic enough, as is the case in Charlie Chaplin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/chaplin-great-dictator-comedy\">The Great Dictator</a>; or not funny at all as in Roberto Benigni\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian/0,,36037,00.html\">Life Is Beautiful</a>; and sometimes it makes us squirm and fret, and then wonder why we shouldn\u2019t, as in Martin Amis\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/22/the-zone-of-interest-martin-amis-review-holocaust\">The Zone of Interest</a>.

I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.\u201d But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war.</p>\n    <p>Lansman was behind the move to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/labour-student-wing-to-fight-partys-decision-to-abolish-organisation\">scrap Labour\u2019s 40-year-old student wing</a>, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a \u201cmoderate\u201d wing of the party. Lansman also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/momentum-bid-to-abolish-deputy-leader-tom-watsons-post\">tabled a last-minute motion</a> at the NEC last year calling for deputy leader Tom Watson\u2019s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt needs to consult with members more. Be more grassroots. It still is in some ways but it has morphed into this top-down thing which means that one or two people have a lot of power.\u201d</p> \n<p>Setting up community centres in Labour heartlands could be one way of giving Momentum a sense of purpose in the five years of a majority government, she suggests.</p> \n<p>She likes the idea of taking over buildings earmarked for regeneration as part of the \u201cmeanwhile use\u201d movement. In South Yorkshire the loss of the miners\u2019 welfare clubs has been a huge blow and in coalfield communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall\">Labour struggled to get the vote out</a>. These centres could be a way of re-engaging with people long term.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of lefties and left activism. There\u2019s a strong history of trade unionism, but after the defeat we need to be looking at more community organising,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Charlie, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-election-supporters-48-hours-sign-up\">trade union campaigner </a>who helped campaigning in Harrow East, Battersea and Putney in the general election, said Momentum\u2019s strength was publishing a public-facing strategy in advance so members knew why they were knocking on doors \u2013 mirroring US Democrat Bernie Sanders\u2019 transparency.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we got to Putney, for example, people could explain why we were targeting this particular road and people had bothered to go through the data,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb903f00-7374-421b-b47f-ef6529a1d17a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 The \u201cred wall\u201d was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east.

      "bodyText": "There are two stand-out memories of the winter general election for Charlie Macnamara. First, the 25-year-old Momentum member\u2019s data sheets melting to illegible shreds in the rain while knocking on doors. Second, the moment the exit poll came through after a 14-hour campaigning shift in Stevenage. \u201cSix of us were out all day. Then we walked through the door of candidate Jill Borcherd\u2019s house and it was devastating. To find out the moment you walk through the door \u2026 we were shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to bother her so we got back in the car and had a long drive back to London, looking on Twitter as the results came in.\u201d As a grassroots group set up explicitly to support Jeremy Corbyn, Momentum would always be challenged by an election loss and the ushering in of a new leader. Momentum thrived on \u201cJezzmania\u201d, Corbyn\u2019s Glastonbury appearances and telegenic outdoor rallies that could be clipped by their savvy tech team to go viral. They have been hugely influential on policy, in effect fast-tracking the Green New Deal to the forefront of the manifesto. But with a new Labour leader in place in two months, the 40,000-strong organisation must decide what its future will be - if it is to survive at all. With its brand of leftwing politics rejected at the ballot box through Labour\u2019s worst electoral defeat since 1935, the group is focusing on how to rebuild itself. So far, its attempt to stay relevant as the continuity Corbyn outfit has got off to a rocky start. Angry exchanges peppered Twitter this month when Momentum hastily organised a members\u2019 ballot to decide who they should endorse for the leadership and deputy leadership. Just 5,000 members recommended the only choices on the ballot paper \u2013 the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner. One furious member who has given hours of their time on the doorstep declared Momentum a \u201cmess\u201d. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it an open ballot?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably head back to the anti-war movement now. There\u2019s other things I can do in politics. I\u2019m not going to be as involved any more. People are worried about where it\u2019s all going.\u201d Writer and organiser Michael Chessum was among the high-profile Momentum activists who criticised the ballot. He tweeted: \u201cLudicrously, we only have one option for each position. This is a joke, and you should vote No on principle. (Even if, like me, you might end up voting for one of the chosen candidates).\u201d While Momentum\u2019s website reads \u201cthe fight goes on\u201d, it is clear some members have justifiable fatigue, having spent the past two years as election foot soldiers. Even loyalists agree that the members, many of whom trudged through long winter nights in marginal seats, want to see change within the organisation. The fact founder Jon Lansman is part of Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign team is not lost on activists. The centralisation of power around Lansman is nuanced and not always as the public see it, some activists say, but he remains an influential figure. The current structure, which has a National Coordinating Group at the top of the organisation that decides on major policy positions, has not always made members feel like it works for them. Activists complain about the \u201ctop-down\u201d structure. Sophie Wilson, 24 \u2013 a councillor in Sheffield who stood as the Labour candidate for Rother Valley, which, at the election, went Tory for the first time since 1918 \u2013 said Momentum was invaluable in livening up the local Labour scene but it needed to change. She said: \u201cA lot of the public think that Jon Lansman controls everything, but he\u2019s not the person pulling the strings, it\u2019s just that the structure is at fault. \u201cIt needs to consult with members more. Be more grassroots. It still is in some ways but it has morphed into this top-down thing which means that one or two people have a lot of power.\u201d Setting up community centres in Labour heartlands could be one way of giving Momentum a sense of purpose in the five years of a majority government, she suggests. She likes the idea of taking over buildings earmarked for regeneration as part of the \u201cmeanwhile use\u201d movement. In South Yorkshire the loss of the miners\u2019 welfare clubs has been a huge blow and in coalfield communities Labour struggled to get the vote out. These centres could be a way of re-engaging with people long term. \u201cThere are a lot of lefties and left activism. There\u2019s a strong history of trade unionism, but after the defeat we need to be looking at more community organising,\u201d she said. Charlie, a trade union campaigner who helped campaigning in Harrow East, Battersea and Putney in the general election, said Momentum\u2019s strength was publishing a public-facing strategy in advance so members knew why they were knocking on doors \u2013 mirroring US Democrat Bernie Sanders\u2019 transparency. \u201cWhen we got to Putney, for example, people could explain why we were targeting this particular road and people had bothered to go through the data,\u201d he said. He has no intention of turning away from the movement. \u201cA lot of us went through a politicisation through the Corbyn period and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to go away. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve noticed is the Corbyn movement brought people together, different movements and campaigns.

      "body": "<p>How do you cure a problem like violent far-right extremism? It was a thought that danced around my head last Friday as I sat in court 3 of suburban east London\u2019s Snaresbrook crown court inspecting James Healy, a 40-year-old thug who attacked me last August. After a night out celebrating my birthday, I\u2019d left a pub with a group of five others. The CCTV shows us cheerily exchanging goodbyes while Healy creeps up on us, hands in pockets, before suddenly karate kicking me to the ground from behind and throwing wild punches in what the court ruled was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/17/guardian-columnist-owen-jones-attack-pub-london\" title=\"\">frenzied attack</a>\u201d. A melee ensued as our assailant was joined by two friends, who later pleaded guilty to affray. My companions helped prevent a far worse incident, three of them taking blows to the head in the process.</p> \n<p>Healy had already pleaded guilty to affray and actual bodily harm; his defence was that his rage-filled attack was provoked by a spilt pint earlier. In fact, either he or a friend had, just before the attack, masqueraded as an admirer of mine, double-checking they weren\u2019t about to assault another stranger with a passing resemblance to Macaulay Culkin. Healy\u2019s home was stashed full of far-right memorabilia: Combat 18 regalia (one of their stated aims is to \u201cexecute all queers\u201d), White Power logos and Nazi death heads and an SS flag adorned with the stamp of Chelsea Headhunters, a notorious football hooligan group associated with the far right.</p> \n<p>Healy was merely a hoarder, he protested: he simply believed these were football-related souvenirs; a birthday card recently sent to him, adorned with loyalist terrorist imagery, was a prank by his friends; he could not possibly be homophobic because his own solicitor was gay; and the police, he claimed, had been in my pocket from day one. Healy\u2019s housemate \u2013 a man with a list of violent convictions \u2013 vouched for his honesty. He would trust Healy not to sleep with his attractive girlfriend.</p> \n<p>The defence collapsed: the judge ruled she was \u201csatisfied so that I am sure that [Healy] holds particular beliefs that are normally associated with the far-right wing\u201d, and the attack was driven by both homophobia and antipathy to leftwing politics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"055944e3-ecb2-40db-ade0-121726a77c95\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4ekDngOa1FY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Healy will be sentenced next month: but if prison is his destination, what will be achieved? This is an important question. As I am a white journalist with a media platform, this far-right attack can draw more attention than most. The incident had a broader context \u2013 I\u2019d been increasingly targeted by the far right both online and on the streets. Yet it was itself far less severe than many of the attacks endured by those without the privilege of attention \u2013 not least minorities who suffer hate-driven abuse, violent attacks or even death. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/15/hate-crimes-double-england-wales\" title=\"\">Hate crimes</a> overall have more than doubled over the past six years; <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/far-right-extremists-programme-prevent-counter-terrorism-record-a9253016.html\" title=\"\">far-right referrals</a> to the official anti-extremism programme Prevent have reached a record high; and, according to the Metropolitan police, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49753325\" title=\"\">fastest growing terror threat</a> today is from the far right.</p> \n<p>While our criminal justice system disproportionately locks up poor people suffering mental distress, or gives black men life-destroying jail terms for nonviolent drug offences, then perhaps there is little to mourn from a homophobic fascist being incarcerated. But again, what will be achieved?</p> \n<p>The Ministry of Justice boasts of multiple programmes that help deradicalise prisoners \u2013 they are \u201ctailored towards each individual\u201d, a spokesperson claims. Yet as Chris Daw a barrister and writer on criminal justice issues, tells me: \u201cIn broad terms, the whole of the prison system is a complete failure when it comes to deradicalisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whether extremists are locked away for months, years or decades, Daw says, they are not deradicalised: often it\u2019s quite the reverse, as they associate with people sharing views similar to their own, sometimes reoffending in the most horrific way. He refers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/usman-khan-profile-terrorist-who-wanted-to-bomb-london-stock-exchange\" title=\"\">Usman Khan</a>, the Islamist terrorist who murdered two people at a rehabilitation conference in November: in his eight years behind bars, he perhaps spent a matter of days engaging with any form of deradicalisation. Meanwhile, Khan could have spent years mixing with those with similar extreme views, discussing their philosophies and ideas. I have to ask: if Healy receives a custodial sentence, how will he emerge back into society?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/15/hate-crimes-double-england-wales\">Hate crimes double in five years in England and Wales</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And there is a broader political context that also cannot be ignored. David Renton, a barrister and author specialising in rightwing extremism, speaks of the left\u2019s anti-fascist folk memory, of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/15/anti-nazi-league-founders-call-for-new-national-campaign\" title=\"\">Anti-Nazi League </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race\" title=\"\">Rock Against Racism</a> in the 1970s. Back then, the far right could be isolated as a small bunch of extremists who could be defeated through popular struggle. But in the US, Britain and elsewhere today, the demarcation between centre right and far right has collapsed.</p> \n<p>Both Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are treated as icons of the contemporary far right, quite unlike their Republican and Conservative predecessors. Britain\u2019s prime minister has the avowed support of far-right extremists such as Britain First and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\" title=\"\">Tommy Robinson</a>. Nations such as Hungary and Brazil can accurately be described as being ruled by far-right governments.</p> \n<p>While the National Front of the 1970s recruited through membership lists and magazine subscriptions, Renton notes, today the online world has become a central portal of radicalisation. Helping to legitimise the far-right worldview, the conservative press systematically scapegoats minorities such as Muslims, migrants, refugees and trans people, all the while demonising the left as dangerous traitors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>My attacker is likely to go to prison a far-right thug and leave much the same way</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>And what is the current \u201canti-woke\u201d backlash other than an attempt to reverse progressive social values \u2013 the hard-won gains of minorities and women \u2013 in order to reimpose conservative norms and ingrain inequality?</p> \n<p>So what should we do with the violent far right? There seems sense in Daw\u2019s suggestion that extremists should not be warehoused together; instead, for example, we should bring in mandatory, high-quality expert interventions and psychological services. Yet all of these are drastically underfunded. Renton argues that divisions on the right should be exploited: many Conservative voters do not approve of rightwing extremism, and we have to \u201crecreate the dynamic of peeling apart centre right and far right to create anti-fascist majorities\u201d, he says.</p> \n<p>Conceding there are no easy solutions can surely not detract from the basic fact that there is no judicial solution to fascism. My attacker, James Healy, is likely to go to prison a far-right thug and leave much the same way, perhaps even more entrenched in his belief system. In a society that portrays the left as the principal dangerous rabble \u2013 often based on online rudeness by leftwing activists \u2013 here is a growing menace lacking the attention it requires. The danger, surely, is that without an effective strategy far worse will happen to others than what I experienced on that warm Friday night outside an Islington pub.</p> \n<p>\u2022Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you cure a problem like violent far-right extremism? It was a thought that danced around my head last Friday as I sat in court 3 of suburban east London\u2019s Snaresbrook crown court inspecting James Healy, a 40-year-old thug who attacked me last August. After a night out celebrating my birthday, I\u2019d left a pub with a group of five others. The CCTV shows us cheerily exchanging goodbyes while Healy creeps up on us, hands in pockets, before suddenly karate kicking me to the ground from behind and throwing wild punches in what the court ruled was a \u201cfrenzied attack\u201d. A melee ensued as our assailant was joined by two friends, who later pleaded guilty to affray. My companions helped prevent a far worse incident, three of them taking blows to the head in the process. Healy had already pleaded guilty to affray and actual bodily harm; his defence was that his rage-filled attack was provoked by a spilt pint earlier. In fact, either he or a friend had, just before the attack, masqueraded as an admirer of mine, double-checking they weren\u2019t about to assault another stranger with a passing resemblance to Macaulay Culkin. Healy\u2019s home was stashed full of far-right memorabilia: Combat 18 regalia (one of their stated aims is to \u201cexecute all queers\u201d), White Power logos and Nazi death heads and an SS flag adorned with the stamp of Chelsea Headhunters, a notorious football hooligan group associated with the far right. Healy was merely a hoarder, he protested: he simply believed these were football-related souvenirs; a birthday card recently sent to him, adorned with loyalist terrorist imagery, was a prank by his friends; he could not possibly be homophobic because his own solicitor was gay; and the police, he claimed, had been in my pocket from day one. Healy\u2019s housemate \u2013 a man with a list of violent convictions \u2013 vouched for his honesty. He would trust Healy not to sleep with his attractive girlfriend. The defence collapsed: the judge ruled she was \u201csatisfied so that I am sure that [Healy] holds particular beliefs that are normally associated with the far-right wing\u201d, and the attack was driven by both homophobia and antipathy to leftwing politics. Healy will be sentenced next month: but if prison is his destination, what will be achieved? This is an important question. As I am a white journalist with a media platform, this far-right attack can draw more attention than most. The incident had a broader context \u2013 I\u2019d been increasingly targeted by the far right both online and on the streets. Yet it was itself far less severe than many of the attacks endured by those without the privilege of attention \u2013 not least minorities who suffer hate-driven abuse, violent attacks or even death. Hate crimes overall have more than doubled over the past six years; far-right referrals to the official anti-extremism programme Prevent have reached a record high; and, according to the Metropolitan police, the fastest growing terror threat today is from the far right. While our criminal justice system disproportionately locks up poor people suffering mental distress, or gives black men life-destroying jail terms for nonviolent drug offences, then perhaps there is little to mourn from a homophobic fascist being incarcerated. But again, what will be achieved? The Ministry of Justice boasts of multiple programmes that help deradicalise prisoners \u2013 they are \u201ctailored towards each individual\u201d, a spokesperson claims. Yet as Chris Daw a barrister and writer on criminal justice issues, tells me: \u201cIn broad terms, the whole of the prison system is a complete failure when it comes to deradicalisation.\u201d Whether extremists are locked away for months, years or decades, Daw says, they are not deradicalised: often it\u2019s quite the reverse, as they associate with people sharing views similar to their own, sometimes reoffending in the most horrific way. He refers to Usman Khan, the Islamist terrorist who murdered two people at a rehabilitation conference in November: in his eight years behind bars, he perhaps spent a matter of days engaging with any form of deradicalisation. Meanwhile, Khan could have spent years mixing with those with similar extreme views, discussing their philosophies and ideas. I have to ask: if Healy receives a custodial sentence, how will he emerge back into society? And there is a broader political context that also cannot be ignored. David Renton, a barrister and author specialising in rightwing extremism, speaks of the left\u2019s anti-fascist folk memory, of the Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism in the 1970s. Back then, the far right could be isolated as a small bunch of extremists who could be defeated through popular struggle. But in the US, Britain and elsewhere today, the demarcation between centre right and far right has collapsed. Both Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are treated as icons of the contemporary far right, quite unlike their Republican and Conservative predecessors. Britain\u2019s prime minister has the avowed support of far-right extremists such as Britain First and Tommy Robinson. Nations such as Hungary and Brazil can accurately be described as being ruled by far-right governments. While the National Front of the 1970s recruited through membership lists and magazine subscriptions, Renton notes, today the online world has become a central portal of radicalisation. Helping to legitimise the far-right worldview, the conservative press systematically scapegoats minorities such as Muslims, migrants, refugees and trans people, all the while demonising the left as dangerous traitors. And what is the current \u201canti-woke\u201d backlash other than an attempt to reverse progressive social values \u2013 the hard-won gains of minorities and women \u2013 in order to reimpose conservative norms and ingrain inequality? So what should we do with the violent far right? There seems sense in Daw\u2019s suggestion that extremists should not be warehoused together; instead, for example, we should bring in mandatory, high-quality expert interventions and psychological services. Yet all of these are drastically underfunded. Renton argues that divisions on the right should be exploited: many Conservative voters do not approve of rightwing extremism, and we have to \u201crecreate the dynamic of peeling apart centre right and far right to create anti-fascist majorities\u201d, he says. Conceding there are no easy solutions can surely not detract from the basic fact that there is no judicial solution to fascism. My attacker, James Healy, is likely to go to prison a far-right thug and leave much the same way, perhaps even more entrenched in his belief system. In a society that portrays the left as the principal dangerous rabble \u2013 often based on online rudeness by leftwing activists \u2013 here is a growing menace lacking the attention it requires. The danger, surely, is that without an effective strategy far worse will happen to others than what I experienced on that warm Friday night outside an Islington pub. \u2022Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>On a cold October night, Richard Ratcliffe, not for the first time, was watching a play about his wife\u2019s ordeal in an Iranian prison. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual-national British-Iranian, has been in detention in Tehran since her arrest on 3 April 2016. She is accused of spying \u2013 a charge she denies. The play was being staged in the London Metropolitan University on Holloway Road, where Zaghari-Ratcliffe, on a scholarship from Iran, studied communications management between 2007-2008.</p> <p>Ratcliffe was sitting in the front row. Beside him sat Ana Diamond, a woman who was incarcerated in the same prison as Nazanin until 2016, and Diamond\u2019s father. As the play unfolded, Diamond\u2019s father, who had also spent years in an Iranian prison, broke into loud sobbing, making it nearly impossible to hear the dialogue. Even though he and his daughter were now free, watching the play forced him to relive the trauma of imprisonment.</p> <p>By contrast, Ratcliffe, an accountant, sat impassively through the 90-minute performance, which began with his own hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London, last summer. He observed the unfolding drama \u2013 his wife, tearful and pleading, the revolutionary guard who abused her in prison, a smug Foreign Office spokeswoman, his own agony \u2013 without betraying any emotion. The set included a calendar marking the days his wife has spent in captivity, and the script quoted from letters and poems she has written to Richard: \u201cI would like to marry you again. It would be the best thing to happen to me. I would like to plant one tree to mark my freedom.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/22/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-pay-400m-debt-in-aid-urges-husband\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: pay \u00a3400m debt in aid, urges husband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Later, Ratcliffe explained how he managed to control his emotions by casting himself in the role of a neutral theatre critic, noticing small changes in the production since the last time he saw it. After the play finished and the cast had taken their bows, Ratcliffe stepped up on stage to answer a familiar round of questions about the prospects for his wife\u2019s release, and her state of mind. The campaign, he explained, is not just about \u201cgetting the right people to listen\u201d, but letting Nazanin know that people care about her fate. With characteristic restraint and politeness, he urged the prime minister to help them: \u201cWith all the distractions of Brexit, please do what you can.\u201d</p> <p>The day after seeing the play, day 1,304 of his wife\u2019s captivity, Ratcliffe told me, he suffered a delayed reaction. He felt too depressed to get out of bed. By now, it was a familiar experience. \u201cIt is how I operate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a coping mechanism. I keep myself incredibly busy and then it all kicks in.\u201d</p> <p>There is a particularly senseless and unjust quality to the story of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She was arrested at the end of a two-week trip to see her parents with her three-year-old child, and authorities used her dual nationality and her work as a project manager for the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters Foundation to claim she was a spy seeking to overthrow the Iranian state. Her case represents a growing trend of state hostage-taking, in which secret police pick up innocent people, often dual nationals, and use them as bargaining chips in wider negotiations with a rival state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/03/the-zaghari-ratcliffes-ordeal-british-arrogance-secret-arms-deals-and-whitehall-infighting-podcast\">The Zaghari-Ratcliffes' ordeal: British arrogance, secret arms deals and Whitehall infighting \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, it seems that she is a pawn in a 40-year dispute between Britain and Iran. This dispute concerns a long-standing \u00a3400m debt Britain owes to Iran: the advance payment for a shipment of tanks that was never fully delivered. Quite why that debt has never been paid is a story of British arrogance, secretive arms deals, American sanctions, Whitehall inertia and infighting at the highest level of government.</p> <p>Some of the most egregious blunders in this sorry episode have been committed by the current prime minister, who promised to leave no stone unturned to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, but instead, mainly through error, has blocked her road to freedom. Ratcliffe is a balanced and rational man, but it is hard to overstate the contempt he feels, in his bleaker moods, for Boris Johnson.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The story of Britain\u2019s debt to Iran, like so many political stories in the Middle East, starts with oil. When the Shah of Iran was installed in 1953, after a coup aided by the British, he planned to become the dominant power in the region. By the 1970s, the Shah, benefiting from booming oil prices, had become one of the largest purchasers of British-manufactured arms; between 1972-1978, almost a quarter of all British arms exports were destined for Iran. The single biggest deal, signed in 1971, was for the sale of more than 700 Chieftain tanks, at the time the most powerful battlefield tank, prized for the accuracy of its guns.</p> <p>This deal, which was worth \u00a3115.5m, was negotiated between an agency owned by the Ministry of Defence, Millbank Technical Services (MTS), and a confidante of the Shah, an Iranian called Shapoor Reporter, who had previously worked for British intelligence. As part of the contract, Reporter would receive 1% of the price \u2013 an unofficial fee for persuading the Shah to choose the British Chieftain over the rival German Leopard tank. Reporter\u2019s informal brokerage fee was agreed by MTS and paid into a special fund administered by the private investment bank Kleinwort Benson.</p> <p>The UK was perfectly aware that, whether this 1% fee went to Reporter or to the Shah himself, none of it would reach Iranian state coffers. It was part of the role of MTS, which operated as the government\u2019s arms sales company with subsidiaries across the old empire, to pay such informal brokerage fees<strong> </strong>with minimum parliamentary scrutiny. Harold Hubert, director of army sales at the MoD, explained in 1972 that there were \u201cadvantages in MTS ... passing on the <em>douceurs</em>\u201d. </p> <p>Reporter was knighted in 1973 for \u201cservices to British interests in Iran\u201d. In December 1974, the Shah ordered a further 1,800 tanks, mainly the latest version of the Chieftain. The Iranians were required to pay 75% of the fee up front in order to cover the cost of getting the tank\u2019s armour into mass production and to equip the main factory in Leeds. For Britain, where the economy was stalled in the middle of a balance-of-payments crisis, the timing of this deal was perfect.</p> <p>However, to the embarrassment of all involved, details of the secret payments would emerge two years later, during an unconnected corruption trial. In 1976, a British serving officer, David Randel, appeared in court charged with taking \u00a325,000 in fees in relation to a contract to install British radar equipment into the Chieftain tanks. During cross-examination, the head of MTS, Sir Lester Suffield, disclosed that a \u00a31m commission had been paid to Reporter because \u201chis advice is tremendously important to any British company trying to sell to Iran\u201d. Since the cost of the commission was included in the deal, it meant Iran was paying inflated prices to enrich officials and the Shah himself. The Shah, already facing anti-corruption protests in Tehran, tried to insist he had not known of the fees, but the court was told that \u201cthe Shah [had] set up a special fund to receive bribes which otherwise would have found their way to officials\u201d.</p> <p>Sir Anthony Parsons, the British ambassador to Tehran, wrote in October 1977: \u201cI am seeing the Shah frequently about the unfolding of this trial and am having a difficult time of it.\u201d Parsons recalledthat the Shah \u201ccould not tolerate the insinuation that he had been receiving money paid by us to Reporter\u201d.</p> <p>To protect its relationship with the Shah, Whitehall hastily concluded it could not confirm whether he had been aware of the commissions paid by MTS, let alone whether he was personally benefiting from them. But by late 1978, the UK could see the Shah was losing his grip on power. When he was ousted in January 1979, desperate attempts were made to win favour with the new regime, and the Shah, Britain\u2019s former ally, was refused asylum in the UK. The then foreign secretary, Lord Owen, later wrote: \u201cThere was no honour in my decision, just the cold calculation of national interest.\u201d But the harsh treatment of a former ally was to no avail, officials told the prime minister, Jim Callaghan. \u201cThe changes in Iran have dealt a major blow to western interests in the Gulf.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eecf3695390fc4e21d06c4cb37f09d9f551079f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eecf3695390fc4e21d06c4cb37f09d9f551079f1/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ratcliffe meeting Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, in London in November 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ratcliffe meeting Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, in London in November 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That blow was most keenly felt in the defence industry. British military exports to Iran would be halved in a year, with the loss of 35,000 jobs. A senior commercial officer at MTS later recalled \u201csomething akin to panic broke out in the Royal Ordnance Factories\u201d. Export approvals for all military contracts to Iran were withdrawn. The MoD was faced with the nightmarish prospect of wholesale redundancies.</p> <p>The only advantage for Britain was that, while the Iranians had paid almost all the agreed fees for the tanks upfront, only a small number had been delivered. When the Iranians formally terminated the tank contract on 6 February 1979, Iran had received only 185 tanks, worth \u00a356m. They demanded that \u00a3250m, which they had paid in advance, must be returned. But MTS kept the money, passing \u00a3120m to the MoD and keeping the rest hidden in its accounts. Some of the tanks already built but not yet sent to Iran were sold on to Jordan, and some were bought by the British army, renamed as Challengers.</p> <p>As it turned out, the advent of a revolutionary Islamic regime in Tehran, which had looked disastrous for British interests, did not put an end to the British government\u2019s opportunities to make money in the Gulf. On the contrary, war between Iran and Iraq, which broke out in 1980, proved highly profitable. The UK\u2019s declared position throughout the Iran-Iraq war was neutral, but as the Scott inquiry into arms sales to Iraq later revealed, the true policy was to sell arms to both sides, in breach of an arms embargo.</p> <p>In 1982, MTS was rebranded as International Military Services (IMS) \u2013 still a subsidiary of the MoD, but now a private company and, as such, less accountable to parliament. IMS kept an office in Tehran and continued selling arms to Iran. At the same time, IMS was given the contract to repair any Chieftain tanks captured by Iraq from Iran. As Alan Clark, then defence minister, later admitted: \u201cThe interests of the west were best served by Iran and Iraq fighting each other, and the longer the better.\u201d</p> <p>Britain had paid fees to a corrupt Shah, then pocketed Iran\u2019s money without delivering the tanks before breaking a British arms embargo. \u201cThe Iranians have long regarded the British as perfidious and corrupt, accurately or not,\u201d said Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary. \u201cThis whole Chieftain tank episode just confirms them in this view.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s cynical policy of arming both sides in the longest conventional war of the 20th century, which left 500,000 dead, was not something the Iranians would forget. More than a decade after the first arms deal was cancelled, Iran had taken delivery of fewer than 10% of the tanks for which the Shah had paid. In 1990, the Iranians embarked on arbitration proceedings to demand that IMS hand back the money. It was the start of an extraordinary legal marathon, much of it played out behind closed doors in the permanent international arbitration court in The Hague.</p> <p>In May 2001, after more than a decade of claims and counterclaims, the court in The Hague declared that IMS must pay the Iranian ministry of defence (Modsaf) \u00a3141m plus interest from 1984 to the date of payment. The total sum was estimated to be about \u00a3380m. IMS was also told it would have to pay the costs incurred by Modsaf during legal proceedings over the previous decade.</p> <p>But this was far from the end of the story. IMS immediately contested the judgment, and in cases where awards by the arbitration court are contested, they require an enforcement order in the relevant domestic court.</p> <p>Now the gruelling legal battle entered its next phrase. In July 2001, Modsaf sought to have this award enforced in a British court, which IMS resisted by launching another appeal. In December 2002, IMS and Modsaf agreed that IMS would transfer a sum of \u00a3382m to a court funds office \u2013 to be held as security pending the IMS appeal. (The balance, with interest, is now over \u00a3500m.)</p> <p>In December 2006, the Dutch appeal court slightly lowered the amount the UK should pay. But the indefatigable lawyers for IMS were dissatisfied with the size of the reduction and, in April 2008, submitted a further appeal. (When the EU imposed sanctions on Modsaf in June 2008 because of its links with Iranian nuclear research, IMS took this as a further reason not to pay.) However, in April 2009, this appeal was roundly rejected by the Dutch supreme court in a damning ruling.</p> <p>It looked as if IMS had run out of road. Payment of the debt was overdue. One former Labour cabinet minister said: \u201cI am not sure whether IMS have been under much political direction. It looks like they have just been pissing about for the sake of not very much money.\u201d</p> <p>This prolonged battle has contributed to the historic mistrust between Iran and Britain, which has periodically erupted in hostilities. In November 2011, Iranians stormed the British embassy in Tehran, in protest at the UK\u2019s role in blocking the Iranian nuclear programme. Protesters scaled the gates, broke the locks and entered the compound. Inside, the demonstrators burned the British flag, smashed windows, destroyed paintings, sprayed graffiti and set a car ablaze.</p> <p>After this break-in, the Iranian ambassador to the UK was expelled and the British embassy in Tehran was closed. It was not reopened until 2015, after Britain and other western powers signed the nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions in return for Iran halting its nuclear programme and allowing an intrusive UN inspection regime. By then, potential reformers, such as President Hassan Rouhani, were in the ascendant.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It was during this period, in March 2016, as Iran started an era of wary engagement with the west and tensions eased, that Zaghari-Ratcliffe flew to Tehran with her daughter, Gabriella. There seemed no cause for concern. She had made the trip every year since she left Iran in 2007, twice with her husband. She was eager for her ageing parents to spend time with their new grandchild.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe had studied English in Tehran before she went to London alone on a scholarship to complete a masters degree. She had met Ratcliffe, then on an accountancy graduate course, at a conference on Palestine. He was an hour late for their first date and when he finally showed up, she laughingly punched his arm. Still, the date couldn\u2019t have gone too badly. As they got to know each other better over the following months, they found that, despite their different backgrounds, they had much in common. They had the same sense of humour, and they had both been brought up in middle-class households where family was everything. Ratcliffe also admired her boldness. \u201cIt was very intrepid of her to come to London,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very genuine and straightforward. She had that wonderful enthusiasm, and a desire to explore a new country with great open eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Three years after they met, he proposed. She posted on her Facebook page: \u201cA big thank you to God and to Richard\u2019s God\u201d. The couple married in 2009 and threw three parties to reflect their different cultures. Ratcliffe had himself been out to Tehran twice to present his credentials as a prospective son-in-law. \u201cShe had two sisters and a brother. And her father, an electrical engineer, was very proud his kids had all gone to university,\u201d Ratcliffe recalled. \u201cIf there was any politics discussed, it was family politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her daughter were heading home to the UK on 3 April 2016, she was arrested at the airport, by agents from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), the powerful militia that operates in parallel with the Iranian military. She was taken to a prison in Kervan in the south of Iran and kept in solitary confinement. Her parents were summoned to take their grandchild home with them. For the next 55 days, she was not allowed to speak to her husband on the phone. \u201cWe knew virtually nothing about what happened to her, but I knew she would be tortured by the separation from Gabriella,\u201d Ratcliffe said.</p> <p>Two months after Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s arrest, the authorities described her as a ringleader in a revolt against the Islamic republic and took her to Evin prison in Tehran. In August 2016, following a trial behind closed doors, she was sentenced to five years in prison on charges relating to national security. She was only given access to her lawyer the day before the court session, and the lawyer was given just five minutes to defend her. These same restrictions applied during the subsequent appeals process in Tehran.</p> <p>For the first nine months after she was arrested, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was kept in total isolation. She has since suffered from mood swings, depression, panic attacks and anxieties about her physical health. At times she has been chained to a bed in a psychiatric wing. Her parents visit every week. Until last year, when Gabriella was brought back to the UK, they would bring her to visit her mother. Zaghari-Ratcliffe speaks to her husband by phone three times a week for 10 minutes. All calls are monitored. \u201cThe first calls I just tried to reassure her that we were still here for her, and that I loved her,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing else that matters. She had been fed all sorts of poison \u2013 that I was off with other women.\u201d</p> <p>Last June, Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote a letter marking Gabriella\u2019s fifth birthday. \u201cShe teaches me now that there is a silver lining in every cloud, and that there is a home, a very warm home waiting for us to go to, where Daddy has been waiting for us for over three years. My most beautiful baby girl, you are wise beyond your age, with the most amazing imagination. You see the world in primary colours, you look out for the unicorns.</p> <p>\u201cYour visits and smiles make my world brighter. I know we have been through dark years \u2013 perhaps the darkest of our lives \u2013 but we have had each other. No one can take us apart. No politics, walls, or even prisons.\u201d</p> <p>It was agonising for Zaghari-Ratcliffe to see her daughter so rarely. A few months after Gabriella\u2019s birthday, she wrote to her husband: \u201cMy heart pounds much more than usual every Sunday morning \u2013 when I get to see my Gabriella Gisou in the visiting room of Evin prison, full of excitement. When the door of the visiting room opens, and the prisoners are allowed in, it is my little girl who runs towards me first, calling out my name, rushing to my cuddle. Those brief minutes might be the shortest of cuddles, but without doubt the most beautiful and uplifting cuddles in the whole world. They are my world.</p> <p>\u201cBut then comes the stress \u2013 Sundays slip so soon through my hands, and fade away in the fog of the cell.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe was just one victim of a wave of arrests of as many as 20 dual nationals in Iran that took place during 2015 and 2016 \u2013 academics, businessmen and individuals who could be linked to a foreign NGO were picked up, including Austrians, Canadians, Britons and Chinese-Americans. Ratcliffe believes the IRGC views dual nationals, a concept Iran does not recognise, as unwelcome symbols of reformist attempts to break down barriers between Iran and the world. This strategy is ongoing. In September 2018, an Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, was arrested in Tehran and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In leaked letters published earlier this week in the Times, Moore-Gilbert protested her innocence and warned that her detention is destroying her mental health.</p> <p>The timing of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s arrest, just before a hearing on the Chieftain tank debt issue was due to take place in the London high court, seems significant. Three months earlier, in January 2016, the US had refunded Iran $400m (\u00a3300m) for undelivered military equipment, and this led to the release of four Americans, including the Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Ratcliffe is convinced the IRGC came to see his wife as another bargaining chip to ensure a debt was paid: \u201cThe guards thought, crudely: \u2018We want to get our money, so we must arrest someone,\u2019\u201d Ratcliffe told me. One former minister says: \u201cThe Iranians are very transactional, and her arrest was viewed as the start of a transaction.\u201d</p> <p>In the weeks after his wife\u2019s arrest, Ratcliffe had been strongly advised by the Foreign Office to say nothing in public, while diplomatic efforts were made to secure her release. But knowing that his wife was being held in solitary confinement, and initially debarred from speaking to her by phone, Ratcliffe took the decision to defy that advice and, in May 2016, went public with an online petition. Over the following months, he found himself trying to run a campaign to keep her in the public eye. As he overcame his natural shyness, the campaign grew into a force calling not just for his wife\u2019s release, but an end to state hostage-taking altogether.</p> <p>Asked if he worries that, on reflection, going public was an error, Ratcliffe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I am in an emotional space where you can have doubts. When it is all over and we are out the other side, there will be a space to reflect, but at the moment we are in the middle of a battle, so we keep going on. Our strategy has worked no worse than anyone else\u2019s. I tell the Foreign Office: \u2018It\u2019s clear there are good reasons why we are doing what we are doing. I want to make my problem your problem.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cThe government\u2019s failure to settle this case is not because they do not care. It is because they do not care enough. There is no lack of sympathy, it is just that sympathy is not going to get us home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ea44d0b979b4cbaedadc26add84e5d1a689f266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea44d0b979b4cbaedadc26add84e5d1a689f266/53_0_3308_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been imprisoned in Iran since 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been imprisoned in Iran since 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaigning for his wife\u2019s release has been a learning process. \u201cI used to work for the National Audit Office, so my biggest previous political act was sometimes to mutter under my breath,\u201d he said. Now, when the politics around the campaign intensifies, he finds the attention hard to deal with. \u201cYou can issue a press release, and six hours later the media will want to know: \u2018What\u2019s the next step?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In early November 2017, the attention became overpowering when Boris Johnson, as foreign secretary, made a blunder that set back Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s cause. While she has always maintained that her visit to Tehran was purely to see her family, Iran had accused her of running a \u201ca BBC Persian online journalism course which was aimed at recruiting and training people to spread propaganda against Iran\u201d. It is true thatbetween February 2009 and October 2010, Zaghari-Ratcliffe had worked for an online BBC World Service Trust journalist training course. But it was a purely administrative role, booking Iranian and other students on courses. She then left to work for Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news organisation.</p> <p>In the middle of a long foreign affairs select committee session in November 2017, Johnson blurted out to MPs that \u201cshe was simply teaching journalism, as I understand it, at the very limit\u201d. It was intended as a statement in her defence, but it directly contradicted Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s own account. The Iranian judiciary claimed that Johnson\u2019s inadvertent confession proved it had been right about the real reason for her visit. \u201cJohnson\u2019s statement annulled all the claims in the past year made by British media who said that she was only visiting Iran for humanitarian reasons,\u201d declared Iran\u2019s state broadcaster.</p> <p>It took Johnson 10 days to issue a half apology. However, in seeking to protect his personal reputation afterwards, he made matters worse. After stalling for weeks, Johnson finally agreed to hold a meeting at the Foreign Office with Ratcliffe, Ratcliffe\u2019s father and his MP, Tulip Siddiq. On the morning of 15 November 2017, the day their meeting was scheduled, the Sun newspaper\u2019s front page carried an article marked exclusive: \u201cIranian officials present a multimillion shopping list to free Nazanin. The demands include settling a 38-year-old demand for \u00a3400m arising from a Chieftain tank deal.\u201d The Sun story argued that the debt was the true cause of Nazanin\u2019s continued imprisonment, so implying that Johnson\u2019s gaffe was not significant in her plight. Ratcliffe was convinced Johnson had placed the story to make him look better.</p> <p>\u201cAt the meeting, the foreign secretary was quite charming, but refused to apologise for what he had said at the select committee,\u201d Ratcliffe recalled. \u201cNear the end of the meeting, we showed him a copy of the Sun story. Boris said he had never seen the article. At that point, Alistair Burt, the Middle East minister, just left the meeting. I think he was horrified by what Johnson had done and did not want to be party to it.\u201d</p> <p>The following day, the Sun reported that Johnson, with the chancellor Philip Hammond, had \u201cquietly authorised that \u00a3450m be handed over\u201d. The Iranians were sufficiently convinced for their ambassador to London to announce on the messaging service Telegram a day later that \u201cthe debt was to be transferred in the coming days\u201d.</p> <p>So when Johnson went to Tehran a few weeks later, in December 2017, expectations for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release were high. Her fellow prisoners started to ask her how she was going to distribute the few possessions she had with her in prison. She began to make leaving presents, including little makeup bags for each of the prisoners, made from a floral print fabric. She was a great knitter and, since the snows had come to Tehran, a couple of the prisoners asked her if she could knit them an \u201cEnglish\u201d woolly hat before she left. But the snows came and went, and she remained in jail.</p> <p>In retrospect, Ratcliffe says, he believes that Johnson\u2019s aides had briefed Sun journalists about the breakthrough on the debt payment without truly knowing if the relevant government departments, including the MoD, were signed up. On his return from Tehran, Johnson told Ratcliffe he should go quiet for three months or so. Ratcliffe was plunged into despair.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The fact that Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate is tied to the ongoing dispute over Britain\u2019s debt to Iran is, by now, hard to deny. The IRGC told Zaghari-Ratcliffe as much during her initial interrogation in 2016. The Iranian deputy prosecutor said the same in May 2018. Again that year, Judge Abbasi, the head of judicial affairs inside Evin prison, was reported as saying to Zaghari-Ratcliffe in court: \u201cEvery time I request to review your case, this is the answer: \u2018The UK has not paid\u2019 and that is why we cannot do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Senior Iranian diplomats in London privately admit there is a link between Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention and the debt, and question why successive British governments have not done more to resolve the issue. Jack Straw now admits he did not do enough to pursue the issue in office. Ratcliffe\u2019s team of lawyers have written at length to cabinet ministers including Johnson and Hammond, urging them to use greater imagination and find a way to pay at least the principal. Their letters mostly go unanswered. One reply from Johnson, in May 2018, stated that there is no connection between the debt and her detention.</p> <p>That, at least, is the government\u2019s line in public. But ministerial sources have confirmed that this has been the subject of heated debate behind closed doors. According to a ministerial source, last year, Foreign Office minister Alastair Burt had a stand-up row with the defence secretary Gavin Williamson about his refusal to find a way to pay the debt. Another former minister said of the handling of the case while Theresa May was prime minister: \u201cHammond was scared stiff he would be sanctioned by the US if he paid. Williamson just thought: \u2018I am not going to fucking help the IRGC.\u2019 May was useless, just a coward, as she was about everything.\u201d</p> <p>Ratcliffe found Jeremy Hunt, who replaced Johnson as foreign secretary in July 2018, empathetic, but he was not been able to succeed where his predecessor failed. In November 2018, Hunt went to Tehran to meet the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and came away empty-handed. At the time of his visit, he said Zarif did not even pretend Zaghari-Ratcliffe was guilty. Her fate, Zarif said, lay with the judiciary, and not his department, but Hunt\u2019s plan to meet the justice minister fell through.</p> <p>In March 2019, Hunt, overruling advice from the Foreign Office, granted Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection. Ratcliffe said: \u201cThere is a Foreign Office instinct about not creating precedents. They worried that the moment Nazanin was given diplomatic protection, then other victims of gross human rights abuses would have a reasonable claim to say that they deserve protection, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60f5e3020ed98718e252ad99ff5671a428c89ed7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60f5e3020ed98718e252ad99ff5671a428c89ed7/97_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ratcliffe and Zaghari-Ratcliffe with their daughter, Gabriella.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ratcliffe and Zaghari-Ratcliffe with their daughter, Gabriella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another Foreign Office minister, Sir Alan Duncan, although not responsible for the Middle East, became involved in Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case because he knows the Gulf well as a former oil trader. He proposed paying the debt into a new escrow account so Iran could receive the money owed in the form of humanitarian aid. The debt might not then be subject to US sanctions.<strong> </strong>In his resignation letter, in July 2019, Duncan said he \u201cremained deeply upset that some fruitful discussions I had initiated about the possible release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe were brought to such an abrupt halt\u201d. It is not clear if the premature briefings led to his plan being shelved, but it is now being re-explored by ministers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the British courts, IMS has carried on its secretive legal trench war with Iran. At first there was a ban on reporting the case, as is typical in commercial arbitration cases. But in May 2019, after an intervention by Ratcliffe\u2019s lawyers and the Sunday Times, Mr Justice Phillips lifted reporting restrictions, and for the first time it was possible to see the scale of IMS resistance to paying the debt. On one occasion, Iranian officials with visas granted by the Foreign Office arrived in the UK on a mission to enforce the Dutch court order. In spite of their legal status, the Home Office held them in a detention centre for nearly a week.</p> <p>In July 2019, and again in a follow-up hearing on 7 October, the law firm Clifford Chance, representing IMS, scored a legal victory, worth millions of pounds. At a hearing, Mr Justice Phillips declared IMS did not have to pay Modsaf interest on any of the money it had withheld after 2008, the date Modsaf came under EU sanctions. In a briefing afterwards, IMS, apparently savouring its victory, declared that at the next hearing it plans to argue that, because of sanctions, it should not have to pay Modsaf any of the \u00a3379m it owes. At no point during the hearing, or afterwards, was Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s name mentioned.</p> <p>The case rolls on, week after week, month after month. Just this week, Ratcliffe sat listening in court room 70 of the Royal Courts of Justice, as three appeal court judges heard IMS and Modsaf continue their seemingly endless argument as to whether interest is payable on the debt.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Ratcliffe, for his part, while trying to follow the legal back-and-forth, is learning to be a father again. In October, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s brother brought Gabriella, now five, to live with her father, but it is a mutual learning process. She speaks little English, and her uncle has to help with translation. After years apart, Ratcliffe is adjusting to having his daughter back at home in Hampstead.</p> <p>\u201cNow there are many cuddles, but at first it was a bit like being a stepdad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to earn your right again to parent, to discipline and be trusted. Gabriella has come over with no control of the situation and there are parts of her wanting to be back in Tehran watching cartoons she can understand. She does not like talking about Mummy being in prison, but she has started to ask why others were being let out of prison and she seems to understand what prison is. She is disoriented and aware that we have made promises we have not been able to keep.</p> <p>\u201cShe has internalised a lot. She notices, for example, if there are any cameras on a bus or a tube. At the moment, she does not dwell on loss or injustice and unfairness. When she is six or seven, she will have a keen sense of right and wrong that she does not have yet.\u201d</p> <p>As for the campaign, Ratcliffe admits it has worn him down. \u201cAt this point it is a bit hard to know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sort of had this idea of a staircase where we escalate every so often, and go up a level. But once you get to a hunger strike on the street, there are not many places you can go from there.\u201d</p> <p>Ratcliffe has had to endure the rising tensions between Iran and the west, knowing that events way beyond his control can render his campaign irrelevant. All the time he is trying to read the shifts in government thinking, picking up fragments from wherever he can. On Thursday, Ratcliffe will be meeting with Johnson for the first time since he became prime minister. He plans to tell Johnson that \u201cdoing nothing is not an option\u201d and wants to know if there is a strategy in place or not.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he is left to worry about his wife\u2019s worsening health. Since the winter of 2017, when hopes for her release came to nothing, Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been deeply depressed. \u201cShe cannot cope. She is trying to be as clear as possible that she cannot cope,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cShe has undertaken four hunger strikes. She is set apart from her daughter. The Foreign Office just needs to be aware that we do not have the luxury of time. Both governments can play this game of poker with one another. We are the ones who are paying the cost, and she cannot pay it for much longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a cold October night, Richard Ratcliffe, not for the first time, was watching a play about his wife\u2019s ordeal in an Iranian prison. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual-national British-Iranian, has been in detention in Tehran since her arrest on 3 April 2016. She is accused of spying \u2013 a charge she denies. The play was being staged in the London Metropolitan University on Holloway Road, where Zaghari-Ratcliffe, on a scholarship from Iran, studied communications management between 2007-2008. Ratcliffe was sitting in the front row. Beside him sat Ana Diamond, a woman who was incarcerated in the same prison as Nazanin until 2016, and Diamond\u2019s father. As the play unfolded, Diamond\u2019s father, who had also spent years in an Iranian prison, broke into loud sobbing, making it nearly impossible to hear the dialogue. Even though he and his daughter were now free, watching the play forced him to relive the trauma of imprisonment. By contrast, Ratcliffe, an accountant, sat impassively through the 90-minute performance, which began with his own hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London, last summer. He observed the unfolding drama \u2013 his wife, tearful and pleading, the revolutionary guard who abused her in prison, a smug Foreign Office spokeswoman, his own agony \u2013 without betraying any emotion. The set included a calendar marking the days his wife has spent in captivity, and the script quoted from letters and poems she has written to Richard: \u201cI would like to marry you again. It would be the best thing to happen to me. I would like to plant one tree to mark my freedom.\u201d Later, Ratcliffe explained how he managed to control his emotions by casting himself in the role of a neutral theatre critic, noticing small changes in the production since the last time he saw it. After the play finished and the cast had taken their bows, Ratcliffe stepped up on stage to answer a familiar round of questions about the prospects for his wife\u2019s release, and her state of mind. The campaign, he explained, is not just about \u201cgetting the right people to listen\u201d, but letting Nazanin know that people care about her fate. With characteristic restraint and politeness, he urged the prime minister to help them: \u201cWith all the distractions of Brexit, please do what you can.\u201d The day after seeing the play, day 1,304 of his wife\u2019s captivity, Ratcliffe told me, he suffered a delayed reaction. He felt too depressed to get out of bed. By now, it was a familiar experience. \u201cIt is how I operate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a coping mechanism. I keep myself incredibly busy and then it all kicks in.\u201d There is a particularly senseless and unjust quality to the story of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She was arrested at the end of a two-week trip to see her parents with her three-year-old child, and authorities used her dual nationality and her work as a project manager for the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters Foundation to claim she was a spy seeking to overthrow the Iranian state. Her case represents a growing trend of state hostage-taking, in which secret police pick up innocent people, often dual nationals, and use them as bargaining chips in wider negotiations with a rival state. In the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, it seems that she is a pawn in a 40-year dispute between Britain and Iran. This dispute concerns a long-standing \u00a3400m debt Britain owes to Iran: the advance payment for a shipment of tanks that was never fully delivered. Quite why that debt has never been paid is a story of British arrogance, secretive arms deals, American sanctions, Whitehall inertia and infighting at the highest level of government. Some of the most egregious blunders in this sorry episode have been committed by the current prime minister, who promised to leave no stone unturned to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, but instead, mainly through error, has blocked her road to freedom. Ratcliffe is a balanced and rational man, but it is hard to overstate the contempt he feels, in his bleaker moods, for Boris Johnson. * * * The story of Britain\u2019s debt to Iran, like so many political stories in the Middle East, starts with oil. When the Shah of Iran was installed in 1953, after a coup aided by the British, he planned to become the dominant power in the region. By the 1970s, the Shah, benefiting from booming oil prices, had become one of the largest purchasers of British-manufactured arms; between 1972-1978, almost a quarter of all British arms exports were destined for Iran. The single biggest deal, signed in 1971, was for the sale of more than 700 Chieftain tanks, at the time the most powerful battlefield tank, prized for the accuracy of its guns. This deal, which was worth \u00a3115.5m, was negotiated between an agency owned by the Ministry of Defence, Millbank Technical Services (MTS), and a confidante of the Shah, an Iranian called Shapoor Reporter, who had previously worked for British intelligence. As part of the contract, Reporter would receive 1% of the price \u2013 an unofficial fee for persuading the Shah to choose the British Chieftain over the rival German Leopard tank. Reporter\u2019s informal brokerage fee was agreed by MTS and paid into a special fund administered by the private investment bank Kleinwort Benson. The UK was perfectly aware that, whether this 1% fee went to Reporter or to the Shah himself, none of it would reach Iranian state coffers. It was part of the role of MTS, which operated as the government\u2019s arms sales company with subsidiaries across the old empire, to pay such informal brokerage fees with minimum parliamentary scrutiny. Harold Hubert, director of army sales at the MoD, explained in 1972 that there were \u201cadvantages in MTS ... passing on the douceurs\u201d. Reporter was knighted in 1973 for \u201cservices to British interests in Iran\u201d. In December 1974, the Shah ordered a further 1,800 tanks, mainly the latest version of the Chieftain. The Iranians were required to pay 75% of the fee up front in order to cover the cost of getting the tank\u2019s armour into mass production and to equip the main factory in Leeds. For Britain, where the economy was stalled in the middle of a balance-of-payments crisis, the timing of this deal was perfect. However, to the embarrassment of all involved, details of the secret payments would emerge two years later, during an unconnected corruption trial. In 1976, a British serving officer, David Randel, appeared in court charged with taking \u00a325,000 in fees in relation to a contract to install British radar equipment into the Chieftain tanks. During cross-examination, the head of MTS, Sir Lester Suffield, disclosed that a \u00a31m commission had been paid to Reporter because \u201chis advice is tremendously important to any British company trying to sell to Iran\u201d. Since the cost of the commission was included in the deal, it meant Iran was paying inflated prices to enrich officials and the Shah himself. The Shah, already facing anti-corruption protests in Tehran, tried to insist he had not known of the fees, but the court was told that \u201cthe Shah [had] set up a special fund to receive bribes which otherwise would have found their way to officials\u201d. Sir Anthony Parsons, the British ambassador to Tehran, wrote in October 1977: \u201cI am seeing the Shah frequently about the unfolding of this trial and am having a difficult time of it.\u201d Parsons recalledthat the Shah \u201ccould not tolerate the insinuation that he had been receiving money paid by us to Reporter\u201d. To protect its relationship with the Shah, Whitehall hastily concluded it could not confirm whether he had been aware of the commissions paid by MTS, let alone whether he was personally benefiting from them. But by late 1978, the UK could see the Shah was losing his grip on power. When he was ousted in January 1979, desperate attempts were made to win favour with the new regime, and the Shah, Britain\u2019s former ally, was refused asylum in the UK. The then foreign secretary, Lord Owen, later wrote: \u201cThere was no honour in my decision, just the cold calculation of national interest.\u201d But the harsh treatment of a former ally was to no avail, officials told the prime minister, Jim Callaghan. \u201cThe changes in Iran have dealt a major blow to western interests in the Gulf.\u201d That blow was most keenly felt in the defence industry. British military exports to Iran would be halved in a year, with the loss of 35,000 jobs. A senior commercial officer at MTS later recalled \u201csomething akin to panic broke out in the Royal Ordnance Factories\u201d. Export approvals for all military contracts to Iran were withdrawn. The MoD was faced with the nightmarish prospect of wholesale redundancies. The only advantage for Britain was that, while the Iranians had paid almost all the agreed fees for the tanks upfront, only a small number had been delivered. When the Iranians formally terminated the tank contract on 6 February 1979, Iran had received only 185 tanks, worth \u00a356m. They demanded that \u00a3250m, which they had paid in advance, must be returned. But MTS kept the money, passing \u00a3120m to the MoD and keeping the rest hidden in its accounts. Some of the tanks already built but not yet sent to Iran were sold on to Jordan, and some were bought by the British army, renamed as Challengers. As it turned out, the advent of a revolutionary Islamic regime in Tehran, which had looked disastrous for British interests, did not put an end to the British government\u2019s opportunities to make money in the Gulf. On the contrary, war between Iran and Iraq, which broke out in 1980, proved highly profitable. The UK\u2019s declared position throughout the Iran-Iraq war was neutral, but as the Scott inquiry into arms sales to Iraq later revealed, the true policy was to sell arms to both sides, in breach of an arms embargo. In 1982, MTS was rebranded as International Military Services (IMS) \u2013 still a subsidiary of the MoD, but now a private company and, as such, less accountable to parliament. IMS kept an office in Tehran and continued selling arms to Iran. At the same time, IMS was given the contract to repair any Chieftain tanks captured by Iraq from Iran. As Alan Clark, then defence minister, later admitted: \u201cThe interests of the west were best served by Iran and Iraq fighting each other, and the longer the better.\u201d Britain had paid fees to a corrupt Shah, then pocketed Iran\u2019s money without delivering the tanks before breaking a British arms embargo. \u201cThe Iranians have long regarded the British as perfidious and corrupt, accurately or not,\u201d said Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary. \u201cThis whole Chieftain tank episode just confirms them in this view.\u201d * * * Britain\u2019s cynical policy of arming both sides in the longest conventional war of the 20th century, which left 500,000 dead, was not something the Iranians would forget. More than a decade after the first arms deal was cancelled, Iran had taken delivery of fewer than 10% of the tanks for which the Shah had paid. In 1990, the Iranians embarked on arbitration proceedings to demand that IMS hand back the money. It was the start of an extraordinary legal marathon, much of it played out behind closed doors in the permanent international arbitration court in The Hague. In May 2001, after more than a decade of claims and counterclaims, the court in The Hague declared that IMS must pay the Iranian ministry of defence (Modsaf) \u00a3141m plus interest from 1984 to the date of payment. The total sum was estimated to be about \u00a3380m. IMS was also told it would have to pay the costs incurred by Modsaf during legal proceedings over the previous decade. But this was far from the end of the story. IMS immediately contested the judgment, and in cases where awards by the arbitration court are contested, they require an enforcement order in the relevant domestic court. Now the gruelling legal battle entered its next phrase. In July 2001, Modsaf sought to have this award enforced in a British court, which IMS resisted by launching another appeal. In December 2002, IMS and Modsaf agreed that IMS would transfer a sum of \u00a3382m to a court funds office \u2013 to be held as security pending the IMS appeal. (The balance, with interest, is now over \u00a3500m.) In December 2006, the Dutch appeal court slightly lowered the amount the UK should pay. But the indefatigable lawyers for IMS were dissatisfied with the size of the reduction and, in April 2008, submitted a further appeal. (When the EU imposed sanctions on Modsaf in June 2008 because of its links with Iranian nuclear research, IMS took this as a further reason not to pay.) However, in April 2009, this appeal was roundly rejected by the Dutch supreme court in a damning ruling. It looked as if IMS had run out of road. Payment of the debt was overdue. One former Labour cabinet minister said: \u201cI am not sure whether IMS have been under much political direction. It looks like they have just been pissing about for the sake of not very much money.\u201d This prolonged battle has contributed to the historic mistrust between Iran and Britain, which has periodically erupted in hostilities. In November 2011, Iranians stormed the British embassy in Tehran, in protest at the UK\u2019s role in blocking the Iranian nuclear programme. Protesters scaled the gates, broke the locks and entered the compound. Inside, the demonstrators burned the British flag, smashed windows, destroyed paintings, sprayed graffiti and set a car ablaze. After this break-in, the Iranian ambassador to the UK was expelled and the British embassy in Tehran was closed. It was not reopened until 2015, after Britain and other western powers signed the nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions in return for Iran halting its nuclear programme and allowing an intrusive UN inspection regime. By then, potential reformers, such as President Hassan Rouhani, were in the ascendant. * * * It was during this period, in March 2016, as Iran started an era of wary engagement with the west and tensions eased, that Zaghari-Ratcliffe flew to Tehran with her daughter, Gabriella. There seemed no cause for concern. She had made the trip every year since she left Iran in 2007, twice with her husband. She was eager for her ageing parents to spend time with their new grandchild. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had studied English in Tehran before she went to London alone on a scholarship to complete a masters degree. She had met Ratcliffe, then on an accountancy graduate course, at a conference on Palestine. He was an hour late for their first date and when he finally showed up, she laughingly punched his arm. Still, the date couldn\u2019t have gone too badly. As they got to know each other better over the following months, they found that, despite their different backgrounds, they had much in common. They had the same sense of humour, and they had both been brought up in middle-class households where family was everything. Ratcliffe also admired her boldness. \u201cIt was very intrepid of her to come to London,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very genuine and straightforward. She had that wonderful enthusiasm, and a desire to explore a new country with great open eyes.\u201d Three years after they met, he proposed. She posted on her Facebook page: \u201cA big thank you to God and to Richard\u2019s God\u201d. The couple married in 2009 and threw three parties to reflect their different cultures. Ratcliffe had himself been out to Tehran twice to present his credentials as a prospective son-in-law. \u201cShe had two sisters and a brother. And her father, an electrical engineer, was very proud his kids had all gone to university,\u201d Ratcliffe recalled. \u201cIf there was any politics discussed, it was family politics.\u201d As Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her daughter were heading home to the UK on 3 April 2016, she was arrested at the airport, by agents from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), the powerful militia that operates in parallel with the Iranian military. She was taken to a prison in Kervan in the south of Iran and kept in solitary confinement. Her parents were summoned to take their grandchild home with them. For the next 55 days, she was not allowed to speak to her husband on the phone. \u201cWe knew virtually nothing about what happened to her, but I knew she would be tortured by the separation from Gabriella,\u201d Ratcliffe said. Two months after Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s arrest, the authorities described her as a ringleader in a revolt against the Islamic republic and took her to Evin prison in Tehran. In August 2016, following a trial behind closed doors, she was sentenced to five years in prison on charges relating to national security. She was only given access to her lawyer the day before the court session, and the lawyer was given just five minutes to defend her. These same restrictions applied during the subsequent appeals process in Tehran. For the first nine months after she was arrested, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was kept in total isolation. She has since suffered from mood swings, depression, panic attacks and anxieties about her physical health. At times she has been chained to a bed in a psychiatric wing. Her parents visit every week. Until last year, when Gabriella was brought back to the UK, they would bring her to visit her mother. Zaghari-Ratcliffe speaks to her husband by phone three times a week for 10 minutes. All calls are monitored. \u201cThe first calls I just tried to reassure her that we were still here for her, and that I loved her,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing else that matters. She had been fed all sorts of poison \u2013 that I was off with other women.\u201d Last June, Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote a letter marking Gabriella\u2019s fifth birthday. \u201cShe teaches me now that there is a silver lining in every cloud, and that there is a home, a very warm home waiting for us to go to, where Daddy has been waiting for us for over three years. My most beautiful baby girl, you are wise beyond your age, with the most amazing imagination. You see the world in primary colours, you look out for the unicorns. \u201cYour visits and smiles make my world brighter. I know we have been through dark years \u2013 perhaps the darkest of our lives \u2013 but we have had each other. No one can take us apart. No politics, walls, or even prisons.\u201d It was agonising for Zaghari-Ratcliffe to see her daughter so rarely. A few months after Gabriella\u2019s birthday, she wrote to her husband: \u201cMy heart pounds much more than usual every Sunday morning \u2013 when I get to see my Gabriella Gisou in the visiting room of Evin prison, full of excitement. When the door of the visiting room opens, and the prisoners are allowed in, it is my little girl who runs towards me first, calling out my name, rushing to my cuddle. Those brief minutes might be the shortest of cuddles, but without doubt the most beautiful and uplifting cuddles in the whole world. They are my world. \u201cBut then comes the stress \u2013 Sundays slip so soon through my hands, and fade away in the fog of the cell.\u201d * * * Zaghari-Ratcliffe was just one victim of a wave of arrests of as many as 20 dual nationals in Iran that took place during 2015 and 2016 \u2013 academics, businessmen and individuals who could be linked to a foreign NGO were picked up, including Austrians, Canadians, Britons and Chinese-Americans. Ratcliffe believes the IRGC views dual nationals, a concept Iran does not recognise, as unwelcome symbols of reformist attempts to break down barriers between Iran and the world. This strategy is ongoing. In September 2018, an Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, was arrested in Tehran and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In leaked letters published earlier this week in the Times, Moore-Gilbert protested her innocence and warned that her detention is destroying her mental health. The timing of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s arrest, just before a hearing on the Chieftain tank debt issue was due to take place in the London high court, seems significant. Three months earlier, in January 2016, the US had refunded Iran $400m (\u00a3300m) for undelivered military equipment, and this led to the release of four Americans, including the Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. Ratcliffe is convinced the IRGC came to see his wife as another bargaining chip to ensure a debt was paid: \u201cThe guards thought, crudely: \u2018We want to get our money, so we must arrest someone,\u2019\u201d Ratcliffe told me. One former minister says: \u201cThe Iranians are very transactional, and her arrest was viewed as the start of a transaction.\u201d In the weeks after his wife\u2019s arrest, Ratcliffe had been strongly advised by the Foreign Office to say nothing in public, while diplomatic efforts were made to secure her release. But knowing that his wife was being held in solitary confinement, and initially debarred from speaking to her by phone, Ratcliffe took the decision to defy that advice and, in May 2016, went public with an online petition. Over the following months, he found himself trying to run a campaign to keep her in the public eye. As he overcame his natural shyness, the campaign grew into a force calling not just for his wife\u2019s release, but an end to state hostage-taking altogether. Asked if he worries that, on reflection, going public was an error, Ratcliffe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I am in an emotional space where you can have doubts. When it is all over and we are out the other side, there will be a space to reflect, but at the moment we are in the middle of a battle, so we keep going on. Our strategy has worked no worse than anyone else\u2019s. I tell the Foreign Office: \u2018It\u2019s clear there are good reasons why we are doing what we are doing. I want to make my problem your problem.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cThe government\u2019s failure to settle this case is not because they do not care. It is because they do not care enough. There is no lack of sympathy, it is just that sympathy is not going to get us home.\u201d Campaigning for his wife\u2019s release has been a learning process. \u201cI used to work for the National Audit Office, so my biggest previous political act was sometimes to mutter under my breath,\u201d he said. Now, when the politics around the campaign intensifies, he finds the attention hard to deal with. \u201cYou can issue a press release, and six hours later the media will want to know: \u2018What\u2019s the next step?\u2019\u201d In early November 2017, the attention became overpowering when Boris Johnson, as foreign secretary, made a blunder that set back Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s cause. While she has always maintained that her visit to Tehran was purely to see her family, Iran had accused her of running a \u201ca BBC Persian online journalism course which was aimed at recruiting and training people to spread propaganda against Iran\u201d. It is true thatbetween February 2009 and October 2010, Zaghari-Ratcliffe had worked for an online BBC World Service Trust journalist training course. But it was a purely administrative role, booking Iranian and other students on courses. She then left to work for Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news organisation. In the middle of a long foreign affairs select committee session in November 2017, Johnson blurted out to MPs that \u201cshe was simply teaching journalism, as I understand it, at the very limit\u201d. It was intended as a statement in her defence, but it directly contradicted Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s own account. The Iranian judiciary claimed that Johnson\u2019s inadvertent confession proved it had been right about the real reason for her visit. \u201cJohnson\u2019s statement annulled all the claims in the past year made by British media who said that she was only visiting Iran for humanitarian reasons,\u201d declared Iran\u2019s state broadcaster. It took Johnson 10 days to issue a half apology. However, in seeking to protect his personal reputation afterwards, he made matters worse. After stalling for weeks, Johnson finally agreed to hold a meeting at the Foreign Office with Ratcliffe, Ratcliffe\u2019s father and his MP, Tulip Siddiq. On the morning of 15 November 2017, the day their meeting was scheduled, the Sun newspaper\u2019s front page carried an article marked exclusive: \u201cIranian officials present a multimillion shopping list to free Nazanin. The demands include settling a 38-year-old demand for \u00a3400m arising from a Chieftain tank deal.\u201d The Sun story argued that the debt was the true cause of Nazanin\u2019s continued imprisonment, so implying that Johnson\u2019s gaffe was not significant in her plight. Ratcliffe was convinced Johnson had placed the story to make him look better. \u201cAt the meeting, the foreign secretary was quite charming, but refused to apologise for what he had said at the select committee,\u201d Ratcliffe recalled. \u201cNear the end of the meeting, we showed him a copy of the Sun story. Boris said he had never seen the article. At that point, Alistair Burt, the Middle East minister, just left the meeting. I think he was horrified by what Johnson had done and did not want to be party to it.\u201d The following day, the Sun reported that Johnson, with the chancellor Philip Hammond, had \u201cquietly authorised that \u00a3450m be handed over\u201d. The Iranians were sufficiently convinced for their ambassador to London to announce on the messaging service Telegram a day later that \u201cthe debt was to be transferred in the coming days\u201d. So when Johnson went to Tehran a few weeks later, in December 2017, expectations for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release were high. Her fellow prisoners started to ask her how she was going to distribute the few possessions she had with her in prison. She began to make leaving presents, including little makeup bags for each of the prisoners, made from a floral print fabric. She was a great knitter and, since the snows had come to Tehran, a couple of the prisoners asked her if she could knit them an \u201cEnglish\u201d woolly hat before she left. But the snows came and went, and she remained in jail. In retrospect, Ratcliffe says, he believes that Johnson\u2019s aides had briefed Sun journalists about the breakthrough on the debt payment without truly knowing if the relevant government departments, including the MoD, were signed up. On his return from Tehran, Johnson told Ratcliffe he should go quiet for three months or so. Ratcliffe was plunged into despair. * * * The fact that Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate is tied to the ongoing dispute over Britain\u2019s debt to Iran is, by now, hard to deny. The IRGC told Zaghari-Ratcliffe as much during her initial interrogation in 2016. The Iranian deputy prosecutor said the same in May 2018. Again that year, Judge Abbasi, the head of judicial affairs inside Evin prison, was reported as saying to Zaghari-Ratcliffe in court: \u201cEvery time I request to review your case, this is the answer: \u2018The UK has not paid\u2019 and that is why we cannot do anything.\u201d Senior Iranian diplomats in London privately admit there is a link between Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention and the debt, and question why successive British governments have not done more to resolve the issue. Jack Straw now admits he did not do enough to pursue the issue in office. Ratcliffe\u2019s team of lawyers have written at length to cabinet ministers including Johnson and Hammond, urging them to use greater imagination and find a way to pay at least the principal. Their letters mostly go unanswered. One reply from Johnson, in May 2018, stated that there is no connection between the debt and her detention. That, at least, is the government\u2019s line in public. But ministerial sources have confirmed that this has been the subject of heated debate behind closed doors. According to a ministerial source, last year, Foreign Office minister Alastair Burt had a stand-up row with the defence secretary Gavin Williamson about his refusal to find a way to pay the debt. Another former minister said of the handling of the case while Theresa May was prime minister: \u201cHammond was scared stiff he would be sanctioned by the US if he paid. Williamson just thought: \u2018I am not going to fucking help the IRGC.\u2019 May was useless, just a coward, as she was about everything.\u201d Ratcliffe found Jeremy Hunt, who replaced Johnson as foreign secretary in July 2018, empathetic, but he was not been able to succeed where his predecessor failed. In November 2018, Hunt went to Tehran to meet the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and came away empty-handed. At the time of his visit, he said Zarif did not even pretend Zaghari-Ratcliffe was guilty. Her fate, Zarif said, lay with the judiciary, and not his department, but Hunt\u2019s plan to meet the justice minister fell through. In March 2019, Hunt, overruling advice from the Foreign Office, granted Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection. Ratcliffe said: \u201cThere is a Foreign Office instinct about not creating precedents. They worried that the moment Nazanin was given diplomatic protection, then other victims of gross human rights abuses would have a reasonable claim to say that they deserve protection, too.\u201d Another Foreign Office minister, Sir Alan Duncan, although not responsible for the Middle East, became involved in Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case because he knows the Gulf well as a former oil trader. He proposed paying the debt into a new escrow account so Iran could receive the money owed in the form of humanitarian aid. The debt might not then be subject to US sanctions. In his resignation letter, in July 2019, Duncan said he \u201cremained deeply upset that some fruitful discussions I had initiated about the possible release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe were brought to such an abrupt halt\u201d. It is not clear if the premature briefings led to his plan being shelved, but it is now being re-explored by ministers. Meanwhile, in the British courts, IMS has carried on its secretive legal trench war with Iran. At first there was a ban on reporting the case, as is typical in commercial arbitration cases. But in May 2019, after an intervention by Ratcliffe\u2019s lawyers and the Sunday Times, Mr Justice Phillips lifted reporting restrictions, and for the first time it was possible to see the scale of IMS resistance to paying the debt. On one occasion, Iranian officials with visas granted by the Foreign Office arrived in the UK on a mission to enforce the Dutch court order. In spite of their legal status, the Home Office held them in a detention centre for nearly a week. In July 2019, and again in a follow-up hearing on 7 October, the law firm Clifford Chance, representing IMS, scored a legal victory, worth millions of pounds. At a hearing, Mr Justice Phillips declared IMS did not have to pay Modsaf interest on any of the money it had withheld after 2008, the date Modsaf came under EU sanctions. In a briefing afterwards, IMS, apparently savouring its victory, declared that at the next hearing it plans to argue that, because of sanctions, it should not have to pay Modsaf any of the \u00a3379m it owes. At no point during the hearing, or afterwards, was Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s name mentioned. The case rolls on, week after week, month after month. Just this week, Ratcliffe sat listening in court room 70 of the Royal Courts of Justice, as three appeal court judges heard IMS and Modsaf continue their seemingly endless argument as to whether interest is payable on the debt. * * * Ratcliffe, for his part, while trying to follow the legal back-and-forth, is learning to be a father again. In October, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s brother brought Gabriella, now five, to live with her father, but it is a mutual learning process. She speaks little English, and her uncle has to help with translation. After years apart, Ratcliffe is adjusting to having his daughter back at home in Hampstead. \u201cNow there are many cuddles, but at first it was a bit like being a stepdad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to earn your right again to parent, to discipline and be trusted. Gabriella has come over with no control of the situation and there are parts of her wanting to be back in Tehran watching cartoons she can understand. She does not like talking about Mummy being in prison, but she has started to ask why others were being let out of prison and she seems to understand what prison is. She is disoriented and aware that we have made promises we have not been able to keep. \u201cShe has internalised a lot. She notices, for example, if there are any cameras on a bus or a tube. At the moment, she does not dwell on loss or injustice and unfairness. When she is six or seven, she will have a keen sense of right and wrong that she does not have yet.\u201d As for the campaign, Ratcliffe admits it has worn him down. \u201cAt this point it is a bit hard to know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sort of had this idea of a staircase where we escalate every so often, and go up a level. But once you get to a hunger strike on the street, there are not many places you can go from there.\u201d Ratcliffe has had to endure the rising tensions between Iran and the west, knowing that events way beyond his control can render his campaign irrelevant. All the time he is trying to read the shifts in government thinking, picking up fragments from wherever he can. On Thursday, Ratcliffe will be meeting with Johnson for the first time since he became prime minister. He plans to tell Johnson that \u201cdoing nothing is not an option\u201d and wants to know if there is a strategy in place or not. Meanwhile, he is left to worry about his wife\u2019s worsening health. Since the winter of 2017, when hopes for her release came to nothing, Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been deeply depressed. \u201cShe cannot cope. She is trying to be as clear as possible that she cannot cope,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cShe has undertaken four hunger strikes. She is set apart from her daughter. The Foreign Office just needs to be aware that we do not have the luxury of time. Both governments can play this game of poker with one another. We are the ones who are paying the cost, and she cannot pay it for much longer.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Its rain washes around the old, laid trunks of hedge sycamores, its wind blows goldfinch from mullein seedheads under power lines into hazels; its noise silences the thrush who, for some days in his ash tree, has been auditioning an oratory of fragmented phrases repeated in short bursts that will become a heart-stopping song before too long. The moss appears unaffected by the traffic of people, dogs and birds, unaffected by the seasons and the sudden appearance of snowdrops from a recurring dream. Common feather-moss, Kindbergia praelonga, has branching ferny shoots up to 3cm long, with divided leaves that in some woodland forms are bipinnate or tripinnate with triangular-shaped tips so they look like feathers; they can be found in moist, shady places on a variety of surfaces. Little has been known of the chemistry of mosses such as Kindbergia, but research reveals within them a remarkable reservoir of anti-microbial, anti-fungal, cardiotonic, tumour-affecting, allergy-causing, plant-growth-regulating, even possible Aids-therapy chemicals. In a world that hardly recognises the presence of this feathery miracle, away from the lane\u2019s verges in the thick of the wood, Kindbergia spreads across the ground and over stones and logs, climbs up trees, posts, rocks and banks. If I stand here long enough it will creep up from my boots and plume me over in a green quiet like a rotting log. This warmer, wetter climate is a mossy place. Palaeoecological evidence over 9,000 years shows that some kinds of moss can tolerate warmer and drier conditions; however, most of Britain\u2019s mossy bogs, fens and mires are too physically degraded to cope with climate heating. Moss in places of humidity and shelter like this wood is, at the moment, creating a miniature rainforest layer with its own dimensions of space and time, its own inhabitants, re-establishing a beyond-world to cover the one we are familiar with. This winter pall \u2013 a word that comes from the covering of a tomb or shroud for the dead \u2013 holds its own glow in a greenwood of the shadows, an effulgence despite the leafless trees and lightless skies above.",

      "bodyText": "The 2020 Australian Open needs some drama that does not involve sodden red dust falling out of the sky or players choking on polluted air \u2013 and Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka will surely provide it on day five. They light up the women\u2019s game like few of their contemporaries, with both their tennis and personalities, the 15-year-old American oddly more self-contained and clinical than the 22-year-old Japanese player who already has two slam titles. When they meet on Friday, they will command the full attention of the media and spectators rammed into the tournament\u2019s showpiece court, Rod Laver Arena, to see if Gauff can gain revenge for the 6-3, 6-0 drubbing Osaka gave her in the third round of the US Open five months ago \u2013 when Osaka was also the title-holder. That Gauff has now reached at least the third round of the four slams she has entered is remarkable enough for one so young, but she is no novelty act. She showed she has genuine pedigree by putting 39-year-old Venus Williams out in the first round, repeating what she did to her compatriot at Wimbledon in a victory that announced her arrival with a trumpet blast. She got to the fourth round there; as she matures she will go deeper, and there are few respected voices in the game who do not think she will go on to prevail more than once on the final weekend of a major. Although she is playing at a level above her No 68 world ranking, it would be a surprise if she beat Osaka \u2013 certainly an unexpected upset, given the defending champion\u2019s form, although she is still prone to meltdowns, as she conceded after a \u201cchildish\u201d outburst in her quick win over Zheng Saisai on day three.

The coalition of more than 50 peak Aboriginal community organisations told Morrison of the \u201cdeep sorrow that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people right across the nation feel at the scarring of their country and loss of wildlife\u201d. The meeting \u201crecognised the significant role that cultural burning, led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, can play in expertly managing the impacts of bushfires in the future\u201d. Morrison and several senior ministers, including the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, the deputy PM, Michael McCormack, the education minister, Dan Tehan, and the Indigenous Australians minister, Ken Wyatt, attended the meeting. It was the \u201cfirst time in a long time that we\u2019ve been in the cabinet room to talk about the best way forward for our people,\u201d the convener of peak organisations, Pat Turner, said. Turner said Morrison was \u201cgenuine\u201d in his desire to see \u201cAboriginal children grow up with the same opportunities as any other child in Australia\u201d. \u201cIt is really important to maintain this relationship and for him to continue his leadership in it. We are very happy to work with them,\u201d she said. The long-awaited meeting agreed to three \u201cshared priorities\u201d over the next 10 years. Morrison committed $1.5m for a data project to develop regional profiles of Closing the Gap targets to support evidence-based policy and decision-making by Indigenous communities. The \u201cpriority reforms\u201d are to have greater Aboriginal involvement in decision-making and service delivery at a national, regional and local level. There was also a commitment to making sure \u201call mainstream government agencies and institutions undertake systemic and structural transformation to contribute to closing the gap\u201d. \u201cThis is not just business as usual,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThese are important structural reforms so that our sector can be built up, so it can participate. \u201cThe prime minister is listening to those voices and supports the new national agreement being built.\u201d Turner said the meeting was a step closer to a place \u201cwhere decision-making is shared, and the expertise and experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is fully recognised\u201d. The national native title council, which also attended the meeting, said the commitment to self-determination had been the \u201cmissing ingredient\u201d. \u201cThe previous targets saw success in some areas and in other areas we saw little improvement,\u201d its chief executive, Jamie Lowe, said. \u201cHow can you expect policies to improve the lives of communities on the ground to be successful when you don\u2019t know what challenges they\u2019re facing because you haven\u2019t had genuine consultation? \u201cThat\u2019s what this process will overcome. We have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d Morrison\u2019s office said negotiations between all governments on the new national agreement based around the priority reforms would begin as quickly as possible.",

      "bodyText": "Australia is among 21 nations where perceived corruption has worsened \u201csignificantly\u201d over the past eight years, a new report says. Transparency International released its latest corruption perceptions index on Thursday, ranking levels of perceived corruption in governments across the world. Australia scored 77 from a possible 100, the same mark as last year. It means Australia has again failed to reverse a longer-term decline of eight points since 2012. Only 22 countries have managed to significantly improve their scores since 2012, including Greece, Estonia and Guyana. Australia is listed as being among 21 nations that have \u201csignificantly declined\u201d in the same time period. The Transparency International Australia chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, said the \u201ccorrosive\u201d influence of money in politics was continuing to undermine government integrity. \u201cWhat the corruption perceptions index clearly shows is that the murkier the political donations trail is, the more corrupt a country is perceived to be,\u201d Lillywhite told the Guardian. The report comes as the Coalition faces significant pressure over the \u2018\u201csports rorts\u201d affair, which has led to repeated calls for the resignation of the former sport minister Bridget McKenzie. It also follows repeated integrity scandals involving both major parties in the past 12 months, including New South Wales Labor, which came under immense scrutiny for its alleged acceptance of an unlawful $100,000 donation from a Chinese billionaire. The global report ranks Australia as the 12th least corrupt nation in the world, an improvement of one place from last year. The improvement is only because Canada and the United Kingdom declined significantly this year, falling below Australia in perceived corruption levels. Australia is among two-thirds of countries across the world that are either stagnating or showing signs of deterioration in their anti-corruption efforts. Lillywhite said the majority of countries that managed to improve their score in the past eight years have all strengthened rules around campaign financing, donations and grants. \u201cCountries that perform well on the CPI gave stronger campaign finance regulation, and broader political consultation, not just listening to well connected individuals and special interest groups,\u201d she said. The government has faced persistent calls to introduce a strong, well-resourced national integrity commission.

It\u2019s a piss-take. But the performance caught on, especially after rugby union went professional in the 1990s. Cable television and mass media took Ka Mate to the world and the world loved it.</p> <p>In the past three years alone, non-M\u0101ori took \u201chaka\u201d as the name of a <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11851335\">Canadian energy drink</a> brand, James Cameron has said he is keen on including a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/104330712/avatar-maori-academic-believes-space-haka-could-be-cringey-but-not-cultural-appropriation\">space haka</a>\u201d in his Avatar sequels, and the Rock and Jason Momoa \u2013 Polynesians, yes, but non-M\u0101ori \u2013 sometimes perform haka as a <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/109363574/aquaman-and-jason-momoa-whats-with-the-hawaiian-hunk-of-a-hero-who-does-haka\">red-carpet party trick</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to write this off as cultural appropriation \u2013 taking an indigenous cultural item without permission, usually for a personal or commercial gain. And in one sense it certainly is. But in another sense it seems like an unhelpful idea to reach for.</p> <p>\u201cWestern culture\u201d, if it\u2019s possible to confine something spread across millennia and continents in a two-word term, functions best in the spirit of open exchange, critique, imitation and improvement. But cultural appropriation would charge that a \u201cspirit of cultural exchange\u201d is often just a cover for \u201ctheft\u201d.</p> <p>Descriptively that\u2019s obviously true. Not only did empires take indigenous people\u2019s land and labour, but they often took assimilated parts of their cultures and languages too. Taboo, the English word, is a borrowing from the Polynesia \u201ctapu\u201d. Yet the former strips the later of its original force and meaning, reducing it to the status of a \u201cno-no\u201d rather than the world-ordering term and idea tapu is and was.</p> <p>This is why I prefer to think about \u201ctaking\u201d the haka in M\u0101ori terms.

      "bodyText": "I wonder if any of the French lawyers protesting their government\u2019s pension reform with a haka, the M\u0101ori dance form, have ever set foot in New Zealand? For a good number of white people, including white New Zealanders, haka is apparently irresistible. \u201cKa Mate\u201d, the Ng\u0101ti Toa haka the All Blacks perform pre-match, delights global audiences every year. Contemporary teams take it dead seriously, but in the late-19th and early-20th century the mostly white team would turn to the British crowds, slapping their thighs and hanging their tongues out for \u201centertainment\u201d. The earliest footage is excruciating. It\u2019s a piss-take. But the performance caught on, especially after rugby union went professional in the 1990s. Cable television and mass media took Ka Mate to the world and the world loved it. In the past three years alone, non-M\u0101ori took \u201chaka\u201d as the name of a Canadian energy drink brand, James Cameron has said he is keen on including a \u201cspace haka\u201d in his Avatar sequels, and the Rock and Jason Momoa \u2013 Polynesians, yes, but non-M\u0101ori \u2013 sometimes perform haka as a red-carpet party trick. It\u2019s tempting to write this off as cultural appropriation \u2013 taking an indigenous cultural item without permission, usually for a personal or commercial gain. And in one sense it certainly is. But in another sense it seems like an unhelpful idea to reach for. \u201cWestern culture\u201d, if it\u2019s possible to confine something spread across millennia and continents in a two-word term, functions best in the spirit of open exchange, critique, imitation and improvement. But cultural appropriation would charge that a \u201cspirit of cultural exchange\u201d is often just a cover for \u201ctheft\u201d. Descriptively that\u2019s obviously true. Not only did empires take indigenous people\u2019s land and labour, but they often took assimilated parts of their cultures and languages too. Taboo, the English word, is a borrowing from the Polynesia \u201ctapu\u201d. Yet the former strips the later of its original force and meaning, reducing it to the status of a \u201cno-no\u201d rather than the world-ordering term and idea tapu is and was. This is why I prefer to think about \u201ctaking\u201d the haka in M\u0101ori terms. The relevant question is: does the performance, whether in New Zealand or France, retain the original haka\u2019s mana and mauri? The easiest way for a non-M\u0101ori person to understand those two terms is to ask: does the performance maintain the haka\u2019s integrity? In Rotorua, the tourist hotspot in New Zealand\u2019s central North Island, Te Arawa \u2013 the local tribe and perhaps the best haka performers in the country \u2013 share their art and coach their visitors in certain haka. It\u2019s an exchange western tourists would recognise as constituting a very public good. Those same tourists take the haka they learn home. They perform it as best they remember. This, of course, isn\u2019t cultural appropriation because the haka retain their mana and mauri. Why? Because Te Arawa were in control. It was up to their tribe\u2019s experts to pick which haka to teach, what history to share and what the instructions for performing were. In a word, the power was still Te Arawa\u2019s. But that isn\u2019t the case with, say, the French lawyers. In their performance the haka is a protest gimmick, a way to jimmy up attention. I appreciate that \u2013 at least in the sense haka can take form in a protest. But it isn\u2019t, as some Europeans and North Americans seem to understand it, an act of unrestrained id.

Aboriginal music has played an important role in telling our history and experiences since invasion.</p> <p>2020 is significant to First Nations people as it marks the 250-year anniversary of Captain Cook and the Endeavour sailing along the east coast of Australia. When I interviewed the Indigenous activist <a href=\"https://989fm.com.au/podcasts/lets-talk/rodney-kelly-2/\">Rodney Kelly</a> in June, he spoke about how Cook shot Aboriginal warriors and stole their weapons. Cook then went on to plant the British flag in the Torres Straits on Possession Island and declared the whole east coast of Australia a British colony. Eight years later Arthur Phillip landed in Botany Bay with the first fleet on Invasion Day 26 January 1788.</p> <p><a href=\"https://989fm.com.au/podcasts/lets-talk/lets-talk-celeste-liddle/\">Invasion Day</a> means a few different things to me. On my father\u2019s side I am Gamilaraay. The expansion of the colony did not reach Gamilaraay country until the 1830s. From December 1837 to January 1838 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/24/massacres-protest-australia-day-undeniable-history\">Waterloo Creek massacre</a> took place. My people in and around the Moree area, where I\u2019m from, commemorate this massacre each year. This is really significant to me as a Gamilaraay person who lives off country because this is a direct result of the colonial violence we faced.</p> <p>Many significant dates have come since then. In 1938 on 26 January the <a href=\"https://989fm.com.au/podcasts/lets-talk/lets-talk-gary-foley/\">Day of Mourning protest and conference</a> was called in Sydney to mark the 150th anniversary of Australia. That is the first day Aboriginal people organised around Invasion Day to protest. Then the 1988 march was one of the largest gatherings of Aboriginal people in protest in modern Australia. Each milestone of Australia\u2019s invasion, Aboriginal people have been there to say it\u2019s not OK to celebrate these things; there needs to be a new way to discuss the legacy of this continent.</p> <p>Aboriginal music tells this history. <a href=\"https://989fm.com.au/podcasts/lets-talk/lets-talk-dhapanbal-yunupingu/\">Yothu Yindi</a> acknowledges the 1988 protests in the famous song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf-jHCdafZY\">Treaty</a>, and many other Aboriginal artists describe the situation we are in today. Collectively they tell the experience of Aboriginal people over the past 250 years, an experience denied by mainstream society which tries to bury the past and forget the atrocities. In among the whitewashing of history, Aboriginal music has been an anchor for our triumphs and a way to hold on to our experiences.</p> <p>In 2013 and 2014 a bunch of Aboriginal hip-hop artists and poets created a mix tape for Invasion Day. The first was called <a href=\"https://www.datpiff.com/K-OTIC-1-K-otic-1-Presents-Idle-No-More-invasion-Day-The-mixtape.447160.html\">Invasion Day Idle No More</a> and the second was called <a href=\"https://1stnationsmobb.bandcamp.com/album/brisbane-blacks-presents-invasion-day-mixtape-2014\">Brisbane Blacks presents Invasion Day Mix-Tape</a>. These were collaborations of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal artists. The CDs were handed out for free at the Invasion Day protests to young mob. Some artists on the tapes were Ancestress, Felon, MC Triks, Lorna Munro, Darah, and Provocalz. When Triple J changed the date of its Hottest 100 playlist in 2017, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to create a playlist for the day like the mix tapes of the past. 98.9FM decided to use its facilities to create The Original 100. It\u2019s a playlist of First Nations artists \u2013 male, female and queer \u2013 who have a story to tell that reflects our collective history.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting of the impeachment trial continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: That wraps up the second full day of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Catch up on The Guardian\u2019s coverage: Read today\u2019s key takeaways... ...And The Guardian\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s arguments. Review the trial\u2019s peculiar rules. Report: Tomorrow, the Trump administration is expected to finalize a rule to strip away environmental protections for streams, rivers, and wetlands. Under the new regulations, for the first time in decades, landlords and businesses will be allowed to dump pollutants and pesticides directly into bodies of water. Per the New York Times, which broke the story: From Day 1 of his administration, President Trump vowed to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d regulation, which had frustrated rural landowners... \u201cI terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last administration\u2019s disastrous Waters of the United States rule,\u201d Mr. Trump told the American Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s annual convention in Texas on Sunday, to rousing applause. He added, \u201cThat was a rule that basically took your property away from you.\u201d His administration had completed the first step of its demise in September with the rule\u2019s repeal. His replacement on Thursday will complete the process, not only rolling back 2015 rules that guaranteed protections under the 1972 Clean Water Act to certain wetlands and streams that run intermittently or run temporarily underground, but also relieves landowners of the need to seek permits that the Environmental Protection Agency had considered on a case-by-case basis before the Obama rule. Lindsey Graham to Adam Schiff: \u2018Good job\u2019 Reporters spotted an unexpected exchange between Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch defender of Donald Trump, and Congressman Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager advocating for removing the president from office. Graham served as an impeachment manager during Bill Clinton\u2019s trial. Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s reportedly left early because she was feeling under the weather. Feinstein is far from the only senator to bend the rules. The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy and Lauren Gambino report that several lawmakers, \u201cvisibly frustrated at the long hours of the trial, appeared at times to be on the verge of mild mutiny, openly flouting rules requiring them to remain at their desks and instead circulating in a cloakroom off the Senate floor\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham reportedly spent up to 30 minutes away from his seat, and at one point 15 Republican seats and 12 Democratic seats were empty, according to CNN. Lawmakers stood to stretch their legs, or headed into the cloakroom to check their phones. Before the trial ended, Democrats asked for a classified piece of evidence to be made available for Senators to review. Senate leader Mitch McConnell said the trial will resume at 1pm ET tomorrow. He and minority leader Chuck Schumer also thanked the Senate pages on the penultimate day of their term. Senators gave the pages a standing ovation. Winding down today\u2019s arguments, Schiff said the impeachment managers will be back tomorrow to present their first article of impeachment against Donald Trump: abuse of power. The asked senators to consider the risks that Trump administration officials took in testifying in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThey risked everything \u2014 their careers,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIf they could show the courage, so can we,\u201d he told lawmakers. Referring to heavily redacted documents obtained by a FOIA yesterday, Adam Schiff said: \u201cI\u2019m sure if you could read under those redactions, it would be a very perfect email.\u201d The documents, which Schiff held up before the Senate, were released by the White House Office of Management and Budget after the watchdog group American Oversight made a \u201crequest for directives and communications that may relate to any effort to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate one of President Trump\u2019s political opponents as part of an effort to give the president an electoral advantage.\u201d Senate Democrats brought an amendment yesterday to subpoena the OMB, but it was voted down along party lines \u2014 as was every other efffort to subpoena evidence. Schiff once again played a clip of Donald Trump publicly calling for Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. \u201cGive him credit for being so obvious,\u201d Schiff said of the president. This is the second time Schiff has played that clip today, emphasizing that Trump\u2019s own words are part of the case House Democrats have built against Trump. One senator bowed out early: 86-year-old Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has reportedly left the Capitol. Senators are expected to remain for the entirety of arguments, but as the oldest member of the Senate Feinstein may get a pass for seeing herself home an hour the presentations are scheduled to end. It\u2019s unclear the extent to which the hours of presentations. Yesterday, an average of 11m viewers tuned in during afternoon hours, and more than 7.5m watched during prime time, according to Nielsen Media Research. The Washington Post adds context: For further perspective: the first day of the House impeachment hearings in November drew an average of 13.1 million viewers on the six networks. special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s testimony before Congress in July attracted 12.97 million. The big TV winner was Fox News, which led all networks during late afternoon and prime time on Tuesday. Its audience peaked at 3.8 million between 9 and 10 p.m. The relatively strong audience interest belied comments from some Trump supporters that the coverage \u2014 which relied primarily on static cameras controlled by the Senate \u2014 was \u201cboring.\u201d Taking over from Adam Schiff, Zoe Lofgren thanked the senators for their patience. \u201cThis is a lot of information,\u201d she said. Then, the picked up where Adam Schiff left off, reconstructing a timeline of events that lead Congress to open an impeachment inquiry. Lofgren has caught us up till November 2019. If you\u2019re a bit lost, look up The Guardian\u2019s timeline of key events: Referring to ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s notes of his phone call with Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Adam Schiff told senators: \u201cThey\u2019re yours for the asking.\u201d \u201cDemand those notes\u2019 Schiff said. \u201cDemand to see the truth.\u201d He continued: \u201cMaybe those notes say no quid pro quo. Maybe those notes say it\u2019s a perfect call. I\u2019d like to see them.\u201d Schiff reviewed what House investigators do know, and read out text messages between Sondland and Taylor. When Taylor grew worried about why the US was withholding congressionally-approved military assistance to Ukraine, he texted Sondland. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d asked Taylor. \u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland replied. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff once again appealed to senators to call more witnesses \u2014 especially national security adviser John Bolton. \u201cWhat did Bolton know about the freeze in aid?\u201d Schiff asked, rhetorically. \u201cHe\u2019s there for your asking.\u201d Schiff also contested claims by Donald Trump and his allies that Ukraine never felt any pressure to announce an investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re to believe they felt no pressure? Folks, they\u2019re at war, and they\u2019re being told you\u2019re not getting $400m in aid,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat\u2019s $400m of pressure.\u201d A reminder that Gordon Sondland, whose testimony is being heavily featured in Adam Schiff\u2019s presentation, is still the US ambassador to the European Union In a public hearing, Sondland said Trump had conditioned a White House meeting with the Ukranian president on him making an announcement that Ukraine was investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals, including Joe Biden. \u201cWas there a quid pro quo?\u201d Sondland testified. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d The trial has resumed after a brief dinner break. Impeachment manager Adam Schiff said he expects to continue for another two or two and a half hours. He has begun by reviewing events following the July 25 phone call between Donald Trump and Voldodmyr Zelensky, detailing efforts by Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukrainian officials. More than five hours of hearing impeachment managers presenting their case against Donald Trump has not compelled Republican senators to subpoena witnesses and testimony. The impeachment brief \u201csays the information is overwhelming, the facts are overwhelming,\u201d said John Barrasso, a Republican senator from Wyoming. \u201cThen present it and let\u2019s vote.\u201d Speaking to reporters in the basement of the Capitol, Barrasso said there\u2019s no need to consider any new evidence. Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said he would want to hear from one additional witness: Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. \u201cThe need for the senate to hear the testimony of Hunter Biden... has become all the more relevant,\u201d he told reporters. But the same senators who denied the need to subpoena any additional evidence complained that the impeachment managers\u2019 were repeating themselves. Barrasso said he heard \u201cnothing new\u201d presented today. Cruz echoed: \u201cJust a few hours into their opening argument, they\u2019re already repeating the same point for 13 hours yesterday.\u201d Bad news for some peacocks, pigs, hamsters - and cats Thr trial has paused for a 30-minute dinner break. This other news: the Department of Transportation is proposing a ban on emotional support animals on planes, except for dogs. In the pecking order of feathered and furry friends, it seems canines win out for a space in the cabin, rather than being in the hold or left at the gate. Airlines would no longer be required to accommodate travelers who want to fly with emotional support animals such as pigs, cats and rabbits, under new rules proposed by the US DoT today, the Washington Post has just reported. The proposed rules, years in the making, narrow the definition of service animal to dogs that have received individualized training to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability, the Post continues. There is time allocated now for public comments to the government - I\u2019m sure they can expect a cacophony of barking, yowling, howling, squeaking and shrieking, as well as purring from passengers who don\u2019t want a kitty under the seat next to them. This could lead to fewer accounts of unfortunate experiences for individuals such as Pebbles the hamster, Dexter the peacock or Flirty the mini horse, and others. A protestor briefly interrupted the trial Here\u2019s what the senators are up to As impeachment managers carry on, taking turns laying out a detailed case against Donald Trump, the senators are taking notes \u2014 or not. They\u2019re sitting at their desks, they\u2019re pacing, they\u2019re drinking milk and filling crossword puzzles. The rules also say lawmakers should refrain from talking, but reporters at the trial have spotted a few whispered conversations. Another convention, if not an explicit rule, is that senators can\u2019t eat, but can drink water or milk while in the chamber. Senator Tom Cotton seems to be making the most of it (milking it, we could say). Among the senators that seem to be sitting tight are progressive presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. But there appears to be a subtle philosophical difference between the two liberal 2020 competitors. Warren seems to have a system for her notes: Sanders isn\u2019t big into note-taking: As the impeachment managers carry on, presenting their case against Donald Trump, the president has announced all sorts of new plans, policies, and programs that on any other day, may have dominated the news cycle. Speaking with reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump announced that he intends to expand his controversial travel ban. \u201cWe\u2019re adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see what\u2019s going on in the world. Our country has to be safe.\u201d According to the AP, anonymous officials familiar with the matter said seven countries were added to a draft of the proposed restrictions: Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be announced very shortly. Okay?\u201d the president teased. In an interview with CNBC, Trump actively reached for what has long been the third rail of politics, indicating a willingness to revamp Social Security and Medicare. Trump said that entitlement programs are \u201c the easiest of all things\u201d to tackle. The president also revealed plans to speak at an anti-abortion demonstration on Friday, organized by the group March for Life. He will be the first president to attend a March for Life event \u2014 though this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s endorsed the group. He addressed anti-abortion demonstrators via telecast in 2018. Donald Trump put out 132 tweets and retweets as of 4:45 pm ET today, setting a record for the most of any single day since he became president. Most of the messages were retweets from supporters, including Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, the GOP, and senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog as the impeachment trial continues. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: House impeachment managers began presenting their opening arguments, with lead manager Adam Schiff speaking for two and a half hours on the Senate floor. He accused Trump of \u201cabusing the power of his office to seek help from abroad to improve his re-election prospects at home... In other words, to cheat.\u201d The House intelligence committee chairman argued the trial represented a battle for the soul of American democracy. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Democratic senators were not considering leveraging potential testimony from Joe Biden or his son, Hunter, to hear from Trump administration officials, like former national security adviser John Bolton. Biden similarly said he would not participate in a witness swap, arguing that such a move would turn the impeachment trial into \u201csome kind of political theatre\u201d. Trump and his allies expressed wariness about having Bolton testify, citing executive privilege. The DC attorney general has sued Trump\u2019s inaugural committee for alleged misuse of funds at the president\u2019s Washington hotel. Maanvi will have more updates and analysis to come, so stay tuned. Trump is still tweeting away, using his favorite social-media platform to amplify his allies and belittle the Senate impeachment trial as a \u201csham.\u201d Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia has concluded speaking for now, and fellow impeachment manager Jason Crow has taken the Senate floor to continue presenting his side\u2019s opening arguments. Of the seven impeachment managers, Crow is the only one who faces an arguably difficult reelection later this year. The freshman congressman won his race in 2018 by 9 points, defeating Republican incumbent Mike Coffman. Campaigning in Iowa, Joe Biden threw cold water on the possibility of testifying in the Senate trial if Trump administration officials, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, also agreed to do so. \u201cThis is a constitutional issue, and we\u2019re not going to turn it into a farce, into some kind of political theatre,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI want no part of being any part of that.\u201d The presidential candidate added he was focused on defeating Trump at the ballot box. \u201cThe Senate\u2019s job is now to try him,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy job is to beat him.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer similarly said during the last trial recess that the idea of a witness swap was \u201coff the table\u201d. Impeachment manager Jerry Nadler has finished speaking (for now), and he has ceded the Senate floor to another member of the House team, congresswoman Sylvia Garcia. The impeachment managers have been presenting their opening arguments for a collective three hours or so now, leaving them 21 hours to finish making their case. Speaking on the Senate floor, impeachment manager Jerry Nadler incorporated tweets from Trump and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, to argue the president and his allies participated in a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. During the recess, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer spoke to reporters and praised the performance of lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff. Schumer also dismissed the possibility of \u201ctrading\u201d the testimony of Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, for the testimony of John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. \u201cI think it\u2019s off the table,\u201d Schumer said when asked about the potential witness swap. The recess has ended, and impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, has taken the Senate floor to continue presenting his side\u2019s opening arguments. Outrage over Trump downplaying troop injuries While there\u2019s a brief recess in the impeachment trial, we can bring you the development that a leading New York expert in traumatic brain injuries has criticized Donald Trump for downplaying the injuries suffered by US military personnel in Iraq during Iran\u2019s missile attacks on bases where they were stationed earlier this month. Michael Kaplen, chair of the New York State Traumatic Brain Injury Services Coordinating Council and past president of the Brain Injury Association of New York State said that he was \u201cshocked at the ignorant statement\u201d made by Trump at a press conference earlier today discussing traumatic brain injuries. Though Trump initially said no US troops were harmed in the 8 January attack on two Iraqi bases housing them, the Pentagon announced last week that 11 service members had been flown to medical hospitals in Germany and Kuwait to be \u201ctreated for concussion symptoms from the blast\u201d, my Middle East correspondent colleague Michael Safi reports. Asked about the discrepancy on Wednesday, Trump said he learned about the injuries \u201cnumerous days later\u201d. \u201cI heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I would say and I can report it is not very serious,\u201d he told a news conference in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries I have seen.\u201d But Kaplen vigorously disagreed. \u201cTo equate traumatic brain injuries as just a headache is insulting and disrespectful to the thousands of military service members suffering from the signature wound of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflict,\u201d he said. He added that the condition, also known as TBI, is a \u201clife altering\u201d injury. \u201cIt\u2019s physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral consequences affect every aspect of an individual\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cA brain injury is only \u2018mild\u2019 if it is someone else\u2019s brain. There is nothing \u201cmild\u201d about a mild brain injury.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff has concluded his presentation after speaking on the Senate floor for about two and a half hours. Once Schiff stepped away from the podium, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called for a roughly 20-minute recess. Schiff concluded his presentation by quoting the oft-repeated line from Benjamin Franklin. On the final day of the 1787 constitutional convention, Franklin was asked whether America would have a monarchy or a republic. \u201cA republic, if you can keep it,\u201d Franklin replied. It appears Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is ready for lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff to wrap up his presentation. Schiff said several minutes ago that 10 minutes remained in his presentation. \u201cSo the end is in sight,\u201d he added. As lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff neared the end of his two-hour presentation, the House intelligence committee chairman laid out what he believes is at stake in the Senate trial. Schiff pointed to the rise of autocratic leaders around the world to argue that democracy is not \u201cimmutable\u201d and that Americans must fight to defend their system of government. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing immutable about this,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cEvery generation has to fight for it. We\u2019re fighting for it right now. There\u2019s no guarantee that this democracy that has served us so well will continue to prosper.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff has been speaking on the Senate floor for more than two hours, and the congressman just said he still has 10 minutes to go, at which point the Senate will likely call a brief recess. Schiff said each of the other House impeachment managers -- Jerry Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia Garcia -- would present part of the team\u2019s opening arguments. The president, who is traveling back to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, appears to be watching the Senate impeachment trial from Air Force One. Trump told CNBC earlier today that he managed to watch some of the proceedings yesterday. \u201cI had a busy day yesterday, as you know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I did get to see some of it. It\u2019s a hoax. It\u2019s a total hoax.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff made clear that Americans should not \u201cget over\u201d how the Trump administration allowed political calculations to affect foreign policy, as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney argued in October. The latest clip that lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff played on the Senate floor included Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, acknowledging a quid pro quo in connection to the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance. \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney said in October. \u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that,\u201d Mulvaney continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d Asked about the concern that political calculations were affecting foreign policy, Mulvaney told White House reporters, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy \u2026 I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff is still speaking on the Senate floor, delivering his team\u2019s opening arguments for why Trump should be removed from office. The California Democrat argued Trump\u2019s misconduct stretched far beyond his July call to the Ukrainian president to include his efforts before and after the call to push for investigations into his political enemies. As opening arguments continue, congressional reporters have raised additional concerns about the press restrictions imposed during the impeachment trial. Reporters on Capitol Hill are generally allowed relatively free rein, giving them many opportunities to pose questions to lawmakers in hallways, but the restrictions have made that more difficult. Like yesterday, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff is playing clips of Trump that he says proves the president\u2019s abuse of power. One of the clips that Schiff just played was this interview Trump gave on the White House lawn in October: \u201cIf they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said at the time, when asked what he wanted the Ukrainian president to do. \u201cI would say President Zelenskiy, if it was me, I would start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Inside the Senate chamber, congressional reporters said senators looked visibly exhausted as they heard the House impeachment managers present their opening arguments. Yesterday\u2019s debate over the impeachment trial rules stretched past 2 a.m. ET, and senators were back on Capitol Hill this morning. As the House impeachment managers present their opening arguments, the White House appears to be pushing back against the allegations in real time, sending out email blasts defending Trump. Even though Senate Democrats\u2019 multiple efforts to force new witness testimony failed yesterday, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff used the beginning of his team\u2019s opening arguments to emphasize the need to hear from administration officials. \u201cYou will hear their testimony at the same time as the American people \u2014 that is, if you allow it,\u201d Schiff said. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has pushed for subpoenas of four Trump administration officials: acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; former national security adviser John Bolton; Robert Blair, a senior adviser to Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security at the office of management and budget. Shortly before taking the Senate floor, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff dismissed a report that some Democratic senators have weighed leveraging the testimony of Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, in order to hear from John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like some fantasy football trade,\u201d Schiff said just before the impeachment trial resumed. \u201cTrials aren\u2019t trades for witnesses.\u201d Campaigning in Iowa, Joe Biden also denied that Senate Democrats were considering such a proposal. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d the presidential candidate said when asked about the report. But one of the Washington Post reporters who spoke to Democratic officials about the proposal insisted the denials simply showed how sensitive the discussions were: Echoing his earlier comments, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff argued Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine and House investigators prove the president believes he is \u201cabove the law.\u201d The House intelligence committee chairman applauded the administration officials who testified during the public impeachment hearings, but he insisted other officials -- including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney -- should be asked to testify for the Senate trial. Schiff argued the documents that Trump was \u201cunable to suppress\u201d clearly \u201cexpose the president\u2019s scheme in detail.\u201d The House impeachment managers now presenting their opening arguments will have 24 hours, spread over three days, to make their case, but it\u2019s unclear whether they will use the full 24 hours. The focus will then shift to Trump\u2019s legal team, who will also get 24 hours to present their opening arguments. The president\u2019s lawyers have so far kept mum on how much of their 24 hours they intend to use. Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, began his team\u2019s opening arguments by thanking Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts for his handling of the trial yesterday. As yesterday\u2019s proceedings concluded, Roberts admonished both sides for engaging in attacks against each other. \u201cThose addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\u201d Roberts said. Schiff then moved on to his team\u2019s arguments, starting with a reading of an Alexander Hamilton quote that warned of \u201ca man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune.\u201d Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has assumed his post, and Trump\u2019s impeachment trial has officially resumed. House impeachment managers will soon begin presenting their opening arguments for why the president should be removed from office. The trial rules allows each side 24 hours, spread over three days, to present its opening arguments, but it\u2019s unclear whether the managers will use the whole time. As the House impeachment managers explained their plans for presenting their opening argument today, three Republican senators held a dueling press conference to defend Trump. Lindsey Graham, one of the president\u2019s closest Senate allies, said House Democrats are \u201con a crusade to destroy\u201d Trump and accused reporters of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in his impeachment. \u201cTo my Democratic colleagues, you can say what you want about me, but I\u2019m covering up nothing,\u201d Graham said. Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, told reporters on Capitol Hill that his team would present \u201ca factual chronology\u201d of the events surrounding Trump\u2019s impeachment. The California Democrat also dismissed a suggestion that John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, could be called in to testify in exchange for calling Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, to Capitol Hill. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like some fantasy football trade,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cTrials aren\u2019t trades for witnesses.\u201d He concluded by offering a somber note about the managers presenting their case for Trump\u2019s removal to the American public. \u201cWe\u2019re trying this case to two juries: the Senate and the American people,\u201d Schiff said. The House impeachment managers will start presenting their opening arguments in favor of Trump\u2019s removal from office in about a half an hour. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused his Republican colleagues of trying to prevent a fair trial from taking place, saying the president\u2019s legal team appeared \u201cunprepared, confused and unconvincing\u201d yesterday. Early this morning, Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts, who is overseeing the trial, admonished both sides for their attacks on each other. \u201cThose addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\u201d Roberts said. The DC attorney general sued Trump\u2019s inaugural committee for alleged misuse of funds at the president\u2019s Washington hotel. The blog will be providing updates and analysis once the trial resumes, so stay tuned. Speaking to reporters in Davos this morning, Trump expressed some wariness about having his former national security adviser, John Bolton, testify during the Senate impeachment trial. Bolton has said he would testify in the trial if he were subpoenaed by the Senate, which has become a pressing debate among the chamber\u2019s members. Trump said he would prefer to have Bolton and others testify but then added, \u201cThe problem with John is that it\u2019s a national security problem. ... He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it\u2019s not very positive and I have to deal on behalf of the country?\u201d The president also noted he and Bolton did not part on \u201cthe best of terms.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t like people testifying when they didn\u2019t leave on good terms,\u201d Trump said. The president\u2019s allies now seem to be echoing that argument. Congressman Mark Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s impeachment advisers, told CNN today, \u201cWhen we start to look at it, the executive privilege aspect of that, I don\u2019t know if John Bolton has anything to add.\u201d The Democratic presidential candidates who are required to stay in Washington this week to participate in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial -- senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- are finding creative ways to keep their Iowa campaigns going. In addition to Klobuchar\u2019s tele-town hall, the candidates have deployed high-profile surrogates across the first caucus state to campaign for them. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is meeting with voters in support of Sanders, and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro is campaigning for Warren. But the candidates who are not required to be in Washington are making the most of their opponents\u2019 absence. Joe Biden is in Iowa today and just announced he will be holding more events there over the weekend. Chief justice John Roberts, who is overseeing the Senate impeachment trial and was on Capitol Hill past midnight for the rules debate, was back at the Supreme Court early this morning to hear oral arguments in a case regarding the separation of church and state. The case, Espinoza v Montana Department of Revenue, centers on the constitutionality of a tax-credit program in Montana, which distributes scholarships that can be used at religious schools. Over in Davos, Donald Trump courted controversy this morning when he reacted to reports that more service members at US bases hit by Iranian rockets have suffered concussion-related injuries by saying the troops \u201chad headaches and a couple of other things\u201d which he deemed \u201cnot very serious\u201d. The strikes on bases in Iraq were carried out by Tehran in retaliation for the US assassination by drone of Gen Qassem Suleimani. Trump initially responded by saying no US troops had been hurt. But 11 US service members were flown out of Iraq in mid-January for examination of concussion-like symptoms, and about 10 more have followed in recent days. \u201cI heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious,\u201d Trump told reporters in Switzerland. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019ve seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our troops. I\u2019ve seen people with no legs and with no arms. I\u2019ve seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, that war. \u201cNo, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no.\u201d According to the Associated Press, most of the troops flown out of Iraq are \u201cbeing treated for symptoms related to possible traumatic brain injury (TBI). A smaller number may have been suffering from psychological trauma, according to two defence officials who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity. The exact nature and severity of the apparent brain injuries has not been publicly released. The question of American casualties was especially significant \u2026 because Trump cited the fact that no Americans were killed or inured as driving his decision not to retaliate further and risk a broader war with Iran. \u2026Trump told reporters he was informed of the concussion issue \u2018numerous days\u2019 after the attack. Trump\u2019s dismissal of concussion-related injuries does not match official views. CNN reports that the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs \u201cannounced last year \u2026 [funding of] up to $50m for new research on concussions. \u201c\u2018VA and DOD share an urgent, ongoing commitment to better understand the long-term impact of TBI,\u2019 Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie said at the time.\u201d Famously, Trump avoided the draft for Vietnam through four academic deferments and one for bone spurs in his foot. In congressional testimony in 2019, former fixer Michael Cohen said Trump told him he made up the problem, because: \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d Chuck Schumer, the senate minority leader, said Donald Trump\u2019s defense team appeared \u201cunprepared, confused and unconvincing\u201d during the first day of debate at the president\u2019s impeachment trial on Tuesday. At a press conference on Capitol Hill, before House impeachment managers were set to make their case in the Senate trial, Schumer assailed Republicans for rejecting the Democrats\u2019 proposals to subpoena witnesses and documents. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we learned on the floor it\u2019s that Leader McConnell and senate Republicans don\u2019t want a fair trial,\u201d Schumer said, adding: \u201cThe impeachment trial of president Trump begins a cloud hanging over it.\u201d That all but one Republican voted against the amendments offered by Democrats \u201crevealed the charade\u201d that they intended to seriously consider calling witnesses at a later stage in the trial, as provided for in a resolution setting the ground rules for the trial, which was approved by the Senate on a party line vote in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Schumer added that the last-minute changes to the that proposal, which McConnell made to accommodate moderates who were uncomfortable with the restrictions placed on the trial, showed that \u201cRepublicans can make this trial more fair if they want to.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a question of conscience,\u201d he said. The DC attorney general has reportedly sued Trump\u2019s inaugural committee for its spending at the president\u2019s Washington hotel. The Washington Post reports: D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine sued President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and business Wednesday, alleging that the committee violated its nonprofit status by spending more than $1 million to book a ballroom at Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel that its staff knew was overpriced and that it barely used. During the lead-up to Trump\u2019s January 2017 inauguration, the committee booked the hotel ballroom for $175,000 a day, plus more than $300,000 in food and beverage costs, over the objections of its own event planner. The committee was formed to organize the events around the inauguration, but Racine alleges it instead \u2018abandoned this purpose and violated District law when it wasted approximately $1 million of charitable funds in overpayment for the use of event space at the Trump hotel.\u2019 A new national poll found Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden essentially tied for first, representing a significant spike for the Vermont senator with less than two weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses. According to the CNN poll, Sanders has the support of 27% of Democratic primary voters, compared to Biden\u2019s 24%. This marks the first time Biden has not held a solo lead in the outlet\u2019s polling. Biden held a small lead in two Iowa polls released in recent days, but the national trend line in Sanders\u2019 favor will likely cause anxiety in the former vice president\u2019s camp. Speaking to reporters in Davos, Trump mocked Lev Parnas, the former associate of Rudy Giuliani who claimed the president was fully aware of his personal lawyer\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate Joe Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s a con man,\u201d Trump replied when asked about Parnas. \u201cI don\u2019t know him, other than he\u2019s sort of like a groupie.\u201d Trump similarly denied knowing Parnas last week, but the former Giuliani associate said the president was \u201clying.\u201d \u201cI welcome him to say that even more. Every time he says that I\u2019ll show him another picture,\u201d Parnas told CNN on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s lying.\u201d Lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff is coming under fire for reportedly mischaracterizing a text message from Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani. Politico reports: The issue arose when Schiff (D-Calif.) sent a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) last week summarizing a trove of evidence from Lev Parnas, an indicted former associate of Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. In one section of the letter, Schiff claims that Parnas \u2018continued to try to arrange a meeting with President Zelensky,\u2019 citing a specific text message exchange where Parnas tells Giuliani: \u2018trying to get us mr Z.\u2019 The remainder of the exchange \u2014 which was attached to Schiff\u2019s letter \u2014 was redacted. But an unredacted version of the exchange shows that several days later, Parnas sent Giuliani a word document that appears to show notes from an interview with Mykola Zlochevsky, the founder of Burisma, followed by a text message to Giuliani that states: \u2018mr Z answers my brother.\u2019 That suggests Parnas was referring to Zlochevsky not Zelensky. The apparent error will likely fuel Republican accusations that Democrats rushed to impeach Trump based on questionable evidence. The president himself tried to draw attention to the story in a morning tweet: Good morning, live blog readers! It\u2019s an important day in the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump, as House impeachment managers and the president\u2019s legal team present their opening arguments for whether he should be removed from office. But both sides started the day off with a scolding from the chief justice of the Supreme Court. John Roberts, who is overseeing the trial, advised the managers and the president\u2019s lawyers to remember they are presenting before \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\u201d \u201cThose addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\u201d Roberts said. The admonishment came after impeachment manager Jerry Nadler and White House counsel Pat Cipollone engaged in a tense back-and-forth, during which Nadler accused Republicans of participating in a cover-up and Cipollone responded by saying the congressman \u201cshould be embarrassed.\u201d As the trial advances toward 24 hours of opening arguments from each side, there is some skepticism that Roberts\u2019 \u201cplay nice\u201d message will have much of an impact. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on: Trump is returning to Washington from Davos. With 12 days to go until the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang and John Delaney are campaigning in the Hawkeye State. The winter meeting of the US conference of mayors will be held in Washington. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

The clips made for something of a greatest hits reel: the ambassador Gordon Sondland asking \u201cwas there a quid pro quo?\u201d and saying \u201cthe answer is yes\u201d; the diplomat David Holmes quoting Sondland saying Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give an expletive about Ukraine\u201d; the former national security official Fiona Hill saying Sondland \u201cwas being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security policy, and those two things had diverged\u201d; the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, saying at a news conference that politics was baked into Trump administration foreign policy and the country should \u201cget over it\u201d. No visible shift in battle lines One of the main points of contention going into the Senate trial \u2013 whether a small number of Republicans would call for witnesses and documents \u2013 had not changed: no Republican had revealed an intention to do so. Trump appeared to be skating toward acquittal, and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Trump\u2019s legal team were scrambling to wrap up the trial as quickly as possible. At this rate, it seemed, Trump could get his wish of acquittal before his State of the Union address on 4 February.",

      "bodyText": "Africa\u2019s richest woman, Angola\u2019s Isabel dos Santos, has been named as a formal suspect in a criminal investigation, the country\u2019s attorney general is reported to have announced. Dos Santos amassed a fortune estimated at $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) while her father, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, was president of Angola. She is battling allegations of corruption and nepotism following the publication of Luanda Leaks, an investigation by the Guardian and other media led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. She denies all wrongdoing. The allegations against Dos Santos relate to suspected maladministration and misappropriation of funds during her 18-month term as chair of the nation\u2019s state oil company, Sonangol, according to reports of a press conference given by the attorney general, Held\u00e9r Pitta Gr\u00f3s, in Luanda. \u201cIsabel dos Santos is accused of mismanagement and embezzlement of funds during her tenure at Sonangol,\u201d he told a news conference Wednesday evening. The Angolan authorities will now conduct a criminal investigation to determine whether she should be charged with these crimes. Angola is the second-largest oil-producing nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its state oil company is central to the economy, accounting for some 90% of exports. Alongside Dos Santos, Pitta Gr\u00f3s named a number of her associates as suspects. According to the Portuguese news agency Lusa, they are: Sarju Raikundalia, the former chief financial officer of Sonangol; M\u00e1rio Leite da Silva, the chairman of the board of directors of Banco de Fomento Angola (BFA); Paula Oliveira, a friend of Isabel dos Santos; A director of Eurobic, a bank in which the former president\u2019s daughter is the largest shareholder, was the fourth suspect named. All of those named are currently outside Angola, the attorney general said, and will be notified of their status as defendants. \u201cAt the moment, the concern is to notify and have them come to justice voluntarily,\u201d Pitta Gr\u00f3s is reported to have told the press conference, adding that if this goal was not achieved, his office would resort to other legal instruments, including issuing international arrest warrants. Dos Santos responded to an email about the allegations, but made no comment on them. Raikundalia issued his first comments about the case in response to the announcement. \u201cIn the evening of 22nd January, I read some press releases, stating that I\u2019m a suspect in a criminal inquiry by Angolan government prosecutors. I would like to draw your attention that I have not been formally notified of such action,\u201d he said in an email to the Guardian. He said he had previously written to the attorney general to express his willingness to provide any information required by Angolan prosecutors. By the time of publication, Dos Santos, Oliveira and Leite da Silva had not responded to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Portugal\u2019s public prosecutor\u2019s office told Reuters that Pitta Gr\u00f3s and Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Lucilia Gago, would meet in Lisbon Thursday. It is not known what they plan to discuss. The Luanda Leaks exposed numerous schemes apparently used by Dos Santos and her husband to obtain Angolan state funds during her father\u2019s presidency. The privately owned Portuguese bank Eurobic has announced that Dos Santos will be quitting as its largest shareholder after earlier saying it had barred her and her family as customers. In a statement on Wednesday, the Lisbon bank said Dos Santos had decided to exit its share register. She holds 42.5% of the stock. The bank said the sale process was already under way, and she was expected to find a buyer \u201cin a very short period\u201d due to the existence of interested parties. In a statement responding to the Luanda Leaks, Dos Santos and her husband said they owed their success to hard work and business acumen. She has accused Angola\u2019s current president of pursuing a \u201cpolitically motivated witch-hunt\u201d against her and her family.",

      "bodyText": "At first glance you\u2019ll probably think they\u2019re real. But a series of eye-catching, official-looking signs that have sprung up around Sydney are in fact works of satire. Produced by an artist and a therapist duo who call themselves Wowser Nation, the works are taking aim at Australia\u2019s creeping nanny state. And they\u2019ve started with the city they believe to be at the forefront of the creep \u2013 Sydney \u2013 even as the New South Wales government repeals the majority of its draconian lockout laws. \u201cWe take existing rules and regulations and turn up the volume just a bit,\u201d sculptor Clary Akon explains when we meet in one of the rare Sydney coffee shops that stays open till 10pm. \u201cIt\u2019s very telling that people are even partially convinced they\u2019re real.\u201d Photoshopped artworks include a warning that \u201cthis area is patrolled by FUN POLICE \u2013 protecting Sydney\u2019s citizens from themselves\u201d in the official police colours and font. Another threatens a $550 fine if you flirt, laugh out loud, dance or \u201cuse long words confusing to security\u201d. The hypothesis that they would pass for real was first tested in 2016, with a sign in Bondi threatening fines unless all joggers wore helmets, and an instruction to \u201clog your jog\u201d. The Daily Mail wasn\u2019t sure how to take it, reporting \u201cmass confusion\u201d and quoting one person saying \u201c\u2018Sydney\u2019s gone TOO FAR this time\u201d. Another said a licence was a \u201cgood idea \u2013 need to weed out the irresponsible joggers who ruin it for everyone else\u201d. For the satirical artists, who saw social media posts of people actually trying to log their jogs on the fake website, something clicked. \u201cWe realised this was a powerful way of drawing attention to an insidious process many people weren\u2019t aware of: that their lives were becoming more and more restricted,\u201d co-founder Francis Merson says, comparing the situation to the frog that jumps out of boiling water but boils to death if warmed slowly. \u201cWe wanted something to happen before the water boiled and it was too late. We were desperate to provoke at least some kind of response, for people to realise, \u2018Fuck, this isn\u2019t us. This isn\u2019t Sydney.\u2019\u201d Over the last three years, they embarked on their guerrilla artist campaign. Merson designs the signs and Akon sneaks around putting them up at Town Hall, Coogee, Bondi, Bronte, Newtown and Marrickville. In an ironic twist, Akon dons the uniform of authority to evade suspicion: a high vis and helmet. Their work satirising Australia\u2019s property obsession \u2013 in which they placed \u201cSOLD!!!

MO $$$ BITCHAZ\u201d notices across property signs \u2013 has been accused of being \u201cvandalism\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d but, Akon says, \u201c[Australia] needs to be shamed, to be held up as an international laughing stock\u201d. In response to Wowser Nation\u2019s \u201cHey, Tosser\u201d signage \u2013 satirising the glee with which people enjoy shaming others for misdemeanours such as littering \u2013 Ireland\u2019s biggest independent radio station tweeted one of the artworks: The guerrilla tactics combine two very Australian and very opposing themes: the officiousness of wowserism and the mischievousness of larrikinism. \u201cFrancis and I were going out in the 90s when Sydney was still fun, laid-back, breezy,\u201d Akon says. \u201cNow it\u2019s tense and rule-bound \u2026 And if there\u2019s no spontaneity in society you can\u2019t really have creativity.\u201d The worse Sydney gets, he says, the more inspired he becomes.

The man in his 30s was admitted to the special pathogens unit in a hospital in Everett, Washington, on Monday. The US citizen had recently returned from a trip to central China and had been diagnosed in Seattle. Dr George Diaz, the section chief of infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, told the Guardian the patient was in a \u201csatisfactory condition\u201d on Wednesday. He did not give an update on how long the patient would remain in the unit. Diaz said he had sat outside a window of the patient\u2019s 20ft x 20ft room to operate the robot, which was equipped with a camera, microphone and stethoscope. It is one of many ways the hospital has worked to reduce risk of the virus spreading. Diaz said the patient was picked up from his home and taken to the hospital by ambulance. He was brought to the isolation unit in an Isopod \u2013 a closed gurney \u2013 and then allowed to move around inside his room once it was secured.

      "body": "<p>He fought. Oh, how he fought. But Mitch McConnell\u2019s battle with drowsy eyelids was a lost cause. The 77-year-old senator\u2019s head bobbed and drooped. An alarmed aide sat at his side, powerless, as McConnell surrendered to the arms of Morpheus.</p> <p>It was 1.40pm on Wednesday and the House impeachment manager Adam Schiff was in full flow, prosecuting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment\">case</a> against Donald Trump. Over nearly two and a half hours, McConnell would not be the only Republican senator to nod off, yawn, rub their eyes or bolt the chamber.</p> <p>According <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/trump-impeachment-house-managers-oral-arguments-senate-trial\">to Schiff</a>, the house was on fire, the republic was in jeopardy and democracy itself was threatened by \u201ca president who would be king\u201d. Yet the response on one side of the aisle was insouciance and somnolence<strong>. </strong>Was it mere fatigue, after Tuesday\u2019s marathon that had run until nearly 2am? Or was it sheer boredom on the part of jurors who have already cleared the accused in their minds and are now just going through the motions?</p> <p>The session had begun with pointed comments by the Senate chaplain, Barry Black, in a prayer for the senators. \u201cHelp them remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle, that words have consequences and that how something is said can be as important as what is said,\u201d said Black, sporting a bow tie. \u201cGive them a civility built upon integrity that brings consistency in their beliefs and actions.\u201d</p> <p>Then Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee, stepped up to the podium to lead opening arguments. Reading from typed A4 sheets in a ring binder, he delivered a tour de force that was both epic and intimate, historically sweeping yet highly specific, offering a view from both 30,000 feet and the microscope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-day-one\">As Trump goes on trial, so does the conscience of the Republican party</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schiff began by quoting from the founding father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/30/alexander-hamilton-founding-father-musical-lin-manuel-miranda\">Alexander Hamilton</a> in a 1792 letter to George Washington that refers to \u201ca man unprincipled in private life\u201d and \u201cbold in his temper\u201d who is \u201cknown to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty\u201d and is \u201cseen to mount the hobby horse of popularity\u201d with an intention to \u201cride the storm and direct the whirlwind\u201d.</p> <p>History rhymes. The California congressman acknowledged the founders\u2019 flaws but also their genius and prescience, though as the years passed, he noted, it became harder to imagine them as human beings. \u201cThis is no less true of Alexander Hamilton, notwithstanding his own return to celebrity.\u201d</p> <p>It was a nod to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hamilton\">Hamilton, the unlikely Broadway musical</a> hit about the former treasury secretary. (The world now awaits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/10/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton-is-an-insane-idea-london-trump\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>\u2019s sequel, a rap musical about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a>\u2019s adventures in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.)</p> <p>Schiff set out a case painfully familiar to those who have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/democrats-trump-impeachment-trial-rules\">following the matter</a> (which is by no means everyone). Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into two discredited allegations that would benefit Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a> presidential election campaign, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Ukrainian president did not immediately agree, Trump withheld two official acts to induce the Ukrainian leader to comply \u2013 a head of state meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>. It was a corrupt scheme to secure foreign help with his re-election \u2013 in other words, to cheat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e4b38213cc68735a039a367ca71a8c12d5bdce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4b38213cc68735a039a367ca71a8c12d5bdce1/0_0_4000_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Representative Adam Schiff presents an argument in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Representative Adam Schiff presents an argument in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dana Verkouteren/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carefully and cleverly, Schiff portrayed a web that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a> has at its centre. In his version, the infamous Ukraine phone call was not separate and distinct from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">Trump-Russia investigation</a> but all of a piece.</p> <p>\u201cThe military aid we provide Ukraine helps to protect and advance American national security interests in the region and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica has an abiding interest in stemming Russian expansionism.\u201d</p> <p>The Senate was shown, on video screens, clips including Trump the candidate urging Russia to find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2019s hacked emails and the former White House expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/21/fiona-hill-testimony-trump-impeachment-hearing\">Fiona Hill warning</a> against the repetition of Russia propaganda talking points about a Ukrainian computer server \u2013 her accent from the English town of Bishop Auckland resounding in the chamber.</p> <p>Another clip was of Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine-quid-pro-quo\">declaring</a>: \u201cI have news for everybody. Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d</p> <p>Schiff commented: \u201cShould we just \u2018get over it\u2019? Is that what we\u2019ve come to? I hope and pray the answer is no.\u201d Unless Trump was held accountable and removed from office, he warned, the next president mighty simply say: \u201cJust get over it. I\u2019m just doing what Donald Trump did. Just get over it.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, Schiff made a masterly plea for the soul of the nation. He entreated senators to put the constitution before party and warned that every generation had to fight anew for democracy and freedom. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our own hand.\u201d</p> <p>Watching from afar, David Axelrod, former strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cDevastating, epic presentation by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff\">@RepAdamSchiff</a> to open trial. Will it matter?\u201d</p> <p>He might as well have asked if facts matter. Think of Schiff as Clarence Darrow, a legal maestro who, at the \u201cScopes monkey trial\u201d in 1925, challenged a Tennessee state law that banned the teaching of evolution. He was opposed by a defender of biblical creationism. He lost.</p> <p>Nearly a century later, the Republican defence appears to be based on blind faith in Trump and the verdict on his conduct is preordained. As Schiff went on, McConnell, the Senate majority leader, nodded off a few times. The aide at his side wondered what to do while remaining tactful, eventually summoning a younger staffer to place a glass of water on McConnell\u2019s desk, thereby making him stir.</p> <p>Fellow Republicans dozed, slumped, rubbed their eyes or stretched their legs. </p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/richard-nixon\">Richard Nixon</a> resigned before he could be impeached, his successor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/27/guardianobituaries.usa\">Gerald Ford</a> declared \u201cour long national nightmare is over\u201d. This time, the party refuses to wake up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "He fought. Oh, how he fought. But Mitch McConnell\u2019s battle with drowsy eyelids was a lost cause. The 77-year-old senator\u2019s head bobbed and drooped. An alarmed aide sat at his side, powerless, as McConnell surrendered to the arms of Morpheus. It was 1.40pm on Wednesday and the House impeachment manager Adam Schiff was in full flow, prosecuting the case against Donald Trump. Over nearly two and a half hours, McConnell would not be the only Republican senator to nod off, yawn, rub their eyes or bolt the chamber. According to Schiff, the house was on fire, the republic was in jeopardy and democracy itself was threatened by \u201ca president who would be king\u201d. Yet the response on one side of the aisle was insouciance and somnolence. Was it mere fatigue, after Tuesday\u2019s marathon that had run until nearly 2am? Or was it sheer boredom on the part of jurors who have already cleared the accused in their minds and are now just going through the motions? The session had begun with pointed comments by the Senate chaplain, Barry Black, in a prayer for the senators. \u201cHelp them remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle, that words have consequences and that how something is said can be as important as what is said,\u201d said Black, sporting a bow tie. \u201cGive them a civility built upon integrity that brings consistency in their beliefs and actions.\u201d Then Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee, stepped up to the podium to lead opening arguments. Reading from typed A4 sheets in a ring binder, he delivered a tour de force that was both epic and intimate, historically sweeping yet highly specific, offering a view from both 30,000 feet and the microscope. Schiff began by quoting from the founding father Alexander Hamilton in a 1792 letter to George Washington that refers to \u201ca man unprincipled in private life\u201d and \u201cbold in his temper\u201d who is \u201cknown to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty\u201d and is \u201cseen to mount the hobby horse of popularity\u201d with an intention to \u201cride the storm and direct the whirlwind\u201d. History rhymes. The California congressman acknowledged the founders\u2019 flaws but also their genius and prescience, though as the years passed, he noted, it became harder to imagine them as human beings. \u201cThis is no less true of Alexander Hamilton, notwithstanding his own return to celebrity.\u201d It was a nod to Hamilton, the unlikely Broadway musical hit about the former treasury secretary. (The world now awaits Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s sequel, a rap musical about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s adventures in Ukraine.) Schiff set out a case painfully familiar to those who have been following the matter (which is by no means everyone). Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into two discredited allegations that would benefit Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential election campaign, he said. \u201cWhen the Ukrainian president did not immediately agree, Trump withheld two official acts to induce the Ukrainian leader to comply \u2013 a head of state meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with Russia. It was a corrupt scheme to secure foreign help with his re-election \u2013 in other words, to cheat.\u201d Carefully and cleverly, Schiff portrayed a web that has Vladimir Putin has at its centre. In his version, the infamous Ukraine phone call was not separate and distinct from the Trump-Russia investigation but all of a piece. \u201cThe military aid we provide Ukraine helps to protect and advance American national security interests in the region and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica has an abiding interest in stemming Russian expansionism.\u201d The Senate was shown, on video screens, clips including Trump the candidate urging Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails and the former White House expert Fiona Hill warning against the repetition of Russia propaganda talking points about a Ukrainian computer server \u2013 her accent from the English town of Bishop Auckland resounding in the chamber. Another clip was of Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, declaring: \u201cI have news for everybody. Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d Schiff commented: \u201cShould we just \u2018get over it\u2019? Is that what we\u2019ve come to? I hope and pray the answer is no.\u201d Unless Trump was held accountable and removed from office, he warned, the next president mighty simply say: \u201cJust get over it. I\u2019m just doing what Donald Trump did. Just get over it.\u201d Above all, Schiff made a masterly plea for the soul of the nation. He entreated senators to put the constitution before party and warned that every generation had to fight anew for democracy and freedom. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our own hand.\u201d Watching from afar, David Axelrod, former strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cDevastating, epic presentation by @RepAdamSchiff to open trial. Will it matter?\u201d He might as well have asked if facts matter. Think of Schiff as Clarence Darrow, a legal maestro who, at the \u201cScopes monkey trial\u201d in 1925, challenged a Tennessee state law that banned the teaching of evolution. He was opposed by a defender of biblical creationism. He lost. Nearly a century later, the Republican defence appears to be based on blind faith in Trump and the verdict on his conduct is preordained. As Schiff went on, McConnell, the Senate majority leader, nodded off a few times. The aide at his side wondered what to do while remaining tactful, eventually summoning a younger staffer to place a glass of water on McConnell\u2019s desk, thereby making him stir. Fellow Republicans dozed, slumped, rubbed their eyes or stretched their legs. When Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, his successor Gerald Ford declared \u201cour long national nightmare is over\u201d. This time, the party refuses to wake up.",

It was Burnley\u2019s first win at Old Trafford for 58 years and home fans chanted against the club\u2019s owners, the Glazers, and the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward. It was also United\u2019s eighth league defeat of the season and Solskj\u00e6r was asked how fans could be convinced United can turn their form around. \u201cAt the end you do feel disillusioned because maybe they do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to stick to our values and beliefs and it\u2019s no use feeling sorry for yourself. Go out there and have the same commitment and get ready for Sunday [in the FA Cup].\u201d Solskj\u00e6r has Scott McTominay, Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford out injured and while the latter tweeted he will return before the end of the season, the manager admitted his squad are feeling the pace. \u201cWe\u2019ve had X amount of games since beginning of December and they are stretched,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have played more than they should have and more mentally than physically they need a mid-season break [in early February]. \u201cWe need to look forward to the FA Cup [against Watford or Tranmere] when there\u2019s a chance to get belief up. We\u2019ve dominated Burnley but we didn\u2019t get the first goal and that took lots of belief out of us.\u201d Asked about the anti-Glazer and Woodward chants Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cI\u2019m responsible for what\u2019s happening on the pitch and of course we\u2019re looking to strengthen. \u201cI can understand supporters are disappointed but there\u2019s a way of \u2026 we need to make sure we try to help the players and the club. I think the players hear the fans when they support them and that\u2019s helped them, so [let\u2019s hope they] keep sticking at that.\u201d With nine days left of the winter transfer window Solskj\u00e6r added: \u201cHopefully we can get something over the line, these players are being stretched.\u201d Sean Dyche was rightly proud of his players. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard to get big and historical moments,\u201d the Burnley manager said.",

Those from the most deprived areas have fewer hip replacements and are admitted to hospital with bed sores more often than people from the least deprived areas. With regard to emergency care, 14.3% of the most deprived had to wait more than the supposed maximum of four hours to be dealt with in A&amp;E in 2017-18, compared with 12.8% of the wealthiest. Similarly, just 64% of the former had a good experience making a GP appointment, compared with 72% of those from the richest areas. While 134 people per 100,000 of the least deprived were admitted to hospital that year because of pressure sores, the rate among the poorest was three times higher, 394 per 100,000 people. Research by the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation thinktanks found that the poorest people were less likely to recover from mental ill-health after receiving psychological therapy and be readmitted to hospital as a medical emergency soon after undergoing treatment. The findings sparked concern because they show that poorer people\u2019shealth risks being compounded by poorer access to NHS care. Moreover, previous evidence showed that, while life expectancy is still improving for the best-off, it has stalled or gone backwards among the poorest. \u201cPoverty is bad for your health, and people in the poorest parts of England face a vicious cycle,\u201d said Ruth Thorlby, a co-author and assistant director of policy at the Health Foundation. \u201cPoor living conditions, low quality work and underfunded local services lead to worse health. \u201cThese findings show that, added to this, those in the most deprived areas are routinely experiencing longer waits in A&amp;E, lower satisfaction and more potentially avoidable hospital admissions,\u201d she added. The thinktanks analysed 23 indicators of the quality of healthcare to see what role, if any, is played by the level of deprivation faced by the patient. They found that care was worse for all of them for those from England\u2019s poorest communities. However, while some related directly to NHS care \u2013 which patients should be able to access equally \u2013 others involved socio-economic factors over which the service has no control, such as housing and employment. \u201cThese findings show some concerning trends about the knock-on effects an overstretched NHS is having on the people in England who often need it most,\u201d said Sarah Scobie, deputy director of research at the Nuffield Trust and the other co-author. \u201cMy worry is that continued pressure on the NHS is only going to exacerbate inequalities, despite the very best of intentions from staff to provide fair and equal care.\u201d Disclosure of such stark and widening inequalities raises awkward questions for the government and NHS England, both of which have pledged to tackle them. In the NHS Long Term Plan published last year, service chiefs promised to take \u201ca more concerted and systematic approach to reducing health inequalities and addressing unwarranted variation in care\u201d. That includes putting about \u00a31bn in extra funding into the parts of England with the highest inequalities in health. More positively, though, the thinktanks also found that, in areas of care where quality is improving, the inequality gap is narrowing, such as in hospital admissions for asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in children, and people being able to die where they live. The research found large disparities between richest and poorest in measures of children and young people\u2019s health, including take-up of the MMR vaccine in five-year-olds, teenage pregnancy and admissions for self-harm for under-18s. Dr Stephen Jivraj, an associate professor in the faculty of population health sciences at University College London, said: \u201cThese findings point to an inverse care law where those most in need of health services are experiencing the poorest quality. \u201cThey provide context to why the gap in health between rich and poor is getting larger, as shown in recent research from UCL. The increase in the gap between deprived areas and less deprived areas is worrying.\u201d NHS England declined to comment. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cEveryone should have access to good quality NHS healthcare no matter where they live.

Lack of police resources is the excuse commonly given for discontinuing investigations, even where there may be sufficient alternative evidence from cameras, witnesses or other sources, the review found. The study, Evidence-led Domestic Abuse Prosecutions, highlights use of what is known as \u201coutcome 16\u201d in police inquiries \u2013 an administrative dead end where no further action is taken because of \u201cevidential difficulties\u201d when the suspect is identified but the \u201cvictim does not support further action\u201d. In rape cases there has been a sudden ballooning of this category, so that the proportion of rape cases abandoned due to outcome 16 rose from 33% to 48% from 2015 to 2018. A similar pattern may be present in domestic abuse cases. In nearly 20% of a sample of 78 cases examined \u201creasonable lines of inquiry had been missed\u201d, according to the joint report by HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services.
