At that evening\u2019s hustings, he avoids any newsworthy interventions \u2013 save a crowd-pleasing criticism of the media over its coverage of transgender issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/22/keir-starmer-warns-labour-to-unite\">Starmer warns Labour: unite or face a generation out of power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These small exchanges reflect the qualities and calculations that have seen Starmer emerge as the clear frontrunner in a race which has largely failed to capture the public\u2019s attention. His quiet competence, seriousness and determination not to rock the boat seem to be winning the day.</p> <p>Yet this approach has left huge unanswered questions about where Starmer\u2019s politics are rooted \u2013 and what he would do with the party should he be announced as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s replacement on 4 April. It is a mystery the <em>Observer</em> is keen to address. In his own words, how would he describe his politics?</p> <p>\u201cLet me just deal with what it is that the leader of the Labour party, whoever it is, has got to do in the next few years,\u201d he begins, not attempting to disguise the fact he is answering his own question.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three very clear priorities. The first is uniting the party. We have to have a leader who is capable of bringing people together. We\u2019ve got 580,000 members, we\u2019re the biggest political party in Europe \u2013 and we spend most of the time taking lumps out of each other.</p> <p>\u201cThe second is to be the most effective opposition against Boris Johnson. The focus in this campaign now really has to be on him. He\u2019s a dangerous man. We all love the caricature, but actually he\u2019s a really dangerous man.</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019ve got to forge our way towards actually winning the next general election, because if we lose the next general election, the Labour party \u2013 our party \u2013 will have been out of power for longer than any period since the second world war.\u201d</p> <p>In the debate around his personal politics, which has seen some on the left warn he is no believer in the Corbynite cause, he settles on tackling inequality. \u201cI\u2019ve been clear that if we are to deal with the gross inequality we now have in our society, we\u2019re going to have to do some radical things as an incoming Labour government, with a fundamental shift in wealth, resource and opportunity.\u201d </p> <p>He doesn\u2019t want to be drawn on anything that might identify him too closely with any faction. \u201cPeople are forever trying to badge me with reference to some historic figure. I\u2019ve resisted that because it\u2019s what I think about the future that matters.\u201d</p> <p>With members able to cast their votes from tomorrow, Starmer is determined to point them towards his priorities: unity, opposing Johnson and building a credible election bid. They are his strengths in comparison to rivals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/feb/17/labour-leadership-starmer-nandy-and-long-bailey-in-tv-debate-video\" title=\"\">Rebecca Long-Bailey, the left\u2019s favourite, and Lisa Nandy</a>, the outsider who has performed strongly at hustings.</p> <p>Given the huge divisions within Labour, is his plea for unity remotely realistic? \u201cYou have to give the party something to fight for,\u201d he says. \u201cI genuinely think, and I\u2019m conscious that sometimes you see what you want to see, that our members are yearning to turn a page now. At the hustings, at the members\u2019 meetings we\u2019ve had, there hasn\u2019t been some of the division we\u2019ve seen in recent years in the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a pleasant fiction from Starmer, quickly dispelled by events.

Heckling culminates in a cry of \u201cfuck off\u201d before someone is led out, complaining lesbian rights were being ignored. Meanwhile, in the past few weeks, some have contrived to have an argument about whether New Labour was \u201cThatcherite\u201d.</p> <p>So, in the name of unity, will Starmer take any practical measures to improve the atmosphere and reduce hostility in the party? \u201cI\u2019m not interested in purging anybody out of the Labour party. On some key issues, antisemitism being one of them, we do have to be clear and we do now have to be robust. If you\u2019re antisemitic, you shouldn\u2019t be in the Labour party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae1d488c05d997d1c81fd5ead6d95ba5f2321abc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae1d488c05d997d1c81fd5ead6d95ba5f2321abc/0_0_3500_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As frustrating as Starmer\u2019s caution over upsetting the membership is, in purely strategic terms it is the obvious strategy for a frontrunner. And while there are stock phrases he falls back on (\u201cno victory without values\u201d is a favourite), he is no Theresa May, whose robotic responses and inability to think on her feet came to define her. With Starmer, there is a sense that he is setting his own parameters and making cold, lawyerly calculations about how far he can go in criticising the past regime and pointing towards a different course.</p> <p>In fact, Starmer is keen to tweak the dials of his election pitch. He presents a challenge to the membership. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a choice \u2013 we as a party can mope around, head in hands, arguing with each other, pointing fingers about who\u2019s to blame for this that and the other,\u201d he says. \u201cOr we could decide the next four years of our history is for us \u2013 we can pull together and shape what happens next, and if we take our party from where it is now to a position where it can win an election, that will change history.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a choice we\u2019ve got to make \u2013 a conscious choice for half a million members. Do you want to make history, pull together and change? If the answer to that is yes, then let\u2019s do it. Because if not, we\u2019re going to lose the next election.\u201d And he wants to make the fight against Johnson more personal. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to train our focus on Boris Johnson and attack him, not each other. We caricature him as a clown. He\u2019s not a clown, he\u2019s dangerous. What he\u2019s doing is dangerous and will damage our country.\u201d</p> <p>So did Labour underestimate Johnson? Suddenly, Starmer finds himself at the limits of his comfort in criticising the Corbyn regime. There is a long pause and words emerge slowly, syllable by syllable. \u201cI think that we need to be absolutely clear about how dangerous he is and how ruthless he is and we have to be exposing him relentlessly, and I\u2019m not sure we did that as well as we should have done.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s adoption of huge parts of Corbyn\u2019s policy programme, including abolishing tuition fees and increasing public ownership, has led some to wonder if he is prepared to make any changes to a party that crashed to a disastrous election. He has said Labour should not \u201coversteer\u201d from the Corbyn era, but will there be any steering involved at all?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency in any party, in any organisation, when something goes wrong, to say we must have got it completely wrong. I\u2019ve seen this in other organisations. Something goes wrong and everyone effectively moves to the other side of the room.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to remember and respect the fact that Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell made it very clear that the Labour party is anti-austerity, the Labour party is against cuts to public services, the Labour party believes in common ownership and the Labour party believes in the green new deal. These are really important steps.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s what he wants to keep. What does he want to change? \u201cI want to get on with the job of writing the next manifesto for 2024. Therefore, going through the exercise of 105 pages of the last manifesto of what you would keep and what you wouldn\u2019t doesn\u2019t get us very far.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s disingenuous, of course, because keeping parts of the manifesto is largely what Starmer has done with his Corbyn-friendly \u201c10 pledges\u201d. Labour\u2019s free broadband policy is not included. Has it been ditched? It seems so. \u201cYou\u2019re tempting me into the thing I wouldn\u2019t do, which is go over the last manifesto. On broadband, the policy was to do it if we got into office within 10 years. By the time we get to five years down the line, all of it is going to have to be rethought.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a36e635be98203a6bea42e2bba9bda9c9c035278\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36e635be98203a6bea42e2bba9bda9c9c035278/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy at a hustings for members in Islington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy at a hustings for members in Islington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In trying to explain Labour\u2019s lack of electoral success, Starmer does hint at a wider image problem. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost four in a row with different leaders.

      "bodyText": "Waiting for the train to Manchester on the latest leg of his Labour leadership campaign, Keir Starmer is approached by a well-wisher seeking a selfie. He makes small talk about football as the photo is taken. In Manchester, he visits his phone bank team, thanks them with a smile and makes a gentle joke about the competition to win votes, praising their polite approach to party members. At that evening\u2019s hustings, he avoids any newsworthy interventions \u2013 save a crowd-pleasing criticism of the media over its coverage of transgender issues. These small exchanges reflect the qualities and calculations that have seen Starmer emerge as the clear frontrunner in a race which has largely failed to capture the public\u2019s attention. His quiet competence, seriousness and determination not to rock the boat seem to be winning the day. Yet this approach has left huge unanswered questions about where Starmer\u2019s politics are rooted \u2013 and what he would do with the party should he be announced as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s replacement on 4 April. It is a mystery the Observer is keen to address. In his own words, how would he describe his politics? \u201cLet me just deal with what it is that the leader of the Labour party, whoever it is, has got to do in the next few years,\u201d he begins, not attempting to disguise the fact he is answering his own question. \u201cThere are three very clear priorities. The first is uniting the party. We have to have a leader who is capable of bringing people together. We\u2019ve got 580,000 members, we\u2019re the biggest political party in Europe \u2013 and we spend most of the time taking lumps out of each other. \u201cThe second is to be the most effective opposition against Boris Johnson. The focus in this campaign now really has to be on him. He\u2019s a dangerous man. We all love the caricature, but actually he\u2019s a really dangerous man. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got to forge our way towards actually winning the next general election, because if we lose the next general election, the Labour party \u2013 our party \u2013 will have been out of power for longer than any period since the second world war.\u201d In the debate around his personal politics, which has seen some on the left warn he is no believer in the Corbynite cause, he settles on tackling inequality. \u201cI\u2019ve been clear that if we are to deal with the gross inequality we now have in our society, we\u2019re going to have to do some radical things as an incoming Labour government, with a fundamental shift in wealth, resource and opportunity.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to be drawn on anything that might identify him too closely with any faction. \u201cPeople are forever trying to badge me with reference to some historic figure. I\u2019ve resisted that because it\u2019s what I think about the future that matters.\u201d With members able to cast their votes from tomorrow, Starmer is determined to point them towards his priorities: unity, opposing Johnson and building a credible election bid. They are his strengths in comparison to rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, the left\u2019s favourite, and Lisa Nandy, the outsider who has performed strongly at hustings. Given the huge divisions within Labour, is his plea for unity remotely realistic? \u201cYou have to give the party something to fight for,\u201d he says. \u201cI genuinely think, and I\u2019m conscious that sometimes you see what you want to see, that our members are yearning to turn a page now. At the hustings, at the members\u2019 meetings we\u2019ve had, there hasn\u2019t been some of the division we\u2019ve seen in recent years in the Labour party.\u201d It\u2019s a pleasant fiction from Starmer, quickly dispelled by events. That evening at the LGBT+ Labour leadership hustings, Nandy is interrupted by a heckler demanding to know why she signed a controversial pledge on trans rights. The heckler is told \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here\u201d by another audience member. Heckling culminates in a cry of \u201cfuck off\u201d before someone is led out, complaining lesbian rights were being ignored. Meanwhile, in the past few weeks, some have contrived to have an argument about whether New Labour was \u201cThatcherite\u201d. So, in the name of unity, will Starmer take any practical measures to improve the atmosphere and reduce hostility in the party? \u201cI\u2019m not interested in purging anybody out of the Labour party. On some key issues, antisemitism being one of them, we do have to be clear and we do now have to be robust. If you\u2019re antisemitic, you shouldn\u2019t be in the Labour party.\u201d As frustrating as Starmer\u2019s caution over upsetting the membership is, in purely strategic terms it is the obvious strategy for a frontrunner. And while there are stock phrases he falls back on (\u201cno victory without values\u201d is a favourite), he is no Theresa May, whose robotic responses and inability to think on her feet came to define her.

      "bodyText": "Tensions in north-west Syria continued to escalate on Saturday after another Turkish soldier was killed in a bomb attack by Russian-backed government forces. Turkey\u2019s 16th military death in Idlib province came as fighting has intensified, huge numbers of people have been displaced, and talks between Ankara and Moscow have stalled. Shortly after news of the latest casualty was confirmed, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, announced that he would meet both Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, next month to discuss the situation in Idlib. However, the death triggered a bitter round of retaliation as Turkish forces destroyed 21 \u201cregime targets\u201d, the country\u2019s defence ministry said. Turkey has dispatched thousands of troops and equipment to north-west Syria, just south of its border, to head off a crushing offensive in recent weeks by the Russia-backed forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, who is attempting to retake the rebel-held territory after nine years of war. Erdo\u011fan recently vowed to take military action \u201ceverywhere in Syria\u201d if another Turkish soldier was killed or wounded. Turkey, which hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees already, has said it cannot handle another wave of displaced people and has shut its borders, even while the Syrian offensive and Russian air raids have caused nearly a million people \u2013 mostly women and children \u2013 to flee the fighting since early December. The rising number of military casualties, including two on Thursday, could derail Ankara\u2019s talks with Moscow over a potential deal to halt the fighting. The United Nations has warned continued combat operations in Idlib could \u201cend in a bloodbath\u201d and has urged a ceasefire. The latest Syrian offensive has prompted the biggest civilian exodus in a civil war that has killed an estimated 400,000 Syrians, displaced millions more, and left much of the country in ruins.",

He will not compete in any Democratic primary until Super Tuesday, 3 March, but he has surged in the polls behind huge spending on advertising, visibility in national coverage and stumbles by the former vice-president Joe Biden, previously the leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party. Bloomberg\u2019s spell in the spotlight has attracted Trump\u2019s attention but it has been harsh too: past comments about women, minorities and even farmers have been unearthed, published and pilloried and his use of the discriminatory \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing policy while in office in New York \u2013 and subsequent defence of it \u2013 has been roundly slammed. Bloomberg kicked off his campaign with an apology for the policy, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2013. Bowser, who is African American, told the Post: \u201cHe can\u2019t change history. He can only change what happens in the future. \u201cAnd I think what\u2019s important is that a real agenda affecting those young men who were targeted by these practices is what everybody is looking for.\u201d The 47-year-old also said no candidate in the Democratic field had a perfect record on race, citing the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Biden\u2019s votes for a 1994 crime bill that contained harsh provisions which disproportionately affected minority Americans. \u201cI would argue that more people are in jail because of that crime bill than stop-and-frisk,\u201d Bowser said. In a pointed message given the publication of the interview on the day of the Nevada caucuses, which Sanders was expected to win, Bowser said the party should be wary of fielding a nominee committed to tax increases and nationalised healthcare. \u201cThat is a tough message up against Donald Trump, who is presiding over a roaring economy,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cEven if he inherited it [from Barack Obama], he\u2019s presiding over it. And many people won\u2019t understand how taking away their health insurance or raising their taxes is a good thing.\u201d Trump answered Bowser indirectly on Saturday, posting a video to his Twitter account in which he boasted about the economy and called claims he inherited it from his predecessor \u201cthe biggest con job I ever heard\u201d. Bloomberg has admitted to some of his reported remarks about women and released testimony from female employees of his eponymous company. But in a torrid first appearance on the debate stage, in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren attacked him in stinging terms, comparing him to Trump for calling women \u201cfat broads and horse-faced lesbians\u201d. \u201cI look at allegations as just that,\u201d Bowser told the Post. \u201cI think what Mike has said is that he\u2019s used crude language. And I\u2019m pretty sure that all of us can imagine Wall Street 30 years ago, male-dominated. And I think we would all be very naive if we thought a lot of crude remarks didn\u2019t happen.\u201d She added: \u201cNow, as an African American woman who\u2019s been in a lot of rooms, we can talk about discrimination. But one of the deadliest forms of discrimination is to be ignored and to be invisible and to not be heard.\u201d Bowser described a close relationship with Bloomberg since 2014, when she first ran for mayor. According to the Post, Bowser backed a Bloomberg White House run after the California senator Kamala Harris dropped out of contention. Harris and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, the other African American in the original field, consulted Bowser before ending their campaigns, the Post said. Only Bloomberg asked for her endorsement. Bowser said she thought mayors were well-qualified to run for president and commended Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has made a strong run in the moderate lane of the primary. But, she said, Buttigieg has had \u201cdifficulty translating his small-town experience into [the] big time\u201d. Bowser is a national co-chair of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign and has appeared for him around the country. She refused to be drawn on whether she would accept an invitation to be his running mate, should he win the nomination. \u201cI have the best job in Washington,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to help Mike win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scanning the magazine aisle at her local supermarket last weekend, Nikki Evans suddenly felt sick. She was stocking up on celebrity and gossip weeklies for her beauty salon when she realised that she couldn\u2019t face buying them any more. \u201cIt\u2019s awful that it took the passing of Caroline [Flack] for people to stop and think \u2018enough is enough\u2019, but I re-evaluated and looked at all these magazines and I couldn\u2019t see anything positive in them,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cPeople come to my salon to feel good; we\u2019re all about wellbeing and wellness, and I\u2019m going to hand them magazines calling people trash? I\u2019m done with it.\u201d The former presenter of ITV series Love Island and one-time winner of Strictly Come Dancing took her own life days before she was due to face trial for the alleged assault of her boyfriend. Flack\u2019s death gave new momentum to #BeKind, a hashtag created in 2017 by Lucy Alexander, a mother who lost her son to suicide and wanted to make a stand against online trolling. In the past week, inspired by Flack\u2019s Instagram post from December in which she wrote: \u201cIn a world where you can be anything, be kind,\u201d brands, celebrities and the public have been keen to express their empathy online, and #BeKind has snowballed. But what has been the real-world impact \u2013 and can the call for more kindness be more than just a hashtag? In Devon, Evans binned every magazine in her salon and explained on her Facebook page that she would be stocking her salon with \u201cgood old fashioned books \u2026 and even some colouring books\u201d instead. The post has now been shared more than four million times while dozens of other salons have pledged to do the same. On Friday, Flack\u2019s former boyfriend, rugby star Danny Cipriani, said the presenter had died of \u201cembarrassment and shame\u201d. Publications including the Daily Mail and the Sun have taken a battering with an online petition calling for \u201cthe British media to knowingly and relentlessly bully a person\u201d to be made \u201ca criminal offence\u201d gaining 800,000 signatures. Adam Frisby, the 32-year-old founder and CEO of fast fashion brand In The Style, said he was devastated by Flack\u2019s death and is producing a line of T-shirts to raise funds for charity. \u201cPeople close to me have suffered deeply with mental health problems, and the news about Caroline took my breath away.

A spokesperson from industry analyst Nielsen told the Observer that while, anecdotally, sales of similar books might have spiked, \u201cit is too early to [understand] the impact on the personal development and self-help book market\u201d as the sales of the last week would not be published until Tuesday.

The Foxes took an early lead at the Etihad when these sides met in December, only for the Citizens to overpower them 3-1 in the end. But Leicester have only lost two of their last 18 at the King Power, while their Manchester namesakes went down here last season. Both Cities will take succour from recent history.</p> <p><strong>Can the reigning champions close the gap at the top with their second win in four days? </strong>Or will the hosts consolidate their Champions League berth by winning for the first time in four?

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s your lot! Thanks for reading this MBM. Bits of Pep. \u201cNice, great victory ... we played a really good game ... next time we will score a penalty ... of course it is a problem, but next penalty, when we play to win something, we will score ... the Premier League, we cannot win, but maybe we are 19 points, mm-mm, maybe we have a little chance, I dunno.\u201d A mischievous shot across Liverpool\u2019s bow, there. They\u2019re not throwing in the towel quite yet! Bite-sized Brenny. \u201cWe\u2019re bitterly disappointed ... everything I asked the players to do they did ... we tired towards the end ... we\u2019re disappointed we didn\u2019t get a penalty, it\u2019s so clear, I thought it was the reason VAR was brought in ... it\u2019s a clear penalty ... we were always a threat ... it\u2019s tough on us ... but I am very proud of our team ... we\u2019ve got 11 games to go and we\u2019re in a great position.\u201d Jonathan Wilson was our man at the King Power. His verdict has landed. Here \u2018tis. Riyad Mahrez has been named man-of-the-match. \u201cIt was a tough game, it\u2019s always difficult to come here. They play very deep. We tried to break them down but it was difficult. In the second half we had more space and it made the difference. We knew if we won here we would increase the gap, and we did. We showed a great reaction after the missed penalty.\u201d That was a fine second-half performance from the champions. The pressure told in the end. Manchester City consolidate second place, on 57 points, moving seven points clear of Leicester (50) who are in turn six clear of fourth-placed Chelsea (44). Liverpool can restore their 22-point lead with victory over West Ham on Monday night, but the reigning champs have served notice that they\u2019ll not be giving up anything until the chase is mathematically impossible. The champions cut the lead at the top to 19 points, thanks to a late strike by Gabriel Jesus. 90 min +2: Perez comes on for Fuchs. It\u2019s fair to say Brendan Rodgers has probably left this switch too late. 90 min +1: De Bruyne takes the ball to the corner in the professional style. 90 min: Leicester throw a few folk forward. But Chilwell gives the ball away a couple of times with options ahead of him, and the crowd groan, the jig nearly up. Leicester have three minutes to save themselves. 88 min: Leicester have scored 12 goals after the 80th minute this season. But they haven\u2019t looked like finding a lucky 13th. They\u2019ve barely had a sniff since Manchester City took the lead. The champions are closing this game out with cold precision. 87 min: Jesus turns Fuchs this way and that down the right. He nearly finds Mahrez with a flick inside, but Schmeichel claims. Leicester then give up possession cheaply, allowing Bernardo Silva to slash a shot across Schmeichel and wide of the right-hand post. 85 min: Leicester replace Praet with Matty James, making his first Premier League appearance for nearly two years. 83 min: It\u2019s fair to say that goal had been coming. Can Leicester respond somehow? It\u2019s going to be difficult, with Manchester City hogging the ball like only Manchester City can. 81 min: There\u2019s a VAR check for a marginal offside, but the goal correctly stands. Manchester City are finally allowed to celebrate. On the touchline, Pep Guardiola raises his arms and cracks a wide grin. What a substitution! Manchester City break upfield. Mahrez flicks delicately down the inside-right channel, releasing Jesus into the box. Jesus draws Schmeichel and fizzes a low shot into the bottom right. 79 min: Vardy spins away from Fernandinho and makes off down the left. He reaches the box, but with Barnes in the middle, crosses way too high. 78 min: Jesus involves himself quickly, dropping a shoulder to cut in from the right. He shoots from the edge of the box. It\u2019s a dribbler, though, and an easy claim for Schmeichel. 77 min: Aguero is replaced by Jesus. 75 min: Barnes slips clear down the right, Fernandinho having over-committed to a slide tackle. He finds Ricardo in the box. Ricardo leans back, eight yards out, and ... hoicks harmlessly over the bar. Not a gilt-edged chance, but decent enough against the champions with time running out. Accordingly, he holds his head in his hands. 74 min: ... De Bruyne loops straight into the arms of Schmeichel. An uncharacteristically poor delivery by the brilliant Belgian. 73 min: Bernardo Silva latches onto a loose ball and bursts down the left, winning a corner off Soyuncu. From which ... 71 min: Mendy bustles down the inside left and into the Leicester box. Things nearly open up for him ... but he loses control at the last minute, and the chance to shoot is gone. 70 min: Chilwell breezes down the left and wins a corner off Walker. The corner\u2019s half cleared. Ricardo traps, sizes up the situation, and dinks a ball down the inside left for Vardy, who lashes a languid Le Tissieresque volley wide left. He had more time than he thought. 68 min: Ricardo is clipped out on the right touchline, and here\u2019s a chance for Leicester to load the box and make the Manchester City defence do some work. Maddison\u2019s delivery isn\u2019t much cop, though. Leicester\u2019s fast start to the second half seems a long time ago. 67 min: Vardy has the chance to set Barnes clear down the inside-right channel, though the situation requires a well-struck precision pass. It doesn\u2019t get one. But that\u2019s a rare sortie upfield from the hosts, who have been under the cosh for a while now. 65 min: Despite the penalty miss, Manchester City continue to pile on the pressure. Mahrez sashays down the right and stands one up for Aguero, but Soyuncu rises to flick a header clear. 63 min: Almost immediately, it\u2019s Aguero v Schmeichel II. And once again, the keeper wins, as Aguero nips down the inside-right channel, sending a snapshot towards the bottom right from six yards. Schmeichel sticks out a foot to kick out for a corner, and the resulting set piece comes to nought. 62 min: AGUERO MISSES! Or, more to the point, Schmeichel saves. Aguero smashes it towards the bottom left. Schmeichel guesses correctly and parries the ball away from goal! 61 min: PENALTY FOR MAN CITY! Praet had his back turned, but his arm was well away from his body. It\u2019s the correct decision, though Leicester will feel aggrieved after the De Bruyne incident in the first half. 60 min: Bernardo Silva burns down the right and wins a corner. From the set piece, Gundogan has a batter. The ball deflects off Praet\u2019s elbow and out for a corner. Manchester City surround the referee. They want a penalty kick. They may well get one. 58 min: Laporte is replaced by Otamendi. On the touchline, Pep is fuming about something or other, screaming at his players, having made some sort of tactical observation. He\u2019s animated. 57 min: More Manchester City passing. Metronomic. 55 min: Leicester can\u2019t get out of their final third. Manchester City doing an awful lot of probing. Evans and Soyuncu win a couple of last-ditch headers, Mendy and Mahrez swinging balls in from either flank. 53 min: Rodri latches onto a loose Tielemans pass in the middle and wheechs upfield. He slips a ball left for De Bruyne, who sends a low heatseeker towards the bottom left. Schmeichel claims confidently. A fine save and even better handling. De Bruyne really creamed that. 51 min: Manchester City get their foot on the ball properly for the first time since the restart. They don\u2019t really do much with it, but re-establishing a modicum of control is their main goal. 49 min: Ricardo scampers down the right and fires a low cross towards Vardy. The ball\u2019s a bit behind the striker, who attempts to backflick it towards Chilwell, coming in from the other side. Not quite. This is an impressive start to the second half from the hosts. 48 min: Barnes busies himself in the centre circle and is upended by a slightly panicked Rodri. Just a garden-variety foul, but another sign that the Leicester sub could pose the visitors a few problems. 46 min: Barnes is immediately in the thick of the action, tearing into a huge gap vacated by Mendy out on the Leicester right. He\u2019s got Vardy waiting in the middle, poised to tap in, but can\u2019t find him. Manchester City are still in the changing room. Leicester get the second half underway. Barnes replaces Iheanacho, who isn\u2019t fit to continue having been clattered by Ederson. The rain\u2019s clearing up, incidentally, so no chance of a weather-related abandonment. On which subject, here\u2019s Justin Horton: \u201cWhile everybody is enjoying Top Premiership Football on television, perhaps spare a thought for these lads, who travelled from Essex to Arbroath to watch the fixture at Gayfield Park today ... a game that was abandoned at half-time due to the wind.\u201d Half-time entertainment. Here\u2019s Jonathan Liew\u2019s take on the lunchtime kick-off. To popular acclaim, the former Leicester player shanks a dismal free kick wide left, and that\u2019s the end of the first half. The champions have had a goal disallowed, while Leicester could (argue amongst yourselves) have had two penalties. No idea how this is still goalless, but it\u2019s been a lot of fun. Don\u2019t go anywhere! 45 min +2: Aguero comes back at Leicester, gliding in from the right and buying a cheap free kick off Soyuncu. This is just to the right of the D. Mahrez looks like he fancies a crack at this one. 45 min +1: Ricardo romps up the right, but loses possession, allowing Manchester City to counter at speed. De Bruyne clips Aguero clear down the inside-left channel. Aguero draws Schmeichel and curls it round the keeper, off the right-hand post and in. But the flag\u2019s up for offside, correctly so. Aguero was a mile off. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 43 min: Ricardo cuts in from the right and has a dig from the edge of the box. Easy pickings for Ederson, who is now getting booed every time he touches the ball. 42 min: Iheanacho gets up and walks off. He\u2019ll be back in a second. Maddison meanwhile takes the corner, from which Tielemans has a whack that\u2019s blocked and cleared. And then Iheanacho comes back on. 41 min: But before it can be taken, Iheanacho needs lengthy treatment. He took a rare old whack there. Anywhere else on the pitch, and that collision would have been deemed a foul. But keepers are keepers. Leicester want a penalty, but they\u2019re not getting one. 39 min: Maddison, quarterbacking from deep, floats a pass into the Manchester City box. Iheanacho gets his head on the ball, hoping to loop it over the outrushing Ederson. He gets properly whacked by the keeper for his trouble. The ball clips off Ederson\u2019s gloves and out for a corner. 37 min: Maddison whips a decent free kick towards the bottom left, but Ederson has read it well and turns it around the post for a corner. The set piece is a non-event. 36 min: Gundogan concedes another clumsy free kick, nipping at Maddison, 30 yards out on the left. He\u2019s in danger of testing the referee\u2019s patience with his repeated fouling. Maddison likes the look of this one too. 35 min: De Bruyne plays a glorious reverse pass down the left to release Bernardo Silva into acres. He\u2019s got four team-mates in the box, but somehow manages to thread the ball between them all, finding nobody. Chilwell clears up the left flank. 34 min: De Bruyne threatens to zip clear down the left, but Soyuncu does extremely well to stick to his side and limit the problem to a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 33 min: After an interminable wait, De Bruyne larrups a very ambitious, reasonably dismal effort high over the bar. 31 min: Manchester City knock it about again. Eventually Praet gets fed up and bowls Rodri to the ground. This will be a free kick in a central position, 35 yards from goal. It\u2019s De Bruyne\u2019s turn to stand over a dead ball with eyes lighting up the night sky. 29 min: Maddison aims for the top right. The ball hits De Bruyne\u2019s hand, which was shielding his face, and deflects harmlessly towards Ederson, who claims. Neither referee nor VAR consider a penalty kick, though you could hardly make the argument that De Bruyne\u2019s arms were in a natural position there. Anyway, it is what it is. 28 min: Iheanacho latches onto a weak clearing header by Laporte, and dribbles with great purpose towards the Manchester City box. He\u2019s clattered by Gundogan, and this is a free kick just outside the D, just right of centre. Maddison\u2019s eyes begin to strobe with excitement. 26 min: Manchester City pen Leicester back. Mahrez probes from the right. Mendy curls in a couple of balls from the left. Leicester hold firm, but the pressure is building. 24 min: Mahrez dances in from the right, drops a shoulder, and tees up De Bruyne, who whips a low first-time shot inches wide of the right hand post. Schmeichel holds the pose of a man who had it covered, but I\u2019m not so sure. 23 min: Manchester City are beginning to dominate, though every time Leicester get the ball, they look good for a quick break. This is nicely balanced. A goal is surely coming along soon, one way or another. 21 min: Fuchs and Maddison combine down the inside left, the latter slipping Iheanacho free in the box. Iheanacho takes a fierce shot from a tight angle, and Ederson fumbles it around the post, but up goes the flag for offside. The correct decision, but only just. Manchester City\u2019s back line was not a work of art. 19 min: A free kick for Manchester City 35 yards out, after Iheanacho accidentally skids into Walker. It\u2019s sent into the City box, forcing Evans to concede a corner. From the set piece, Mendy has a batter from distance. That one\u2019s deflected over the bar, and the second corner is a non-event. After a slow start, the champions are beginning to ask some serious questions. 17 min: Manchester City stream forward in typically attractive style. Gundogan and Aguero exchange cute passes down the inside right, the former sidefooting towards the bottom right. He doesn\u2019t hit it cleanly, but nearly catches out Schmeichel, who appears in two minds but hacks clear at the very last second. The resulting corner comes to nought. 15 min: It\u2019s high-octane stuff, this. Everyone racing around like they\u2019ve just ingested a whole pack of Refreshers. No prizes for guessing why they\u2019re on my mind. 13 min: Fuchs hassles Gundogan on the halfway line, and wins yet another midfield battle for the hosts. Manchester City are preposterously ponderous sometimes. They get away with their latest faff when Fuchs seriously overhits his pass towards Vardy down the left. \u201cManchester City\u2019s black second strip was \u2018inspired\u2019 by the colour scheme used in the Hacienda,\u201d notes Frinton Bojangles. \u201cI\u2019d assumed the third kit came from someone\u2019s chemically enhanced night out in the early 90s.\u201d 11 min: Vardy makes good down the left and hooks low into the mixer. Fernandinho hacks clear with blue shirts lurking. There\u2019s surely no way this match will end goalless. 9 min: Manchester City go up the other end and nearly score themselves. Vardy sashays in from the right and pearls one towards the top left. Schmeichel extends to full length in the process of tipping the shot away. This is already great fun. 8 min: Leicester come so close to taking the lead. Once again, the champions are caught dozing in midfield. Tielemans snaffles the ball and strokes a lovely pass down the middle of the park, Vardy tearing free. He slips the ball bast Ederson, only for his shot to smack the base of the left-hand post and bounce clear. So unlucky! 6 min: A nice open feel to this game. Iheanacho turns a ball round the corner on the left flank and sends Chilwell barrelling towards the Manchester City box. He goes shoulder to shoulder with Fernandinho and comes off second best, miscontrolling then falling over. He wants a penalty but there was little contact, certainly none that\u2019s illegal, so come on and come off it. 4 min: Tielemans looks lively. He wins another midfield battle before driving his team forward. Maddison is close to releasing Iheanacho down the inside right, but his outside-of-the-boot flick is a wee bit too heavy and the former Manchester City man can\u2019t control. 2 min: It\u2019s all Manchester City. But then suddenly Gundogan is caught faffing about in the centre circle by Tielemans, who rakes a pass down the inside-left channel for Vardy. For a second, it looks like the striker will tear clear, but Laporte stands firm and ushers him away from the danger zone. And we\u2019re off! Manchester City get the ball rolling on a drizzly night in the midlands. They ping it around a lot. You sense a pattern is already set. The teams are out! Leicester are in their trademark blue shirts, while Manchester City are kitted out in their retro-confectionery-influenced, yellow-and-pink third kit. Such a shame they\u2019re not sponsored by Lyons Maid or Barratts. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Pre-match Pep talk. \u201cI select my team for this match. I never understand to play a game thinking about the next one. That way you can suffer a big defeat. The other is a good team. We don\u2019t know exactly their set-up. I guess they\u2019re going to play with five. We change the way we have to press, we have to adapt a little bit.\u201d And then a light moment as he\u2019s asked whether it\u2019s a good or bad sign that Jamie Vardy hasn\u2019t scored in eight matches? \u201cA bad sign. [laughs] If you didn\u2019t do the question, it would be a good sign! But it\u2019s a bad sign, honestly.\u201d Brendan Rodgers speaks to Sky. \u201cWe lose that natural defensive midfielder player, so we put an extra one into the back line. It allows us to still play the way we want to play. We know we will have longer spells without the ball than normal, but you still have to fight and be strong defensively. And we\u2019ve put in an extra striker to help us in the counter-attacking moments. We\u2019ve played the system before. It\u2019s a big game for us. If we win, we\u2019ll go a point behind. It\u2019s a great challenge.\u201d Leicester make three changes to the side that drew at Wolves last Friday week. Christian Fuchs, Dennis Praet and Kelechi Iheanacho replace Harvey Barnes, Ayoze Perez and the suspended Hamza Choudhury. Manchester City make three changes as well, in the wake of their midweek victory over West Ham. Fernandinho, Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan replace Nicolas Otamendi, Gabriel Jesus and the semi-injured David Silva. Leicester City: Schmeichel, Soyuncu, Evans, Fuchs, Ricardo Pereira, Maddison, Tielemans, Praet, Chilwell, Iheanacho, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Albrighton, Ward, Barnes, Perez, James. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Fernandinho, Laporte, Mendy, Rodri, Mahrez, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Aguero. Subs: Bravo, Stones, Gabriel Jesus, Silva, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Foden. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). You can be pretty sure that Manchester City haven\u2019t given up the Premier League chase quite yet. Yes, they\u2019re currently 22 points behind leaders Liverpool, who require only five more wins to be certain of the title. But the gap was 25 before the West Ham stroll on Wednesday, and it\u2019ll be just 19 if they see off third-placed Leicester City tonight. OK, OK ... but do you really think Pep Guardiola is the sort to throw in the towel just because something\u2019s merely improbable? Us neither, so here we all are. This face-off between third and second should be a cracker. Not least because three points would be equally precious to Leicester, as they look to maintain a comfortable chasm between third and fourth. The Foxes took an early lead at the Etihad when these sides met in December, only for the Citizens to overpower them 3-1 in the end. But Leicester have only lost two of their last 18 at the King Power, while their Manchester namesakes went down here last season. Both Cities will take succour from recent history. Can the reigning champions close the gap at the top with their second win in four days? Or will the hosts consolidate their Champions League berth by winning for the first time in four? We\u2019ll find out this tea-time. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>It can be difficult sometimes to remember why we ever started liking football. What was it that first stirred us back in our childhood to make sure we were always by a radio or television at twenty to five? That led us to pore over the details in the Sunday papers? That made us belt a ball endlessly against the garage wall and keep detailed records of the games of Subbuteo we played against ourselves? It\u2019s hard to remember now. Was it the legal wrangling? Was it the appeals to the court of arbitration for sport? Was it the futile pixel-by-pixel examination of offside decisions? Was it even the thrill of seeing the rich and greedy hammer much poorer opposition and then demand to be even richer? Was it human-rights-abusing states pumping money into the game to make everybody forget about their wars and torture centres?

Was it the appeals to the court of arbitration for sport? Was it the futile pixel-by-pixel examination of offside decisions? Was it even the thrill of seeing the rich and greedy hammer much poorer opposition and then demand to be even richer? Was it human-rights-abusing states pumping money into the game to make everybody forget about their wars and torture centres? It\u2019s so hard now to remember. Chunk!

      "bodyText": "At Plonkers wine bar in York city centre, brass plaques on the bare brick walls show how high the floodwaters have risen over the years. The highest was 17ft 8in in 2000 \u2013 \u201cHere it comes\u201d, the plaque reads. The lowest is 2012\u2019s 16ft 7in, captioned \u201cHere again\u201d. Another plaque from 2015 says \u201cKeep on smiling\u201d and records a height of 17ft 2in. Flooding has become a part of life for the businesses on the banks of the River Ouse which runs through the city, and owners have invested thousands in water pumps and flood barriers to help their buildings weather the storms. But after countless swampings and near misses, many are starting to feel the strain. \u201cI\u2019ve had this business for 30 years, and I have flooded nearly every year,\u201d said Plonkers owner Leann Williams. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to every story and every solution and every promise, and nothing will get done, it just stays the same.\u201d The Ouse is expected to peak at 14ft 5in above normal levels on Monday, which is within the city\u2019s flood defence limits, but other areas of Yorkshire have been badly hit. Firefighters rescued people from 10 homes in Settle on Friday night, and the village of Horton in Ribblesdale was completely cut off. North Yorkshire fire and rescue service tweeted: \u201cWe have two crews and a water rescue team from Ripon in Horton in Ribblesdale which is currently surrounded by flood water. Crews are checking residents and ensuring everyone is safe.\u201d This is the third weekend in a row the area has been battered by heavy rain, following storms Ciara and Dennis. Large swathes of the country have been affected, with England receiving 144% of its average February rainfall. More than 1,000 homes and businesses were flooded in the Calder Valley by Storm Ciara, and south Wales and the Midlands are still reeling from the floods caused by Storm Dennis last weekend. Boris Johnson has come under criticism for failing to visit affected areas, and flood victims say the compensation on offer is not enough. Households can apply for up to \u00a3500 emergency relief, while business rates and council tax will be paused for those \u201csignificantly affected\u201d. Small to medium-sized businesses can apply for a grant of up to \u00a32,500 if they have suffered severe, uninsurable losses, but this leaves many without support. Williams said she only received financial aid in 2015, when the Foss Barrier failed and 500 homes in York were inundated, so she is mainly shouldering the burden alone. \u201cI get really emotional about it because it\u2019s 30 years and I\u2019m at the point now where I\u2019ve had enough, I want out,\u201d she said. \u201cFor 30 years I\u2019ve provided jobs in this city. I\u2019m done, I don\u2019t want to do it any more. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d The company\u2019s pump system keeps the bar functional when water levels are high, but on Friday afternoon the bar was quiet \u2013 when people see the water at the bottom of the street, they often assume Plonkers has shut up shop. \u201cThis street is known as the flooded street, so we\u2019re the one that\u2019s classed as closed.

And just along the river is the King\u2019s Arms, known as the \u201cpub that floods\u201d, often used in the media to illustrate the high water levels. The Ouse is rising by about a third of an inch (8mm) a year on average, and although a nearby flood defence \u2013 part of the city\u2019s \u00a345m five-year plan \u2013 is due to finish next year, this area is still under assessment. The Environment Agency is trying to juggle the needs of residents and businesses in trouble spots across the city. Progress is being made, but for those facing the waters every year, it\u2019s not happening quickly enough. In a historic motor house on Skeldergate Bridge, overlooking the Ouse, is Dyls Caf\u00e9 Bar, where the floods have taken their toll. \u201cWe\u2019re suffering extremely badly at the moment,\u201d said owner Malcolm Dyl. \u201cWhen the water is up, somebody has to sleep here all night because the electric could cut.

It\u2019s very close to. It will wipe our business out completely.\u201d On Saturday the flooded river completely inundated Dyl\u2019s outside terrace and the riverside footpath, but the business is still open and accessible from the top of the bridge \u2013 although many customers are put off by the high water levels. \u201cOur trade is down by 80% this February compared to last year, so you can imagine our cash flow.

      "body": "<p>At last, France are really back. Against the very team who have driven them to distraction of late, this latest incarnation of brazen French youngsters held their nerve as an all-too-familiar narrative unfolded, defending what had been a comfortable lead with only 14 men in the dying minutes. This time, there would be no gifts, as in the World Cup in October, as in the Six Nations last year, when their second-half implosion in Paris sent Wales on their way to a grand slam.</p> <p>Now it is France who are a step closer to that honour, having not won one since 2010. A win in Edinburgh in the next round would set up a crunch home match against Ireland on the final weekend. The irony was rich that this callow team might finally defend a lead against a Wales team of more than 800 caps and that it should be Wales who gifted them the key turning point. An interception try by Romain Ntamack in the 52nd minute was the response after Wales had pulled back to within a single point early in the second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/22/france-wales-six-nations-rugby-shaun-edwards-fabien-galthie\">Fabien Galthi\u00e9 and Shaun Edwards\u2019s French revolution outmuscles Wales  | Ian Malin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there was a feeling from the off that something was different about <em>Les Bleus</em> this time. Wales are lately well used to the idea of brilliant Frenchmen outplaying them for long stretches, only to hand them the game on a plate. This time, France were restricted to the odd moment in a first half in which they looked, if not dominant, at the very least comfortable, even authoritative. Wales, with all those caps, hardly looked green, but neither did they impose themselves as might have been expected against so young a team a long way from home. Certainly, it would have tested an uninformed observer to pick the side with such an overwhelming advantage in experience.</p> <p>The French ran out to an 11-point lead on the half-hour. Again, Wales are unused to this experience, but if a goalline stand by the French near half-time was anything to go by Wales knew they would have to earn the right to overturn this deficit. They chose to scrum a series of penalties (France lost the first-half penalty count 9-2), following the first of two French yellow cards, for Gregory Alldritt in the 40th minute. Wales, caught between a desire to attack the French forwards or their undermanned three-quarters, made a hash of that opportunity to pull back to within a point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"640e54aee537ebe7306197e5c6ab7a00b40be488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/640e54aee537ebe7306197e5c6ab7a00b40be488/13_0_2574_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"France\u2019s Gregory Alldritt leaves the pitch after he is shown a yellow card by the referee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France\u2019s Gregory Alldritt leaves the pitch after he is shown a yellow card by the referee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>France ended up defending the position with an energy that might have felt less familiar. Or perhaps it should have. Wales, after all, know better than anyone the new architect of France\u2019s defensive system, Shaun Edwards. The old warhorse might as well have been manning the barricades himself.

      "bodyText": "At last, France are really back. Against the very team who have driven them to distraction of late, this latest incarnation of brazen French youngsters held their nerve as an all-too-familiar narrative unfolded, defending what had been a comfortable lead with only 14 men in the dying minutes. This time, there would be no gifts, as in the World Cup in October, as in the Six Nations last year, when their second-half implosion in Paris sent Wales on their way to a grand slam. Now it is France who are a step closer to that honour, having not won one since 2010. A win in Edinburgh in the next round would set up a crunch home match against Ireland on the final weekend. The irony was rich that this callow team might finally defend a lead against a Wales team of more than 800 caps and that it should be Wales who gifted them the key turning point. An interception try by Romain Ntamack in the 52nd minute was the response after Wales had pulled back to within a single point early in the second half. But there was a feeling from the off that something was different about Les Bleus this time. Wales are lately well used to the idea of brilliant Frenchmen outplaying them for long stretches, only to hand them the game on a plate. This time, France were restricted to the odd moment in a first half in which they looked, if not dominant, at the very least comfortable, even authoritative. Wales, with all those caps, hardly looked green, but neither did they impose themselves as might have been expected against so young a team a long way from home. Certainly, it would have tested an uninformed observer to pick the side with such an overwhelming advantage in experience. The French ran out to an 11-point lead on the half-hour. Again, Wales are unused to this experience, but if a goalline stand by the French near half-time was anything to go by Wales knew they would have to earn the right to overturn this deficit. They chose to scrum a series of penalties (France lost the first-half penalty count 9-2), following the first of two French yellow cards, for Gregory Alldritt in the 40th minute. Wales, caught between a desire to attack the French forwards or their undermanned three-quarters, made a hash of that opportunity to pull back to within a point. France ended up defending the position with an energy that might have felt less familiar. Or perhaps it should have. Wales, after all, know better than anyone the new architect of France\u2019s defensive system, Shaun Edwards. The old warhorse might as well have been manning the barricades himself. Wales looked edgy in the face of it. Notwithstanding a Dan Biggar penalty in only the fourth minute, Wales\u2019s afternoon had not got off to an auspicious start. The sight of George North leaving the field with another head knock was disconcerting enough, but by then France had the first of their two first-half tries. France were more than happy to engage in the aerial exchanges with both half-backs deadly accurate with the boot. Ntamack was the one to test Leigh Halfpenny in the seventh minute and when the latter spilled under pressure, the excellent Anthony Bouthier gathered the loose ball to gallop home.

When Hadleigh Parkes was forced into touch five metres out, a well-worked loop at the front of the French lineout sent Paul Willemse, the biggest of a monstrous back five, crashing to the line.

Now the latest in a run of modern works to be inspired by the sad legacy of this short life is being heralded as one of the most eagerly awaited books of the spring. The acclaimed author Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s first historical novel, Hamnet, tackles the mystery surrounding the fate of Hamnet Shakespeare, the playwright\u2019s only son.

      "bodyText": "Over Christmas, Andrea Godwin\u2019s fridge broke down. It was the worst timing for a working mother of two young boys, let alone someone who also relies on Centrelink to get by. At times like these Godwin would usually request an advance on her parenting payment. But these days she is barred from accessing them. Centrelink claims she owes it money \u2013 an $8,500 robodebt. \u201cI don\u2019t even like getting a debt for $100 or $200, to me it\u2019s still quite a large amount,\u201d Godwin, 32, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cFor a single mum on a casual earning job, it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to hang over me for such a long time.\u201d About four years ago, the government announced a new policy to bolster the budget bottom line and emphasise its tough posture on so-called welfare rorting. The system \u2013 which used tax office data to predict where a person may have underreported income to Centrelink and then forced them to prove they did not \u2013 quickly became known as robodebt. Godwin has one of the more than 600,000 debts issued, which are worth about $1.6bn in total. And she may well have a second, worth about $10,000, after Centrelink began another debt \u201creview\u201d in October. Since 2016, Centrelink has sent out more than 1m review letters warning people the information it holds from the tax office is \u201cdifferent to the information you reported to us\u201d. The language of the letters has softened recently, but the effect is the same: show us proof that the income you reported to us was correct; and if you can\u2019t, pay up. Despite a string of scandals, including an intellectually disabled man who was handed a $14,500 robodebt and the Melbourne woman who had her tax return seized while she was homeless, the scheme rolled on year after year with only minor \u201crefinements\u201d. Until Guardian Australia published leaked documents last year, the government appeared to be mulling an expansion. Then in November, to the shock of many, the government backed down from the program.

With a measure and nuance that has come to characterise his current arc of fame, Jenek debugged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/big-brother-house-lgbt-history-india-willoughby\">the difference between drag and trans-identity</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/pride/fast-lane/article/2018/02/05/opinion-heres-why-aussie-drag-queen-courtney-act-winning-celebrity-big-brother\">took conservative politician Ann Widdecombe to task</a> for her support of homophobic policies.</p> <p>Jenek may not be used to being taken seriously, but he\u2019s certainly not intimated by it. Normally softly spoken, on that point he\u2019s bullish: \u201cIt\u2019s so validating and inspiring. It\u2019s always been a big part of my identity ... but there\u2019s been no space for that.\u201d</p> <p>Jenek is based between London, Sydney and Los Angeles and he has noticed that although \u201cthe world has become more respectful of diversity in general \u2026<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>Australia is still definitely behind the eight ball.\u201d</p> <p>He sees SBS \u2013 where he\u2019ll co-host a live stream of Sydney\u2019s Mardi Gras parade on 28 February \u2013 as an island of hope in a still white bread landscape. The broadcaster \u201cfeels to me like Australia. It looks to me like the Australia I see walking around outside.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d55dbb41881f92e9f1577d998cd733cfeab87236\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d55dbb41881f92e9f1577d998cd733cfeab87236/0_0_5412_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtney Act performs on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge on 6 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtney Act performs on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge on 6 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty Images for BridgeClimb</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jenek is optimistic about this change: \u201cPeople having the opportunity to \u2026 picture themselves in someone else\u2019s experience \u2013 [It] fosters a sense of empathy. Empathy is what is missing right now in the world. We\u2019re yelling from opposite sides of the room and nothing\u2019s getting done.\u201d</p> <p>Learning to sit back and listen has had a profound impact on Jenek\u2019s self-image. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that I fell out of my cis, binary mother\u2019s baby gap perfectly developed and understanding of the world,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI\u2019m not that way now \u2026 and it\u2019s about understanding that and trying to be better.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in the same world we all grew up in. I was socialised with the same mass media ideas, and I\u2019m happy to admit that because of that I have been racist, misogynistic, homophobic, all those negative qualities. But when you recognise them in yourself \u2026 you realise they\u2019re not real, they\u2019re socialised.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes people think empathy is trying to understand someone\u2019s experience through their own lens \u2013 and that\u2019s not empathy. It wasn\u2019t until I understood that I don\u2019t have to understand someone else\u2019s experience, I just had to believe them, that I was really set free from a somewhat narcissistic view of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Jenek has been exploring that process of emergence through his work lately. On 19 February his show Fluid will debut \u2013 \u201csomewhere between a one-person play and a pop concert\u201d for which he wrote his own music for the first time \u2013 in Sydney.<strong> </strong></p> <p>As the title suggests, the work deals with Jenek\u2019s struggles with gender identity, and his understanding of self. He started writing the show in September last year, and feels like \u201cI\u2019m already a different person.\u201d Reliving past moments of his life through rehearsals: \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see how your body reacts and changes.</p> <p>\u201cFor the longest time I didn\u2019t realise, but drag was a safe space for me to express my femininity \u2013 and I could justify it as a job. But it was always Shane on one side and Courtney on the other.\u201d</p> <p>This show is an attempt to unify that polarity, and become comfortable with the space in between. \u201cOnly recently I\u2019ve realised that drag was a shield.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Jenek says that in the commonwealth alone, 34 countries still have anti-homosexual laws. The climate crisis and Australia\u2019s treatment of refugees and First Nations people also weigh heavy on his mind. As part of a select group of queer people who have finally won a seat at the table, he feels the responsibility to make more room for others. \u201cWe\u2019re in unique position to be able to think about how those things affect more than just us, and lend our voices to worthy causes.\u201d</p> <p>Lately, stories of allyship and solidarity<strong> </strong>have been making Jenek teary. He talks about the resonance of a widely shared quote \u2013 which he notes is often attributed to Lilla Watson <a href=\"http://unnecessaryevils.blogspot.com/2008/11/attributing-words.html\">but was in fact created by a larger group of First Nations activists in the 1970s</a>: \u201cIf you have come here to help me, then you are wasting your time ...

      "bodyText": "From a drag show on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, to posters lining the streets and appearances on morning television shows and panels, it\u2019s been hard to miss the message: Australia\u2019s biggest drag export in decades, Courtney Act, is back in town. But this time it\u2019s different: \u201cTen years ago I would walk into a TV studio in Sydney and I would be welcome \u2013 but I would be a sideshow act,\u201d her lower-key but no-less shiny alter ego, Shane Jenek, says. \u201cNow I walk in ... and people are interested in what I have to say, and value my opinion. That\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever been familiar with in a media space.\u201d Jenek has spent two decades, more or less, in the public eye. He had a brief stint hosting a children\u2019s cartoon show in his late teens, but it was Australian Idol that propelled him to mainstream Australian attention. In 2003 as Courtney \u2013 all blond wigs and early-aughts coloured eyeshadows \u2013 he came joint 13th in the reality show\u2019s debut season. One of the judges, Ian \u201cDicko\u201d Dickson, called him \u201cone of the sexiest girls in the competition\u201d with the caveat \u201csurprisingly\u201d. Jenek moved to the US, eventually scoring a career-making runner-up prize on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. But it was not until 2018 in the UK that all those reality shows coalesced into a political voice. \u201cCelebrity Big Brother created that space,\u201d he reflects. In a winning turn on the show, Jenek earned praise in and out of drag for his patient approach to LGBTIQ+ issues. With a measure and nuance that has come to characterise his current arc of fame, Jenek debugged the difference between drag and trans-identity, and took conservative politician Ann Widdecombe to task for her support of homophobic policies. Jenek may not be used to being taken seriously, but he\u2019s certainly not intimated by it. Normally softly spoken, on that point he\u2019s bullish: \u201cIt\u2019s so validating and inspiring. It\u2019s always been a big part of my identity ... but there\u2019s been no space for that.\u201d Jenek is based between London, Sydney and Los Angeles and he has noticed that although \u201cthe world has become more respectful of diversity in general \u2026 Australia is still definitely behind the eight ball.\u201d He sees SBS \u2013 where he\u2019ll co-host a live stream of Sydney\u2019s Mardi Gras parade on 28 February \u2013 as an island of hope in a still white bread landscape. The broadcaster \u201cfeels to me like Australia. It looks to me like the Australia I see walking around outside.\u201d Jenek is optimistic about this change: \u201cPeople having the opportunity to \u2026 picture themselves in someone else\u2019s experience \u2013 [It] fosters a sense of empathy. Empathy is what is missing right now in the world. We\u2019re yelling from opposite sides of the room and nothing\u2019s getting done.\u201d Learning to sit back and listen has had a profound impact on Jenek\u2019s self-image. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that I fell out of my cis, binary mother\u2019s baby gap perfectly developed and understanding of the world,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI\u2019m not that way now \u2026 and it\u2019s about understanding that and trying to be better. \u201cI grew up in the same world we all grew up in. I was socialised with the same mass media ideas, and I\u2019m happy to admit that because of that I have been racist, misogynistic, homophobic, all those negative qualities. But when you recognise them in yourself \u2026 you realise they\u2019re not real, they\u2019re socialised. \u201cSometimes people think empathy is trying to understand someone\u2019s experience through their own lens \u2013 and that\u2019s not empathy. It wasn\u2019t until I understood that I don\u2019t have to understand someone else\u2019s experience, I just had to believe them, that I was really set free from a somewhat narcissistic view of the world.\u201d Jenek has been exploring that process of emergence through his work lately. On 19 February his show Fluid will debut \u2013 \u201csomewhere between a one-person play and a pop concert\u201d for which he wrote his own music for the first time \u2013 in Sydney. As the title suggests, the work deals with Jenek\u2019s struggles with gender identity, and his understanding of self. He started writing the show in September last year, and feels like \u201cI\u2019m already a different person.\u201d Reliving past moments of his life through rehearsals: \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see how your body reacts and changes. \u201cFor the longest time I didn\u2019t realise, but drag was a safe space for me to express my femininity \u2013 and I could justify it as a job. But it was always Shane on one side and Courtney on the other.\u201d This show is an attempt to unify that polarity, and become comfortable with the space in between. \u201cOnly recently I\u2019ve realised that drag was a shield.\u201d For years he struggled with his gender identity. \u201cI thought that I didn\u2019t feel like the man I was told I was supposed to be, then I must be trans.\u201d Now he believes: \u201cHowever you actually feel is correct.\u201d While he\u2019s noticed resistance to this, even within the LGBTIQ+ community, these walls are dissolving. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think of myself as a cougar but I have dated a couple of gentlemen who were 25 \u2026 Even their sensibilities surrounding gender and sexuality are so different. I find myself stopping and taking a few steps back, looking at everything and thinking: \u2018This is the wonderful world I always dreamed of as a teenager.\u2019 \u201d Of course, there\u2019s a long way to go. Jenek says that in the commonwealth alone, 34 countries still have anti-homosexual laws. The climate crisis and Australia\u2019s treatment of refugees and First Nations people also weigh heavy on his mind. As part of a select group of queer people who have finally won a seat at the table, he feels the responsibility to make more room for others. \u201cWe\u2019re in unique position to be able to think about how those things affect more than just us, and lend our voices to worthy causes.\u201d Lately, stories of allyship and solidarity have been making Jenek teary. He talks about the resonance of a widely shared quote \u2013 which he notes is often attributed to Lilla Watson but was in fact created by a larger group of First Nations activists in the 1970s: \u201cIf you have come here to help me, then you are wasting your time ... But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not free until we\u2019re all free, essentially,\u201d he says. Applying this ethos to himself, Jenek summarises it with a sheepish grin: \u201cTo not be a shit cunt, basically.\u201d \u2022 Courtney Act is co-hosting SBS\u2019 live broadcast of the Mardi Gras parade on Saturday 29 February from 7.30pm AEDT. Fluid runs at the Eternity Playhouse until 28 February",

Greg Hunt, the environment minister who designed the policy, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/6748902\">told ABC Radio National</a> it would put \u201ca limit on the emissions that individual firms can have\u201d.</p> <p>Specifically, it would set a limit \u2013 a baseline \u2013 for about 140 industrial facilities that emitted more than 100,000 tonnes each year. While the government chose not to emphasise the point, companies that breached their baseline at a particular site without federal approval would have to pay by buying carbon credits created through cuts elsewhere.</p> <p>As Hunt described it, the safeguard mechanism was half the Coalition\u2019s direct action climate policy (a name long since dropped). The first half of direct action was the <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/government/emissions-reduction-fund\">emissions reduction fund</a>, a $2.5bn incentive scheme under which the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/coalitions-emissions-reduction-fund-labelled-a-joke-after-first-post-election-auction\">would pay for pollution cuts</a>, mostly from landowners who signed up to plant or look after native vegetation. The second half would \u201csafeguard\u201d those cuts \u2013 ensure they were not just wiped out \u2013 by preventing \u201csignificant increases in emissions above business-as-usual levels\u201d elsewhere.</p> <p>In practice, the scheme has run quite differently.</p> <p>In the case of Centennial Coal, the Australian Conservation Foundation found it could reasonably have been expected to pay more than $6m to offset its extra emissions, based on <a href=\"http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ERF/Auctions-results/july-2019\">the price the government pays</a> for carbon credits. Instead it followed rules set up by the government that allowed it to retrospectively apply for a change to its baseline arrangements.</p> <p>Most people paying attention to the scheme have been left to wonder: why have a policy to limit emissions that routinely allows companies to ignore their limit?</p> <p>Suzanne Harter, a climate campaigner with the ACF, is among those who says it makes no sense. \u201cIf the government keeps increasing the pollution baselines, there is no point to the safeguard mechanism,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/20/labor-to-announce-net-zero-emissions-target-by-2050-and-will-oppose-taxpayer-funding-of-coal\">Labor to announce net zero emissions target by 2050 and will oppose taxpayer funding of new coal power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tennant Reed, who runs climate, energy and environment policy for the Australian Industry Group, which represents the interests of more than 60,000 businesses, agrees. \u201cIf it never has to do something to actually reduce emissions it will have been a waste of time for everyone involved,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The numbers tell a pretty basic story. In the first two years of the scheme, analysts at energy and carbon consultancy RepuTex found the regulator had approved changes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/16/coalition-climate-policy-heavy-industry-increase-emissions-nearly-third\">allowed big industry to emit up to 32% more without penalty</a> than when the safeguard was introduced.</p> <p>Companies used only some of this additional headroom. Actual emissions under the scheme rose 12% over those two years.</p> <p>Based on this, RepuTex found the safeguard was likely to lead to an extra 280m tonnes of pollution over the next decade, more than six months\u2019 worth of Australia\u2019s total carbon pollution. It would more than eclipse the 193m tonnes of cuts contracted under the emissions reduction fund.</p> <p>RepuTex\u2019s executive director, Hugh Grossman, said it meant taxpayers\u2019 dollars spent on storing carbon dioxide in vegetation was \u201ceffectively money going down the drain\u201d.</p> <p>The rise in emissions under the safeguard mechanism reflects a longer-term trend. In a separate report, RepuTex found industrial emissions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/12/a-60-rise-in-industrial-emissions-points-to-failure-of-coalitions-safeguard-mechanism\">had risen 60% since 2005</a>, the year against which the government has pledged at least a 26% cut by 2030.</p> <p>The surge has been driven by the creation of a $50bn liquefied natural gas export industry across northern Australia and increases in direct combustion at mining sites, venting of fugitive emissions in fossil fuel extraction and pollution from metals, chemicals and minerals processing.</p> <p>The rise in industrial emissions is the primary reason national emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/29/not-something-to-celebrate-drought-and-flood-cause-drop-in-emissions\">stubbornly refused to fall</a> while there has been a historic drop in pollution from power plants and a significant dip from farming due to the drought.</p> <p>That could start to change this year as more of the recent record investment in solar and wind power, spurred by the now-reached national renewable energy target, is comes online. But analysts say Australia cannot hope to meet its climate targets while major industry is left unchecked. The industrial sector is expected to pass power generation to become the country\u2019s most polluting sector within two or three years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/15/is-disunity-in-politics-really-death-any-more-im-not-so-sure-given-the-rolling-climate-conflict\">Is disunity in politics really death any more?

      "bodyText": "When we look at the path to zero net emissions by 2050 two things stand out \u2013 firstly it is exactly in line with Labor\u2019s old policy of a 45% cut by 2030, and secondly the government\u2019s target of a 26% cut is woefully below what is needed. This week, Anthony Albanese announced that Labor will commit to achieving zero net emissions by 2050. And let\u2019s state clearly \u2013 this is a damn good thing. You might want to argue that we need to get to zero net earlier, and that\u2019s a worthy argument, but let us not get silly and suggest this target shows the ALP is somehow hostage to fossil fuel companies. This is a massive step for our economy. Last year Australia expelled 532m tonnes of greenhouse gasses. Aiming to get to zero net in 30 years is not something you can dismiss as a sign of a party doing nothing. The government is currently refusing to set any target. Instead, the prime minister is talking up his \u201ctechnology over taxation\u201d approach. There is a very easy way for the government to demonstrate it agrees with the science on climate change and is committed to reducing emissions \u2013 set a target to reduce emissions that agrees with the science. The IPCC made this pretty clear for governments in its \u201csummary for policymakers\u201d report released in October 2018. It stated that to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, \u201chuman-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching \u2018net zero\u2019 around 2050\u201d. We should pause here and note that within six months of this very clear statement, the Coalition went to the election with a target of a 26% cut from 2005 levels by 2030, while the ALP went with a target of a 45% cut. And of course the focus of the debate from most of the media was on the cost of the 45% cut rather than why the Coalition was ignoring the science. A damning moment for our media. Boris Johnson of all people has committed to zero net emissions by 2050, but our government will not, cowed as it is by people such as senator Matt Canavan who tweeted this week: \u201cThere is a simple reason that Labor won\u2019t cost its net zero emissions policy because net zero emissions = net zero jobs!\u201d As the Australian Institute\u2019s Matt Grudnoff noted, \u201cnet zero jobs\u201d actually means any jobs lost will be balanced by job gains, which is perhaps not what Canavan is trying to argue. This brings me to the second point \u2013 this is not an astonishing target. It is in effect just what the ALP was already planning. Getting to zero net emissions by 2050 goes along the same path as aiming for a 45% cut by 2030, as we can see in the graph. I say this not to discount the policy, but to highlight that given it is in line with what the ALP was already targeting and also is what a conservative government in the UK is planning, the big issue is not that the ALP has this target, but that the government does not. It is based on the science and it also will greatly benefit our economy. I have written in the past that getting to zero net zero emissions is going to be tough. If it was easy it would have been done already, so let us not lie and say it can be done with no pain. It will require a huge change in our economy. But the good news is it will hugely benefit our economy and nation. The CSIRO has estimated that if we continue on our current path, our GDP out to 2060 will grow by just 2.1% annually; but if we target zero net emissions by 2050, our economy will be so transformed and improved that our GDP will grow on average each year by 2.75% and real wages will be greatly improved. Doing nothing is not the answer \u2013 it is economic degradation. We must get to zero net emissions by at least 2050, and the ALP target \u2013 which will need strong interim targets as well \u2013 must be the baseline from which all climate-change policy debate occurs. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "The British army has relinquished control of its last remaining military headquarters in Germany following 75 years in the country, ahead of the final withdrawal of serving personnel. Following the second world war, the UK was among a number of allied nations to retain a military presence in Germany but it halved the amount of soldiers after the fall of the iron curtain. About 20,000 British service personnel have been steadily withdrawn since 2010 during \u201cOperation Owl\u201d under cost-cutting measures announced by former prime minister David Cameron. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed the UK would continue to have a military presence in Germany beyond 2020 once the withdrawal of British army units to the UK has been completed. However, around 185 British army personnel and 60 MoD civilians are set to remain. An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cThe closure of Catterick Barracks Bielefeld marks the withdrawal of 20,000 British personnel from Germany. Since 2010 we\u2019ve taken care to make this process as smooth as possible for our people and their families. \u201cAs a founding member of Nato we will continue to work closely with our European partners and will maintain a presence in Germany.\u201d Catterick Barracks has been the last remaining headquarters for the British forces in Germany since 2013. On Thursday, a flag-lowering ceremony marked the handover of the base in Bielefeld to the German authorities following the steady re-basing of thousands of troops under Operation Owl. \u201cToday, I think, not only for me but for the British forces as a whole, means the end of an era,\u201d said Lt Col Tony Maw, the officer commanding the Germany Enabling Office, according to Forces Network. \u201cToday also marks the start of a new era, with our footprint now firmly set up in Sennelager with the Germany Enabling Office.\u201d In the UK, Salisbury Jobcentre Plus is assisting veterans and the spouses of serving personnel to access benefits, employment and support. Hundreds of new homes have been built for returning families in the three garrison towns of Bulford, Tidworth and Larkhill in recent years, since most will be repatriated to Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. But they have been warned the homes will be much smaller than those they have been residing in.",

So he splits from them and finds himself befriending an itinerant Chinese worker called King Lu (Orion Lee), and for a while, the pair seem no more than a couple of hobos, finding common cause in their own loneliness.

      "body": "<p>Graeme Armstrong, 28, grew up in Airdrie, east of Glasgow. He was involved with gang culture from a young age. Expelled from school in his mid-teens, he transferred to Coatbridge high school, and went on to study English literature at Stirling University. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-young-team-9781529017328.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Young Team</em></a>, his first novel, is a raw and lyrical Bildungsroman that traces the life of Azzy Williams, a smart, secretly sensitive boy growing up in a rough Scottish town where he is drawn to gangs, drugs and crime. The book is written in a voice that recalls Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner \u2013 dialect that fizzes off the page.</p> <p><strong>How much of Azzy Williams is your own experience?</strong><br>I was engaged in gangs in the local community, in North Lanarkshire. I spent many, many years living the life of Azzy Williams. His voice is a mouthpiece for my own experience. Of course he\u2019s a fictional character in a fictional world, but his voice and my voice are akin.</p> <p><strong>How did you come to write the book?</strong><br>I stopped taking drugs on Christmas Day 2012. I was in my first weeks of withdrawal and I had tried to stop taking drugs before and it\u2019s quite a lonely space. I didn\u2019t hang around with friends much at that point. I was pretty isolated, up in my university in Stirling, just sitting smoking cigarettes in my flat. I was thinking about Ken Loach\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/oct/04/artsfeatures4\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Sixteen</em></a>, how good that was, how it was the first time my generation had been portrayed: kids of the 90s and 00s. I saw my life in that. I thought: I\u2019m going to write a film that\u2019ll be the next <em>Sweet Sixteen</em>. After about 15 minutes I realised that writing films wasn\u2019t for me. Then I wrote three words on the page: \u201cThe Young Team.\u201d I thought: \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d \u2013 and I just started writing. I bashed out the first draft there and then. It was an outpouring. By the end of 2015, I had about 250,000 words and everything since then has been editing, cutting back. It has taken almost seven years altogether.</p> <p><strong>Would you agree that there\u2019s a certain nostalgia for your time in gangs that comes through in the book?</strong><br>Absolutely. I think part of the seductive nature of gangs is that there is a brotherhood between gang members. It\u2019s a tough environment, a very masculine environment, where young men are under intense pressure to put up these hard fronts. In the brotherhood of a gang setting you find safety in numbers, but also camaraderie. In my own experience, when I stopped hanging about with gangs and stopped taking drugs and moved to the city, I felt a kind of loneliness.</p> <p><strong>You write brilliantly about drugs and violence, both of which tend to lie outside the realm of language.\u2026</strong><br>You\u2019re right that they do transcend the normal vocabulary of how we say things. When it came to violence, it was all about pace for me. Violence in real life is much more confusing than it is in films. It\u2019s very, very quick, and afterwards, you don\u2019t always remember things, and that\u2019s just adrenaline. You remember what happens to you afterwards, the injuries or whatever, but the violence itself is often just a blur. In the book I increase pace to give these frantic moments, but they\u2019re not tales of heroism. Azzy is the victim of gang violence on numerous occasions. He\u2019s always covered in \u201ceggs\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s something I remember, that you always had these lumps all over you. You didn\u2019t feel them at the time because you were drunk so often, but you felt them afterwards.</p> <p><strong>The dialect is, in places, quite hard for the uninitiated to follow. Did this worry you?</strong><br>The first versions I wrote, I think they were much harder, much more true to life. They were what we\u2019d call MSN speak, which was the chatroom we all used. It was almost indecipherable to others. I met Janice Galloway at Stirling University and she offered to read some of my work. She said to me: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you the same thing I told Irvine Welsh: you\u2019ve got to cut back on the dialect.\u201d So I thought if it\u2019s good enough for him, it\u2019s certainly good enough for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I sanitised it, but I rewrote in a way that was more legible, and with an awareness of the fact that there would be people who would be reading this book and may struggle.</p> <p><strong>What was the last great book you</strong><strong> read?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/17/this-is-memorial-device-david-keenan-review\" title=\"\"><em>This Is Memorial Device</em></a> by David Keenan.</p> <p><strong>Which novelists or non</strong><strong>fiction writers working today do you most admire?</strong><br>The ones that have really left an impact on me recently: Sally Rooney, both of her books, <em>Conversations With Friends</em> and <em>Normal People</em>. It\u2019s outside my normal sphere of reading but it\u2019s really, really tremendous writing. Very sparse but so accomplished.

I\u2019ve not been doing as much reading as I would like, with all this work. My reading pile by my bed is turning into a Jenga tower.</p> <p><strong>What was the last classic </strong><strong>you read?</strong><br><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>. It wasn\u2019t what I had expected for such a classic.</p> <p><strong>What book would you give to a 10-year-old?</strong><br><em>The Hobbit</em>. That was one that I was exposed to really young and it captivated me.</p> <p><strong>What sort of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I read a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/may/16/goosebumps-rl-stine-what-you-didn-t-know\" title=\"\">Goosebumps</a> to tell you the truth, and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that. They were fantastic, I loved all that stuff. Quite young \u2013 very early high school if not primary school \u2013 I was on crime fiction. Ian Rankin and all of that sort of stuff.</p> <p><strong>How do you organise your books on your shelves?</strong><br>I\u2019ve got different shelves for different things.

She said to me: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you the same thing I told Irvine Welsh: you\u2019ve got to cut back on the dialect.\u201d So I thought if it\u2019s good enough for him, it\u2019s certainly good enough for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I sanitised it, but I rewrote in a way that was more legible, and with an awareness of the fact that there would be people who would be reading this book and may struggle. What was the last great book you read? This Is Memorial Device by David Keenan. Which novelists or nonfiction writers working today do you most admire? The ones that have really left an impact on me recently: Sally Rooney, both of her books, Conversations With Friends and Normal People. It\u2019s outside my normal sphere of reading but it\u2019s really, really tremendous writing. Very sparse but so accomplished. Kerry Hudson\u2019s book Tony Hogan\u2026 and her memoir Lowborn. Jenny Fagan, The Panopticon, that left a huge impression on me. I\u2019ve not been doing as much reading as I would like, with all this work. My reading pile by my bed is turning into a Jenga tower. What was the last classic you read? The Catcher in the Rye. It wasn\u2019t what I had expected for such a classic. What book would you give to a 10-year-old? The Hobbit. That was one that I was exposed to really young and it captivated me. What sort of reader were you as a child? I read a lot of Goosebumps to tell you the truth, and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that. They were fantastic, I loved all that stuff. Quite young \u2013 very early high school if not primary school \u2013 I was on crime fiction. Ian Rankin and all of that sort of stuff. How do you organise your books on your shelves? I\u2019ve got different shelves for different things. I\u2019ve got a nonfiction shelf, a Scottish social realism shelf and a general fiction shelf. \u2022 Graeme Armstrong appears at Waterstones, Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow (5 March) and Aye Write! festival, Glasgow (12 March) \u2022 The Young Team by Graeme Armstrong is published by Picador (\u00a314.99).

Iran said later on Saturday that the number of cases in the country had risen to 28 and the number of deaths to five.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of new coronavirus cases in South Korea has doubled in a day to 433, officials in the country said.</strong> They suggested the tally could rise significantly as more than 1,000 people who attended a church at the centre of the outbreak reported flu-like symptoms. More than half of the national cases are linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-south-korea-sees-huge-jump-cases-china-hubei-wuhan-outbreak-\">a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cpatient 31\u201d who attended religious services </a>at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The woman had no recent record of overseas travel, authorities said.</li> \n   <li><strong>The disease is severe or critical in 20% of cases, mild in 80% and has been fatal in 2% of cases</strong>, the WHO said. Tedros said more research was needed to explain the relatively few cases among children. </li> \n   <li><strong>The director general said the biggest concern continued to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems. </strong>\u201cWe have also published a strategic preparedness and response plan, with a call for $675m (\u00a3510m) to support countries, especially those which are most vulnerable.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>China said the daily count of new virus cases there fell significantly to 397, though another 109 people died of Covid-19.</strong> Most of the new cases and all but three of the deaths were in Hubei province, where the outbreak started.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote> \n   <br> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-22T11:01:08.502Z\">at 11.01am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

Five people have now died from the coronavirus in Iran, prompting World Health Organization head to say Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus he was especially concerned about the country. Carnival celebrations were banned in some Italian towns after they were placed on lockdown following the deaths of two people from the coronavirus. The UK residents who were trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan for more than two weeks were sent to an isolation facility on Merseyside for a further 14 days of isolation at a facility after landing back in the south of England on a Ministry of Defence flight. A British couple diagnosed with the coronavirus also have pneumonia, after spending two weeks in quarantine onboard the coronavirus-stricken Princess Diamond. The family of David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, said they had been moved to a \u201cprison\u201d-like hospital. Around 100 more passengers were allowed to disembark from the cruise ship on Saturday, as Japan\u2019s health minister apologised after 23 others were allowed to leave without being properly tested. Around 150 people brought to a hotel in Milton Keynes earlier this month after being evacuated from Wuhan will be discharged tomorrow following a two-week period in quarantine. There is uncertainty in Singapore, where eight out of 85 infections appear to have no links to previous cases, and in South Korea, where links to a controversial church are being investigated. Samsung shut a mobile device factory in South Korea after a worker tested positive for coronavirus, while organisers for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics postponed training for volunteers because of the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of Filipino couples participated in a mass wedding wearing face masks because of coronavirus fears following health tests provided by officials. A restaurant owner in Yulha-dong, Daegu, the city at the heart of South Korea\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, likened his deserted surroundings to Gotham City to be. We are now going to close today\u2019s live blog. Thank you for reading. Thousands of members of a secretive religious sect in South Korea are being screened for the new coronavirus after more than 430 cases were confirmed in the country by officials, the Guardian\u2019s Rebecca Ratcliffe reports with Nemo Kim in Seoul. Around 150 people brought to the Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre in Milton Keynes earlier this month after being evacuated from Wuhan will be discharged tomorrow. They arrived in the UK on February 9, having been on a second evacuation flight from the virus-hit city, and the Department of Health confirmed that the 14-day quarantine period will come to an end on Sunday but did not say what time the group would be released. The group will have been regularly tested for any signs of the virus during the quarantine period. As of Saturday afternoon there had been no new cases of coronavirus detected in the UK, the department said. COVID-19 is now confirmed to have infected 52 people across Italy: 39 in Lombardy, 12 in Veneto, 1 in Turin and a suspected case in Umbria. The viral outbreak that began in China has infected nearly 78,000 people globally and, on Friday, Italy became the first country in Europe to report the death of one of its own nationals from the coronavirus, triggering a lockdown in about a dozen towns. Around 100 more passengers were allowed to disembark from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship on Saturday, as Japan\u2019s health minister apologised after 23 others were allowed to leave without being properly tested, AFP reports. The 100 passengers included the last group of Japanese passengers to leave the ship, while some foreign passengers were still waiting onboard for chartered aircraft to be sent by their governments. About 970 passengers disembarked earlier this week. Television footage showed a driver in a white protective suit at the wheel of a bus with the curtains drawn so that passengers could not be identified. They will be quarantined for two weeks near Tokyo, officials said. At a news conference, the health minister, Katsunobu Kat\u014d, apologised that 23 passengers had been allowed to disembark without undergoing all the required tests. \u201cWe deeply regret that our operational mistake caused the situation,\u201d Kat\u014d said, adding that the passengers would be tested again. With the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still onboard as many of them did not undergo isolation because they were needed to keep the ship running. They were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to say they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly Covid-19 disease. Kat\u014d defended Japan\u2019s onboard quarantine, telling a TV programme on Saturday that there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3,000 people at once. Should we panic about the spread of coronavirus? My Guardian colleagues Sarah Boseley, Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam have the answer to that question and others in this explainer. For the record, their answer on whether we should panic is: No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. Andrew Tatem, a professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, said the new cases outside China were worrying: Prior to the recent news of apparent outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran, it seemed like the relatively low number of cases outside of China and with no link to travelling there pointed to hope that the virus could be contained. This recent news, particularly regarding Iran, is especially worrying, and [WHO director general] Dr [Tedros Adhanom] Ghebreyesus\u2019 assessment that the window of opportunity for containing the outbreak is narrowing is certainly correct. The fact that cases have been confirmed in both Canada and Lebanon that seem to have come from Iran suggests that a significant outbreak is ongoing there and may have been occurring for some time. Given the relative rarity of international travel across a whole national population typically, especially a country like Iran where international travel may be rarer per capita than for high-income countries like in North America and Europe, exported cases seen internationally can often represent the tip of an iceberg of something occurring in the origin country. Iran normally has some strong travel connections to countries where health systems may be weaker, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan \u2013 importations and outbreaks here would be particularly concerning in terms of capacities to detect the virus and contain spread. Speaking at Arrowe Park, where the British citizens brought home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan are headed, the chief executive of Wirral teaching hospital NHS trust, Janelle Holmes, said: There was a lot of preparation that went in for our Wuhan guests who successfully left and had been really appreciative of the support and help that we provided. That has given us a blueprint for building on that for the new arrival of guests. I was pleased for the staff and partners who had spent such lot of time making sure their stay was as comfortable as possible and clearly I think because we did such a good job we were asked to support this group of travellers that are coming back from a cruise in Japan. The group of people is slightly different. Obviously they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China but we are working exactly the same as we did before with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us. Holmes praised the support of the local community \u2013 including donations from schools and scout groups \u2013 for evacuees based at Arrowe Park and also thanked staff previously living in the quarantine accommodation blocks for their patience as they stay in nearby hotels. Thousands of Russia-linked social media accounts are attempting to spread panic about the coronavirus outbreak, US officials said. They said the disinformation campaign promoted unfounded conspiracy theories that the US was behind the outbreak, in an apparent attempt to damage its international standing. False personas are being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points and conspiracies, including suggesting that the CIA is behind the virus that has claimed more than 2,300 lives, mostly in China. Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, said: Russia\u2019s intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns. By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response. Couples in Philippines marry wearing masks \u2013 video Hundreds of Filipino couples participated in a mass wedding wearing face masks because of coronavirus fears. As part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus, officials in the city of Bacolod conducted health tests and provided the 220 couples with masks before they tied the knot The UK residents who were trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan for more than two weeks are en route to a further 14 days of isolation at a facility on Merseyside, after landing back in the south of England (see 11.47am). Thirty-two masked British and European evacuees from the vessel are being bussed with a police escort to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, where they will spend a fortnight in quarantine to protect against the spread of the illness should any of them be infected. The group, who tested negative for Covid-19 before they flew, are expected to arrive at the hospital later on Saturday afternoon. As with the previous coach loads of people brought to Arrowe Park, the bus drivers did not appear to be wearing any protective clothing as the convoy, escorted by police and ambulance vehicles, was pictured leaving the MoD base. Before the flight, one passenger who was diagnosed with Covid-19 at a Japanese hospital but was since given the all-clear said he expected the experience would be like visiting a holiday camp. Alan Steele, who was on honeymoon with his wife, Wendy, wrote on Facebook: \u201cWendy\u2019s test was negative so \u2018Butlins the Wirral\u2019 here we come for 14 days.\u201d Since being kept onboard the cruise liner in the port of Yokohama, 634 passengers and crew have been infected \u2013 accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China. It is understood some British nationals who are part of the Diamond Princess crew opted to remain. Italy is taking evasive action after the deaths of two people from coronavirus (see 10.38am). AFP has the latest: In Codogno, streets were mostly deserted and few shops were open after the mayor put the town of 15,000 on temporary lockdown on Friday. A 38-year-old man from the town is in intensive care, and his pregnant wife and another man have also tested positive for the virus. Three others have tested positive in initial tests, but are awaiting results of a second round. \u201cNo entry\u201d, read the sign outside Codogno\u2019s emergency room. Only a bakery and a few businesses were open, with many shops posting signs saying they were closed due to the lockdown, which could last as long as five days. In the areas under lockdown in northern Italy, public activities such as carnival celebrations, church masses and sporting events have been banned for up to a week. In the town of Casalpusterlengo, a billboard instructed residents to stay in their homes. In most towns, bars, restaurants and libraries have been closed, and in the small city of Cremona, about 25 minutes east of Codogno, school has been cancelled. The World Health Organization says it is taking precautions for the arrival of the new coronavirus in Africa. Earlier today, its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a briefing that the WHO\u2019S biggest concern was the potential for the virus to spread in countries with weaker health systems. There have been more than 200 suspected cases in the WHO\u2019s AFRO region, which includes most African countries, though nearly all have been confirmed negative, the regional director, Matshidiso Rebecca Moeti, said on Saturday. Egypt is the only African country to have recorded a confirmed case. The African Union commission chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat, told officials to take \u201cdrastic preventive and control measures.\u201d He said: Our dear continent, Africa, is particularly at risk, given its relatively fragile health systems. Yoon-sook Lee, a restaurant owner in Yulha-dong, Daegu, the city at the heart of South Korea\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, said: It is literally like how I imagine Gotham City to be. Streets are deserted and those who are outside are half-running as if they are all in a hurry or being chased. I run a restaurant which serves takeaway lunches for special events. As all events are being cancelled, all my orders have been cancelled. From the evening of the 19th, I\u2019ve noticed that people are stockpiling water and instant noodles. It\u2019s also difficult to buy masks. I had to queue up for two hours at Costco to get a single box of 20 masks. We try and stay indoors as much as possible and when we do have to venture outside, we make sure to wear a mask. We try and wash our hands as often as possible even when we\u2019re at home. I\u2019m starting to feel panicky as I\u2019m worried about my family. I have young children so I\u2019m worried about them. I\u2019m also getting really worried about how long this will go on as it will affect our family\u2019s income from the restaurant. I\u2019m getting news from TV and social media but I think there is also a lot of fake news. Last month in Daegu, some YouTubers pretended to be chasing down an infected person on the subway and it was found to be fake. Everyone thought how ridiculous they were but now things don\u2019t seem so far off from what they were filming. A British couple diagnosed with coronavirus after spending two weeks in quarantine onboard the Princess Diamond have contracted pneumonia. The family of David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, said they had been moved to a \u201cprison\u201d-like hospital. The couple were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary when it was placed in quarantine. Mr Abel has now been diagnosed with acute pneumonia, while his wife has mild pneumonia. Although they were originally in a hospital just 90 minutes from the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship, Mrs Abel called her son in the middle of the night to say the couple were suddenly being moved to a different \u201cthree-star\u201d hospital. It took seven hours for the family to track down which hospital they had been taken to. Princess Cruises have sent the Abels a mobile phone that can make calls to their family. Steve Abel, their son, posted video updates on the couple\u2019s YouTube channel alongside his wife Roberta on Friday night and Saturday morning. Speaking on Friday evening, he said: They are in a really bad way. Dad is very weak. He can\u2019t walk around \u2013 he\u2019s in a wheelchair now. I haven\u2019t seen him in a wheelchair, but mum tells me he has to be put in a wheelchair to go from the ambulance to the hospital. They are really distressed. His exact words to me were, \u2018this has to stop now, we can\u2019t take any more of this. It\u2019s like a prison.\u2019\u201d He said his parents were left in a hospital room that has no shower or bathing facilities, and were only provided with basic paper towels: They haven\u2019t eaten properly. Neither of them can eat the food. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, they haven\u2019t had any treatments. They have been told they won\u2019t get any treatments, but have been told they will see if they test negative for the coronavirus in two or three days and if they test negative twice they can go \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t treat the pneumonia, which is what we are so worried about. On Saturday morning he posted a second update and said: They have spoken to a doctor who can liaise with them a bit better. That is really reassuring and has done a lot for their mental wellbeing. They are brighter today and seem a lot happier, but they are still in the same situation. The family have said they are willing to fly out to Japan to bring the couple home. Roberta Abel said: \u201cWe are in fight mode now, we just want them back.\u201d She criticised the reaction of the Foreign Office, and said their response had been \u201cnext to useless\u201d. She said in an update on Saturday morning: \u201cWe do not believe they are in the best possible place like the Foreign Office are telling people.\u201d A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe welfare of all British nationals is of the highest priority to the UK government. We are working with the Japanese authorities to ensure those British nationals who are remaining in Japan for health reasons get the best care possible.\u201d Iran, facing the potential closure of some of its borders, has ordered extra supplies of face masks, disinfectants and gloves as worried Iranians responded to the sudden outbreak of coronavirus that has so far claimed five lives in the country. The health ministry announced on Saturday that 10 new cases of coronavirus had been detected, including one person who has died. Both Iraq and Turkey were placing restrictions on visitors from Iran. A health ministry spokesman, Kianush Jahanpur, said the new numbers brought the total number of cases of the new coronavirus in Iran to 28, with five deaths. Extra diagnostic supplies have been sent to the country by the World Health Organization. The ministry said it would take steps to prevent pharmacists exploiting the rise in demand for masks amid reports that prices were being doubled or even inflated by five times. The number of people wearing masks has visibly increased over the past 48 hours in the capital, Tehran, with some commuters avoiding the underground and other crowded public spaces. Earlier reports said two patients had died in Qom on Thursday. Most of the new cases include people living in Qom and those who have visited the religious city, an hour\u2019s drive south of Tehran, during the past week. A local Tehran mayor was among those reported to have contracted the virus, provoking concern that other politicians that had recently met with him were at risk. At one point it was reported that Tehran city council was to be shut for a week, but this was later denied. Jahanpur said earlier that 735 patients with symptoms similar to flu had been hospitalised in various cities. A flight carrying 32 British and European evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship has landed in the UK, PA Media reports. The plane, which also carried British government and medical staff, touched down at Ministry of Defence base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire shortly after 11.30am. Passengers will now be taken by road to Arrowe Park hospital, Wirral, for 14 days\u2019 quarantine to protect against the spread of the illness should any of them be infected. They have so far tested negative for Covid-19. The evacuees have spent more than two weeks trapped on the coronavirus-stricken ship off the coast of Japan. It is unclear where the small number of EU citizens who were also on the plane will be taken. The four Britons onboard the Diamond Princess who have tested positive for coronavirus were not on the flight. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: We have brought 32 British and European citizens safely home from Japan. The FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] worked hard to get them back to the UK securely. Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals. Arrowe Park was previously used to host 83 British nationals for a 14-day quarantine period earlier in February after they were flown out of Wuhan in China, which has been at the centre of the outbreak. Young-mi Lee (not her real name) is a member of the church at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea. More than half of the cases in the country are linked to a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cpatient 31\u201d who attended religious services of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an abbreviation of \u201cNew Heaven and New Earth\u201d, a fast-growing secretive fringe sect that mainstream Christian groups describe as a cult. Young-mi said: I didn\u2019t attend the Daegu service this time but I have attended mass services before in Daegu. It is near Cheongdo, the birthplace of the founder of our religion, so we often hold mass services in Daegu. When I attend a service in Daegu, there are several hundred in attendance. It is very busy. I haven\u2019t been tested yet and I don\u2019t know who has been tested but we\u2019re all very worried about the virus and about the negative impact this situation is having on our religion. I heard that the church headquarters gave the list of attendees to the authorities. I\u2019m taking all the precautions that other Koreans are taking, such as wearing a mask and washing hands. The church leaders have told us that this is a test by the devil as he is jealous of the expansion of our church and I believe that is the case. I hope that this situation will make our church stronger. We get persecuted by other people as it is, so this situation is even tougher for us. I don\u2019t know anyone who is ill and I believe those who are ill will become well very soon. Samsung Electronics said on Saturday that one coronavirus case had been confirmed at its mobile device factory complex in the South Korean city of Gumi, causing a shutdown of its entire facility there until Monday morning, Reuters reports. Samsung, the world\u2019s top smartphone maker, said the floor where the infected employee worked would be shut down until the morning of 25 February. It added: The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the infected employee in self-quarantine and taken steps to have them tested for possible infection. Gumi is close to the city of Daegu, home to a church at the centre of South Korea\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak. South Korea said on Saturday that the number of people infected with the coronavirus in the country had more than doubled to 433. A 70-year-old man in China\u2019s Hubei province was infected with coronavirus but did not show symptoms until 27 days later, the local government said on Saturday, suggesting the virus\u2019s incubation period could be much longer than the presumed 14 days. A longer incubation period could complicate efforts to contain the epidemic that has so far killed more than 2,000 people and spread outside China. On 24 January, the man, only identified by his family name, Jiang, drove his car back to Shennongjia, in north-western Hubei, from eastern Ezhou, where he had close contact with his sister, who had been infected, according to the government website of Hubei. He had a fever on 20 February and tested positive for coronavirus a day later, according to the government statement. Organisers for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics have postponed training for volunteers because of the spread of the coronavirus in Japan, Reuters reports. Training was scheduled to start today but will be rescheduled, the organising committee said in a statement released late on Friday. The postponement of training will not affect other preparations, and organisers are not considering cancelling the games, the statement said. A repatriation flight carrying 32 British and European evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship is due to arrive in the UK on Saturday morning after departing from Japan late on Friday, PA Media reports. The Foreign Office said the evacuation flight also had British government and medical staff on board. The plane is due to land at Boscombe Down military base, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, with passengers to then be taken to Arrowe Park hospital, Wirral, for 14 days of quarantine. It is unclear where the small number of EU citizens will be taken once the plane lands in the UK. The evacuees have spent more than two weeks trapped on the coronavirus-stricken ship off the coast of Japan. Since being kept on board the cruise liner in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China. It is understood some British nationals who are part of the Diamond Princess crew opted to remain. Some British nationals who were passengers did not register for the flight. It is understood some have returned to their homes overseas, while a number boarded an evacuation flight to Hong Kong where they live. The four Britons onboard the Diamond Princess who have tested positive for coronavirus were not on the flight. Meanwhile, Britons in Cambodia who left another cruise ship, the Westerdam, and who have been cleared for travel, are also being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. All have tested negative after one case was diagnosed on board. AP has collated the latest figures on known infections \u2013 totalling almost 78,000 \u2013 and deaths by country: Mainland China: 2,345 deaths among 76,288 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 69 cases, 2 deaths Macao: 10 cases Japan: 754 cases, including 634 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 3 deaths South Korea: 433 cases, 2 deaths Singapore: 86 cases United States: 35 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Thailand: 35 cases Iran: 28 cases, 5 deaths Taiwan: 26 cases, 1 death Australia: 23 cases Malaysia: 22 Italy: 19 cases; 1 death Vietnam: 16 cases Germany: 16 France: 12 cases, 1 death United Arab Emirates: 11 cases United Kingdom: 9 Canada: 9 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 cases Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Lebanon: 1 Israel: 1 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Two people in Italy have died of coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 34, Italian media reported on Saturday. Adriano Trevisan, 78, from Veneto, died on Friday night, while the virus also killed a woman in the Lombardy region. Thirty-two people in Italy are confirmed to have contracted the virus \u2013 27 in Lombardy, four in Veneto and three in Lazio. Another 250 people are in quarantine as they await test results in Lombardy, and 10 towns in the region are in lockdown after authorities warned people to stay home and avoid social contact, Corriere della Sera reported. The first locally transmitted case in Italy was that of a 38-year-old Italian man in Lombardy. The man, who is in intensive care, may have contracted the disease after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China, even though the colleague had tested negative for the virus. An active runner, the 38-year-old recently took part in a number of races. His pregnant wife is also infected, as is a person who went running with the man. Three other cases in Lombardy are elderly people who frequented a bar in the town of Codogno, near Lodi, that is owned by the father of the man who went running with the 38-year-old. Meanwhile, 19 Italians evacuated from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan arrived back in Italy on Saturday morning and were quarantined at a military barracks near Rome. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: We have put in place all measures at the highest precautionary level. It is not the time to blame ourselves for anything, we must continue to monitor and be ready to review some measures. At the centre of the outbreak in South Korea is the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an abbreviation of \u201cNew Heaven and New Earth\u201d, a fast-growing secretive fringe sect that mainstream Christian groups describe as a cult. The church, with about 200,000 members, was founded in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, who claims to be an angel sent by Jesus Christ to create God\u2019s kingdom on earth. Videos of services show attendees sitting close together on the floor in rows, singing and chanting in unison. Media reports citing former members of the church said many would attend church regardless of illness and were banned from wearing anything on their faces, including face masks or eye glasses. The church is often criticised for its recruitment methods. Members target already established believers attending mainstream churches and often do not disclose their affiliation with the church. New members are encouraged to distance themselves from friends and family who were not part of the sect. The church has more than 300 mission centres in 15 countries, including China. In response to questions over whether the church had a branch in Wuhan, it said in a statement on its website that it has more than 120 students in China enrolled in its bible course. (Members must complete an eight-month bible study course and an exam in order to join the church.) The church said there was no physical building or meeting place. The church said on its website that it had shut all branches and centres and was disinfecting its facilities. It responded to criticism of its worship services by saying its members sit on the floor \u201conly to accommodate as many people as possible in a confined space\u201d. Its pastor described the virus as the \u201cwork of the devil\u201d to halt Shincheonji\u2019s fast growth. \u201cJust like Job\u2019s faith was tested, it is an attempt to destroy our progress,\u201d he said in an internal message reported by Yonhap news agency. Welcome to our continued coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. The director general of the WHO (World Health Organization), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, gave a press conference this morning. Here is a summary of the latest developments: The director-general of the WHO expressed concern about coronavirus cases with no contact with a confirmed infected person nor travel history to China. He said: \u201cAlthough the total number of Covid-19 cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to or contact with a confirmed case.\u201d Tedros said the WHO was \u201cespecially concerned\u201d about the increase in the number of cases in Iran. He said testing kits had been supplied to the Islamic Republic where there had been 18 cases and four deaths in the past two days. Iran said later on Saturday that the number of cases in the country had risen to 28 and the number of deaths to five. The number of new coronavirus cases in South Korea has doubled in a day to 433, officials in the country said. They suggested the tally could rise significantly as more than 1,000 people who attended a church at the centre of the outbreak reported flu-like symptoms. More than half of the national cases are linked to a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cpatient 31\u201d who attended religious services at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The woman had no recent record of overseas travel, authorities said. The disease is severe or critical in 20% of cases, mild in 80% and has been fatal in 2% of cases, the WHO said. Tedros said more research was needed to explain the relatively few cases among children. The director general said the biggest concern continued to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems. \u201cWe have also published a strategic preparedness and response plan, with a call for $675m (\u00a3510m) to support countries, especially those which are most vulnerable.\u201d China said the daily count of new virus cases there fell significantly to 397, though another 109 people died of Covid-19. Most of the new cases and all but three of the deaths were in Hubei province, where the outbreak started.",

I\u2019ve had people calling me up out of the blue, asking how they can help, and what they can do. There are loads of people coming here on the day to make sure the event goes well,\u201d she said. For me, the Marcus Lipton centre has offered the opportunity to learn from, serve and feel part of this community since I moved to Brixton five years ago. If we are serious about moving beyond the dark cloud of London\u2019s youth violence epidemic, we must cherish and empower our public spaces more than ever. In 2017, I asked my mentor, Ira Campbell \u2013 Marcus Lipton\u2019s wise managing director \u2013 about the centre\u2019s purpose. \u201cKids that come to places like this, it\u2019s their escape from everything else they\u2019ve got going on in their household, in their school,\u201d he replied passionately. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where they can be free for a bit.\u201d Ciaran Thapar\u2019s book, Cut Short, is forthcoming from Penguin Viking UK. A fundraising initiative for the Marcus Lipton centre has just been launched",

I was just waiting for the red card to be shown \u2013 not with real pleasure \u2013 because it\u2019s just a tackle that endangers the player. That\u2019s what VAR was brought in for, to see things that the referee and the pitch-side [official] don\u2019t see. \u201cIt\u2019s just not good enough. Saying afterwards that they made a mistake is not good enough because they had a couple of minutes to try to get it right. They probably needed one viewing of that one to get it right. It\u2019s another huge question mark on VAR. This one doesn\u2019t need [the referee to look at] a pitch-side monitor. It\u2019s a clear decision, a human decision. So Stockley Park, red card.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho merely sought to highlight the times when he felt VAR had hurt his team. \u201cI hope the noise is the same noise as when the VAR kills us,\u201d the Tottenham manager said. \u201cAs against Liverpool when [Andrew] Robertson should get a red card and didn\u2019t; against Watford when [\u00c9tienne] Capoue should get a red card twice, with the same gentleman, Michael Oliver. I hope noise is the same noise.\u201d Because the incident was seen by an official who chose not to take action, the FA confirmed that Lo Celso will escape retrospective punishment despite the VAR\u2019s volte\u2011face. The former Chelsea manager had said on Friday that he knew Lampard would play a formation with three centre-halves, raising a spying subplot. Lampard said he was serious about his belief that Mourinho had tapped into an old contact at the Chelsea training ground. \u201cThat\u2019s the world we live in,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI\u2019m not being sinister about it. Whether someone has worked previously at the club, I think that that can happen. We\u2019d been working on a back three for two or three days. I am not that trusting in all ways, in everybody, but that\u2019s life.\u201d Mourinho appeared to backtrack when he said Lampard always went to three central defenders in times of bad results. \u201cNo one leaked me anything,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThey are loyal to him.\u201d",

Maybe it is, maybe not.</p> <p>Online dating sites have been around for too long for the genie to be put back into the bottle. Nor is it necessary, but do we all need to wake up, just in terms of safety? This isn\u2019t about victim-blaming \u2013 only one person was responsible for Millane\u2019s death. Nor is it about morality \u2013 I couldn\u2019t care less who people sleep with or how long they\u2019ve known them. This is about women deserving to be safe and how the online dating model fails them, not least by putting a covert pressure on them to casually put themselves at risk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/a-life-sentence-grace-millane-leaves-trail-of-shattered-lives\">'A life sentence': Grace Millane murder leaves trail of shattered lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It could be said that much of the no-strings, arguably male-centric online hooking-up model fails anyone who\u2019s looking for a relationship. But, for now, let\u2019s focus purely on safety. Online dating has effectively normalised risk for women. Chatting online produces a mirage of familiarity where normal rules become blurred, making it easy for people to forget that, when they meet, they\u2019re on a blind date.</p> <p>Of course, any kind of dating is risky \u2013 life is risky \u2013 but when it comes to one on one, alone in a room, a woman would usually be physically weaker than a man and therefore less able to fend off an attack. It doesn\u2019t mean that men aren\u2019t sometimes vulnerable, rather that women are nearly <em>always</em> vulnerable \u2013 they\u2019re always taking a chance.</p> <p>However casual the encounter, women need to protect themselves, not just by initially meeting in a public place, but also by listing their locations all the way through and perhaps taking a photo of themselves with their date and storing it online. Don\u2019t apologise, just do it, be upfront and \u201cuncool\u201d about it. If someone doesn\u2019t like it, or calls you paranoid or weird, get out of there.</p> <p>Men need to start appreciating the huge risks women take with online dating or at least stop diminishing them. Sorry if this comes across as mumsy or prescriptive, but cases like this haunt me; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/a-life-sentence-grace-millane-leaves-trail-of-shattered-lives\" title=\"\">devastated families like the Millanes</a> break me.

      "bodyText": "Women, please never feel that you have to be \u201ccool\u201d about dating strangers you meet online. The killer of Grace Millane has been jailed for life, a minimum of 17 years, for strangling her to death in a hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand, after a Tinder date, the night before her 22nd birthday. Afterwards, the man, whose name has been suppressed, watched porn and took intimate \u201ctrophy\u201d photos of the British backpacker. He set up another date for the following day, leaving her body in the hotel room. When caught, he tried to plead the sinister, increasingly popular, \u201crough sex gone wrong\u201d defence. (The detective inspector in the case said: \u201cStrangling someone for five to 10 minutes until they die is not rough sex\u201d.) It might seem almost incidental that Millane met her killer online. Maybe it is, maybe not. Online dating sites have been around for too long for the genie to be put back into the bottle. Nor is it necessary, but do we all need to wake up, just in terms of safety? This isn\u2019t about victim-blaming \u2013 only one person was responsible for Millane\u2019s death. Nor is it about morality \u2013 I couldn\u2019t care less who people sleep with or how long they\u2019ve known them. This is about women deserving to be safe and how the online dating model fails them, not least by putting a covert pressure on them to casually put themselves at risk. It could be said that much of the no-strings, arguably male-centric online hooking-up model fails anyone who\u2019s looking for a relationship. But, for now, let\u2019s focus purely on safety. Online dating has effectively normalised risk for women. Chatting online produces a mirage of familiarity where normal rules become blurred, making it easy for people to forget that, when they meet, they\u2019re on a blind date. Of course, any kind of dating is risky \u2013 life is risky \u2013 but when it comes to one on one, alone in a room, a woman would usually be physically weaker than a man and therefore less able to fend off an attack. It doesn\u2019t mean that men aren\u2019t sometimes vulnerable, rather that women are nearly always vulnerable \u2013 they\u2019re always taking a chance. However casual the encounter, women need to protect themselves, not just by initially meeting in a public place, but also by listing their locations all the way through and perhaps taking a photo of themselves with their date and storing it online. Don\u2019t apologise, just do it, be upfront and \u201cuncool\u201d about it. If someone doesn\u2019t like it, or calls you paranoid or weird, get out of there. Men need to start appreciating the huge risks women take with online dating or at least stop diminishing them. Sorry if this comes across as mumsy or prescriptive, but cases like this haunt me; devastated families like the Millanes break me. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with casual sex, don\u2019t be casual about safety. Stormzy is on a roll with his Greggs card \u2013 vegan of course It must be refreshing for a celebrity to get a freebie that\u2019s useful in an ordinary, delicious way. Rapper Stormzy can\u2019t move for accolades but now that he\u2019s the first person to receive the Greggs concierge black card, he can order \u201cwhatever he wants, wherever, whenever\u201d.

Ah ... hold on, as I type Aaron Wilbraham pulls one back for Rochdale to make it 2-1.

League Two latest: Crawley Town have taken the lead against Stevenage again and this time the goal stands. Beryly Lubala fires the hosts ahead in the 21st minute.

Premier League: David Hytner was at Stamford Bridge, where Jose Mourinho\u2019s overly defensive set-up played into the hands of Frank Lampard. More on Stockley Park-gate: BT Sport analyst and former referee Peter Walton has now changed his mind and decided that Giovani Lo Celso should have been sent off for his stamp on Cesar Azpilicueta.

More on that contentious non-red at Stamford Bridge: John Cross is as bemused as everyone else ... Full time: Brentford 2-2 Blackburn Rovers Championship: Brentford make it three draws on the spin, coming from two goals down to rescue a point against Blackburn Rovers. They are in fourth place, three points off an automatic promotion place. Blackburn remain in eighth place, two points off the play-offs. Premier League: Despite conceding a late goal, Chelsea have run out fairly comfortable winners at Stamford Bridge. Frank Lampard rang the changes and each of those brought in to the team \u2013 Mason Mount, Olivier Giroud, Marcos Alonso and Ross Barkley \u2013 justified their inclusion with fine performances. Still in fourth place, Chelsea extend their lead over Tottenham to four points. Controversy at Stockley Park Have taken some time to decide that Tottenham midfielder Giovani Lo Celso should not have been sent off for an alleged stamp on Cesar Azpilicueto earlier in the second half, the VAR officials at Stockley Park are now reported to have said they made a mistake. \u201cIt\u2019s not a VAR error, but a human error,\u201d they say. Expect to hear more on what appears to be another VAR shambles. A VARce, if you will. Premier League: Erik Lamela has pulled one back for Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge, his shot from a tight angle creeping in after a deflection off the heel of Antonio Rudiger completely wrong-footed Willy Caballero.

League Two Joint top of the table with Exeter City but ahead on goal difference, Swindon Town host a Grimsby side that has lost just two out of 10 matches since the appointment of Ian Holloway. Exeter travel to Northampton, who could do with a result to maintain their push for the play-offs. View the League Two table League One Ahead of Coventry at the top of the table with the two sides separated by nothing more than goal difference, Rotherham travelling to Accrington Stanley, who are in 14th place. Coventry travel to take on a Rochdale side who are 10 points clear of the drop zone, but not so comfortable that they don\u2019t need to keep looking over their shoulder. With Bolton and Southend already looking dead and buried, Tranmere are in desperate need of points to close the seven-point gap between themselves and AFC Wimbledon. They travel to Wycombe, while Wimbledon entertain Blackpool. View the League One table Championship Wayne Rooney and Aleksandar Mitrovic got on the scoresheet as Derby County and Fulham played out a 1-1 draw at Pride Park last night. Making his 500th English league appearance, Rooney opened the scoring with an audacious Panenka penalty, only for Mitrovic to volley home an equaliser in the 71st minute. In today\u2019s early game, unlikely promotion-chasers Brentford host Blackburn Rovers at Griffin Park, where the visitors lead 1-0 and will go sixth, within two points of their rivals if they can hold on to their lead. View the Championship table Premier League The weekend\u2019s top flight action kicked off at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea are entertaining Tottenham.

View the Premier League table The winter break is behind us, which means that after two weeks worth of Premier League pickings that can only be described as slim, we have several top flight three o\u2019clock kick-offs to keep tabs on this Saturday.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe want to reverse the idea that humans are the only dominant species,\u201d says Simone Farresin, co-founder with Andrea Trimarchi of the Amsterdam-based design studio <a href=\"https://www.formafantasma.com/filter/home/news\" title=\"\">Formafantasma</a>. In particular, they are interested in trees. Whereas humans are \u201cobsessed with the whole body\u201d, trees can loses limbs and still thrive. Then there\u2019s tree sex, which involves the intervention of insects and birds. \u201cWithin the body of a tree,\u201d says Farresin, \u201cthere is both death and aliveness.\u201d</p> <p>Next month they open an exhibition at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/formafantasma-cambio\" title=\"\">Cambio</a>, for which the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/sunday-with-hans-ulrich-obrist-i-go-to-london-zoo-mostly-for-the-architecture\" title=\"\">Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>, invited them to provide \u201cmore a way of thinking than an exhibition of products\u201d. They have chosen to make the show about trees. It is about nothing but timber, and about everything to do with timber that you might imagine, from its molecular structure to its uses in everyday objects, to the laws and lore of forests. It takes in a genre of American portraiture that dwelt on the reflections of its sitters in their mahogany furniture, the intensity of the polish being a sign of wealth. It tells how indigenous people of the Amazonian basin use oral traditions to navigate the forest.</p> <p>At first glance, Farresin\u2019s and Trimarchi\u2019s CV is typical of many aspiring design practices. Founded 10 years ago, the studio has built a reputation among design cognoscenti through exquisite objects displayed at (for example) <a href=\"https://basel2020.designmiami.com/\" title=\"\">Design Miami</a>, a high-end fair dedicated to the rarefication of domestic objects to the point where they become valuable artistic collectibles. They have designed promotional installations for Fendi and Lexus. Their creations look like exceptionally skilled and stylish works, of a kind that sometimes adorn the world of products \u2013 a light fitting, for example, made of little more than its elegantly-looped and carefully specified power cable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A material for them is never something inert, to be bent to the designer\u2019s will. It has a life, a history, a voice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Closer acquaintance reveals Formafantasma (which roughly translates as \u201cghost form\u201d) to be more like alchemists, for whom all forms of knowledge of the world are ripe for inquiry. The shelves of their studio are like a latterday version of a 17th-century <em>Wunderkammer</em>, or cabinet of curiosities, in which objects of art and science were promiscuously mixed. In Formafantasma\u2019s version, vases made of shiny black lava cohabit with a light made of a cow\u2019s bladder, with a bell jar containing a balsa model of some kind of tower. Formafantasma\u2019s understanding of their materials is biochemical, technical, social, cultural, aesthetic, ecological, economic and geographic.</p> <p>Farresin, 39, the taller of the two, currently sporting a moustache, is from Vicenza, near Venice, the city of Andrea Palladio. Trimarchi, 36, trim-bearded, is from Taormina, the Sicilian city famous for its Roman ruins and scenic views of Etna. Partners in life as well as business, they met as undergraduates in Florence, where they learned from the 1960s-formed gurus who taught them that \u201cyou can have energy and joy in design, you can have fun\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe want to reverse the idea that humans are the only dominant species,\u201d says Simone Farresin, co-founder with Andrea Trimarchi of the Amsterdam-based design studio Formafantasma. In particular, they are interested in trees. Whereas humans are \u201cobsessed with the whole body\u201d, trees can loses limbs and still thrive. Then there\u2019s tree sex, which involves the intervention of insects and birds. \u201cWithin the body of a tree,\u201d says Farresin, \u201cthere is both death and aliveness.\u201d Next month they open an exhibition at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, Cambio, for which the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, invited them to provide \u201cmore a way of thinking than an exhibition of products\u201d. They have chosen to make the show about trees. It is about nothing but timber, and about everything to do with timber that you might imagine, from its molecular structure to its uses in everyday objects, to the laws and lore of forests. It takes in a genre of American portraiture that dwelt on the reflections of its sitters in their mahogany furniture, the intensity of the polish being a sign of wealth. It tells how indigenous people of the Amazonian basin use oral traditions to navigate the forest. At first glance, Farresin\u2019s and Trimarchi\u2019s CV is typical of many aspiring design practices. Founded 10 years ago, the studio has built a reputation among design cognoscenti through exquisite objects displayed at (for example) Design Miami, a high-end fair dedicated to the rarefication of domestic objects to the point where they become valuable artistic collectibles. They have designed promotional installations for Fendi and Lexus. Their creations look like exceptionally skilled and stylish works, of a kind that sometimes adorn the world of products \u2013 a light fitting, for example, made of little more than its elegantly-looped and carefully specified power cable. Closer acquaintance reveals Formafantasma (which roughly translates as \u201cghost form\u201d) to be more like alchemists, for whom all forms of knowledge of the world are ripe for inquiry. The shelves of their studio are like a latterday version of a 17th-century Wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, in which objects of art and science were promiscuously mixed. In Formafantasma\u2019s version, vases made of shiny black lava cohabit with a light made of a cow\u2019s bladder, with a bell jar containing a balsa model of some kind of tower. Formafantasma\u2019s understanding of their materials is biochemical, technical, social, cultural, aesthetic, ecological, economic and geographic. Farresin, 39, the taller of the two, currently sporting a moustache, is from Vicenza, near Venice, the city of Andrea Palladio. Trimarchi, 36, trim-bearded, is from Taormina, the Sicilian city famous for its Roman ruins and scenic views of Etna. Partners in life as well as business, they met as undergraduates in Florence, where they learned from the 1960s-formed gurus who taught them that \u201cyou can have energy and joy in design, you can have fun\u201d. They then applied to the Design Academy Eindhoven as a single entity, with a combined portfolio, to be accepted or refused as one. They were accepted and have worked in the Netherlands ever since: they like the country\u2019s \u201cculture of pushing boundaries\u201d and the Dutch government\u2019s support for young businesses. In design, they say, \u201cit\u2019s normal that the people who survive are wealthy\u201d, which Farresin and Trimarchi are not. Their home is a mezzanine gallery, just big enough for a bed and a living area, looking on to their calm white studio in a former Amsterdam stove factory. It must be intense, to live and work in such proximity, all the time, but it suits them. \u201cWe have never done a project divided,\u201d says Farresin, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t work. Conversations and words are our tools. We always know how we made a decision because we have always talked about it.\u201d Farresin is the more talkative. Trimarchi describes himself as \u201cmore organising\u201d, adding of Farresin: \u201cHe is, like, a mess.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a Nazi,\u201d says Farresin, \u201che\u2019s very, very precise.\u201d \u201cHe could go on discussing ideas for months,\u201d says Trimarchi, \u201cI\u2019m the one who says it\u2019s time to stop thinking and to deliver.\u201d You can see the difference between the two in the way they treat the peel of the clementines they are eating: Trimarchi piles his into a neat stack, the smallest pieces at the top; Farresin is a tad more careless.

Infiltration of the conspiracy theorist group Keep Talking found that Jeremy Corbyn supporters and confidantes of former Labour MPs have attended meetings addressed by Holocaust deniers. During one gathering in London last year, suspended Labour supporters heard James Thring, an infamous antisemite linked to the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, speak openly and unchallenged about Holocaust denial. A covert recording of Thring at the meeting captured him claiming that no deaths were recorded at the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, where 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were systematically murdered. \u201cThe archives from the listening posts show no evidence that they heard anything about deaths in Auschwitz; we didn\u2019t know that this was going on \u2026 because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Thring can be heard saying.

Other Keep Talking attendees include Holocaust denier and far-right activist Alison Chabloz, who the Jewish News reported in 2015 became a supporter of the Labour party and \u201cdeclared loyalty to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in several blog posts\u201d. Chabloz was convicted of antisemitism in 2018 after publishing videos of herself singing antisemitic songs denying the Holocaust at a meeting of the London Forum, a far-right organisation with links to the US alt-right. Another speaker at Keep Talking meetings was Israeli writer Miko Peled, who addressed the group after appearing at a Labour party conference fringe event in Brighton in 2019. During a Labour party conference in 2017 he reportedly told a fringe event that: \u201cThis is about free speech, the freedom to criticise and to discuss every issue, whether it\u2019s the Holocaust: yes or no, Palestine, the liberation, the whole spectrum.\u201d The other co-founder of Keep Talking, Nick Kollerstrom, is a Holocaust denier who has referred to \u201cstorybook gas chambers\u201d when describing Auschwitz.",

It\u2019s a plan widely seen as ambitious \u2013 a slow-burner \u2013 but feasible.

Anglo\u2019s 5.5p-a-share offer values the company at \u00a3405m, or \u00a3524m including debt, which is well below the returns they were hoping for.</p> <p>But the mining firm, which also owns the De Beers diamond group, says its offer is fair, and points out that it will have to invest a further $3bn before any polyhalite is extracted. Sirius\u2019s board has recommended that shareholders accept the offer at a vote in London on 3 March, to prevent the company collapsing into administration \u2013 and wiping out the value of the stock altogether.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019ve spent \u00a31.1bn, there\u2019s a big hole in the ground, and Chinese, Indian and American customers are signing agreements for millions of tonnes</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Goodwill MP</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the deal to go ahead, two hurdles must be cleared.</p> <p>Investors owning 75% of the company must back the deal, but the takeover also requires the backing of a majority of those present at the meeting, plus those voting by proxy.

While polyhalite is found elsewhere in the world, the only seam that has been mined lies 1,500 metres below the ground south of Whitby, extending into a sizable area beneath the North Sea. It was deposited around 260 million years ago, as the Zechstein Sea, which once covered much of modern Europe, evaporated.</p> <p><strong>What does Sirius want with it?</strong><br>Polyhalite is already being extracted at Boulby mine, further north.

      "bodyText": "For the best part of a decade, North Yorkshire has been dreaming about gold hidden beneath the brooding beauty of the moors. A deep mine on the eastern edge of the North York Moors, the first in the UK for 40 years, promised to bring jobs, investment and spectacular returns for anyone who dipped into their pockets to help fund it. But in the end, no one but a handful of hedge funds and a global mining giant is likely to make any money out of North Yorkshire\u2019s buried treasure. In 2011, a little-known company called Sirius Minerals unveiled plans to dig at Sneatonthorpe, a few miles south of Whitby, the seaside town known for fish and chips and a starring role in Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. The Woodsmith mine would extract polyhalite, a mineral so uniquely packed with nutrients that agricultural buyers would queue up to buy it, delivering hundreds of millions of pounds in profit each year. For 85,000 small investors, the \u00a34bn project seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity, not to mention a chance to bring 1,000 permanent jobs to a region that has suffered from nearby Teesside\u2019s industrial decline. \u201cWe felt as a family that if there was going to be a long-term benefit to the area we were almost duty bound to put a bit in,\u201d says local dairy farmer John Cook, whose cows supply milk for Morrisons supermarkets. Cook leads a 450-strong group of landowners in the Yorkshire Coast Minerals Association, who all stand to earn royalties once the mine is up and running. A return on the shares would have been a very welcome windfall in the meantime, given how precarious farming incomes can be. But now such dreams are hanging by a gossamer thread, after Sirius\u2019s financing plans dramatically fell apart last year. Those who bought shares when they smashed through 40p in August 2016 has watched their investment collapse since. Global mining giant Anglo American is now proposing to buy the cash-strapped company for just 5.5p a share. \u201cYou do think \u2018Oh crikey, when it was 38p we should have sold,\u2019\u201d says Cook, whose family were lucky enough to have bought the shares relatively cheaply. \u201cBut there are stories of people who\u2019ve drawn out their life savings, and you feel very sorry for them. It\u2019s a real shame, is that.\u201d Scarborough\u2019s Conservative MP, Robert Goodwill, agrees. \u201cWhat\u2019s really sad is that people have invested more than they can afford to lose, even cashed in their pensions. There\u2019s a guy in Middlesbrough who got \u00a3250,000 compensation for an injury he got in the military, and put it all in. \u201cA lot of people invested because they heard people talking about it in the pub and could see it starting to take shape. People wanted to support the local economy.\u201d Sirius\u2019s vaulting ambition began to fall flat when a \u00a3400m bond sale flopped in September last year, triggering the share price crash that has dealt such damage to small investors. Chief executive Chris Fraser blamed factors including Brexit and a lack of support from the government, which refused to provide a loan guarantee for the mine, despite its potential as a vote-winning northern industrial project. The success of the bond sale was a key condition to unlocking a further $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in loans from Wall Street banker JP Morgan, funds which duly evaporated. The Woodsmith mine plan involves sinking two mine shafts and digging a 23-mile tunnel under the North York Moors to take polyhalite to a complex on the Teesside coast, to be shipped to buyers around the world. It\u2019s a plan widely seen as ambitious \u2013 a slow-burner \u2013 but feasible. Buyers have already signed \u201cofftake\u201d agreements for millions of tonnes of polyhalite. Yet without funding, the mine is little more than a hole in the ground. Now, small shareholders are gearing up for one final chance to make their voices heard. Anglo\u2019s 5.5p-a-share offer values the company at \u00a3405m, or \u00a3524m including debt, which is well below the returns they were hoping for. But the mining firm, which also owns the De Beers diamond group, says its offer is fair, and points out that it will have to invest a further $3bn before any polyhalite is extracted. Sirius\u2019s board has recommended that shareholders accept the offer at a vote in London on 3 March, to prevent the company collapsing into administration \u2013 and wiping out the value of the stock altogether. For the deal to go ahead, two hurdles must be cleared. Investors owning 75% of the company must back the deal, but the takeover also requires the backing of a majority of those present at the meeting, plus those voting by proxy. This is effectively a one-shareholder, one-vote system that minimises the effect of financial muscle and maximises the power of the 85,000 disgruntled small investors, who could theoretically vote against the offer en masse. To do so might seem illogical, but some have pledged via online bulletin boards to vote against, in an act of vengeance for the perceived mismanagement of the company. Others, such as the web-based Fund Sirius shareholders\u2019 group, believe there must be an alternative way to raise funds or find another buyer. Last week, holdout investors won support from investment firm Odey Asset Management, which amassed a 1.3% stake and started waving it about just as the saga was coming to a head. The firm, run by multimillionaire hedge fund guru Crispin Odey, claimed in an open letter that Anglo\u2019s offer makes a \u201cmockery\u201d of the true value of Sirius. Odey says Anglo has not declared its offer final because it wants to retain the option to raise it again, should a rival be willing to pay more. Anglo must, he said, either raise the price to 7p a share or declare its offer final \u2013 otherwise the fund would vote against. The profit for Odey on a 7p bid is about \u00a31.4m, which is chump change in the hedge fund world, but not bad for a couple of weeks\u2019 work and an open letter. Cook, who is in regular contact with other small investors, says Odey\u2019s intervention has changed things: \u201cThat will influence some smaller investors, so it\u2019s going to be very interesting.

Three of Daley-Clarke\u2019s grandparents took a similar journey from the West Indies in the early 1960s: it\u2019s a journey she is reminded of every time she sees the print, and an image she hopes her daughters will remember growing up with.</p> <p>Daley-Clarke, 29, lives with her husband, Jermel, 33, and two young daughters \u2013 Israel, 4, and Ezra, 2 \u2013 in a social housing flat in Islington, north London.

Daley-Clarke recalls her own experience of leaving home at 16 and living in temporary accommodation for seven years before her name eventually made its way to the top of the waiting list. Her first rented home was a one-bedroom flat in King\u2019s Cross. While living there she met her husband and started a family. It was another three years before a two-bedroom property became available.</p> <p>When the call finally came to view their current flat, Daley-Clarke agreed to the tenancy on the spot, knowing it could be another three years before the next two-bedroom property became available.</p> <p>\u201cIt was in such a bad state of disrepair that six other families had already turned it down,\u201d she recalls. While the housing association has a duty to ensure its properties are safe, anything deemed cosmetic is left to the tenants.</p> <p>The home Daley-Clarke has created bears little resemblance to the flat she first saw last June. Earthy tones, second-hand furniture, natural fabrics and abundant plant life fill the space with warmth and character. Daley-Clarke manages an interior design showroom: her eye for design is apparent throughout.</p> <p>Having moved in, the couple prioritised the girls\u2019 bedroom. They painted the walls white and set up a second-hand Ikea bed and cot, draping the frame in natural fabrics in shades of turmeric, terracotta and grey.

      "bodyText": "In the middle of the wall in Africa Daley-Clarke\u2019s living room is a print illustrating the passengers disembarking from the Empire Windrush. Before moving into her flat last June, she sold all of the art on her gallery wall to fund the purchase of this new print. Three of Daley-Clarke\u2019s grandparents took a similar journey from the West Indies in the early 1960s: it\u2019s a journey she is reminded of every time she sees the print, and an image she hopes her daughters will remember growing up with. Daley-Clarke, 29, lives with her husband, Jermel, 33, and two young daughters \u2013 Israel, 4, and Ezra, 2 \u2013 in a social housing flat in Islington, north London. The street they live on comprises mostly detached Victorian villas. The property they live in has been split into three apartments. Here, on the first floor, in a two-bedroom flat with a front room, kitchen, bathroom and small balcony, Daley-Carke has created what she describes as a \u201cnatural, nourishing home\u201d for her young family. \u201cI never want my family to go without because we can\u2019t afford to live in a bigger home,\u201d she says. \u201cBut really, we don\u2019t need any more.\u201d Through her social media channel, @thevitamindproject, she talks openly about home ownership and the stigma of living in social housing. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I genuinely didn\u2019t know that people rented privately,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought you either owned your home or you lived in social housing.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s that she realised the opposite was also true: friends and colleagues who rented privately had very little understanding of social housing. \u201cThere is nothing to prevent anyone from applying for social housing,\u201d she says, before going on to explain the \u201cvery fair\u201d points-based system housing associations use to allocate properties. The rent \u2013 which is non-subsidised and non-profit \u2013 is pegged to local salaries and their tenancy is secure for five years. \u201cAll of that is rarely talked about,\u201d says Daley-Clarke, \u201cand I think that is where the stigma comes from \u2013 from not understanding that not everyone has the same start in life, and from not understanding that privilege comes in so many different shapes and forms.\u201d According to a 2019 report by the English Housing Survey, the nationwide shortage of social housing has lead to the highest levels of overcrowding since records began 24 years ago. Daley-Clarke recalls her own experience of leaving home at 16 and living in temporary accommodation for seven years before her name eventually made its way to the top of the waiting list. Her first rented home was a one-bedroom flat in King\u2019s Cross. While living there she met her husband and started a family. It was another three years before a two-bedroom property became available. When the call finally came to view their current flat, Daley-Clarke agreed to the tenancy on the spot, knowing it could be another three years before the next two-bedroom property became available. \u201cIt was in such a bad state of disrepair that six other families had already turned it down,\u201d she recalls. While the housing association has a duty to ensure its properties are safe, anything deemed cosmetic is left to the tenants. The home Daley-Clarke has created bears little resemblance to the flat she first saw last June. Earthy tones, second-hand furniture, natural fabrics and abundant plant life fill the space with warmth and character. Daley-Clarke manages an interior design showroom: her eye for design is apparent throughout. Having moved in, the couple prioritised the girls\u2019 bedroom. They painted the walls white and set up a second-hand Ikea bed and cot, draping the frame in natural fabrics in shades of turmeric, terracotta and grey. Their toys (mostly wooden, mostly second-hand) are corralled in easy-to-reach baskets and drawers and their books are displayed in an alcove created by removing the bedroom door, freeing up the dead space behind. By week three, they had also decorated the main living and dining area, filling it with plants and furniture from their previous flat. (The only new additions are the gigantic banana plant and dining table.) The hallway has been papered in a busy bamboo print that reminded Daley-Clarke of the set in Only Fools and Horses. The master bedroom is still a work in progress. The couple invested two-years\u2019 of savings in the renovation of the bathroom and kitchen, both of which were dilapidated, cold and clinical. The work was undertaken concurrently in just 10 days. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in the space at the same time with two small children, you\u2019ve got to do it quickly,\u201d says Daley-Clarke. In the kitchen, Jermel built the work surface and open shelving from reclaimed scaffolding boards. The bathroom has been turned into a cosseting, tactile space with irregular teal tiles and a patterned terracotta floor that wraps over the side of the bath, creating the illusion of a built-in tub. \u201cEven if we have to leave this flat after five years, we took the decision to invest in our home from the outset \u2013 to treat it like our forever home,\u201d she says. (She makes the point that their renovation costs equated to about 10% of what they\u2019d need to pay for a deposit on a similar two-bedroom flat.)

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s conservatives are on the brink of a landslide victory in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections as forecasts show them taking more than two-thirds of the seats. The reformists, the largest grouping in the outgoing parliament, have been decisively beaten, with predictions showing them taking only 17 seats in the 290-strong parliament. The principalists \u2013 or conservatives \u2013 were on course to take around 200 seats, including all 30 seats in the capital, Tehran, previously a stronghold of the reformers. Although they are a diverse group, many of the senior conservatives are former supporters of ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The result is a rebuff for those that had pushed for greater engagement with the west, and is likely to constrain Iran\u2019s foreign policy options. The parliament could press for Iran to quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. In Tehran, where turnout was low, at between 20% and 25%, the response to the early results was not one of surprise, given the number of reformist candidates disbarred from standing, Mojtaba Rezai, a mechanic, said: \u201cThey are just a bunch of gangsters. They just choose between the 10 of them who is going to lead their list and we get no say. They are not lists, but shits.\u201d In north Tehran around the Cinema Museum, the mood was indifferent, as people said they knew no one in their family who had voted, nor intended to vote again. A shopper in central Tehran laughed when asked if they had heard the results, saying: \u201cWhy should we wait for the result? It is a foregone conclusion and has been fixed in advance. They can do what they want, and we just have to get on making a living. We face years more of sanctions.\u201d The rial was coming under further pressure against the dollar after the blacklisting of Iran by the Financial Action Task Force on Friday. Mostafa Tajzadeh, one of the most prominent reformist politicians, who was formerly imprisoned in Evin prison, said: \u201cWe are facing a difficult and complex situation made worse by the low levels of participation. Why did the supreme leader not warn the Guardian Council against not allowing independent and critical voices to stand? The price has been low participation, and a parliament that only represents the minority.\u201d Other more radical voices said the landslide was what they wanted since it showed the people they had no route through parliament to achieve change. The value of the democratic verdict, already sabotaged by the mass disqualification of reformists, will be further undermined if the turnout is as low as some predict. Turnout was 64% in 2014 and 62% in 2016. The lowest turnout \u2013 51% \u2013 was in 2004. The deadline for closing the 55,000 polling booths on Friday was repeatedly extended, with pro-government sources claiming the polls were kept open until midnight to cope with high turnout. Government opponents said officials had been hoping a last-minute rush might mask a voter boycott in the big cities caused by disillusionment with Iranian politics. The run-up to the election, dismissed as a farce by the US government, had been marred by the mass disqualification of the best-known centrist candidates, some of whom, such as Ali Motahari, nevertheless turned out to vote in Tehran. The result means strong supporters of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei now control all the main levers of power in Iran except for the presidency. The reformists, elected four years ago on a ticket of engagement with the west, had been the largest party in the parliament, but found many of their proposals blocked by other centres of power in Iran, notably the Guardian Council. Presidential elections are due next year, leaving the centrist incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, to navigate a difficult year engaging with a strong, largely unsympathetic parliament. The initial results showed that as many as 14 senior figures in Ahmadinejad\u2019s presidency had been elected, as well as his former central bank governor. The former mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, an Iran-Iraq war veteran and former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was also victorious in Tehran, putting him in a strong position to take over the parliament\u2019s speakership. That post had previously been held by Ali Larijani who stood down preparing for a likely run at the presidency. Ghalibaf has said only 30% of the country\u2019s economic travails are caused by sanctions, saying mismanagement of the economy is the chief culprit. Principalists claim the reformers have tried to interfere in the economy excessively, and want Iran to look to its neighbours to boost trade, rather than Europe. Reformers have threatened to pursue Ghalibaf over property deals from which he benefited as mayor of Tehran. About 7,150 candidates from more than 16,000 hopefuls survived screening by government-run panels and the Guardian Council, a conservative body of clerics and jurists who assess commitment to Islam, belief in the system of religious law and the Islamic Republic. A third of incumbents were barred from standing again. Moderates, who see disqualifications as a bid by hardliners to dominate the 2021 presidential race, say they had no candidates in the contest for 230 of the assembly\u2019s 290 seats. Parliament has no formal role over foreign policy, but it can intervene if Rouhani tries to engage in any talks with the US before a lifting of sanctions. The Iranian foreign ministry believes Donald Trump has been gripped by a fantasy that the maximum economic pressure is going to lead to the Iranian regime\u2019s fall. The election results, despite the low turnout, arguably show the regime\u2019s power has been enhanced. The foreign ministry are said to be 80% certain that Trump will be re-elected, and believe any prospect of progress on the nuclear deal is unlikely until after the US presidential elections in November. There is concern that the UK may break from its European partners France and Germany in the summer, ending its support for the deal. Many Iranian voters said they would be willing to withstand another six years of sanctions for the sake of their country\u2019s independence. Figures such as Motahari defended the reformist-led parliament\u2019s record, saying external bodies had blocked more than half of its legislation. He cited the parliament being excluded when the government suddenly doubled petrol prices in November, prompting state repression of street protests. He said parliament had wanted to impeach the interior ministry for its handling of the protests, but were ordered not to do so.

The president\u2019s views on news of a book deal for Marie Yovanovitch, another key figure in the Ukraine scandal which led to Trump\u2019s impeachment, were not immediately clear. Bolton, a former ambassador to the UN, was Trump\u2019s third national security adviser until he was fired in September last year. He refused to testify in the House impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals, which resulted in two articles of impeachment, concerning abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He offered to testify in the Senate but Republicans voted not to call witnesses during a trial which duly ended in Trump\u2019s acquittal, despite leaks from Bolton\u2019s book manuscript seeming to show he possessed key knowledge about the affair. The Room Where It Happened was slated for publication in March but it has been held up, the national security council telling Bolton\u2019s lawyer it would \u201cmove forward as expeditiously as possible\u201d with determining what could be published. On Friday night, the Washington Post cited two anonymous sources as saying Trump had told his own lawyers the book should not come out before the election. Trump has attacked Bolton publicly on Twitter but the Post also reported notes of an off-the-record briefing of TV anchors on 4 February. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and block the publication of the book,\u201d Trump reportedly said. \u201cAfter I leave office, he can do this. But not in the White House. \u201cI give the guy a break,\u201d he added. \u201cI give him a job. And then he turns on me. He\u2019s just making things up.\u201d Trump also called Bolton a traitor, the Post said. Bolton has begun to discuss his book in public. At Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, on Monday, he reportedly said he was \u201cnot asking for martyrdom\u201d but \u201cknew, I think I knew, what I was getting into\u201d. He also said White House efforts to suppress his \u201ceffort to write history\u201d were \u201ccensorship\u201d but did not discuss what he had written in detail.

Joe Biden is a contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Yovanovitch does have firsthand knowledge of much of what transpired regarding Ukraine, and in House testimony gave a chilling account of alleged threats from Trump and his allies because she was regarded as insufficiently loyal. Yovanovitch told investigators Ukrainian officials warned her Rudy Giuliani and other Trump insiders were planning to \u201cdo things, including to me\u201d and were \u201clooking to hurt\u201d her. Pushed out of her job early in 2019, on Trump\u2019s orders, she testified that a senior Ukrainian official told her she \u201creally needed to watch my back\u201d. According to a rough transcript of the Zelenskiy call released by the White House, Trump told the Ukrainian president Yovanovitch \u201cwas bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news\u201d. Trump has also attacked Yovanovitch in public \u2013 including while she was testifying. On Friday, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt confirmed that it had acquired the former ambassador\u2019s planned memoir, which is currently without a title. According to the publisher, the book will trace Yovanovitch\u2019s diplomatic service from Somalia to Ukraine and \u201cfinally back to Washington DC where, to her dismay, she found a political system beset by many of the same challenges she had spent her career combating overseas\u201d. \u201cYovanovitch\u2019s book will deliver pointed reflections on the issues confronting America today, and thoughts on how we can shore up our democracy,\u201d the publisher said. Asked why Yovanovitch\u2019s book would not be published in this election year, the Houghton Mifflin senior vice-president and publisher Bruce Nichols said: \u201cAmbassador Yovanovitch has had a 30-year career of public service in many locations, with many lessons to be drawn. \u201cThis is about much more than just the recent controversy.\u201d The Associated Press reported that the deal was worth \u201cseven figures\u201d and that Yovanovitch was represented by the Javelin literary agency \u2013 whose clients also include James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump in May 2017, and Bolton.",

      "body": "<p>Residents of flats in Greater Manchester who are facing huge bills to replace flammable cladding have told of \u201canxiety so extreme I can\u2019t function\u201d and feel they are members of \u201cgeneration stuck\u201d.</p> <p>A survey carried out by the Greater Manchester High Rise Task Force found 53% of owner-occupiers in tower blocks had been hit with increased service charges after the Grenfell Tower fire.</p> <p>One resident said their monthly charge had increased from \u00a390 to \u00a3480 to cover cladding replacement, with another saying their management company had proposed the cost be added to their maintenance charge to the tune of \u00a31,000 a month.</p> <p>Many leaseholders are unable to sell their homes and move on because lenders will not offer mortgages, the research found. About 70% of residents said they were worried about a fire in their building and spoke of their increasing levels of anxiety, difficulty sleeping and feeling of being trapped.</p> <p>In 2014, Matthew Hallsworth and Natasha Johansson bought a flat in Albion Works, a timber-clad block in the New Islington area of central Manchester. The couple, who married six months ago, said they had sought counselling after feeling \u201cat the end of our tether\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/12/mps-urge-government-to-fix-all-buildings-with-dangerous-cladding\">MPs urge government to fix all buildings with dangerous cladding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNobody seems to be thinking of our mental safety,\u201d said Johansson on Friday. \u201cThe anxiety is so extreme I can\u2019t function. We\u2019ve constantly got this money hanging over our heads through no fault of our own. I go to work and can\u2019t concentrate, I come home, look at these four walls and think: \u2018Will they set on fire, will I be bankrupted?\u2019 How can you relax in this flat, knowing it\u2019s a fire risk? Right now the reality is I\u2019m more of a danger to myself than a fire.\u201d</p> <p>Fire officials also found alarms could not be heard in the flats, only in the hallways. With the policy changed from \u201cstay put\u201d to \u201cevacuate\u201d following the Grenfell Tower disaster, the building managers, Residential Management Group (RMG), said fire wardens would patrol until a new fire alarm system was installed. The 24-hour \u201cwaking watch\u201d involves five fire wardens patrolling the 182 flats of blocks D and E, costing residents \u00a310,000 a week plus VAT. The 12-hour shifts are being covered by an extra service charge, yet to be levied, and the residents\u2019 reserve fund.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had an evacuation or tested anything with the waking watch. Their procedure \u2013 which we only know because the BBC reported it \u2013 is to shout \u2018fire, fire, fire\u2019 and knock on \u2018as many doors as possible\u2019 in the event of a fire,\u201d Johansson said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a new boiler but at the moment we buy food at the supermarket and think: \u2018Will we be able to afford this in a month\u2019s time?\u2019 All that money from our guests from our wedding might have to be spent on cladding.\u201d</p> <p>Having sought help from charities, the Leasehold Advisory Service, the housing minister and their MP, the couple found nobody was able to help them because their contract says they are expected to foot the bill for \u201creasonable maintenance costs\u201d. \u201cLegally, we have no protection. It\u2019s like we\u2019re writing a blank cheque to be imprisoned in our own home. We literally can\u2019t move,\u201d Johansson said.</p> <p>The couple said it was an injustice that timber cladding is not covered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/09/government-allocates-funds-to-replace-grenfell-style-cladding\">government\u2019s fund</a> that covers ACM (aluminium composite material). Johansson said: \u201cIf timber cladding is being treated in the same way as ACM \u2013 it\u2019s serious enough that it needs to be replaced \u2013 then why aren\u2019t we being treated the same and receiving the same help?\u201d</p> <p>RMG said it had acted on safety advice from fire engineers, surveyors and Greater Manchester fire service regarding the cladding. Justin Herbert, an RMG operations director, said: \u201cWe are now looking to implement an integrated alarm system which will remove the need for the waking watch. The next stage will be to determine the long-term solution of addressing the cladding.</p> <p>\u201cWe totally understand the concerns regarding the costs, which could not have been foreseen. We have to invoice to cover the costs in line with the lease covenants but will ensure we implement the most cost-effective compliant solution. We will continue to support the residents through this very difficult period.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Block D, Hallsworth and Johansson said they needed the uncertainty to end so they could move on. \u201cI can\u2019t minimise the effect this has had on us; it\u2019s felt life-ruining. This was our future in this flat and now it feels like it\u2019s taken our future from us. We thought we had escaped being \u2018generation rent\u2019; now we\u2019re \u2018generation stuck\u2019,\u201d Johansson said.</p> <p>Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cWhat really strikes me is the damage this is doing to people\u2019s mental health. I was at a meeting of the High Rise Task Force and there were young people just in floods of tears, saying, \u2018I can\u2019t cope with this\u2019, \u2018It\u2019s a living nightmare\u2019. People should not be left in that kind of limbo with no peace of mind, not just about their safety but their finances as well.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government must ensure all unsafe cladding is removed and that residents should not have to pay for it. \u201cIt\u2019s not the residents\u2019 responsibility. When you buy a flat you are entitled to expect that the regulatory processes have created a flat that is safe. It is to be argued out between government and industry as to how much percentage liability there is for both sides.\u201d</p> <p>An Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has supported an industry-led solution to manage valuations of high-rise residential buildings. We expect building owners to share the relevant information with surveyors and residents and to take proactive steps to ensure their buildings are safe as a priority.</p> <p>\u201cBuilding owners should follow expert advice to ensure any building safety risks are identified and fixed as a matter of urgency to make sure that residents are safe in their homes. Cost should not be a barrier to remediation, and we are working with the Treasury to address this issue.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2020 because an earlier version erroneously included a photo of a neighbouring block, which is separate to the Albion Works flats.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Residents of flats in Greater Manchester who are facing huge bills to replace flammable cladding have told of \u201canxiety so extreme I can\u2019t function\u201d and feel they are members of \u201cgeneration stuck\u201d. A survey carried out by the Greater Manchester High Rise Task Force found 53% of owner-occupiers in tower blocks had been hit with increased service charges after the Grenfell Tower fire. One resident said their monthly charge had increased from \u00a390 to \u00a3480 to cover cladding replacement, with another saying their management company had proposed the cost be added to their maintenance charge to the tune of \u00a31,000 a month. Many leaseholders are unable to sell their homes and move on because lenders will not offer mortgages, the research found. About 70% of residents said they were worried about a fire in their building and spoke of their increasing levels of anxiety, difficulty sleeping and feeling of being trapped. In 2014, Matthew Hallsworth and Natasha Johansson bought a flat in Albion Works, a timber-clad block in the New Islington area of central Manchester. The couple, who married six months ago, said they had sought counselling after feeling \u201cat the end of our tether\u201d. \u201cNobody seems to be thinking of our mental safety,\u201d said Johansson on Friday. \u201cThe anxiety is so extreme I can\u2019t function. We\u2019ve constantly got this money hanging over our heads through no fault of our own. I go to work and can\u2019t concentrate, I come home, look at these four walls and think: \u2018Will they set on fire, will I be bankrupted?\u2019 How can you relax in this flat, knowing it\u2019s a fire risk? Right now the reality is I\u2019m more of a danger to myself than a fire.\u201d Fire officials also found alarms could not be heard in the flats, only in the hallways. With the policy changed from \u201cstay put\u201d to \u201cevacuate\u201d following the Grenfell Tower disaster, the building managers, Residential Management Group (RMG), said fire wardens would patrol until a new fire alarm system was installed. The 24-hour \u201cwaking watch\u201d involves five fire wardens patrolling the 182 flats of blocks D and E, costing residents \u00a310,000 a week plus VAT. The 12-hour shifts are being covered by an extra service charge, yet to be levied, and the residents\u2019 reserve fund. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had an evacuation or tested anything with the waking watch. Their procedure \u2013 which we only know because the BBC reported it \u2013 is to shout \u2018fire, fire, fire\u2019 and knock on \u2018as many doors as possible\u2019 in the event of a fire,\u201d Johansson said. \u201cWe need a new boiler but at the moment we buy food at the supermarket and think: \u2018Will we be able to afford this in a month\u2019s time?\u2019 All that money from our guests from our wedding might have to be spent on cladding.\u201d Having sought help from charities, the Leasehold Advisory Service, the housing minister and their MP, the couple found nobody was able to help them because their contract says they are expected to foot the bill for \u201creasonable maintenance costs\u201d. \u201cLegally, we have no protection. It\u2019s like we\u2019re writing a blank cheque to be imprisoned in our own home. We literally can\u2019t move,\u201d Johansson said. The couple said it was an injustice that timber cladding is not covered by the government\u2019s fund that covers ACM (aluminium composite material). Johansson said: \u201cIf timber cladding is being treated in the same way as ACM \u2013 it\u2019s serious enough that it needs to be replaced \u2013 then why aren\u2019t we being treated the same and receiving the same help?\u201d RMG said it had acted on safety advice from fire engineers, surveyors and Greater Manchester fire service regarding the cladding. Justin Herbert, an RMG operations director, said: \u201cWe are now looking to implement an integrated alarm system which will remove the need for the waking watch. The next stage will be to determine the long-term solution of addressing the cladding. \u201cWe totally understand the concerns regarding the costs, which could not have been foreseen. We have to invoice to cover the costs in line with the lease covenants but will ensure we implement the most cost-effective compliant solution. We will continue to support the residents through this very difficult period.\u201d Back in Block D, Hallsworth and Johansson said they needed the uncertainty to end so they could move on. \u201cI can\u2019t minimise the effect this has had on us; it\u2019s felt life-ruining. This was our future in this flat and now it feels like it\u2019s taken our future from us. We thought we had escaped being \u2018generation rent\u2019; now we\u2019re \u2018generation stuck\u2019,\u201d Johansson said. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cWhat really strikes me is the damage this is doing to people\u2019s mental health. I was at a meeting of the High Rise Task Force and there were young people just in floods of tears, saying, \u2018I can\u2019t cope with this\u2019, \u2018It\u2019s a living nightmare\u2019. People should not be left in that kind of limbo with no peace of mind, not just about their safety but their finances as well.\u201d He said the government must ensure all unsafe cladding is removed and that residents should not have to pay for it. \u201cIt\u2019s not the residents\u2019 responsibility. When you buy a flat you are entitled to expect that the regulatory processes have created a flat that is safe. It is to be argued out between government and industry as to how much percentage liability there is for both sides.\u201d An Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has supported an industry-led solution to manage valuations of high-rise residential buildings. We expect building owners to share the relevant information with surveyors and residents and to take proactive steps to ensure their buildings are safe as a priority. \u201cBuilding owners should follow expert advice to ensure any building safety risks are identified and fixed as a matter of urgency to make sure that residents are safe in their homes. Cost should not be a barrier to remediation, and we are working with the Treasury to address this issue.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2020 because an earlier version erroneously included a photo of a neighbouring block, which is separate to the Albion Works flats.",

      "body": "<p>At dusk, graduate student Sara Lewis was sitting on her back porch in North Carolina with her dog. \u201cWe were supposed to be mowing our grass, but we never did, so we had long grass in our yard,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSuddenly this cloud of sparks rose up out of the grass and started flying around me.\u201d</p> <p>Each spark was a firefly: a beetle that glows in the dark. Hundreds of fireflies had gathered in Lewis\u2019s back yard and were soaring around her. \u201cIt was this incredible spectacle,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cand I just sort of gasped.\u201d Then she became fascinated. \u201cI started wondering what the heck was going on here, what were these bugs doing, what were they talking about?\u201d She has spent much of the past three decades studying fireflies.</p> <p>In recent years Lewis\u2019s work has taken on a new urgency. All around the world, the lights of fireflies are going out. The dazzling beetles are disappearing from long-established habitats. Often it is not clear why, but it seems likely that light pollution and the destruction of habitats are crucial factors. Biologists are racing to understand what is happening to fireflies so we can save them before their lights fade permanently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9cd160e4b50c6197c7fe86469bc852d27bdf368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9cd160e4b50c6197c7fe86469bc852d27bdf368/0_135_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Different species of firefly on display at the Forest Research Institute in Kuala Lumpur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Different species of firefly on display at the Forest Research Institute in Kuala Lumpur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bazuki Muhammad/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been fireflies since the dinosaur era, says evolutionary geneticist <a href=\"https://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/sarah-lower\" title=\"\">Sarah Lower</a>, an assistant professor of biology at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe estimates we have currently are that fireflies are over 100m years old,\u201d she says. Early in their history, they <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/36495\" title=\"\">split into two groups</a>, one of which spread throughout the Americas while the other colonised Europe and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1055790318307954?via%3Dihub\" title=\"\">Asia</a>.</p> <p>Fireflies all belong to a family of beetles called <em>Lampyridae</em>. In Europe they are often called glow-worms, while American fireflies with flashing lights are known as lightning bugs. All these terms are misleading, says Lower. \u201cThey are not flies. They are not bugs. They are not worms. They are beetles.\u201d</p> <p>Fireflies are not the only luminous insects: three other beetle families have luminescent members, as do fungus gnats. However, fireflies are the most prominent. There are approximately 2,000 species.</p> <p>However, fireflies are in trouble. In 2019, the <a href=\"https://xerces.org/\" title=\"\">Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation</a> published a <a href=\"https://xerces.org/publications/guidelines/conserving-jewels-of-night\" title=\"\">report on North American fireflies</a>, warning that \u201cpopulations appear to be in decline\u201d. It was co-authored by <a href=\"https://ase.tufts.edu/biology/faculty/lewis/\" title=\"\">Lewis</a>, who is now professor of evolutionary and behavioural ecology at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and author of a book on fireflies, <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691162683/silent-sparks\" title=\"\"><em>Silent Sparks: The Wondrous World of Fireflies</em></a>.</p> <p>The extent of the decrease is unclear because most firefly populations have not been tracked. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/\" title=\"\">monitors thousands of species</a>, only created its <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/commissions/ssc-groups/invertebrates/firefly\" title=\"\">Firefly Specialist Group</a> in 2018. Fireflies are difficult to study: they are hard to find when not displaying.</p> <p>\u201cThe best data we have is from the UK,\u201d says Lewis. Citizen scientists have tracked the UK\u2019s one firefly, the common glow-worm, <em>Lampyris noctiluca</em>, since the 1970s. For most species there are only anecdotes, but they all tell the same story, and biologists who study wild fireflies are convinced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad62cbb8131f75581a099a8ef38aea75353d603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad62cbb8131f75581a099a8ef38aea75353d603/0_9_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some south-east Asian firefly species only live along riverbanks in threatened mangrove forests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some south-east Asian firefly species only live along riverbanks in threatened mangrove forests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TorriPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, Lewis and her colleagues published the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz157/5715071#192204015\" title=\"\">first systematic review</a> of threats to fireflies in the journal <em>BioScience</em>. They surveyed 49 firefly experts from around the world, asking them to rank 11 potential threats in order of importance. \u201cThese are people on the ground who have been working with fireflies and they see what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Lewis. According to the experts, the biggest threats to fireflies are habitat loss, pesticides and light pollution\u2026</p> <h2><strong>1. Homes destroyed</strong> </h2> <p>While some animals adapt to life in human environments such as cities, many fireflies need particular habitats, so are vulnerable if those habitats are destroyed.</p> <p>The congregating fireflies of south-east Asia are an example. The males have flashing lights with which they attract females. They gather at night in a mangrove tree, and flash \u2013 whereupon the females fly in and choose mates. In some species the males synchronise their flashes, creating spectacular displays that tourists love.</p> <p>Most such fireflies are in the genus <a href=\"https://jurcon.ums.edu.my/ojums/index.php/jtbc/article/view/891\" title=\"\"><em>Pteroptyx</em></a>, and live only around riverbanks. After mating, the females lay their eggs in the mud of the riverbank. The larvae develop there and spend months feeding on snails, before becoming adults and returning to their display trees. \u201cAll the parts of their life-cycle depend on that habitat,\u201d says Lewis. But humans are cutting it down and replacing it with oil palm plantations. \u201cFor that particular group of fireflies, habitat-loss is a really big thing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>2. Too bright</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc741f79d5fe978646914daec2690a202b175b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efc741f79d5fe978646914daec2690a202b175b2/0_127_3048_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female glow-worm shining to attract her mate \u2013 her work will be made harder by brighter skies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female glow-worm shining to attract her mate \u2013 her work will be made harder by brighter skies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Steel/TUFTS UNIVERSITY/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second biggest threat, according to the survey, is light pollution. This takes many forms, from bright and direct streetlights to the diffuse \u201cskyglow\u201d that means the sky is never truly dark. Most biodiversity studies have largely neglected light pollution, says Lewis. \u201cBut for fireflies it\u2019s front and centre.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Lewis and Avalon Owens of the biology department at Tufts identified five ways in which nocturnal light pollution could affect fireflies, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.4557\" title=\"\">in a study published in <em>Ecology and Evolution</em></a>. The light can make them lose track of the time or their position. The fireflies may struggle to recognise important objects, such as their snail prey. In species where one sex is attracted to the glow of the other, artificial lights may disrupt mating. Finally, really bright lights may dazzle or even blind the fireflies.</p> <p>Some species are <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10905-018-9687-8\" title=\"\">more vulnerable to light pollution</a>. In the eastern US, big dipper fireflies (<em>Photinus pyralis</em>) are thriving. They are not tied to a particular habitat and are common in New York City. \u201cThey\u2019re in people\u2019s back yards in Brooklyn,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cThe adults fly in parking lots.\u201d However, this reflects big dipper fireflies\u2019 lifestyle. \u201cTheir courtship activity is actually just around sunset, so it\u2019s already quite light,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be disturbed at all by the high light-levels in urban environments.\u201d</p> <p>This is unusual. Many fireflies display late at night, when it would naturally be very dark. \u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of background illumination from streetlights or even skyglow, then their signals are going to be less visible,\u201d says Lewis. These nocturnal species are most vulnerable to light pollution.</p> <p>Fireflies\u2019 eyes are particularly sensitive to certain kinds of artificial light, says <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/2554\" title=\"\">Alan Stewart</a> of the University of Sussex. His team studied the eyes of British common glow-worms, in which males are attracted to glowing females. The <a href=\"https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/14/2373\" title=\"\">males\u2019 eyes were tuned to the females\u2019 green light</a>, but when blue light was added, the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10841-014-9664-2\" title=\"\">males struggled to find the females</a>. This means new LED streetlights, which are longer-lasting and thus environmentally beneficial, are likely to disrupt the fireflies more than old-fashioned sodium streetlights, due to their blueish light.</p> <h2><strong>3. Chemicals and collectors</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"286a8f806444e753670a1311298c8992f0a5e2b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/286a8f806444e753670a1311298c8992f0a5e2b2/0_69_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pesticides on sale in Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thailand banned the pesticide chlorpyrifos, as well as herbicides glyphosate and paraquat in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romeo Gacad/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The third major threat is pesticides. This never occurs to most people, says Lewis, because they see fireflies only as displaying adults. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really think about the life cycle,\u201d she says. Most of a firefly\u2019s life is spent as a larva, on or under the ground, or underwater. There, they are exposed to pesticides. Firefly larvae are especially at risk because they are predators, normally hunting small snails, each of which may contain a dose of pesticide. \u201cIf people were aware of that, I think they would be a lot more hesitant to spray pesticides on their lawn,\u201d says Lewis.</p> <p>In parts of Asia, fireflies are taken from the wild in huge numbers. \u201cThey have big insect festivals and will hire local people to go out, catch a bunch of fireflies and release them at the festival,\u201d says Lower. If the fireflies are habitat specialists, they will not survive. \u201cThat\u2019s depleting populations in some places.\u201d One conservation organisation estimated that <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/chinas-endangered-fireflies/\" title=\"\">over 17m were purchased in China in 2016</a>.</p> <p>Beyond these external factors, there are also risks tied to fireflies\u2019 lifestyles. In a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-019-01869-7\" title=\"\">2019 paper published in <em>Biodiversity and Conservation</em></a>, Lewis and her colleagues highlighted \u201cnumerous risk factors\u201d. For instance, adults often cannot fly far \u2013 and in some species may not fly at all \u2013 so they struggle to move if their habitat is threatened. Many species also have specialised diets, so can starve if their food supply is lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b23322e29708d4f4a016b01ecc48670b28d6227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b23322e29708d4f4a016b01ecc48670b28d6227/0_73_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiichiro Minami\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiichiro Minami, who helped restore Japan\u2019s population of fireflies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SilentSparks.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is, now we are getting a handle on what is happening to fireflies, we can do something.

In the 1920s a young man named Kiichiro Minami figured out how to rear fireflies in captivity, with no scientific training.

First, she says, \u201cif there\u2019s a place with firefly biodiversity or abundance, try to preserve that habitat.\u201d Not all of us can do that, but one thing anyone who lives near fireflies can do is reduce light pollution. \u201cTurn off your lights during firefly season, or just turn off your lights in general.

      "bodyText": "At dusk, graduate student Sara Lewis was sitting on her back porch in North Carolina with her dog. \u201cWe were supposed to be mowing our grass, but we never did, so we had long grass in our yard,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSuddenly this cloud of sparks rose up out of the grass and started flying around me.\u201d Each spark was a firefly: a beetle that glows in the dark. Hundreds of fireflies had gathered in Lewis\u2019s back yard and were soaring around her. \u201cIt was this incredible spectacle,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cand I just sort of gasped.\u201d Then she became fascinated. \u201cI started wondering what the heck was going on here, what were these bugs doing, what were they talking about?\u201d She has spent much of the past three decades studying fireflies. In recent years Lewis\u2019s work has taken on a new urgency. All around the world, the lights of fireflies are going out. The dazzling beetles are disappearing from long-established habitats. Often it is not clear why, but it seems likely that light pollution and the destruction of habitats are crucial factors. Biologists are racing to understand what is happening to fireflies so we can save them before their lights fade permanently. There have been fireflies since the dinosaur era, says evolutionary geneticist Sarah Lower, an assistant professor of biology at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe estimates we have currently are that fireflies are over 100m years old,\u201d she says. Early in their history, they split into two groups, one of which spread throughout the Americas while the other colonised Europe and Asia. Fireflies all belong to a family of beetles called Lampyridae. In Europe they are often called glow-worms, while American fireflies with flashing lights are known as lightning bugs. All these terms are misleading, says Lower. \u201cThey are not flies. They are not bugs. They are not worms. They are beetles.\u201d Fireflies are not the only luminous insects: three other beetle families have luminescent members, as do fungus gnats. However, fireflies are the most prominent. There are approximately 2,000 species. However, fireflies are in trouble. In 2019, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation published a report on North American fireflies, warning that \u201cpopulations appear to be in decline\u201d. It was co-authored by Lewis, who is now professor of evolutionary and behavioural ecology at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and author of a book on fireflies, Silent Sparks: The Wondrous World of Fireflies. The extent of the decrease is unclear because most firefly populations have not been tracked. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which monitors thousands of species, only created its Firefly Specialist Group in 2018. Fireflies are difficult to study: they are hard to find when not displaying. \u201cThe best data we have is from the UK,\u201d says Lewis. Citizen scientists have tracked the UK\u2019s one firefly, the common glow-worm, Lampyris noctiluca, since the 1970s. For most species there are only anecdotes, but they all tell the same story, and biologists who study wild fireflies are convinced. Earlier this month, Lewis and her colleagues published the first systematic review of threats to fireflies in the journal BioScience. They surveyed 49 firefly experts from around the world, asking them to rank 11 potential threats in order of importance. \u201cThese are people on the ground who have been working with fireflies and they see what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Lewis. According to the experts, the biggest threats to fireflies are habitat loss, pesticides and light pollution\u2026 1. Homes destroyed While some animals adapt to life in human environments such as cities, many fireflies need particular habitats, so are vulnerable if those habitats are destroyed. The congregating fireflies of south-east Asia are an example. The males have flashing lights with which they attract females. They gather at night in a mangrove tree, and flash \u2013 whereupon the females fly in and choose mates. In some species the males synchronise their flashes, creating spectacular displays that tourists love. Most such fireflies are in the genus Pteroptyx, and live only around riverbanks. After mating, the females lay their eggs in the mud of the riverbank. The larvae develop there and spend months feeding on snails, before becoming adults and returning to their display trees. \u201cAll the parts of their life-cycle depend on that habitat,\u201d says Lewis. But humans are cutting it down and replacing it with oil palm plantations. \u201cFor that particular group of fireflies, habitat-loss is a really big thing.\u201d 2. Too bright The second biggest threat, according to the survey, is light pollution. This takes many forms, from bright and direct streetlights to the diffuse \u201cskyglow\u201d that means the sky is never truly dark. Most biodiversity studies have largely neglected light pollution, says Lewis. \u201cBut for fireflies it\u2019s front and centre.\u201d In 2018, Lewis and Avalon Owens of the biology department at Tufts identified five ways in which nocturnal light pollution could affect fireflies, in a study published in Ecology and Evolution. The light can make them lose track of the time or their position. The fireflies may struggle to recognise important objects, such as their snail prey. In species where one sex is attracted to the glow of the other, artificial lights may disrupt mating. Finally, really bright lights may dazzle or even blind the fireflies. Some species are more vulnerable to light pollution. In the eastern US, big dipper fireflies (Photinus pyralis) are thriving. They are not tied to a particular habitat and are common in New York City. \u201cThey\u2019re in people\u2019s back yards in Brooklyn,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cThe adults fly in parking lots.\u201d However, this reflects big dipper fireflies\u2019 lifestyle. \u201cTheir courtship activity is actually just around sunset, so it\u2019s already quite light,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be disturbed at all by the high light-levels in urban environments.\u201d This is unusual. Many fireflies display late at night, when it would naturally be very dark. \u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of background illumination from streetlights or even skyglow, then their signals are going to be less visible,\u201d says Lewis. These nocturnal species are most vulnerable to light pollution. Fireflies\u2019 eyes are particularly sensitive to certain kinds of artificial light, says Alan Stewart of the University of Sussex. His team studied the eyes of British common glow-worms, in which males are attracted to glowing females. The males\u2019 eyes were tuned to the females\u2019 green light, but when blue light was added, the males struggled to find the females. This means new LED streetlights, which are longer-lasting and thus environmentally beneficial, are likely to disrupt the fireflies more than old-fashioned sodium streetlights, due to their blueish light. 3. Chemicals and collectors The third major threat is pesticides. This never occurs to most people, says Lewis, because they see fireflies only as displaying adults. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really think about the life cycle,\u201d she says. Most of a firefly\u2019s life is spent as a larva, on or under the ground, or underwater. There, they are exposed to pesticides. Firefly larvae are especially at risk because they are predators, normally hunting small snails, each of which may contain a dose of pesticide. \u201cIf people were aware of that, I think they would be a lot more hesitant to spray pesticides on their lawn,\u201d says Lewis. In parts of Asia, fireflies are taken from the wild in huge numbers. \u201cThey have big insect festivals and will hire local people to go out, catch a bunch of fireflies and release them at the festival,\u201d says Lower. If the fireflies are habitat specialists, they will not survive. \u201cThat\u2019s depleting populations in some places.\u201d One conservation organisation estimated that over 17m were purchased in China in 2016. Beyond these external factors, there are also risks tied to fireflies\u2019 lifestyles. In a 2019 paper published in Biodiversity and Conservation, Lewis and her colleagues highlighted \u201cnumerous risk factors\u201d. For instance, adults often cannot fly far \u2013 and in some species may not fly at all \u2013 so they struggle to move if their habitat is threatened. Many species also have specialised diets, so can starve if their food supply is lost. The good news is, now we are getting a handle on what is happening to fireflies, we can do something. Some practices, such as the harvesting of fireflies, simply need to stop. Japan has achieved this. In the early 1900s, firefly shops collected the insects, packed them into bags and sent them by bicycle courier to big cities where they were released for people to enjoy. \u201cThat put a huge dent in firefly populations,\u201d says Lewis. In the 1920s a young man named Kiichiro Minami figured out how to rear fireflies in captivity, with no scientific training. Minami started releasing the fireflies back into rivers, restoring the population. This is still happening. \u201cSchoolchildren raise fireflies in class and release them into rivers,\u201d says Lewis. While Japan\u2019s fireflies have not been restored to their former glory, they are a conservation success story. Beyond that, Lewis identifies three actions that should help every firefly species. First, she says, \u201cif there\u2019s a place with firefly biodiversity or abundance, try to preserve that habitat.\u201d Not all of us can do that, but one thing anyone who lives near fireflies can do is reduce light pollution. \u201cTurn off your lights during firefly season, or just turn off your lights in general. Have motion-detector lights that only come on when you need them.\u201d And reduce the use of pesticides. People can also help by reporting firefly sightings. Anyone in North America can do so by joining the organisation Firefly Watch, which has been running since 2010. There are similar \u201ccitizen science\u201d schemes in many countries. You can also join iNaturalist, which allows you to submit photos of animals for identification. \u201cWe just want people to go out and enjoy fireflies in their natural habitats as much as they can,\u201d says Lewis. Stewart agrees, calling fireflies a \u201cmagical experience\u201d. With care, many of us may one day have fireflies sparkling in our back yards. Lampyris Noctiluca: Britain\u2019s only firefly The UK has only one native firefly: the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). Lampyris is found also on mainland Europe. They are best seen in June and July evenings, when females glow green to attract males. The UK glow-worm survey website offers a wealth of information. Common glow-worms live for two years. They hatch from eggs in late summer, grow a little by feeding on tiny snails, then hibernate through winter. They spend the next spring and summer growing, hibernate, then pupate in spring.

      "bodyText": "When was the last time a British prime minister cancelled a White House summit with a US president? Possibly never. Yet that\u2019s what Boris Johnson did after a livid, cursing Donald Trump slammed the phone down on him in a row over the Chinese firm, Huawei. Now a planned t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in Washington next month, already twice delayed, is off. Not postponed. Not rescheduled. Off. So much for \u201cBritain Trump\u201d, the servile moniker the president pinned on Johnson last year. So much for the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. Perhaps it was always doomed to end in tears. Imperious, bullying American behaviour, political arm-twisting and shameless economic blackmail over a post-Brexit trade deal pose big problems for Britain in a time of deep uncertainty. But other US partners are in the same boat. If a reminder were needed, it came in the form of Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state and Trump\u2019s most influential adviser, who pompously lectured fractious European leaders at last weekend\u2019s Munich security conference. Pompeo reassured mutinous allies that, despite unilateralist, isolationist appearances, America remained committed to global leadership. \u201cThe death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly over-exaggerated. The west is winning. We are collectively winning. We\u2019re doing it together,\u201d he declared. This is utter hogwash. And almost everyone outside a dishonest, self-deceiving circle of Republican stooges and Trump toadies knows it. Together? In many respects, the US and Europe are further apart than at any time since 1941. Pompeo\u2019s speech revealed a cold war mindset that crudely divides the world into friends and foes, separated by walls, missiles, sanctions, insults, and mutually assured dysfunction. For Pompeo, who referenced his formative experience as a soldier patrolling \u201cfreedom\u2019s frontier\u201d in West Berlin in the 1980s, there is no middle way. It\u2019s a black-and-white world ruled by fear and force. It\u2019s pure regression. Pompeo laid into China over military expansionism, debt diplomacy and cyber threats. Fair enough. But if he wants things to change, he needs to talk calmly. The coronavirus epidemic, like Huawei\u2019s controversial G5 networks and Beijing\u2019s HS2 bid, shows how inescapably interdependent China and western countries already are. When Jaguar Land Rover runs short of parts, Apple iPhones grow scarce and Lake District B&amp;Bs bemoan missing tourists, all because Hubei is stricken by a virus, it\u2019s plain the global die is cast. Whether for security, trade, political, or public health reasons, it\u2019s too late to isolate China. Pompeo had it in for Russia and Iran, too \u2013 another evil empire, in his telling, that wages \u201ccampaigns of terror in the Middle East and right here in Europe\u201d. Strange, then, that Europeans mostly believe Trump\u2019s Iran vendetta to be dangerous and foolish. Stranger still how Trump sucks up to Vladimir Putin. Pompeo\u2019s broader theme \u2013 that the west, representing freedom and democracy, is winning \u2013 is no less daft. Only people with their heads stuck in the self-congratulatory, delusional cloud that frequently envelops Washington could seriously make such a ridiculous claim about the world in 2020. What kind of foggy thinking or wilful blindness allows a senior politician to indulge such complacency when, as he speaks, not so far away, hundreds of thousands of refugees are being mercilessly bombed on Idlib\u2019s freezing hillsides? Almost 10 years ago, Syrians rose up in search of the freedom and democracy Pompeo lauds. But they got precious little help from the west. The story of the war, in part, is the story of how the west lost Syria, lost other Arab spring countries \u2013 and lost credibility everywhere. Or let\u2019s look at nuclear disarmament as the 1970 non-proliferation treaty\u2019s (NPT) review conference approaches in April. While the climate emergency dominates the news, nuclear weapons remain the fast-track route to Armageddon. Is non-proliferation a battle the west is winning? Hardly. Trump tore up a key medium-range missile agreement with Russia last year. Now experts fear the 2010 New Start strategic weapons treaty is headed the same way. Contrary to the spirit of the NPT, both the US and Russia are deploying new weapons, including low-yield, tactical warheads that increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s blundering, hypocritical efforts to force North Korea and Iran to forsake nukes altogether are a bust. Putin\u2019s Russia seizes territory in Ukraine, subverts other people\u2019s elections, and assassinates opponents in foreign cities without effective western punishment. The more China\u2019s brutal repression of its Muslim minority is documented, the more European governments look away. About this, at least, Pompeo is right. But he is dead wrong about Palestine and the Israeli land-grab recently endorsed by Trump. Such blatant theft overturns decades of binding UN resolutions. It makes a mockery of the \u201cinternational rules-based order\u201d \u2013 and any semblance of justice. Might these and many other unaddressed crises, including Yemen, Kashmir and Myanmar\u2019s ethnically cleansed Rohingyas, reasonably be called \u201cwins\u201d for western values? Of course not. And away from conflict zones, new technologies, far from bolstering free societies, deliver ever more pervasive, pernicious means of monitoring, controlling and censoring citizens. Across the globe, the battlements of open governance are under attack while its defenders are betrayed from within. Authoritarian regimes are on the up. Intolerant rightwing populists and ultra-nationalist mini-Trumps are on the march. No, Mr Pompeo. \u201cAmerica First\u201d may work for some in your country. But \u201cthe west\u201d, meaning a multinational, democratic alliance that champions shared principles, aims and laws, is not winning.

      "body": "<p>Film and television makers have never been shy about the female form. Hollywood always valiantly ensures audiences know what its leading ladies look like in underwear, and often without, while television heaves with the bosoms of pretty ing\u00e9nues in period drama. Alas, anyone with a brain will know these portrayals are far from representative of how women look and act in real life. Tired of the disconnect? Good news: today\u2019s hottest screen hits are proving that you can discuss women\u2019s bodies honestly, and without sexualising them, too.</p> <p>Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma\" title=\"\"><em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em></a>, the scorching period drama from the French film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/21/celine-sciamma-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire\" title=\"\">C\u00e9line Sciamma</a> released on 21 February. Having already generated a buzz, and plenty of awards, in France, adoring reviews suggest that it\u2019s set to do the same here. Sciamma won praise for her depiction of young women\u2019s sexuality in 2014\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\"><em>Girlhood</em></a> \u2013 a punchy snapshot of teenage life in the Parisian banlieues. Now she has turned her hand to a tale of lesbian passion in 18th-century Brittany.</p> <p>The film follows a painter, Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant), who must complete a portrait of a young noblewoman, H\u00e9lo\u00efse (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/adele-haenel\" title=\"\">Ad\u00e8le Haenel</a>), in secret: H\u00e9lo\u00efse has previously refused to pose for portraits in an act of rebellion against her forthcoming arranged marriage.</p> <p>The \u201cfemale gaze\u201d is a term used in recent years to describe art that subverts the ubiquitous male perspective. Like many buzzwords, it is often misapplied \u2013 but not so in the case of <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em>, which is unmistakably made from a female vantage point and with a feminist sensibility. Indeed, its plot is a meta commentary on that fact: in order to paint H\u00e9lo\u00efse secretly, Marianne has to memorise her features while posing as her walking companion \u2013 cue a slew of scenes involving a woman looking at another woman. Crucially, H\u00e9lo\u00efse soon returns Marianne\u2019s glances.</p> <p>Their relationship provides a blueprint for what the female gaze should do in film-making, says Ginette Vincendeau, a professor of film studies at King\u2019s College London. While warning that it\u2019s simplistic to assume films by women will automatically be feminist, she says that Sciamma\u2019s picture contains a good example of \u201cthe reciprocity of the female gaze\u201d \u2013 or how it can counter the imbalance that is thought to corrupt the male gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s more of an equal power relation between the person depicted and the person depicting, which is to me a feminist gesture,\u201d she says.</p> <p>H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne eventually work together on the portrait, a collaboration that Sciamma has said mirrors the film\u2019s creative process. She and Haenel were until recently a couple; in an <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wxejd4/portrait-lady-fire-film-celine-sciamma-interview-2020\" title=\"\">interview last week</a> she insisted that the fictional dialogue between artist and subject reflects their \u201cintellectual relationship\u201d in real life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0973f98a47f1a45c385f198db827b3b4cd769bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0973f98a47f1a45c385f198db827b3b4cd769bb/0_136_4587_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celine Sciamma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celine Sciamma says the creative process depicted in the film mirrors real life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Smith/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the film\u2019s subject matter means it\u2019s inevitably concerned with appearances. But it also offers a welcome study of the less superficial aspects of women\u2019s bodies. At one point, Marianne wakes up in the night with agonising period pain. Meanwhile, a subplot involves H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s maid, Sophie, who is pregnant but does not want to be. In one of the film\u2019s most transfixing scenes, a local woman reaches up between Sophie\u2019s legs to perform an abortion. As Vincendeau points out, these are heavily aestheticised portrayals rather than strictly \u201chonest\u201d ones, but nonetheless it\u2019s refreshing to see women\u2019s health (hardly a Hollywood trope) discussed on the big screen.</p> <p>Of course \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 there\u2019s H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne\u2019s love-making, too. The film manages to capture their red-hot desire without requiring, say, the controversial full-frontal sex scene that takes up an outsized portion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/21/blue-is-the-warmest-colour-review\" title=\"\"><em>Blue Is the Warmest Colour</em></a>, Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s 2013 film about a tempestuous lesbian romance. In focussing on the emotional build-up rather than the sex itself, Sciamma eroticises the character\u2019s feelings rather than her actors\u2019 bodies.</p> <p>Sciamma has said this approach perplexed her home country. \u201cIn France, they don\u2019t find the film hot,\u201d she told the <em>Guardian</em>. \u201c[They think] it lacks flesh, it\u2019s not erotic \u2026 They don\u2019t even know that \u2018male gaze\u2019 exists. You can tell it\u2019s a country where there\u2019s a lot of sexism, and a strong culture of patriarchy.\u201d Nevertheless, the film\u2019s 10 nominations for the C\u00e9sars, the French equivalent of the Oscars, suggest its subtlety isn\u2019t lost on everyone.</p> <p>Speaking of awards, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/golden-globes-2020-1917-and-fleabag-lead-british-invasion-with-major-wins\" title=\"\"><em>Fleabag</em> also earned gongs</a> for a TV show that offered a spiky, poignant take on women\u2019s physical experiences. One of its most talked-about sequences came when Fleabag\u2019s sister miscarries in a restaurant toilet cubicle. Back at the table, her relatives are sniping their way through an engagement dinner. Waller-Bridge shows a private moment of pain escalating into a public episode of family warfare (it somehow ends in a punch-up). If it\u2019s rare to see baby loss on screen, it\u2019s practically unheard of to see such an idiosyncratic, blackly comic depiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94cd8bc52f7187da9fd35b34cee37793a017c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94cd8bc52f7187da9fd35b34cee37793a017c4e/0_333_5970_3581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ria Zmitrowica in The Welkin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ria Zmitrowicz in The Welkin, a play by Lucy Kirkwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brinkhoff-Moegenburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be on stage rather than screen, but Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s <em>The Welkin</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/23/the-welkin-review-lyttelton-theatre-london-maxine-peake-lucy-kirkwood\" title=\"\">currently running at the National Theatre</a>, also applies mordant humour to the anguishes and indignities of reproductive life. It\u2019s a grim tale at first glance: a young woman, Sally Poppy, will hang for murder unless she can convince a 12-strong jury of women that she\u2019s pregnant. But it grants the women deciding her fate a temporary liberty of sorts: in the courthouse, they\u2019re untethered from both domestic chores and male authority. Soon, they\u2019re cracking jokes about hot flushes and bad sex.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2020/kate-maltby-we-need-more-shows-that-put-women-centre-stage-not-just-their-bodies/\" title=\"\">Writing about the play for <em>The Stage</em></a>, the critic Kate Maltby observed that \u201cthroughout, we hear more about the sticky details of women\u2019s bodies than I\u2019ve ever heard on a major theatre stage\u201d.</p> <p>Like <em>Portrait of a Woman on Fire</em>, while the play hinges on women\u2019s bodies, it doesn\u2019t show too much of them. \u201cThank God <em>The Welkin</em> avoids the trap of offering [Ria] Zmitrowicz up for our gaze,\u201d continues Maltby, before calling for more plays \u201cabout the ways women talk about our bodies; not how men observe them\u201d.</p> <p>And this is precisely the power of the female gaze. At its best, it portrays the full gamut of women\u2019s lives rather than focusing on the 0.001% of the time when this involves being sexy and naked. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t depict sex at all. Just look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/17/sex-education-season-two-review-netflix\" title=\"\"><em>Sex Education</em></a>, Laurie Nunn\u2019s exuberant drama about teenage relationships. The first series included a funny sequence about the joy of female masturbation; this year a plotline showed a young woman having a brilliant time in bed regardless of being saddled with vaginismus, a condition that makes penetrative sex painful.</p> <p>After all, the best depictions of women\u2019s bodies are not really about bodies at all, but the experiences and emotions attached to them. To put it another way, they paint women as they are: thinking humans who are as capable of scrutinising the world as the world is of scrutinising them. <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em>\u2019s H\u00e9lo\u00efse knows the score. \u201cIf you look at me, who do I look at?\u201d she asks Marianne during a sitting, in a sly question that\u2019s really more of a statement.</p> <p>The film-making old guard are happy to show the female form, but less keen on acknowledging the life that comes with it. Thank goodness for the new wave of creatives making such ignorance impossible.</p>",

Their relationship provides a blueprint for what the female gaze should do in film-making, says Ginette Vincendeau, a professor of film studies at King\u2019s College London. While warning that it\u2019s simplistic to assume films by women will automatically be feminist, she says that Sciamma\u2019s picture contains a good example of \u201cthe reciprocity of the female gaze\u201d \u2013 or how it can counter the imbalance that is thought to corrupt the male gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s more of an equal power relation between the person depicted and the person depicting, which is to me a feminist gesture,\u201d she says. H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne eventually work together on the portrait, a collaboration that Sciamma has said mirrors the film\u2019s creative process. She and Haenel were until recently a couple; in an interview last week she insisted that the fictional dialogue between artist and subject reflects their \u201cintellectual relationship\u201d in real life. So the film\u2019s subject matter means it\u2019s inevitably concerned with appearances. But it also offers a welcome study of the less superficial aspects of women\u2019s bodies. At one point, Marianne wakes up in the night with agonising period pain. Meanwhile, a subplot involves H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s maid, Sophie, who is pregnant but does not want to be. In one of the film\u2019s most transfixing scenes, a local woman reaches up between Sophie\u2019s legs to perform an abortion. As Vincendeau points out, these are heavily aestheticised portrayals rather than strictly \u201chonest\u201d ones, but nonetheless it\u2019s refreshing to see women\u2019s health (hardly a Hollywood trope) discussed on the big screen. Of course \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 there\u2019s H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne\u2019s love-making, too. The film manages to capture their red-hot desire without requiring, say, the controversial full-frontal sex scene that takes up an outsized portion of Blue Is the Warmest Colour, Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s 2013 film about a tempestuous lesbian romance. In focussing on the emotional build-up rather than the sex itself, Sciamma eroticises the character\u2019s feelings rather than her actors\u2019 bodies. Sciamma has said this approach perplexed her home country. \u201cIn France, they don\u2019t find the film hot,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201c[They think] it lacks flesh, it\u2019s not erotic \u2026 They don\u2019t even know that \u2018male gaze\u2019 exists. You can tell it\u2019s a country where there\u2019s a lot of sexism, and a strong culture of patriarchy.\u201d Nevertheless, the film\u2019s 10 nominations for the C\u00e9sars, the French equivalent of the Oscars, suggest its subtlety isn\u2019t lost on everyone. Speaking of awards, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag also earned gongs for a TV show that offered a spiky, poignant take on women\u2019s physical experiences. One of its most talked-about sequences came when Fleabag\u2019s sister miscarries in a restaurant toilet cubicle. Back at the table, her relatives are sniping their way through an engagement dinner. Waller-Bridge shows a private moment of pain escalating into a public episode of family warfare (it somehow ends in a punch-up). If it\u2019s rare to see baby loss on screen, it\u2019s practically unheard of to see such an idiosyncratic, blackly comic depiction. It may be on stage rather than screen, but Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s The Welkin, currently running at the National Theatre, also applies mordant humour to the anguishes and indignities of reproductive life. It\u2019s a grim tale at first glance: a young woman, Sally Poppy, will hang for murder unless she can convince a 12-strong jury of women that she\u2019s pregnant. But it grants the women deciding her fate a temporary liberty of sorts: in the courthouse, they\u2019re untethered from both domestic chores and male authority. Soon, they\u2019re cracking jokes about hot flushes and bad sex. Writing about the play for The Stage, the critic Kate Maltby observed that \u201cthroughout, we hear more about the sticky details of women\u2019s bodies than I\u2019ve ever heard on a major theatre stage\u201d. Like Portrait of a Woman on Fire, while the play hinges on women\u2019s bodies, it doesn\u2019t show too much of them. \u201cThank God The Welkin avoids the trap of offering [Ria] Zmitrowicz up for our gaze,\u201d continues Maltby, before calling for more plays \u201cabout the ways women talk about our bodies; not how men observe them\u201d. And this is precisely the power of the female gaze. At its best, it portrays the full gamut of women\u2019s lives rather than focusing on the 0.001% of the time when this involves being sexy and naked. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t depict sex at all. Just look at Sex Education, Laurie Nunn\u2019s exuberant drama about teenage relationships. The first series included a funny sequence about the joy of female masturbation; this year a plotline showed a young woman having a brilliant time in bed regardless of being saddled with vaginismus, a condition that makes penetrative sex painful. After all, the best depictions of women\u2019s bodies are not really about bodies at all, but the experiences and emotions attached to them. To put it another way, they paint women as they are: thinking humans who are as capable of scrutinising the world as the world is of scrutinising them. Portrait of a Lady on Fire\u2019s H\u00e9lo\u00efse knows the score. \u201cIf you look at me, who do I look at?\u201d she asks Marianne during a sitting, in a sly question that\u2019s really more of a statement. The film-making old guard are happy to show the female form, but less keen on acknowledging the life that comes with it. Thank goodness for the new wave of creatives making such ignorance impossible.",

Our players need to show something, our home form hasn\u2019t been what we want it to be, we are very honest about that. It\u2019s a time to change that, a good opportunity. Olivier Giroud\u2019s professionalism has been brilliant. He needed some weeks to get fit, and today he is ready, so he gets the nod.

Do you do the same question for them? For other managers it is normal to leave out any player they want. It looks like to me any time I make a decision of this type, there is always a big story so I prefer not to answer.

So depending on your cut-off point, and the angle at which you\u2019re holding the prism you\u2019re peering through, Spurs either have a win ratio of 50 percent or a slightly less impressive 3.33 percent. It\u2019s all up to you.</p> <p><strong>However you want to spin it, this is a big one. </strong>When Chelsea did a number on Spurs in north London last December, an eventual finish in the Champions League places looked likely for Frank Lampard\u2019s side. For Spurs, such an end-of-season prize seemed a pipe dream. But Spurs have won three of their last four league games, drawing the other, while Chelsea are without a win in four. And suddenly, having made up eight points in short order, Jose Mourinho is breathing down his old club\u2019s neck. They\u2019re just a point behind!</p> <p><strong>Should Chelsea swat Spurs aside as they usually do on their own patch, that gap regenerates to four points and the Pensioners can breathe again. </strong>Only problem is, they\u2019ve won just five of their 13 league matches at the Bridge this season. Spurs will scent blood. Chelsea, however, have that recent 2-0 win in N17 as succour, and can point to Tottenham riding their luck at times during their recent winning run, while they themselves had none whatsoever against Manchester United last Monday. So depending on how you look at it, etc., and so on, and so forth.</p> <p><strong>Can Chelsea burst clear again in the race for fourth? </strong>Or will Jose overhaul his old club to set up one hell of a scramble during the run-in? We\u2019ll find out this lunchtime. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-22T02:19:02.126Z\">at 2.19am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was our man at Stamford Bridge. His verdict has landed, so you know what to do: click and enjoy. Thanks for reading this MBM! \u201cI am proud of the players and their efforts. I am proud to see them fight until the last second. It is very difficult to do better than what we did, especially conceding a goal before we score. We had our opportunities to score but when we are 1-0 down it is very difficult because we don\u2019t have that power. And with minutes going on and on, the fatigue of people like Lucas and Bergwijn is going to be bigger and bigger. How can I search more than we are doing? There is nothing more to search. The hopes are always the same hopes. The boys fight until the end and if we can score before the opponent, the game can be a little bit different. But when an opponent scores before us, they compact, and it\u2019s very difficult. We don\u2019t have the presence, the movement, the creation.\u201d As for the Lo Celso incident: \u201cI feel sorry VAR don\u2019t admit more times, especially when things go against us. I don\u2019t want to speak about it.\u201d And now a cast-iron promise from Jose: \u201cI am going to be very repetitive. You are going to be bored of me, because I am going to be very, very repetitive.\u201d Here it comes, then ... Frank Lampard\u2019s verdict on the latest VAR farce, five days after Harry Maguire survived his lashing out at Michy Batshuayi. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s two VARs in two games. It\u2019s always harder to speak about it when you\u2019ve lost, because people claim you\u2019re just shouting, but maybe you need to shout. Everybody in the world saw that it was a red. But it\u2019s too late [to say they made a mistake]. The game should be over. I hate to call for red cards, but when they\u2019re endangering players ... it\u2019s a leg-breaker. VAR has been brought in to get the right decision. I\u2019m not saying anything about referees on the spot, it\u2019s not easy on the spot, VAR is here to clear it up. I\u2019m not surprised that they\u2019ve put it right, but it\u2019s not good enough.\u201d Man-of-the-match Olivier Giroud speaks! \u201cIt was a very important game for us. We have shown great character. We knew it was a turning point, we had lost a bit of confidence so it\u2019s nice to bounce back and get a hard win against a rival. Scoring was a good feeling for me, a good moment. It was a special day for me, and for all of us.\u201d Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, an ice pack taped to his leg, is then asked about the Lo Celso challenge: \u201cI\u2019m not a player who likes to be on the floor. I am tough. But it was a clear stamp on my shin, I felt it straight away and was surprised it wasn\u2019t a red card. It wasn\u2019t even a yellow card! Everybody can make a mistake but when you have a lot of replays it should be easier.\u201d A deserved victory for Chelsea. They weren\u2019t at their best, but they did score two fine goals to illuminate an otherwise scrappy game. Spurs by contrast were a complete non-event. Giovani Lo Celso was fortunate not to walk after standing on Cesar Azpilicueta\u2019s leg, but as it didn\u2019t affect the outcome, that doesn\u2019t matter now and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear no more about it. Eh? The whistle goes. Frank Lampard punches the air in celebration of a big victory. They\u2019re four points clear of Spurs, in the final Champions League spot. 90 min +3: Lo Celso loops a ball into the box. It\u2019s deflected, but the absurd arc doesn\u2019t fox Caballero. Imagine if he of all players scored a last-gasp equaliser, though. 90 min +2: Mount dances down the right, getting the better of Winks, but can only scoop his cross into the arms of Lloris. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. Spurs aren\u2019t going to complete an absurd smash and grab, are they? So having said that, Lamela dribbles into the Spurs box down the left. He tries to roll a cross inside for Alli. The ball clips off Rudiger\u2019s heel, and into the bottom left, past a wrong-footed Caballero. Game on! Finally! 87 min: In the dugout that was once his stomping ground, Jose now looks fairly relaxed. A man who has accepted his fate. Spurs have barely threatened. 85 min: Really, whatever your opinion of Lo Celso\u2019s challenge, we can surely all agree on one thing: let\u2019s unplug the VAR box, let it cool down, recycle whatever bits we can, pop the rest in landfill, and forget this ever happened. We don\u2019t need to mention it ever again. Move on. No blame culture. 83 min: This is preposterous. After a review, the folk in the VAR bunker have admitted that Lo Celso should have been sent off for standing on Azpilicueta\u2019s leg. They\u2019re claiming \u201cit\u2019s not a VAR error, but a human error\u201d. Sweet baby Moses, what a fiasco. 82 min: Alonso takes, and curls powerfully towards the top right. Lloris is beaten all ends up, but instead of nestling in the top right, the ball twangs off the crossbar. 81 min: Mount prepares to bring down a high ball on the edge of the Spurs box, and is clumsily brought down by Lo Celso, who finally goes in the referee\u2019s notebook. This will be a free kick, just to the right of the D. 79 min: Mount spins Vertonghen with ease down the right. He curls a low ball into the centre for Abraham, who pokes cutely towards the bottom left. It looks like it\u2019s heading in, but Lloris somehow grabs a ball that\u2019s behind him. What a save! That\u2019s kept Spurs in it. Just. 78 min: Spurs make a double change, their last roll of the dice. Aurier and Alli replace Bergwijn and Alderweireld. 77 min: Chelsea make their second switch, replacing Barkley with Willian, who ran Tottenham ragged in December. 76 min: This is scrappy nonsense right now. Here\u2019s Mary Waltz: \u201cA penny for Jose\u2019s thoughts (50 mins)? How many points can I squeeze out of the season in a series of 0-0 and 1-0 fixtures?\u201d 74 min: Winks bustles in from the right and falls over in the general environs of Rudiger. He wants a penalty but he\u2019s not getting it. He was fairly brushed off the ball. 73 min: Not much going on. Chelsea will be perfectly happy as the clock ticks on. 71 min: Giroud goes off to a standing ovation. A message from the fans to Frank. He\u2019s replaced by the equally popular Abraham. 70 min: Lamela slips a pass down the right for Bergwijn, who is brushed off the ball by Christensen with ease. Bergwijn hasn\u2019t featured at all today. 68 min: Spurs stroke it around the back. They\u2019ve had more possession in this second half, though they\u2019ve done very little with it. In the dugout, Jose Mourinho has a face on. His post-match interview could be interesting if the score stays this way. 66 min: Lamela looks for the top right, attempting a curler over the wall. The wall does its job, deflecting the ball out for a corner. The set piece is punched clear by Caballero, then returned by Alderweireld. The keeper claims well, under pressure from Sanchez on his line. 65 min: Some pre-free-kick faffing. 64 min: Moura dribbles his way down the inside right and is blocked crudely by Christensen, who picks up his fourth booking of the season for his trouble. A free kick just to the right of the D. 62 min: The first switch of the afternoon, as Lamela replaces Ndombele. 60 min: Ndombele sashays down the inside-left channel and enters the box. He\u2019s got time to shoot, but hesitates, allowing James to brush him off the ball. Was he waiting for the sort of clumsy challenge that\u2019d gift a penalty? If so, it wasn\u2019t coming. Great defending by the ever-impressive James. 58 min: Incidentally, during the first half, BT Sport cut to a shot of Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini, looking on, both men sporting fashionable flat caps. But both broadcaster and your hapless MBM hack missed the really big news, as Paul Neilan reports: \u201cThey were only sitting in front of Bobby Bloody Davro and no-one appears to have told them.\u201d Bobby Davro, a star of Saturday light entertainment once more. It\u2019s like TVS never lost their licence. 56 min: Frank Lampard isn\u2019t happy with that decision at all, and is currently involved in a heated exchange of views with the fourth official. You can see his point; red cards have been awarded for much less. 54 min: VAR decides there\u2019s no foul play, deeming the challenge accidental. Lo Celso is a lucky boy. So is Azpilicueta, who has suffered no serious damage. 52 min: Lo Celso stands on Azpilicueta\u2019s outstretched leg as the pair contest for a ball in midfield. VAR will have a look at this. It\u2019s not a pleasant one, with the Chelsea captain\u2019s leg bending in sickening fashion. Is it accidental, though, rather than a stamp? Possibly, though it\u2019s one of those that can be argued either way. 50 min: That goal represents a full house for Frank Lampard, as it involved all four of the players he recalled to the starting XI. Penny for Jose\u2019s thoughts. Barkley nearly makes it three with a power curler from the left. Lloris tips over; the corner comes to nothing. What a strike this is! The ball\u2019s worked across the face of the Spurs box, right to left. Giroud to Mount to Barkley to Alonso, who strides in from the left and pearls a first-time daisycutter across Lloris and into the bottom right. That\u2019s a stunner. 47 min: James has a wander down the right and has a dig from distance. He drags his shot across the face of goal. Lloris had it covered. Spurs get the second half underway. Mystic Dom doesn\u2019t have much confidence in their ability to turn this around. \u201cIs there any more chilling sentence to a Spurs fan than \u2018If Spurs win this game, they will  \u2019? To be honest, I don\u2019t know why Jose bothered to send a team out.\u201d Half-time entertainment. Max Rushden celebrates the legendary Jimmy Greaves, whose brilliance is one of the few things Chelsea and Spurs fans can agree on. It\u2019s not been much of a spectacle, though Chelsea won\u2019t care. As things stand, they\u2019ll go four points clear of Spurs in fourth, thanks to Olivier Giroud\u2019s expertly taken goal. The best you can say for Tottenham: they\u2019re still in it. 45 min: As this half peters out painfully, the officials show us some mercy. There will be just one additional minute. 44 min: Might as well beat the queue for a pint and a pie. 42 min: It\u2019s not been a classic so far, this. 40 min: Lo Celso is barged - fairly - off the ball by Kovacic, allowing Chelsea to break upfield at speed. Barkley breaks into the box from the left and shanks wide. He should have done much better. 38 min: Chelsea reestablish some control in midfield. But that was much better from Spurs, who are finally showing a little ambition. 36 min: Alderweireld, quarterbacking from deep, sprays a pass down the right for Tanganga, who comes in from the flank and takes one touch to bring Alonso out of the game. The ball also flies past Caballero, who is way off his line. But it\u2019s flying at speed, and bobbles out of play to the left of goal before Tanganga can poke into an empty net. Nearly as direct as it gets. 35 min: Spurs finally show in attack. A few passes and Moura is gifted space in the box on the left. His shot is deflected over the bar by Azpilicueta\u2019s lunge. From the corner, Sanchez flashes a header towards the top left, but it\u2019s tipped over spectacularly by Caballero. The second corner comes to nothing. 33 min: Kovacic slides a ball down the middle. Barkley takes up possession, his back to goal 30 yards out, and very nearly backheels Mount free down the inside left. Sanchez blocks. Spurs were very nearly opened up with a rapier thrust. 31 min: Giroud has a dig from the best part of 30 yards. Ambitious, bordering on downright disrespectful. An international team-mate of Lloris as well. 29 min: Lo Celso gets up and takes the resulting free kick. It\u2019s not very good. 28 min: Lo Celso dribbles down the left and is clattered by Mount. He extends his leg as he falls, and catches the Chelsea player. It\u2019s not exactly Harry Maguire on Michy Batshuayi, but it is a little bit saucy. Neither referee nor VAR is interested, though. 26 min: Spurs haven\u2019t responded to falling behind at all. They\u2019re barely able to string two passes together. Chelsea are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession. 24 min: The set piece is worked towards Alonso, to the left of the D. He chests down and pearls a stunning volley towards the top right. It\u2019s beaten Lloris and is inches away from nestling in the top corner. That was Le Tissieresque. 23 min: But here comes the first yellow card of the afternoon. Winks loses control and is robbed by Jorginho. He responds by tugging on the Chelsea midfielder\u2019s shirt, and that\u2019s a booking and a free kick out on the right. 21 min: Giroud and Sanchez clatter into each other. No whistle, and no recriminations either, the pair shaking hands after a short period of hopping around in pain. Adults playing hard but fair. 19 min: Jorginho tries to release Barkley down the inside left, but Sanchez snuffs out the attack. Chelsea are first to everything in the centre of the park right now. 17 min: VAR pokes its neb in. Of course it does. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with the goal, and eventually we\u2019re allowed to continue. The Stamford Bridge faithful break into a chorus of the traditional English folk song Fuck VAR. No manners, but cogent analysis nonetheless. Jorginho curls a glorious pass down the inside right channel for Giroud. A poor first touch takes him a bit wider than he\u2019d like, but he powers a shot towards the bottom right anyway. Lloris parries. Barkley gets onto the rebound and slams a shot against the right-hand post. Giroud latches onto that rebound and drives home, beating Lloris, the ball flying into the bottom right. 14 min: Barkley powers his way down the inside right and fires a low diagonal shot wide of the left-hand post. A more-than-decent effort. 13 min: Seems Giroud\u2019s header took a nick off a Spurs player. Another corner. James hits it long. Too long. Goal kick. Ah well, at least this match has finally sparked into life after a slow start. 12 min: Chelsea respond by whisking up the other end, Alonso sliding a glorious pass down the inside left to release Mount, who whistles a shot towards the bottom left. Lloris turns the ball around the post. From the resulting corner, Giroud flashes a header wide left at the near post. 10 min: The first corner leads immediately to the second. Lo Celso\u2019s low delivery is cleared by the first man, but Spurs come back quickly at the home side, Moura dropping a shoulder 20 yards out and slamming a shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s a fine effort, but well met by Cabellero. 9 min: Bergwijn busies himself out on the left, and earns the first corner of the game off Azpilicueta. 7 min: Rudiger dallies in the midfield and is robbed by Winks, who should really send Moura clear down the left. But his pass is a clunker, and flies out for a goal kick. Shame for Spurs, as Chelsea were light at the back there, and Moura had plenty of grass in front of him. 6 min: A slow, scrappy start to this game, which is why I\u2019ve been droning on about bugger all. 4 min: Spurs have hardly had a touch yet. Maybe they\u2019re pining for the yellow winter ball, which is back in its box for another year, replaced by a white-and-red number. Spring has sprung. 2 min: Alonso crosses from the left. James crosses from the right. Spurs clear without too much fuss. It\u2019s all Chelsea in the opening exchanges, Spurs happy to sit back. And we\u2019re off! Chelsea get the ball rolling, and ping it around the back for a bit. The teams are out! Chelsea wear their famous blue, Spurs are in their trademark lilywhite. A derby-day atmosphere at Stamford Bridge. We\u2019re one reggae instrumental away from kick-off. And now it\u2019s the turn of Frank Lampard. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for us. We understand how close the battle for fourth is, and it\u2019s a big rivalry anyway. This game always has a lot on it, regardless. Our players need to show something, our home form hasn\u2019t been what we want it to be, we are very honest about that. It\u2019s a time to change that, a good opportunity. Olivier Giroud\u2019s professionalism has been brilliant. He needed some weeks to get fit, and today he is ready, so he gets the nod. We have a squad for a reason, players have to come in and do their jobs. I expected Jose to know how we were going to go, so the match-up is a test, a challenge for us.\u201d BT Sport have a word with the ever-spiky Jose Mourinho. \u201cI cannot demand more than I do in every game, which is to give everything they can give. We have had only two days to prepare but we prepared the best we could. As I was more than expecting, Chelsea come with a system and with Alonso playing, we prepare ourselves tactically for that. And with what we have available, we are going to fight for the points.\u201d As for leaving out Dele Alli? \u201cI am not sure you ask every manager in the Premier League when one player stays out. Do you do the same question for them? For other managers it is normal to leave out any player they want. It looks like to me any time I make a decision of this type, there is always a big story so I prefer not to answer. I think Ndombele can give us creativity, we need a bit of risk, he is in condition to give us a good hour.\u201d Chelsea hand Olivier Giroud his first start in three months. He\u2019s one of four changes to the side that went down at home to Manchester United. Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and Marcos Alonso also step up, taking the places of Michy Batshuayi, Pedro, Willian, and the injured N\u2019Golo Kante. Meanwhile there\u2019s no room in the starting XI for Tottenham\u2019s bottle-and-boot-juggling malcontent Dele Alli. He drops to the bench, one of three changes made in the wake of the Leipzig defeat. Serge Aurier and Gedson Fernandes also make way; Jan Vertonghen, Tanguy Ndombele and Japhet Tanganga take their places. Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Rudiger, James, Jorginho, Kovacic, Alonso, Barkley, Mount, Giroud. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Abraham, Willian, Loftus-Cheek, Zouma, Emerson Palmieri, Gilmour. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Tanganga, Ndombele, Winks, Lo Celso, Davies, Lucas Moura, Bergwijn. Subs: Lamela, Dier, Sessegnon, Alli, Gazzaniga, Aurier, Fernandes. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). It\u2019s fair to say Chelsea have the upper hand in this fixture: Tottenham Hotspur have won it once in the last 30 years. Look at it another way, though: Spurs have won one of their last two Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge, having triumphed here 3-1 in April 2018. So depending on your cut-off point, and the angle at which you\u2019re holding the prism you\u2019re peering through, Spurs either have a win ratio of 50 percent or a slightly less impressive 3.33 percent. It\u2019s all up to you. However you want to spin it, this is a big one. When Chelsea did a number on Spurs in north London last December, an eventual finish in the Champions League places looked likely for Frank Lampard\u2019s side. For Spurs, such an end-of-season prize seemed a pipe dream. But Spurs have won three of their last four league games, drawing the other, while Chelsea are without a win in four. And suddenly, having made up eight points in short order, Jose Mourinho is breathing down his old club\u2019s neck. They\u2019re just a point behind! Should Chelsea swat Spurs aside as they usually do on their own patch, that gap regenerates to four points and the Pensioners can breathe again. Only problem is, they\u2019ve won just five of their 13 league matches at the Bridge this season. Spurs will scent blood. Chelsea, however, have that recent 2-0 win in N17 as succour, and can point to Tottenham riding their luck at times during their recent winning run, while they themselves had none whatsoever against Manchester United last Monday. So depending on how you look at it, etc., and so on, and so forth. Can Chelsea burst clear again in the race for fourth? Or will Jose overhaul his old club to set up one hell of a scramble during the run-in? We\u2019ll find out this lunchtime. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

Alonso, too \u2013 another player recalled to the lineup by Lampard \u2013 more than justified his manager\u2019s faith. The left wing-back had narrowly missed the top corner with a blast from distance midway through the first half but everything came together for him on 48 minutes. What a strike it was, a celebration of technique, cutting across a pass from Barkley, which produced the sweetest of connections to send the ball hurtling into the far corner. Giroud had started the move, flicking on to Mount, and the midfielder drove forward before squaring for Barkley. Spurs had flickered briefly towards the end of the first half, with Moura seeing a shot blocked by Azpilicueta and Davinson S\u00e1nchez extending Caballero with a header from a corner. There was also the moment when Japhet Tanganga got in behind Alonso following Toby Alderweireld\u2019s precision long ball only to take a heavy touch. Caballero had left his line and lost his bearings and he was relieved to see Tanganga\u2019s touch take the ball all the way past the far post. Mourinho asked his players to take higher starting positions in the second half and Tanguy Ndombele almost danced through, beating two Chelsea players but not a third in Reece James. It was an isolated flicker. Chelsea could point to a Barkley effort on 50 minutes that worked Lloris and, despite the late scare, they could close out the result with comfort.",

      "body": "<p>Something is happening to boys in bands up and down the country and across the Irish Sea. They are singing about things that matter, such as mental health and gentrification. They are disillusioned, but dressed smartly, in faded shirts and starched slacks. They are white, usually, and serious, very serious, often performing with an intensity that suggests they\u2019ve watched <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/05/popandrock.joydivision\" title=\"\">Control</a></em> a fair few times. They\u2019re also cutting across the generations, resonating with people who want heavy music that means something.</p> <p>You can\u2019t call this a scene or a sound, although the indie press, what\u2019s left of it, has tried to, gleefully rubbing its corduroys at the sight of men with guitars coming over the hill. But the general consensus is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/03/idles-review-academy-oxford\" title=\"\">Idles</a> have blown the door open for raging, post-punkish alternative music, and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fontaines-dc\" title=\"\">Fontaines DC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/20/black-midi-schlagenheim-review\" title=\"\">Black Midi</a> and other intense younglings have trudged through in their charity-shop suits and fugs of feedback, waiting to be nominated for the Mercury.</p> <p>For some, these are all thrilling Joy Divisions for a new generation: urgent music for urgent times. Others, as John Doran of music website the Quietus wrote last year, see many of these bands as \u201c<a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/27491-speedy-wunderground-year-4-compilation\" title=\"\">just the latest iteration of something quite old</a>\u201d, hawking impassioned discord that can be boiled down to \u201cfour pints and all the feels\u201d punk. Some say that a Black Midi doesn\u2019t even really sound anything like a Fontaines DC, but surely that\u2019s a boring side note to the swelling excitement around independent guitar music.</p> <p>The next band primed for a big breakthrough are <a href=\"https://themurdercapital.com/\" title=\"\">the Murder Capital</a>. Like Fontaines DC, they are from Dublin, but unlike Fontaines DC they\u2019ve been hailed as one of the most intense/powerful/vital (delete as necessary) nadgers-in-a-deathgrip live acts around at the moment. They met at music college and got noticed off the back of a session video for the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SmnKIjCnlk\" title=\"\">More Is Less</a>, before they\u2019d even had a chance to officially release any recorded music.

Strobe lights flash menacingly as they posture on stage like post-punk Peaky Blinders. They dress, to use their own words, like a \u201chungover Cillian Murphy\u201d, in braces, blazers, belts and billowing shirts; each of the five members is engaging on their own, just like a boy band. Singer James McGovern\u2019s romantic outfit and occasional tambourine-tapping give him an air of Morrissey.

The liberal use of the words \u201cpost-punk\u201d they inspire might suggest wiry intensity, but the Murder Capital\u2019s sound is far closer to the anthemic noir of a band such as Interpol than the tightly wound rottweiler rage of Idles, to whom they are routinely compared.

      "bodyText": "Something is happening to boys in bands up and down the country and across the Irish Sea. They are singing about things that matter, such as mental health and gentrification. They are disillusioned, but dressed smartly, in faded shirts and starched slacks. They are white, usually, and serious, very serious, often performing with an intensity that suggests they\u2019ve watched Control a fair few times. They\u2019re also cutting across the generations, resonating with people who want heavy music that means something. You can\u2019t call this a scene or a sound, although the indie press, what\u2019s left of it, has tried to, gleefully rubbing its corduroys at the sight of men with guitars coming over the hill. But the general consensus is that Idles have blown the door open for raging, post-punkish alternative music, and now Fontaines DC, Black Midi and other intense younglings have trudged through in their charity-shop suits and fugs of feedback, waiting to be nominated for the Mercury. For some, these are all thrilling Joy Divisions for a new generation: urgent music for urgent times. Others, as John Doran of music website the Quietus wrote last year, see many of these bands as \u201cjust the latest iteration of something quite old\u201d, hawking impassioned discord that can be boiled down to \u201cfour pints and all the feels\u201d punk. Some say that a Black Midi doesn\u2019t even really sound anything like a Fontaines DC, but surely that\u2019s a boring side note to the swelling excitement around independent guitar music. The next band primed for a big breakthrough are the Murder Capital. Like Fontaines DC, they are from Dublin, but unlike Fontaines DC they\u2019ve been hailed as one of the most intense/powerful/vital (delete as necessary) nadgers-in-a-deathgrip live acts around at the moment. They met at music college and got noticed off the back of a session video for the track More Is Less, before they\u2019d even had a chance to officially release any recorded music. Since then, their ascent has been swift. When they toured the UK last year, in support of their debut album When I Have Fears, the venues were so small their guitar necks touched. A year later, in Bristol, they already appear to have outgrown tonight\u2019s venue, as adult men pile in and eagerly await their brooding catharsis.

They do stirring tension particularly well, especially the deliciously sludgy middle pairing of Slowdance I and Slowdance II, although I find myself waiting for an unhinged release that never really comes. We make do with closing song Don\u2019t Cling to Life, an indie-disco number about death that is an attempt at writing this generation\u2019s answer to The Rat by the Walkmen,\u2013 a galvanising one at that \u2013 and a spot of crowdsurfing. Rock-by-numbers moments such as these jar with all the hot-blooded emotion casting about.

      "body": "<p>The lingering stench from putrefying deer carcasses is so powerful in Richie King\u2019s pickup truck that his neighbours once reported him to the police. The suspicious plastic boxes behind our seats are empty today, he promises, chuckling, as we drive into California\u2019s Sierra Azul mountains.</p> \n<p>But we are both hoping the smell of fermenting roadkill proves irresistible for an elusive predator in these hills: mountain lions.</p> \n<p>King, a wildlife biologist, spends his days setting camera traps at bait sites for the big cats. If they feed on the deer or he finds a kill site, he returns with a cage and collars the mountain lion so it can be tracked by the the Santa Cruz Puma Project, overseen by Prof Chris Wilmers at UC Santa Cruz. Data from this area, surrounded by Silicon Valley, farmland and the Pacific Ocean, is vital to understanding the threats to the species in the region.</p> \n<p>The Toyota Tacoma grumbles its way through the Californian oaks as we travel to the first bait site.

The suspicious plastic boxes behind our seats are empty today, he promises, chuckling, as we drive into California\u2019s Sierra Azul mountains. But we are both hoping the smell of fermenting roadkill proves irresistible for an elusive predator in these hills: mountain lions. King, a wildlife biologist, spends his days setting camera traps at bait sites for the big cats. If they feed on the deer or he finds a kill site, he returns with a cage and collars the mountain lion so it can be tracked by the the Santa Cruz Puma Project, overseen by Prof Chris Wilmers at UC Santa Cruz. Data from this area, surrounded by Silicon Valley, farmland and the Pacific Ocean, is vital to understanding the threats to the species in the region. The Toyota Tacoma grumbles its way through the Californian oaks as we travel to the first bait site. But in a clearing, King suddenly stops and inspects the road. A line of mountain lion paw prints cover the sandy track in the direction of the camera traps. We continue driving, the pickup roaring as we heave over fallen trees. Then, high in the mountain, a dead deer lying on its side and tied to an oak emerges in the shade. Aside from the flies, humming as they feast somewhere inside the animal, nothing else is about.

Now he wouldn\u2019t merely be facing live fire against an elite opponent for the first time in three years, but the sport\u2019s most devastating puncher. Given Wilder\u2019s taste for early finishes, the sense at ringside was there was no guarantee that Fury would make it through the early rounds, which made for a positively electric atmosphere at the Staples Center as the bell finally rang.</p> \n<p>Wilder springs his first attack early on, lunging in with a wild left-right combination only to be wrapped up by his mountainous opponent. A few moments after, Fury does an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvFix9gioDU\">Ali shuffle</a>, lands a crisp jab and makes Wilder miss before dropping his hands to his side and sticking out his tongue. He would continue to provocatively bait Wilder similarly in subsequent rounds, which served to both unsettle the champion and underscore his inaccuracy for the judges.</p> \n<p>Fury gets a bit careless with about a minute to go and Wilder detonates a check left hook square on his chin \u2013 probably one of the three or four biggest shots of the whole fight \u2013 but the challenger eats it well before backing off and resuming the plan of scoring from the outside. Wilder takes another big swing with a lunging combination in the final 10 seconds, only this time Fury doesn\u2019t clinch when they miss, cracking the champ with a flush counter right followed by a combination.</p> \n<p>When the bell sounds, Fury throws his arms skyward as Wilder ambles back to his corner. It\u2019s only been three minutes, but Fury has tasted the bogeyman\u2019s power and demonstrated for Wilder the specific problems his unique mix of size, movement and improvisational flair present. It could be a long night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29b8b8f58f2ab990c5447403c9eb45fdb24de0af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b8b8f58f2ab990c5447403c9eb45fdb24de0af/0_144_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyson Fury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyson Fury baits Deontay Wilder during their 2018 fight in Los Angeles.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Hahn/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Round four: Wilder starts to press</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cI know you see opportunities, but they will only present themselves more and more,\u201d Fury\u2019s corner man Ben Davison tells him before the fourth round. \u201cDon\u2019t get greedy.\u201d The tactics are clear. Fury has as much to gain by making the champion miss as landing blows himself. The more Wilder swings at empty air, the more he will overextend himself trying for the knockout and find himself off the balance he requires to land the money shot. That\u2019s exactly what happens in the fourth, with Wilder overshooting his show-stopping right with such force and eagerness that afterward he will tell reporters he hyperextended it.</p> \n<p>Much has been made of Wilder\u2019s low work rate in the first fight, that he allowed Fury to be comfortable for too long and gain confidence. The thing is, Wilder <em>is</em> going for it in the fourth, but Fury\u2019s blend of foot speed and deft upper-body movement make him a maddeningly elusive target. (\u201cIt felt like he had baby oil on him,\u201d Wilder later confesses. \u201cHe was slippery.\u201d)</p> \n<p>When Wilder does connect, like the stinging left jab that draws a trickle of blood from Fury\u2019s nose, the punches make an impact. But it\u2019s Fury\u2019s ability to use his own jab as an offensive weapon, as a rangefinder and as a buttress, often doubling and tripling it up, that have built him an early lead on the scorecards.</p> \n<h2><strong>Round seven: Fury stops Wilder in his tracks</strong></h2> \n<p>The sense of menace continues to hang over the proceedings at the midpoint of the scheduled 12 rounds, but Fury is still bouncing on his toes, moving around the ring and firing off shots in unpredictable rhythms. With 1:35 left in the seventh, Fury beats Wilder to the punch with a right cross to the chin. Then seconds later, he lands a crunching left-right combination to the head that rocks the American backward. It\u2019s Fury\u2019s best combination of the fight and Wilder responds with a wild flurry of looping punches that all miss by miles. Fury follows it up with another big right with 34 seconds to go.</p> \n<p>The sequence comes as Fury is bleeding from the nose and perhaps in danger of letting Wilder wrest the momentum. If it doesn\u2019t quite reverse the run of play, it firmly re-establishes his footing in the action.</p> \n<h2><strong>Round nine: Fury goes down, but comes back stronger</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll beat him with your left hand alone,\u201d Davison tells Fury before the ninth. And he\u2019s right. Wilder has been out of fresh ideas since round two and it\u2019s becoming clear his only plan is to hope Fury walks into a right hand. The bell rings and Fury continues his erratic movements, switching from orthodox to southpaw and back in the first 20 seconds. The champion narrowly misses with a right hand and Fury gestures to his chin, pirouetting toward his corner. But this time Wilder guesses Fury\u2019s destination correctly and cuts off the ring, pinning the challenger into his own corner. Wilder opens up with four hooks in quick succession. Only the third of them connects, a right hand to the temple, but it\u2019s enough to send Fury crumpled to the canvas and set off pandemonium in the Staples Center.</p> \n<p>Fury looks more annoyed than hurt, rising to a knee by five and easily beating the count. Wilder is poised for the finish and charges in with a wild combination, but Fury wraps him up. They\u2019re separated before Wilder darts in with another flurry of punches, but Fury slips them and connects with three hard blows. With a minute left in the ninth, Wilder appears gassed. Fury senses it and mocks his opponent, spreading his arms and sticking out his tongue again.</p> \n<p>Everyone talks about the <em>other</em> knockdown and rightfully so, but Fury\u2019s fightback in the ninth, to win nearly every second after going down amid the white-hot wall of sound from 17,698 spectators in full throat, nearly matches it for drama. Two minutes after the fight seemed done and dusted, the Gypsy King is back in command.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f07c881fff41ca4f9969848e2f3296589596723\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f07c881fff41ca4f9969848e2f3296589596723/0_0_4358_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyson Fury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyson Fury makes it to his feet after going down in the ninth round.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Hahn/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Round 10: A champion in retreat</strong></h2> \n<p>Watching a Deontay Wilder fight is an exercise in lean-forward suspense, knowing he\u2019s capable of ending a match at any moment with his shocking one-punch knockout power. But that familiar sense of foreboding has never felt <em>less</em> present than in the 10th. Wilder is out of bullets after nearly punching himself out in the ninth and Fury has been emboldened after tasting Wilder\u2019s power, surviving a knockdown and swerving the American\u2019s best finishing salvo. Now Fury is walking his man down and snapping Wilder\u2019s back with the jab, which lays bare how the champion\u2019s biggest weapon is negated when he\u2019s fighting off the back foot and can\u2019t step forward and plant. Should Fury\u2019s logic-defying prediction of a knockout in Saturday\u2019s rematch come through, the specific tenor of this 10th round will likely precede it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1069114488035536898\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The CSAC's corrected scorecard for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WilderFury?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WilderFury</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/l82pddBfh9\">pic.twitter.com/l82pddBfh9</a></p>\u2014 Bryan Armen Graham (@BryanAGraham) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1069114488035536898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 2, 2018</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Round 12: \u2018A holy hand\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Boxing\u2019s most famous sequence in a generation begins with Fury landing yet another crisp right hand, but Wilder, reborn from his 10th-round wilt, bursts into the pocket almost immediately and launches a right followed by a C4-packed left hook that abruptly separates Fury from his senses. The challenger appears unconscious on the way down and his head violently bounces off the canvas. Game over. The broadcast cuts to an overhead shot of Fury supine on the floor, a still form with arms outstretched and right knee tilted upward in the shape of a crucifix. Most referees would have waved it off on the spot and would not be questioned for it, but Jack Reiss shows why he\u2019s one of the sport\u2019s best by going through the formality and giving the count. At six, Fury\u2019s power is restored and moves to get up. At nine, he makes it to his feet and convinces Reiss to allow him to continue, but only after he responds to the referee\u2019s command to jog a few steps to his left then back. It was out of a damn Rocky movie. \u201cI had a holy hand upon me tonight,\u201d Fury will say afterward. \u201cAnd it brought me back.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://gfycat.com/specificforthrightgoldfinch\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/specificforthrightgoldfinch\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There are 121 seconds till the final bell when the fight resumes. When it does the badly wounded challenger, implausibly, picks back up where he left off: jabbing and feinting, slipping and countering. Even he will say in the months that follow that he didn\u2019t feel the punch: it was just lights out \u2026 and then back on. The next two minutes, as Fury again fends off Wilder\u2019s finishing efforts and gets the better of the exchanges, represent an indelible moment in modern sports history. Reiss\u2019s sangfroid made it possible.</p> \n<h2><strong>Epilogue: Two champions embrace</strong></h2> \n<p>After the final bell, Mexico\u2019s Alejandro Rochin will score the fight 115-111 to Wilder, Canada\u2019s Robert Tapper will have it 114-112 for Fury and Phil Edwards of the United Kingdom will call it even at 113-113. (The Guardian scored it 115-111 to Fury.)</p> \n<p>Before the result is announced and the fighters discover they will be bound in time by more than a single night in Los Angeles, they wrestle through the security separating them and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QASG4p5yrxI?t=3143\">embrace for nearly a minute</a> near Wilder\u2019s corner. \u201cHe was just telling me great fight, he loves me and thank you for the opportunity. We\u2019re the best in the world. The respect was mutual,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cI think with the two knockdowns I definitely won the fight. We poured our hearts out tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Don\u2019t let <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/deontay-wilder-taunts-tyson-fury-about-his-mental-health\">Wednesday\u2019s made-for-TV theatrics</a> in the service of salesmanship fool you.

      "bodyText": "Rod Blagojevich\u2019s claim to have been a political prisoner persecuted by \u201cuncontrolled prosecutors\u201d is \u201cjust bullshit\u201d, the CNN host Anderson Cooper said in a fiery interview with the former Illinois governor whose sentence was commuted by Donald Trump. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was charged with corruption and impeached by his state legislature. Convicted of attempting to sell Barack Obama\u2019s US Senate seat and other corrupt acts, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. In 2010, while waiting to be sentenced, he appeared on The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump fired him then but repeatedly commented on his case after winning the White House and this week, after Blagojevich had served eight years behind bars, the president brought him relief. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday night, Blagojevich described his \u201cmost profound and everlasting gratitude to President Trump\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s a Republican president,\u201d he said, \u201cI was a Democratic governor. My fellow Democrats have not been very kind to him \u2013 in fact, they\u2019ve been very unkind to him. If you\u2019re asking me what my party affiliation is, I\u2019m a Trumpocrat.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision in Blagojevich\u2019s case and pardons for other high-profile white-collar criminals \u2013 and his claim to be the \u201cchief law enforcement officer\u201d of the US \u2013 attracted widespread criticism. Many expect Trump to pardon Roger Stone, a longtime adviser who was this week sentenced to more than three years in prison for lying to Congress, obstructing the Russia investigation and threatening a witness. Trump\u2019s fury over prosecutors\u2019 initial recommendation of a seven- to nine-year sentence for Stone has roiled the entire US justice system. Appearing on CNN on Friday, Blagojevich insisted that critics of Trump\u2019s action in his case had not \u201clooked carefully because I am a political prisoner\u201d. Cooper countered that Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader who spent 27 years in brutal prison conditions before emerging to become president of a multiracial South Africa, was most people\u2019s idea of a political prisoner. \u201cIf you were to ask Nelson Mandela whether he thought the process was fair back in the early 60s in South Africa,\u201d Blagojevich said, \u201che would say what I\u2019m saying today.\u201d Sounding a distinctly Trumpian note, given the president\u2019s conspiracy theory-laced complaints about the prosecution of allies including Stone, Blagojevich blamed his conviction on \u201cuncontrolled prosecutors who can do just about anything they want to do and are using their power to go after government officials\u201d. He also said prosecutors \u201clied to [the] jury\u201d about his actions. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who has actually been convicted of lying to the FBI, though, by that very same jury,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe very argument you are making right now \u2026 it was heard in the courtroom and no one bought it.\u201d Cooper then alluded to another infamous Trumpian tactic, made famous by the White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway.

The number of infections has increased by 229 to 433, officials said on Saturday, with most of the cases linked to the city of Daegu and surrounding region two hours south of Seoul. A 61-year-old woman in Daegu is believed to be at the heart of the rapid spread and is thought to have passed the infection to dozens, and possibly even hundreds, of fellow worshippers at the controversial Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Of the new cases announced on Saturday, 92 have been traced to patients or staff at Cheongdo Daenam hospital near Daegu. \u201cMost of the hospital\u2019s patients who have been diagnosed are those who had been staying as inpatients for mental illnesses,\u201d Seoul\u2019s vice health minister, Kim Gang-lip, told a media briefing.

It is the birthplace of its founder, Lee Man-hee, who has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and claims that he will take 144,000 people with him to Heaven, body and soul, on the Day of Judgement. County officials said on Friday that a three-day funeral was held for Lee\u2019s brother three weeks ago at a hall owned by the hospital. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, on Friday called for a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services. Kim said on Saturday that the outbreak had entered a serious new phase, but still expressed cautious optimism that it could be contained to the region surrounding Daegu, where the first case was reported on Tuesday.

Millions of people in China remain confined to their homes as the government tries to contain the spread of the virus, raising serious concerns about economy. But Liu Guoqiang, deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said on Saturday that borrowing costs would be guided downwards to help businesses stay afloat and that the impact of the virus would be \u201climited\u201d. As the World Health Organization warned on Friday that the window of opportunity to stop the spread of the virus was narrowing, it appeared to be spreading more widely across the world. Four people have now died from the virus in Iran and Italy recorded its first fatal case on Friday night. The British government said that an evacuation flight had left Japan on Saturday morning with 32 British and European passengers from the ship on board, as well as British government and medical staff. The organisers of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games postponed training for their army of volunteers on Saturday due to the coronavirus outbreak, but said that there was \u201cno consideration\u201d of cancelling the Games. Some 100 passengers who were in close contact with infected people on board began disembarking from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama on Saturday, local media said. They included the last batch of Japanese passengers to leave the ship while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for chartered aircraft to be sent by their governments.

Adams\u2019s rhythmic ingenuity in setting Goodman\u2019s text, in all its variety, is a topic in itself. As the performers\u2019 confidence grew, so that first uncertainty vanished. The sound was enhanced by a subtle amplification system (by German specialists d&amp;b audiotechnik), its first use in a UK opera. By the time Greene, in his Scottish Opera debut and brilliantly cast as Nixon, launched into his propulsive, media-addicted \u201cNews\u201d aria (\u201cit\u2019s prime time in the USA\u201d), all was well. As Mao, in his few appearances, Mark Le Brocq masterfully conveyed a sense both of charisma and folly. David Stout\u2019s Kissinger, awkward boffin, has little opportunity to show his inquisitive powers: \u201cPlease, where\u2019s the toilet?\u201d is one of his more memorable lines. The dancers in the violent, revolutionary ballet The Red Detachment of Women, the three secretaries to Mao (Louise Callinan, Sioned Gwen Davies, Emma Carrington), the \u201cchorus of Nixon in China\u201d and the orchestra of Scottish Opera all combined to make this a gripping and absorbing show. Yet the lyrical moments, the private reflections especially of Pat Nixon and of the philosophically inclined Chou En-lai \u2013 elegantly sung by Nicholas Lester \u2013 stood out. \u201cHow much of what we did was good?\u201d Chou asks at the end, contemplating lonely old age. And Richard Nixon, complex, ambiguous, so soon to be brought down by Watergate, has his own, all-American memories: \u201cI found the smell of burgers on the grill made grown men cry.\u201d Never the twain shall meet. Nixon in China is at the Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 27-29 February",

      "body": "<p>In early 2010, I was on the brink of bankruptcy and living in a friend\u2019s flat in Clevedon, near Bristol. I\u2019d been made redundant from my job as a journalist; I was temping and working in a pizza restaurant. I\u2019d maxed out my credit cards, and when I called the bank asking to extend my overdraft, I was refused. I came off the phone and broke down in tears. I even sold my prized record and CD collection. I was depressed and broke. Then I hit on the idea of applying to Deal Or No Deal.</p> <p>I filled in the application form online, telling my story as well as I could: my Serbian background; my love of culture; and my despair at not being able to provide for my 13-year-old daughter, Daisy. A few weeks later, I got a letter inviting me to audition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The winnings got me out of a financial black hole</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was incredibly nervous, but immersed myself in the various games and pieces to camera, and tried to chat confidently with the other applicants. At the end, they split us into two groups. \u201cWell, at least I gave it a shot,\u201d I thought. I wasn\u2019t hopeful, but mine was the group that went on the show.</p> <p>We were put up in a hotel in Bristol for two weeks, filming three or four shows a day. Even though only one person plays the game each episode, future contestants feature in the background, standing behind those famous sealed red boxes, each with a number from one to 22 on the front, containing a sum of money from 1p to \u00a3250,000. It was relentless, but a real buzz. Day after day, I watched my new friends from the wings, as they won anything from 1p to \u00a330,000. I bonded with the other contestants, did a bit of Serbian folk dancing for the studio audience, and dressed as an Arthurian knight for that week\u2019s medieval-themed shows. Then, after spending 15 shows in the wings, my name flashed up: it was my turn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d7937975b089cba0514f87dc3a38e254dcaa1b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d7937975b089cba0514f87dc3a38e254dcaa1b9/0_549_3639_4162/874.jpg\" alt=\"Velimir Ilic\" width=\"874\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was depressed and down. Then I hit on the idea of applying to Deal Or No Deal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Backstage, I was shaking. I told the production crew I felt too nervous to go on. Noel Edmonds appeared, put his arm around me, and said I\u2019d be fine; he seemed to radiate calm. As soon as I stepped into the spotlight, I felt my anxiety lift.</p> <p>After losing out on some of the big money boxes (\u00a350,000, \u00a375,000 and \u00a3100,000), I started to think how deflated I\u2019d feel if, after all this effort, I came away with nothing. Eventually, the Banker made me an offer to walk away with \u00a312,500 and I took a calculated risk, saying \u201cNo deal\u201d. As the end of the game loomed, with the \u00a3250,000 still in play, the Banker rang again and offered me \u00a320,000. I thought briefly about turning it down and ploughing on, but it was too risky. Noel asked me the famous question, and I replied: \u201cDeal.\u201d Waves of relief washed over me. \u201cFor Daisy!\u201d shouted Noel, and the tears (happy ones, this time) flowed. I\u2019d done the right thing: Noel revealed my own box had only \u00a3100 in it.</p> <p>The winnings got me out of my financial black hole. I could finally treat Daisy, pay off debts, buy a few records \u2013 and still pay the bills. Nearly 10 years on, as a freelance writer, money\u2019s still tight \u2013 but nowhere near as bad as it was. Daisy is now in her early 20s and financially independent.</p> <p>I often think about what a powerful and emotional experience it was, a defining moment. It gave me back my confidence, and taught me that, sometimes, you need to take yourself out of your comfort zone.</p> <p>How many other people\u2019s lives have been changed by a gameshow? Here are just a few. <strong>VI</strong></p> <h2>I met the love of my life: Alex McMillan, 25, Belfast</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"731ed702749a4df3633c9b34cafcd4edefbe411f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/731ed702749a4df3633c9b34cafcd4edefbe411f/1267_478_3480_2088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex McMillan and Laura Conlon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex McMillan and Laura Conlon: the couple met when Laura was the first person to join his university quiz team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My grandad watched Mastermind and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/jim-bowen-bullseye-host-and-comedian-dies-aged-80\" title=\"\">Bullseye</a>, and my dad was a huge fan of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9hqFMGoQbQtgegDMeUiDLw?app=desktop\" title=\"\">The Weakest Link</a>, to an almost religious level. I learned his trait of blurting out an answer: if you were right you could be really smug about it; if you were wrong, you could brush it off as if it was nothing.</p> <p>I loved the idea of people appearing on TV just for the sake of showing that they know things. I used to love learning interesting facts. I was never particularly athletic, so it was nice to be good at something.</p> <p>I was probably 10 or 11 when I first got a question that my dad didn\u2019t. It was the \u00a31m question on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?, about which planet had a satellite called Oberon. He took a guess, and even though I had no reason to be, I was confident that the answer was C. My dad looked bewildered that I knew it \u2013 I didn\u2019t, but he thought I did. I thought, \u201cSo, people are impressed when you know things that are of no consequence.\u201d I\u2019ve been trying to impress people with facts ever since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought we were quids in, as we had several science people on the team</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I started watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/19/only-connect-the-uneasy-appeal-of-britains-hardest-quiz-show\" title=\"\">Only Connect</a> a year before my dad died. It\u2019s a lateral-thinking show: you\u2019re given a series of clues with a common theme that isn\u2019t necessarily obvious, and you have to either state the connection or give the next one in a sequence. My dad watched it with me, but never really followed it. I was 16 when he passed away from liver failure, and I found a lot of comfort in the show. So two years later, as soon as I turned 18, I started trying to get on gameshows; I\u2019d have turned them all down to be on Only Connect.</p> <p>I started a computer games degree at Queen\u2019s University in 2013, and none of the societies really called out to me. When the student council gave me clearance to start a quiz society, I got excited. But nobody showed up to the first few events. At the first, I was left with three uneaten pizzas.</p> <p>In my third year, I made a full set of Only Connect-style test questions; I knew there had to be at least two other people who wanted to be on the show. I did a social media callout, and sat in the student union with my poxy little laptop plugged into a monitor. No one arrived for a little while, and then Laura walked in. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was the right room because I was the only person there, and asked if I was \u201cthe Only Connect guy\u201d. She seemed very enthused.</p> <p>She liked me, but I was oblivious to it. I should have realised when she applied to be on Fifteen To One, because she wanted to do something good for the quiz society, meaning me. She was deathly stressed about it.</p> <p>The first time we applied to Only Connect we were rejected quickly; the second time we were rejected after a long time, which hurt more. Laura wrote me a card of condolence, because I was more cut up about it than I should have been.</p> <p>But we did manage to get on to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/tenable/2a4724\" title=\"\">Tenable</a>. I\u2019d put together a team of five from the quiz society, named The Giant\u2019s Quizway. We managed to fluke our way through a Skype audition, and travelled together to Pinewood Studios near Slough. We managed to survive to the final round, where we were playing for \u00a311,000. Our final question was to list the words behind the acronyms \u201claser\u201d and \u201cscuba\u201d. I thought we were quids in, as we had several science people on the team, but we couldn\u2019t figure out what the \u201cs\u201d in laser stood for. To this day, \u201clight amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\u201d haunts me, doubly so because my physics teacher at secondary school said it might come in useful some day.</p> <p>Laura and I have now been together three years. We live together, and we\u2019ve worked together as question setters on Mastermind.</p> <p>I never managed to get on to Only Connect \u2013 and now I never will because I\u2019m writing for it, which is the better deal. I think if my dad knew I was writing for quiz shows he\u2019d be very boastful down the pub, about his clever wee son.</p> <h2>I flew my daughter to see her grandmother: Suda Perera, 33, Brighton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa668d5226807e58b72804c2eee91a8761a37869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa668d5226807e58b72804c2eee91a8761a37869/366_208_3235_1941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suda Perera: the academic wonmore than \u00a320,000 on two shows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suda Perera: the academic won more than \u00a320,000 on two shows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After I finished my master\u2019s in 2008, I was unemployed. I\u2019d moved back home, as had my best friend from school. His dad liked to do the pub quiz on a Sunday and they invited me. We kept winning and I fell in love with answering questions. I started watching quizzes and my mum, noticing me giving all the answers the contestants weren\u2019t getting, said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on one of them?\u201d</p> <p>I was 23 when I went on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008g90y\" title=\"\">Who Dares Wins</a>. You apply as an individual, and when you enter the studio you\u2019re partnered with a stranger as the cameras start rolling, so you have no time to get to know each other or discuss tactics. When we applied, they asked, \u201cWho would you not want to be paired with?\u201d I\u2019d said, \u201cAnyone who\u2019s overconfident and takes risks\u201d; I was paired with Danielle, who was really confident and took loads of risks. The first thing she said to me was, \u201cI asked not to be put with anyone thin \u2013 you\u2019re a stick!\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019re up against the defending champions. Our first topic was \u201cRobbie Williams\u2019 Top 40 singles\u201d and we had to decide how many we could name. We thought we could easily name 11, but bombed out at seven. Danielle overplayed our hand \u2013 but single-handedly carried the next one when we had to name British racing driving champions.</p> <p>After two rounds, it was a draw. In the last round, the teams had to take turns to name poet laureates. I knew all of them, so it was over pretty quickly. By the time we were knocked out, we\u2019d won \u00a312,500 each, which is not bad for a day\u2019s work. I realised I could pay off my student loan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The category was African capital cities; I'm a lecturer in African politics and love capital cities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last year, my life changed again after being on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08s3bgz\" title=\"\">Impossible</a>. You play against 23 other contestants answering multiple-choice questions; there\u2019s the right answer, the wrong answer and the impossible answer. For example, \u201cWhich European country has Madrid as its capital?\u201d Spain is the right answer, France is the wrong answer and Japan is impossible, because it\u2019s not a European country.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t that quick on the buzzer, but I never gave an impossible answer. After every five questions, the person with the most points goes to the prize board. It must have been divine intervention, because when I got there, the category was African capital cities; I\u2019m a lecturer in African politics and love capital cities. For a moment I panicked: \u201cIf I get this wrong, my career is over.\u201d When I gave my answers and the money dropped, it was just the most incredible relief. I won \u00a310,000.</p> <p>I\u2019d told the show that if I won the money, I was going to take my seven-month-old Tomiri to see both of her grandmothers (one lives in Sri Lanka, the other in South Africa), and we did use some of the money to go to South Africa. But my maternity pay had already run out, and I was taking on zero-hour contracts to make up the rent. When I saw \u00a310,000 I thought, \u201cIf I want to take three or six more months to think about going back to work, I can afford that now.\u201d It made a huge difference.</p> <p>I think most people who go on gameshows need the money for essential things, like house repairs, or supplementing when they\u2019ve just been made redundant. TV shows want to make dreams come true, stories like taking their kid to Disneyland or to swim with dolphins. But the truth is, our dreams are being able to pay our rent.</p> <h2>I got my dream job: Julia Hobbs, 48, Reading</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ecc04179a5979ca4b0dbddf4f015f12288e2e53c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecc04179a5979ca4b0dbddf4f015f12288e2e53c/703_377_4437_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Hobbs: the former administrator won \u00a361,000 after she was made redundant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Hobbs: the former administrator won \u00a361,000 after she was made redundant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January 2008, I was made redundant. I\u2019d been working in the City, providing admin support. I felt betrayed; I\u2019d been there seven years and had always been enthusiastic.</p> <p>Nine days later, I was in the audience of the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007y5mv\" title=\"\">1 vs 100</a>, one of those gameshows on before the national lottery. Going on quiz shows had always been a hobby, although the chances of winning anything on this one were slim: there were 100 people in the \u201caudience\u201d and one contestant. A multiple-choice question comes up on the screen, and the 100 people have five seconds to select an answer on a handset. The contestant then answers the question, independently. Every person in the 100 who got the question wrong is out; the player gets \u00a31,000 for everyone they knock out \u2013 but if they get too many wrong, they are replaced by a member of the 100.</p> <p>On the final show of the day, the player was knocked out. I was one of 17 people still in the game, so I knew I was in with a chance of being chosen to play. I was on the end of a row. They flashed a light across us and I looked at the monitor, saw my face and thought, \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s me!\u201d They put me into makeup and then suddenly I was up there, answering questions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had a choice of bailing with the money I'd won so far, or going for a \u00a350,000 bonus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I knocked out quite a lot of people with my first question, then managed to knock out the rest over the next couple. You also get the opportunity to dodge three questions, which I did \u2013 but if you do that, your prize fund is halved. It was all about survival. When the last question came up, I had a choice of bailing with the money I\u2019d won so far, or going for a \u00a350,000 bonus. If I got it wrong, I\u2019d leave with nothing. The host, Ben Shephard asked the question: \u201cWhere would you find the hyoid bone? \u201d I remember thinking: \u201cI know the answer, I\u2019m going to win this money. I can settle my debts. I can be something else.\u201d I answered \u201cthroat\u201d and walked away with \u00a361,000.</p> <p>After the show, I called my partner and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Peru!\u201d One of his close friends was getting married there, but we\u2019d told them we couldn\u2019t afford to go. I had job interviews lined up; on the Monday, I cancelled them. I decided to have some me time and think about what I wanted to do. I was still on my redundancy period and didn\u2019t have to go into work, but I went in so I could tell them I\u2019d won the money. It was the most amazing feeling, being able to say, \u201cGuess what happened to me at the weekend?\u201d</p> <p>Then, in November 2008, a producer, Luke Kelly, called to say he\u2019d been working on a revamped version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/oct/13/going-for-gold-revival\" title=\"\">Going For Gold</a> on Channel 5, and they had a question setter who was leaving. He remembered I was interested in question setting and asked if I wanted to come for an interview. I wrote him a sample selection of questions and had a meeting with the series producer. The next thing I knew, he was calling me to say I\u2019d got the job.</p> <p>Since then, I\u2019ve worked on Pointless, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7R21uYn3k\" title=\"\">Tipping Point</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06bnq0f\" title=\"\">Decimate</a>, The Fanatics, Divided, and I\u2019m at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thechase\" title=\"\">The Chase</a> now as a question producer.

      "bodyText": "In early 2010, I was on the brink of bankruptcy and living in a friend\u2019s flat in Clevedon, near Bristol. I\u2019d been made redundant from my job as a journalist; I was temping and working in a pizza restaurant. I\u2019d maxed out my credit cards, and when I called the bank asking to extend my overdraft, I was refused. I came off the phone and broke down in tears. I even sold my prized record and CD collection. I was depressed and broke. Then I hit on the idea of applying to Deal Or No Deal. I filled in the application form online, telling my story as well as I could: my Serbian background; my love of culture; and my despair at not being able to provide for my 13-year-old daughter, Daisy. A few weeks later, I got a letter inviting me to audition. I was incredibly nervous, but immersed myself in the various games and pieces to camera, and tried to chat confidently with the other applicants. At the end, they split us into two groups. \u201cWell, at least I gave it a shot,\u201d I thought. I wasn\u2019t hopeful, but mine was the group that went on the show. We were put up in a hotel in Bristol for two weeks, filming three or four shows a day. Even though only one person plays the game each episode, future contestants feature in the background, standing behind those famous sealed red boxes, each with a number from one to 22 on the front, containing a sum of money from 1p to \u00a3250,000. It was relentless, but a real buzz. Day after day, I watched my new friends from the wings, as they won anything from 1p to \u00a330,000. I bonded with the other contestants, did a bit of Serbian folk dancing for the studio audience, and dressed as an Arthurian knight for that week\u2019s medieval-themed shows. Then, after spending 15 shows in the wings, my name flashed up: it was my turn. Backstage, I was shaking. I told the production crew I felt too nervous to go on. Noel Edmonds appeared, put his arm around me, and said I\u2019d be fine; he seemed to radiate calm. As soon as I stepped into the spotlight, I felt my anxiety lift. After losing out on some of the big money boxes (\u00a350,000, \u00a375,000 and \u00a3100,000), I started to think how deflated I\u2019d feel if, after all this effort, I came away with nothing. Eventually, the Banker made me an offer to walk away with \u00a312,500 and I took a calculated risk, saying \u201cNo deal\u201d. As the end of the game loomed, with the \u00a3250,000 still in play, the Banker rang again and offered me \u00a320,000. I thought briefly about turning it down and ploughing on, but it was too risky. Noel asked me the famous question, and I replied: \u201cDeal.\u201d Waves of relief washed over me. \u201cFor Daisy!\u201d shouted Noel, and the tears (happy ones, this time) flowed. I\u2019d done the right thing: Noel revealed my own box had only \u00a3100 in it. The winnings got me out of my financial black hole. I could finally treat Daisy, pay off debts, buy a few records \u2013 and still pay the bills. Nearly 10 years on, as a freelance writer, money\u2019s still tight \u2013 but nowhere near as bad as it was. Daisy is now in her early 20s and financially independent. I often think about what a powerful and emotional experience it was, a defining moment. It gave me back my confidence, and taught me that, sometimes, you need to take yourself out of your comfort zone. How many other people\u2019s lives have been changed by a gameshow? Here are just a few. VI I met the love of my life: Alex McMillan, 25, Belfast My grandad watched Mastermind and Bullseye, and my dad was a huge fan of The Weakest Link, to an almost religious level. I learned his trait of blurting out an answer: if you were right you could be really smug about it; if you were wrong, you could brush it off as if it was nothing. I loved the idea of people appearing on TV just for the sake of showing that they know things. I used to love learning interesting facts. I was never particularly athletic, so it was nice to be good at something. I was probably 10 or 11 when I first got a question that my dad didn\u2019t. It was the \u00a31m question on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?, about which planet had a satellite called Oberon. He took a guess, and even though I had no reason to be, I was confident that the answer was C. My dad looked bewildered that I knew it \u2013 I didn\u2019t, but he thought I did. I thought, \u201cSo, people are impressed when you know things that are of no consequence.\u201d I\u2019ve been trying to impress people with facts ever since. I started watching Only Connect a year before my dad died. It\u2019s a lateral-thinking show: you\u2019re given a series of clues with a common theme that isn\u2019t necessarily obvious, and you have to either state the connection or give the next one in a sequence. My dad watched it with me, but never really followed it. I was 16 when he passed away from liver failure, and I found a lot of comfort in the show. So two years later, as soon as I turned 18, I started trying to get on gameshows; I\u2019d have turned them all down to be on Only Connect. I started a computer games degree at Queen\u2019s University in 2013, and none of the societies really called out to me. When the student council gave me clearance to start a quiz society, I got excited. But nobody showed up to the first few events. At the first, I was left with three uneaten pizzas. In my third year, I made a full set of Only Connect-style test questions; I knew there had to be at least two other people who wanted to be on the show. I did a social media callout, and sat in the student union with my poxy little laptop plugged into a monitor. No one arrived for a little while, and then Laura walked in. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was the right room because I was the only person there, and asked if I was \u201cthe Only Connect guy\u201d. She seemed very enthused. She liked me, but I was oblivious to it. I should have realised when she applied to be on Fifteen To One, because she wanted to do something good for the quiz society, meaning me. She was deathly stressed about it. The first time we applied to Only Connect we were rejected quickly; the second time we were rejected after a long time, which hurt more. Laura wrote me a card of condolence, because I was more cut up about it than I should have been. But we did manage to get on to Tenable. I\u2019d put together a team of five from the quiz society, named The Giant\u2019s Quizway. We managed to fluke our way through a Skype audition, and travelled together to Pinewood Studios near Slough. We managed to survive to the final round, where we were playing for \u00a311,000. Our final question was to list the words behind the acronyms \u201claser\u201d and \u201cscuba\u201d. I thought we were quids in, as we had several science people on the team, but we couldn\u2019t figure out what the \u201cs\u201d in laser stood for. To this day, \u201clight amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\u201d haunts me, doubly so because my physics teacher at secondary school said it might come in useful some day. Laura and I have now been together three years. We live together, and we\u2019ve worked together as question setters on Mastermind. I never managed to get on to Only Connect \u2013 and now I never will because I\u2019m writing for it, which is the better deal. I think if my dad knew I was writing for quiz shows he\u2019d be very boastful down the pub, about his clever wee son. I flew my daughter to see her grandmother: Suda Perera, 33, Brighton After I finished my master\u2019s in 2008, I was unemployed. I\u2019d moved back home, as had my best friend from school. His dad liked to do the pub quiz on a Sunday and they invited me. We kept winning and I fell in love with answering questions. I started watching quizzes and my mum, noticing me giving all the answers the contestants weren\u2019t getting, said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on one of them?\u201d I was 23 when I went on Who Dares Wins. You apply as an individual, and when you enter the studio you\u2019re partnered with a stranger as the cameras start rolling, so you have no time to get to know each other or discuss tactics. When we applied, they asked, \u201cWho would you not want to be paired with?\u201d I\u2019d said, \u201cAnyone who\u2019s overconfident and takes risks\u201d; I was paired with Danielle, who was really confident and took loads of risks. The first thing she said to me was, \u201cI asked not to be put with anyone thin \u2013 you\u2019re a stick!\u201d You\u2019re up against the defending champions. Our first topic was \u201cRobbie Williams\u2019 Top 40 singles\u201d and we had to decide how many we could name. We thought we could easily name 11, but bombed out at seven. Danielle overplayed our hand \u2013 but single-handedly carried the next one when we had to name British racing driving champions. After two rounds, it was a draw. In the last round, the teams had to take turns to name poet laureates. I knew all of them, so it was over pretty quickly. By the time we were knocked out, we\u2019d won \u00a312,500 each, which is not bad for a day\u2019s work. I realised I could pay off my student loan. Last year, my life changed again after being on Impossible. You play against 23 other contestants answering multiple-choice questions; there\u2019s the right answer, the wrong answer and the impossible answer. For example, \u201cWhich European country has Madrid as its capital?\u201d Spain is the right answer, France is the wrong answer and Japan is impossible, because it\u2019s not a European country. I wasn\u2019t that quick on the buzzer, but I never gave an impossible answer. After every five questions, the person with the most points goes to the prize board. It must have been divine intervention, because when I got there, the category was African capital cities; I\u2019m a lecturer in African politics and love capital cities. For a moment I panicked: \u201cIf I get this wrong, my career is over.\u201d When I gave my answers and the money dropped, it was just the most incredible relief. I won \u00a310,000. I\u2019d told the show that if I won the money, I was going to take my seven-month-old Tomiri to see both of her grandmothers (one lives in Sri Lanka, the other in South Africa), and we did use some of the money to go to South Africa. But my maternity pay had already run out, and I was taking on zero-hour contracts to make up the rent. When I saw \u00a310,000 I thought, \u201cIf I want to take three or six more months to think about going back to work, I can afford that now.\u201d It made a huge difference. I think most people who go on gameshows need the money for essential things, like house repairs, or supplementing when they\u2019ve just been made redundant. TV shows want to make dreams come true, stories like taking their kid to Disneyland or to swim with dolphins. But the truth is, our dreams are being able to pay our rent. I got my dream job: Julia Hobbs, 48, Reading In January 2008, I was made redundant. I\u2019d been working in the City, providing admin support. I felt betrayed; I\u2019d been there seven years and had always been enthusiastic. Nine days later, I was in the audience of the BBC\u2019s 1 vs 100, one of those gameshows on before the national lottery. Going on quiz shows had always been a hobby, although the chances of winning anything on this one were slim: there were 100 people in the \u201caudience\u201d and one contestant. A multiple-choice question comes up on the screen, and the 100 people have five seconds to select an answer on a handset. The contestant then answers the question, independently. Every person in the 100 who got the question wrong is out; the player gets \u00a31,000 for everyone they knock out \u2013 but if they get too many wrong, they are replaced by a member of the 100. On the final show of the day, the player was knocked out. I was one of 17 people still in the game, so I knew I was in with a chance of being chosen to play. I was on the end of a row. They flashed a light across us and I looked at the monitor, saw my face and thought, \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s me!\u201d They put me into makeup and then suddenly I was up there, answering questions. I knocked out quite a lot of people with my first question, then managed to knock out the rest over the next couple. You also get the opportunity to dodge three questions, which I did \u2013 but if you do that, your prize fund is halved. It was all about survival. When the last question came up, I had a choice of bailing with the money I\u2019d won so far, or going for a \u00a350,000 bonus. If I got it wrong, I\u2019d leave with nothing. The host, Ben Shephard asked the question: \u201cWhere would you find the hyoid bone? \u201d I remember thinking: \u201cI know the answer, I\u2019m going to win this money. I can settle my debts. I can be something else.\u201d I answered \u201cthroat\u201d and walked away with \u00a361,000. After the show, I called my partner and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Peru!\u201d One of his close friends was getting married there, but we\u2019d told them we couldn\u2019t afford to go. I had job interviews lined up; on the Monday, I cancelled them. I decided to have some me time and think about what I wanted to do. I was still on my redundancy period and didn\u2019t have to go into work, but I went in so I could tell them I\u2019d won the money. It was the most amazing feeling, being able to say, \u201cGuess what happened to me at the weekend?\u201d Then, in November 2008, a producer, Luke Kelly, called to say he\u2019d been working on a revamped version of Going For Gold on Channel 5, and they had a question setter who was leaving. He remembered I was interested in question setting and asked if I wanted to come for an interview. I wrote him a sample selection of questions and had a meeting with the series producer. The next thing I knew, he was calling me to say I\u2019d got the job. Since then, I\u2019ve worked on Pointless, Tipping Point, Decimate, The Fanatics, Divided, and I\u2019m at The Chase now as a question producer. I have my dream job. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that I\u2019m grateful every single day for what I do. Pit your wits: can you answer the life-changing questions our contestants faced? Alex McMillan, The Chase \u2022 In 2004, which former South African president retired from public life? \u2022 Which British chef created a meat fruit bowl and chicken curry ice-cream? \u2022 Which 60s children\u2019s TV puppet series featured the aquaphibians? \u2022 What Renault car model was advertised with the \u201cva-va-voom\u201d slogan? \u2022 A Shanghai can be scored in what pub game?

The story of the night was the Maori All Stars - winning back their pride after last year\u2019s capitulation, but it was a game very much in the balance for nearly 70 minutes. They\u2019ll go home satisfied on the Gold Coast, even those supporting the Indigenous All Stars, but the fans saw some terrific rugby league there. I\u2019m not even going to attempt to wrap all the A-League, W-League, AFLW, Super Rugby, Super W and Cricket T20 World Cup action we\u2019ve had today - feel free to scroll back through this at your leisure. The standout results perhaps the AFLW win by Freo over conference rivals Collingwood, and the Reds\u2019 thumping Super Rugby win over the Sunwolves. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more of the same - thanks for your company! They faded late in the contest last year - it wasn\u2019t to happen twice - as the Maori All Stars run home comfortable winners in the final quarter. Brandon Smith with a brace of tries, Kayln Ponga huge at the back, and it\u2019s plenty of smiles for those in green at full time. Great celebrations, and their fans in the crowd are delighted. A tough, fast, high-quality contest. What a start to the 2020 NRL season. NRL All-Stars: Try! 1\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-30 Maori They kick for the corner, and there\u2019s a moment of havoc as the first defender misses it! It bobbles in goal, but Hughes eventually tidies. A big smile as he takes the tackle - they can run down the clock from here, the Maori. But they don\u2019t! Hughes kicks centre-field and Latrell misses it! A very fortuitous bounce and it\u2019s Dylan Walker rushing through the middle to score under the posts! They let Adam Blair take the final conversion - and he slots it. NRL All-Stars: 3\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-24 Maori A bit of a silly penalty to concede as Latrell flops on Ponga after the tackle was effected. They\u2019re running out of minutes, the IAS, and now they have to defend another set of six. They do, but it\u2019s a scrabbly start to their set. Eventually we stop for a knock-on against MAS, so they do have time for perhaps one last crack the home side. NRL All-Stars: Try! 4\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-24 Maori (Smith) This lad is a man on a mission! Brandon Smith has ducked the head and beat the line. For the third time in nearly as many minutes the Wombat gets among it. 151 run metres, and now - two tries! What a game from the bloke who can\u2019t even get a game at the Storm. NRL All-Stars: 6\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-18 Maori No try! It\u2019s the man they call \u201cthe Wombat\u201d who burrows over - and does he catch the line? The video men say \u201cno\u201d - that\u2019s a double movement. Oh my, that\u2019s a tight call. He deserved a double, Smith - gee he\u2019s a hard worker. NRL All-Stars: 7\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-18 Maori From the kick off, IAS have pushed the margins, but Proctor takes it with a foot on the line! Into touch - we have a 50m penalty and re-start for the Maori. Big opportunity to put this game to bed here. NRL All-Stars: Try! 10\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-18 Maori Big play! The Maori strip one-on-one about 30m out from IAS\u2019 line, and they stay down this end. And Brandon Smith sells his marker with the dummy and ducks the head from dummy-half and beats through 2-3 would-be tacklers to score under the posts! Ponga converts - and the Maori are back in the lead! NRL All-Stars: 12\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-12 Maori They put it on the toe on the last, the MAS - but it\u2019s a bit of a damp sock, a dribbling kick from Bromwich, easily tidied up 20m out. IAS then grind through a rugged, straight-forward set of six, and the MAS bring it out from 20m out from their own line. NRL All-Stars: 15\u2019 to play - Indigenous 16-12 Maori They were within two metres of the line, the Kiwis - but Addo-Carr cleans up with a desperate tidy. Jack Wighton looks to clear the IAS\u2019s line with a booming kick - that must have flown 60m or so - but it\u2019s gone into touch! Pressure still on. And we have our first \u201ccaptain\u2019s challenge\u201d - and it\u2019s unsuccessful! They thought there was a strip, the IAS players - no dice say the men with the TV screens. NRL All-Stars: No try! Indigenous 16-12 Maori They thought they\u2019d struck straight away, the Kiwis, but there\u2019s a slight knock-forward in the build up and their four pointer is ruled out. Frenetic stuff, once again - two minutes in. So - there\u2019s three-quarter-time. They\u2019ve been immense the Maori All-Stars, physically, but a few too many missed tackles have crept into their game, with the Indigenous All-Stars enjoying 55% of the possession, and completing better than their opponents - 20/27 v 15/25. You have to say, this switch to four quarters does make for a more high-octane game of footy. Plenty of time to suck in some deep ones, and watch for the hits inside the first few minutes. Mind you - there have been some very heavy injuries this game; you don\u2019t want NRL going the way of NFL with teams of 60 players getting broken and then disappearing. Surely player safety has to be forefront of the considerations as well. NRL All-Stars match: Try! Indigenous 16-12 Maori (Roberts) They\u2019ve struck late in the quarter once again, and it\u2019s the teenage wrecking ball, David Fifita, who gets the run going, before James Roberts turns Ponga inside out to score 10m to the right of the posts! Ferguson adds the extras from the boot, and they\u2019re in the lead for the first time. Okay! I think that\u2019s everything else in bed. Let\u2019s take home the All Stars game - we\u2019ve got almost a full half to play, and it\u2019s still 10-12, the visitors marginally leading. You have to say, it\u2019s a draw that does nothing for anyone. The Victory players said pre-game that they \u201chad to win three points\u201d. They didn\u2019t. Hard on the home fans, Newcastle were arguably the better side, and they would have loved the two extra points today. Great to see Wes Hoolahan finally make his A-League bow after missing most of the season through injury. It was a high-energy and exciting game, all things said though - with Victory offering a better showing after the break. Still - they\u2019re not going to feature in the finals if they can\u2019t get some wins - the club with claims to being the biggest in the country. And here\u2019s a cracking headline for you - lovers of Olympics diving. I\u2019ll let you click through and tell me more about this piece. I\u2019ve got A-League to watch: And a small caveat apology to our followers from across the dutch for the lack of diacritics or macrons throughout our coverage today. As Guardian readers are notoriously the most demanding of observers when it comes to glyphs etc let us both assume that every time I\u2019ve written Maori, I clearly have meant M\u0101ori. But for me to do that on this keyboard while simultaneously covering 57+ sports today is just not feasible, or put otherwise, it would be tu meke. Chur. NRL All-Stars: Indigenous 10-12 Maori - half-time He lit up last year\u2019s contest with a special backflip, and Blake Ferguson has struck again just before half-time! Kodi Nikorima put the Maori back in front - despite the visitors going down to twelve after Hughes\u2019 sin-binning, but it was Ferguson - the man from Wellington (NSW) - who stung the Kiwis with an effort in the corner. Big half (or two quarters) to come! Wowee. That was pretty emphatic. A terrific home performance from the Queenslanders who were simply a gear above for most of the 80 minutes. The Sunwolves crossing late to spare their blushes, a little, but that was an utter rout. Isaac Lucas and Joshua Nasser with the final tries to snuff out any hint of a revival. Champagne in the showers stuff for the Reds. Well, it was closer than many may have expected, but they\u2019ve got there in the end, the Windies. The skipper Stafanie Taylor seeing the Calypso Girls home with her knock of 26* with support from Shemaine Campbelle (23*) at the other end. They run down the Thai total of 78 with 20 balls to spare - 3/80 (16.4) the final tally. A big sigh of relief - that\u2019s game one from Pool B down and dusted. And some Olympics news for those that are passionate about their canoeing (canoevians?) It\u2019s another gold to the prodigiously talented Jess Fox, but a young Tassie lad could also be Tokyo-bound after a fine showing in the men\u2019s C1: It was 40 at the break, it\u2019s 80 at the final whistle. Too much experience, too much muscle, too much fast running. As a slight consolation at least the home side get on the board this half, but it\u2019s a real rugby lesson they\u2019ve been handed today. Still, plenty of young players coming through the ranks in WA - they\u2019ll be better for this experience. What an absolute cracker! They had almost 100+ more possessions, the Magpies, but their kicking has not matched the quality of the Dockers when it mattered. It was the battle of the undefeated teams, but it\u2019s Fremantle who stay top in Conference B. They didn\u2019t score at all in the second quarter, and notched just one behind in the final term, but they\u2019ve squeaked home. A thriller - great contest. A-League - Goal! Newcastle 1-1 Melbourne (Toivonen) 48 min: It didn\u2019t take long after the break, and honestly: who else. It\u2019s Ola \u201cGoala\u201d Toivonen - the Victory skipper and talisman who gets his side back in this game. They looked down and out almost all the first half, but the giant Swede has hammered home a delightful far-post header to level the ledger off Tim Hoogeland\u2019s perfectly-weighted cross. Game. On. NRL All-Stars: Indigenous 6-6 Maori - quarter-time They draw level just before the first break, the home heroes as Josh Curran crashes over near the posts. It all turned on that Addo-Carr interception: if the Maori go in 12-0 makes this an entirely different contest. Still: 3x 20 minutes still to come. A few rule changes here tonight: four-quarter footy; unlimited interchange, and captains can argue the ref\u2019s toss. A brave new world. Now, sports sometimes like to over-egg a narrative some time, but if you\u2019ve read anything about this little fella - well, he just melts your heart. Quaden Bayles. He\u2019s the nine-year-old Murri boy who also has dwarfism, and a confronting video of the bullying that he deals with on a daily basis has gone all around the globe. I saw him interviewed, so quietly decent and stoic about just trying to live his life as him. Honestly, it\u2019s heart-wrenching. But he\u2019s been embraced by the entire Indigenous All Stars team this week - meeting his heroes at training - and what a night this will be for him. Absolute little legend. Let\u2019s hope others feel better from his example. A-League: Newcastle Jets 1-0 Melbourne Victory - half-time It\u2019s been a hard watch for the Victory faithful, they\u2019ve been second best in almost every category. Some head-scratching decisions from interim coach Carlos Salvachua who has winger Marco Rojas trying to pull the strings as a No 10, and defensive midfielder Giancarlo Gallifuoco deputising at right back. Needless to say, it\u2019s not exactly clicked for them. Still, plenty of talent on the pitch to turn it around. 9 min: Oh my - this is Harlem Globetrotters stuff from the Maori All-Stars! They\u2019ve hardly trained together, and they\u2019ve almost gone coast-to-coast with a sublime passage of play - but Addo-Carr has produced a try-saving interception about 5m outside his own line! The noise from the fans is at fever pitch - this is unbelievable rugby league already. NRL All Stars - Try! Indigenous 0-6 Maoris (DWZ) 4 min: It\u2019s a terrific pass out from Jahrome Hughes and they get it to the man in the corner and it\u2019s Dallin Watene-Zelezniak who drops a casual one-handed superman to score in the corner! A flying start, and what a fine conversion from Ponga from the sideline. And from the restart Josh Addo-Carr has just been absolutely crunched! Gee, there\u2019s some big hits flying round out there already. So - we\u2019re just moments away from the Indigenous v Maori All-Stars clash. Latrell v Ponga at fullback. What a contest that\u2019s going to be. Really strong lineups for both sides. And if you were already fizzing for this one, check this hype video. Great scenes. First whistle - and we\u2019re away: and the first tackle is an immense hit! Gee, you hope everyone\u2019s warm, that was ferocious. And some big news trickling in from the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup as we approach the halfway point of the West Indies\u2019 innings - and they\u2019re not exactly doing it easy. They\u2019re 3/37 off 9 overs. The Thai debutants are bowling brilliantly here - but some of the running between the wicket has been questionable. Two run outs among the three wickets lost - or, rather thrown away. 42 runs off 66 is the equation. And suddenly, this one\u2019s not a foregone conclusion! Super Rugby: Queensland Reds 36-0 Sunwolves - half-time Well, they started off scoring at a point a minute, and they appear to have liked it so much they decided to continue in that fashion. I saw the stat that this is the most first-half points in a Super Rugby game for the Reds in a decade. Lovely stuff. Tate McDermott and then the Wallabies duo of Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and James O\u2019Connor with tries to keep the scoreboard ticking over. As you know, I\u2019m not one to go too hard, too early - but I think we can conclusively call it after just a handful of rounds: Australian rugby is back, baby. (*Ducks for cover*) A-League - 22 min: Petratos catches the crossbar! He\u2019s a crafty player, Dimi, but even he may not have entirely meant that, as the wind catches his curling corner and almost deposits it in Lawrence Thomas\u2019 top-left bins. And can you believe this - they\u2019ve rattled the frame again! We\u2019re having a VAR check, at first glance it looked to have hammered off the crossbar - but the computer men say it\u2019s crossed the line! Goal to Newcastle Jets - it\u2019s a first on his return to Newcastle for Roy the Boy - a terrific, fast transition raid following a fine cross from Petratos! And for Victory supporters trying to work out what\u2019s happening to their side - here\u2019s a pretty succinct summary from one of the faithful: Dark days. Still - plenty of time in this one. And you\u2019ve still got Big Ola. Super W - Rugby WA 0-40 Queensland Reds - half-time: Look away Twiggy, it\u2019s not going so well over in the West. This has been a masterclass from the Reds, but that will surprise few, given they put 112 on the Rebels during round one. Former national team skipper Liz Patu helping herself to a hattrick of tries. You would say she\u2019s looking hungry, but I promised myself no biting jokes. 70% possession to the visitors; this has been very dominant. Still, plenty of young talent in this WA squad. AFLW - Fremantle 3.0 (18) lead Collingwood 2.5 (17) - 2nd qtr It\u2019s been all the Magpies during this second quarter, with former Diamonds star Sharni Layton really putting herself about in the middle of a crowded pack. But they\u2019ve been defending resolutely the home side, scrapping and fighting for every contested ball. They started brightly, Freo, with Roxxy Roux and Gabby O\u2019Sullivan combining well once again, but you sense they\u2019re in a real battle now. A-League - Goal! Disallowed! 8 min: They thought they\u2019d taken the lead, the home side - but to the fans\u2019 chagrin it\u2019s been chalked off. Thurgate with the curling effort, but it\u2019s deflected off the back of referee Alireza Faghani, who\u2019s decided to rule out his own \u201cassist\u201d. It\u2019s the correct decision - the goal only comes about because of the deflection off the man with the whistle. A-League - Newcastle v Melbourne - kick-off! And we\u2019re underway in the Hunter. Huge test this, with the Victory players calling this clash their \u201cgrand final\u201d given how badly they need to pick up points if they\u2019re to make a late push for the top six and finals football. An interesting subplot for Jets fans - it\u2019s only taken 20 rounds, but marquee signing, Wes Hoolahan is officially ready for action: he\u2019s on the bench and could come on for 20-25 minutes late on. Super Rugby - Try! Queensland Reds 19-0 Sunwolves - 15\u2019 Wowee. They\u2019ve come to play at Lang Park. Liam Wright got the Reds moving after just five minutes, before Taniela Tupou crashed over just minutes later. But on the quarter-hour mark it\u2019s a first ever Super Rugby try for the youngster Hunter Paisami! He\u2019s in the side due to the season-ending injury to rising star Jordan Petaia; but have the Reds found the next \u201cBig Thing\u201d of Australian rugby? A blistering start - let\u2019s see if they can keep it up. Sunwolves are shellshocked. If you missed the opening game last night there was of course a bit of a boilover. We knew pre-tournament they were a bit of a dark horse, but India have thrown down a huge gauntlet to the rest of the field - knocking over the Southern Stars, on home soil, if you don\u2019t mind. Geoff Lemon was our eyes and ears at the ground last night - here\u2019s his match report: Women\u2019s T20 World Cup: Thailand 9/78 (20) - end of innings It\u2019s the West Indies sitting pretty in the opening match from group B - with the firepower at their disposal you\u2019d have to imagine they\u2019ll run down a relatively small total like this. Huge credit to the Thai XI appearing at their first World Cup, booking the final qualifying spots, alongside Bangladesh. Nannapat Koncharoenkai the standout for them with 33 with the bat. Let\u2019s hope they can grab an early wicket or two to at least make this one a little nervy. So - what\u2019s up next, you ask, as my fingers already begin to be reduced to bleeding stumps. Well, there\u2019s two matches from the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, Super W action, AFLW as Freo take on the Pies, a second A-League fixture Jets v Victory, Super Rugby with Reds v Sunwolves, and of course - the big one: the Indigenous v Maori All Stars season curtain raiser. Latrell Mitchell at fullback, you say? Sure, why not. They have a reputation for scoring late goals - a testament to the strong sense of team purpose that Robbie Fowler has forged up in Queensland this season - but would you believe it; they\u2019ve snatched a late goal against Perth, for the second time this season. It\u2019s the English centre back Macaulay Gillesphey who\u2019s popped up with a header from the corner. Tony Popovic would be steaming, as the win would have put Perth in clear second on the ladder. Perhaps the midweek Asian Champions League exertions saw the Glory fade a little late on. And they did hang on! Good to see at least somebody in the Australian conference is winning games - they\u2019ve pulled five points clear already at this early stage of the season, the Brumbies. A fine performance from Noah Lolesio who guided his pack around the park brilliantly, with some resolute defence and fine work at the breakdown late on prevents the inevitable Chiefs\u2019 come back. Big win. Great for the Australian game. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve got about four screens going and I missed this one - but that steady hand on the tiller Scott Heinrich had his eyes across it. A pulsating finish to the inaugural QClash - here\u2019s his summary: A ripper, a gripper, a tugger of the nerves at Metricon for the first AFLW QClash and, in the end, no winner but footy itself. These teams put on a real display and left nothing out on the park, nothing at all. The Suns came home hard and drew level courtesy of a sweetly-struck set shot from Kalinda Howarth, her third goal for the game, five minutes from time. But they could do no more and this rivalry begins with a draw, the fourth in AFLW history. Can we please have one of these each week? And some bad news ahead of the NRL season in the final trial match between the Warriors and the Storm. Again, from AAP: The Warriors\u2019 18-16 trial loss to Melbourne Storm has been soured by serious-looking injuries to two rising front-rowers. The visitors scored four tries to three in a tight encounter in Palmerston North on Saturday, securing victory through a late try to second-rower Chris Lewis. While a Melbourne side comprised largely of second-stringers appeared to emerge with no injury concerns, the Warriors faced the worrying sight of young props Jackson Frei and Phillip Makatoa being assisted from the field. Both appeared to have damaged a knee, the ailments coming in the wake of first grade prop Bunty Afoa having been ruled out for most of the season with an ACL tear. Cooper Johns, son of legendary Matty Johns, hooker Harry Grant and wing Sandor Earl crossed before halftime to put Melbourne 14-12 ahead after the Warriors created tries to halves Paul Turner and Chanel Harris-Tavita. Winger Setu Tu put the hosts in front midway through an error-prone second half before Lewis\u2019s match-winner came via a neat pass from fullback Nicho Hynes. They lost the inaugural clash last year, and based on the scale of the celebrations, that certainly meant something very special to the Aussie girls. The Ferns took the lead after just three minutes through Kerehitina Matua, before Steph Mooka levelled the ledger after 12 minutes. It was right in the balance until near the end, when Nakia Davis-Welsh clinched a terrific take from the skipper Talisha Harden off the kick of Jenni-Sue Hoepper. Plenty of mob from all across New South Wales and Queensland getting along to this match - what a great celebration of a game that means so much to regional communities. Super Rugby - 76 min: The Chiefs are laying siege to the Brumbies\u2019 line, they have a 5m lineout feed - but would you believe: they\u2019ve been pinged for the throw being not in straight! A huge error, in the context of this game. And can they hang on from here, the team from Canberra? Would be a big result - Australian sides don\u2019t win too many \u201cacross the dutch\u201d. Super Rugby - 70\u2019: Chiefs 14-26 Brumbies About ten to play in the Waikato, where they\u2019re huffing and puffing like the big, bad wolf, the Chiefs. As mentioned, the Brumbies shot out to a 0-26 lead - tries to Tom Banks, former leaguie Solomone Kata and Pete Samu saw the visitors dominate the first half. A second to Samu saw more of the same after the break, before Aaron Cruden and Anton Lienert-Brown finally got the home side on the board. Let\u2019s keep eyes on this one now. Some news for our motoring enthusiasts - it\u2019s not been a great news week for the Holden brand, but one man\u2019s still flying the flag. This from our colleagues at Australian Associated Press: Holden legend Jamie Whincup will start the season-opening Supercars race at the Adelaide 500 in pole position. Fresh off confirming he would be racing on next year, the Red Bull star produced a blistering lap in the top-10 shootout on Saturday. The 37-year-old will be gunning for an 11th win around the South Australian capital\u2019s street circuit after claiming the 84th pole of his career. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling. I don\u2019t know if there was a little bit in going out with a hot car straight after (qualifying),\u201d Whincup said. \u201cThe car felt great, I got the most out of it and very happy to be P1. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy close. 78 laps this afternoon is going to be intense but (I\u2019m) looking forward to it.\u201d Whincup will start ahead of Erebus\u2019 David Reynolds and Milwaukee Racing\u2019s Will Davison, who rounded out the top-three. NRLW - 3/4 time: Indigenous All-Stars 4-4 Maori Ferns It\u2019s a concept we\u2019re not used to in league, but this game is being played in four quarters. Just the one try each, with both teams going hammer and tonge. NZ\u2019s Harata Butler the standout performer so far, with hard-won metres up the guts. Shakiah Tungai also playing brilliantly for the Indigenous women. A shout out too to Kelsey Parkin - no relate, I believe - I\u2019ll have a dig into her backstory. And, as I write this the Indigenous All-Stars are finally in again! It\u2019s put to the sky and the skipper Tallisha Harden brings it down well, and it\u2019s finished off by, was it Nakia Davis-Welsh? Either way it\u2019s 10-4 to the home chargers, kick converted. So - a quick round the grounds: we\u2019re in the shadow of 3/4-time in the NRLW Indigenous v Maori All-Stars match - a bit more on that shortly. We\u2019re midway through the third in the all-Queensland AFLW clash with the Lions just edging the Suns, a goal and a behind the margin. I was about to say that in the Super Rugby it\u2019s the Brumbies sitting very nicely - they were 0-26 leaders away to the Chiefs. But would you believe it, Damien McKenzie\u2019s had other ideas and that one has really tightened back up. And, in the A-League we\u2019re still 0-1 to Perth from Dolphin Stadium on the hour mark. Thanks umpire, thanks ball boys. And cheers Scotty. Eep. Indoor cricket\u2019s a ruiner isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m in action tomorrow with the gentle left-arm tweakers. Hopefully the entire Guardian blogsquad aren\u2019t cruelled in one weekend. But enough on that - we\u2019ve got more than enough sport to jump back into. It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s more of it with every passing weekend.. Righto, all good things must come to an end. And just to prove that this is a fate that befalls bad things too, my contribution to this all-time classic is over. As promised earlier, Richard Parkin is here to grab the baton and run as far away from me as possible. Given I ripped a hole 15cm long in my left calf muscle playing indoor cricket last Tuesday, that won\u2019t be hard. Ta ta! A-League: HT: Brisbane Roar 0-1 Perth Glory Fornaroli\u2019s goal remains the difference between these two teams. The Glory might have had another, and in a way dseserved another, but the Roar will need to show greater attacking intent, and start to pass the ball with a bit of meaning, if they\u2019re to get anything out of this game. Re Bruno The Beauty, toss this one onto his pile of great goals. Try as I might - you might say, at the end of the day, I give 110% - to avoid cliches, this was a case of too little, too late for Sydney FC, who played like winners but end this gamer as losers. An own goal deep into injury time saw them get onto the scoresheet, and this they deserved to do, but goals either side of half-time to Morgan Andrews see Perth go home with all three points tucked safely inside the kit bag. The Glory took their chances, rode their luck and sucked up Sydney\u2019s pressure. Speaking of Morgan Andrews, how\u2019s this for a free-kick? A-League: GOAL! Brisbane Roar 0-1 Perth Glory (Fornaroli 33\u2019) Bruno Fornaroli, it has to be said, is a pleasure to watch. But such is his taste for goals, he must be a nightmare for defenders. There was a hint of offside here, and it seemed VAR was all set to poop all over Perth\u2019s party, but Fornaroli\u2019s goal - all touch, evasion and class to curl it home with his left foot - was allowed. It\u2019s his 11th of the season and eighth in his past eight starts. Almost machine like. AFLW: QT: Gold Coast 0.0 (0) v Brisbane 2.0 (12) The Lions strut into their quarter-time huddle after an impressive start to this inaugural AFLW QClash. Better still, Rheanne Lugg goes into the trivia books as the first goal kicker in games between these rivals. And on her 30th birthday. Very good. Super Rugby: 22 mins: Chiefs 0-12 Brumbies An electrifying start from the Brumbies, who have shown a lot this season and are doing nothing here to dent their burgeoning reputation. An early try to Tom Banks was followed up moments later with an array of slick passing and field movement to set up Solomone Kat. And it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re done yet. The Chiefs, no mugs by any definition, have their backs to the wall. W-League: GOAL! Sydney FC 0-2 Perth Glory (Morgan Andrews 58\u2019) That\u2019s two goals for the Glory, two goals for Morgan Andrews, and a mountain of headaches for a Sydney FC team which has had plenty of play, and plenty of chances, but nothing to show for it. A-League: 5 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Perth Glory So far, so good. So far, no goals. The Doggies threatened to do something either side of half-time but Carlton were maximum value for this win and were far too polished going forward compared to their opponents. The Blues booted five goals in the second half to kick away from the Dogs, with diminutive forward Georgia Gee (three goals) a standout performer. W-League: HT: Sydney FC 0-1 Perth Glory That\u2019s gotta hurt. Sydney FC enjoy the better of the first half in the Gong but it\u2019s Perth Glory who head to half-time with the lead after Morgan Andrews curled her free-kick over the wall and into the back of the net after 41 minutes. Some positives to be extracted here for the Rebels, but ultimately they were unable to land any sort of blow and will rue not taking full advantage when the Sharks were down to 13 men. There was only five points in it early in the second half but, restored to their allotment of 15, the Sharks scored successive tries to put the issue beyond doubt. A late converted try to Rangi denied the Sharks a bonus point, but they were deserved winners of this contest. The Rebels? Well, there\u2019s something to work on - and they have plenty to work on - but this is already their third loss of a season that\u2019s starting to slip away. W-League: 32 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory No goals at WIN Stadium but it seems all Sydney FC with chances to Siemsen, Huerta and Kennedy all going begging. The Glory were forced into an early substitution, with an injury to McKenna bringing Lowry on after 21 minutes. AFLW: Q3: 9 mins rem: Western Bulldogs 2.3 (15) v Carlton 4.2 (26) The Blues are holding sway but the Doggies are still in this. A goal just a moment ago to Georgia Gee, her second of the game, was Carlton\u2019s first major since the first quarter. But the Dogs are finding scoring even harder to come by at a windy Whitten Oval. A tight contest earlier on at Mars - the stadium, not the planet or choccie bar - but the Brumbies did enough to make it two from two this season. The Rebels came hard in the closing stages, with Walker\u2019s try after 63 minutes making the scoreboard all square, but a penalty to Woodie 10 minutes later gave the Brumbies a lead they wouldn\u2019t relinquish. A bitter pill to swallow for the Rebels, and this was certainly an honorable defeat, but a loss is a loss and they are yet to register a win in the early stages of the Super W campaign. Super Rugby: 49 mins: TRY! Rebels 17-22 Sharks Yes, the Rebels are now making them pay. Sheer weight of numbers, and the gaps that come with a 15 v 13 battle, sees Marika Koroibete advancing to the line for what looks a certain try. He somehow drops the ball at the crucial moment, knocking it backwards, but all\u2019s well that ends well as Isi Naisarani scoffs the crumbs and scores the try. And with Andrew Deegan converting, we now have a five-point ball rugby game. Super Rugby: 46 mins: Rebels 10-22 Sharks This doesn\u2019t make great reading for Rebels fans but a late try in the first half to Madosh Tambwe gave the Sharks a lead that looks comfortable, but isn\u2019t entirely commensurate with what\u2019s happening out on the field in Ballarat. And the Rebels are pressing hard in the early stages of the second stanza. The Sharks are defending stoutly, but they need to. And now the the visitors are down to 13 men, with Tambwe sent to the bin for 10 minutes. Surely the Rebels will make them pay. Surely? Fortunes have been contrasting for Australia\u2019s cricketers over the past 24 hours. A very nice win for the men over in South Africa - caps doffed to Ashton Agar - but the national women\u2019s team has some work to do in the T20 World Cup after their loss in the opening round to India. News to you? Then read on. Hello and welcome to y\u2019all. Today is another big day of sport and Sportwatch is here in all its reliable, dependable - yet, at the same time, boldly exhilarating - glory to do what it says on the tin: watch the action and bring you the news, goss, scores, updates and moments that matter. Don\u2019t mention it. The likes of my good self and Richard Parkin (who\u2019s asleep now but will be cutting literary shapes later on) do get paid, but we\u2019re not just in it for the money. So what\u2019s on today? We have three games of what is proving to be an excellent AFLW season, Super W and Super Rugby, A-League, W-League, the NRL All Stars games and, this evening, the continuation of the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. Yowser. That\u2019s a congested dance card. If you\u2019d like to tango with me, you can do so by Email or Twitter - @scott_heinrich.",

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until smooth. Pop it back in the bowl, cover and leave to prove until doubled in size. Next, make the candied hazelnuts. Put the nuts, sugar and butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Cook for roughly five minutes, stirring constantly, until the sugar has melted and the hazelnuts are well coated. Tip the hazelnuts on to a sheet of baking paper and separate with a spatula. Leave to cool, then put them in a zip-lock bag, smash into smallish pieces with a rolling pin, and transfer to a bowl. Line two trays with baking paper and divide the dough into 12 tight balls. Roll each one into roughly 8cm logs, transfer to the trays, leaving space between them, loosely cover and prove for another hour, or until doubled in size. Mix all the filling ingredients well until soft peaks form, then put in the fridge until needed. Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/gas 6. Brush each bun with the beaten egg and bake for 14-15 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the glaze, put the glucose and grapefruit juice into a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and mix until the glucose has melted. Sift in the icing sugar and stir until smooth. Remove the bowl from the pan. Fold half the crushed nuts into the cream and put in a piping bag. Split the buns lengthways, pipe a generous amount of cream into each one, top with some crushed hazelnuts and finish with the glaze.",

      "bodyText": "An overflowing vase of unseasonably fiery flowers is the perfect antidote to winter. But if you worry about how far imported blooms have travelled, and at what cost to the environment, brightening up your room needn\u2019t be a guilty pleasure: a cut flower producer on the south coast may have the answer. Ben Cross grows alstroemerias all year round in West Sussex. Even in midwinter, long beds of these tropical-looking flowers, native to South America and commonly known as Peruvian lilies, rise up defiantly in the energy-efficient greenhouses at Crosslands Flower Nursery, where they are picked to supply British flower markets all through the seasons. \u201cFrom Christmas to February, we harvest three times a week,\u201d says Cross. \u201cIn March, the plants will go berserk: from then to Christmas we harvest seven days a week, at least 1,000 bunches a day.\u201d His alstroemerias look as exotic as hothouse orchids: trumpeting blooms with speckled and tiger-striped throats. They can be near-white or baby pink, but are most recognisable in the hot tangerine, gold and ruby-red shades that are ever-present on flower stands. They are ubiquitous because alstroemerias make excellent cut flowers; the sturdy stems won\u2019t snap as you put them in a vase or flop after a few days, and each is topped with a spray of six flowers or more, often lasting two to three weeks in a vase. They aren\u2019t all that hardy, though. Alstroemerias need shelter to flower all year round. The plants grown at Crosslands are hybrids created for their flowers, but probably contain some genes from hardier species such as A. ligtu and A. aurea. These originate from the Andes, where conditions are cool and dry; similar to a British greenhouse for much of the year. \u201cWhere we are, sandwiched between the English Channel and the South Downs, we have the perfect growing conditions: the perfect light, the perfect warmth,\u201d says Cross. The greenhouse is kept at 13C though the winter. Heat is provided by a biomass boiler powered by renewable wood pellets \u2013 a sustainable source of fuel, as long as new trees are planted to replace those cut. Water consumption is minimal; plants are watered for 20 minutes once a month in winter. In summer this increases to 20 minutes every 10 days \u2013 still very low compared to usage in countries such as Kenya, where most cut flowers sold in the UK originate. Cross grows without pesticides, using biological controls, such as the tiny Encarsia wasp to take care of whitefly, and the predatory Phytoseiulus persimilis to control red spider mite. The focus on energy efficiency is not new here. Cross is the fourth generation of growers to run Crosslands Flower Nursery, which once grew various crops. His grandfather and father decided to focus on alstroemerias during the energy crisis of the 1970s. \u201cIt was the time of rising oil prices \u2013 you could no longer grow lots of things. It was time to specialise,\u201d he says. \u201cGrandad chose the British alstroemeria because it is a good sustainable crop.\u201d The nursery was started by Cross\u2019s great=grandfather when he arrived from Abertillery in Gwent in 1936 as part of the Land Settlement Association, a government scheme to resettle unemployed workers from industrial areas on farming land. These new market gardeners transformed much of West Sussex into a network of small farms growing produce to sell, including thousands of seasonal cut flowers. As the economics of market gardening became harder over the decades, most closed. Cross spent 10 years as a marine biologist before returning to Crosslands, but realised he could, potentially, make an impact as a grower. He is well-placed to, because it\u2019s an optimistic time for the British cut flower industry, now worth \u00a3121m \u2013 up from \u00a382m in 2015 \u2013 after years of decline due to imports. The uplift is driven by increased consumer demand in response to concern over produce-miles and sustainability. Last year, homegrown flowers accounted for 14% of all stems sold in the UK, still a small slice compared to imports from overseas, but up from 12% three years ago. \u201cI did my first talk in 2014, to a flower club of 100 people,\u201d says Cross. \u201cI was amazed that no one knew that most of the UK\u2019s flowers are imported from all over the world. Now I\u2019m fully booked for talks until 2021 \u2013 I think the message really strikes a chord.\u201d Who would have thought a vase of these fiery blooms could clock up as little mileage as a head of broccoli? Sometimes, the most exotic-looking flower can find its niche here in the UK.",

Her research, using functional MRI scans, has identified striking similarities between losing a loved one and breaking an addiction.</p> <p>\u201cWith heartbreak, no one gets out alive,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter studying people who were rejected in love, we found activity in the brain regions associated with craving and obsession, as well as in the nucleus accumbens, the main factory of addictions like gambling and substance abuse.</p> <p>\u201cWe also found activity in the region associated with physical pain, and anxiety that goes along with physical pain. It is a very powerful brain response.\u201d</p> <p>Fisher\u2019s findings are echoed by Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge. She <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/decoder-brain-training-app-university-of-cambridge-a4044201.html\">recently launched Decoder</a>, a brain-training app that claims to effectively distract the lovelorn and improve concentration skills.</p> <p>\u201cLove is very addictive,\u201d Sahakian says. \u201cIt\u2019s like your reward system is activated by that person. If they leave you, you have to get rid of that habitual, compulsive need to see them, text them and hear their voice \u2026 The best way to do that is through distraction and using your time in other ways.\u201d</p> <p>Other, more controversial treatments are on offer, such as eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (<a href=\"https://www.susanquinn.net/emdr-is-effective-for-healing-pain-from-a-breakup/\">EMDR</a>) and neurofeedback. The latter was praised by the rapper Dessa last year, who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/18/646251015/this-rapper-tried-to-use-neuroscience-to-get-over-her-ex?t=1556039802330\">tried the therapy</a> after stumbling across Fisher\u2019s research online.</p> <p>\u201cKnowing that there was a reliable signature of brain activity associated with romantic love made me question whether there were ways to change,\u201d says Dessa, who had been struggling to cut the cord on an on-and-off relationship lasting 14 years with a man she refers to as X.</p> <p>The aim of neurofeedback is to \u201cretrain\u201d brain waves and minimise unwanted activity through electroencephalography. Subjects wear a cap of electrical wires that tracks brainwaves and translates them into audio or visual cues. Although the treatment is still seen as experimental in the science community, early, small-scale tests have suggested it may alleviate <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28407727\">symptoms of depression</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.isnr.org/in-defense-of-neurofeedback\">ADHD and PTSD</a>.</p> <p>Dessa tried the treatment for nine sessions to see if it could stop her romantic obsession. The results, she says, were positive. \u201cI felt less compelled and fixated,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I saw X again, I didn\u2019t have the same surge of adrenaline.\u201d</p> <p>She is quick to add that a larger sample size would be needed to monitor other variables that could be responsible for the result. \u201cMaybe it was just a placebo, but I did notice a change,\u201d Dessa says.</p> <p>Retraining your brain with electrical wires is not for everyone. Brian Earp, a researcher in psychology, philosophy and ethics at the University of Oxford, believes a more straightforward chemical intervention \u2013 or \u201canti-love biotechnology\u201d \u2013 will soon be readily available for people struggling with the loss of a partner.</p> <p>\u201cThe scary thing is that anti-love biotechnology is already here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s happening as a side-effect of currently used medications, but western medicine tends not to systematically study the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294428485_Love_drugs_why_scientists_should_study_the_effects_of_pharmaceuticals_on_human_romantic_relationships\">interpersonal effects</a> of common drugs, so we have little idea of the true scope of the problem.</p> <p>\u201cBut based on numerous case reports backed up by pharmacological and neuroscientific research, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs, a common type of antidepressant] can sometimes have a \u2018blunting\u2019 effect on people\u2019s ability to care about the feelings of others \u2013 including their romantic partners.\u201d</p> <p>Earp stresses that SSRIs can often be helpful for a relationship if depression has been causing problems between a couple. But it seems they may also help with muting the depression that can follow a failed one.</p> <p>Both Earp and Fisher are quick to point out the ethical problems of actual anti-love biotechnology. If a cure for heartbreak were to be marketed and developed \u2013 which they believe is one day likely \u2013 there are concerns about how it would be used, and by whom. \u201cMight drugs one day be used to intentionally sever a romantic bond?\u201d asks Earp. \u201cWe would need to agree on an ethical framework for handling such cases.\u201d</p> <p>As well as this, any tampering with emotional memory could cause further complications. We often learn from our mistakes; what good is it if we just block them out?</p> <p>\u201cMany of our unpleasant memories have helped us, as individuals and as a society, to adjust our future behaviour accordingly,\u201d says Strange. However, he adds, treatments such as propofol should be \u201crelatively straightforward to implement\u201d if a clear benefit can be demonstrated, which means \u201ca real-world clinical treatment should not be too far away\u201d.</p> <p>Fisher, meanwhile, is adamant the best approach is a simple one: follow the addiction model.</p> <p>\u201cThrow out the cards and letters: stuff them in a box, put them in the attic,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t write, don\u2019t call, get some exercise \u2013 it increases dopamine and resistance to pain. Cut out sugar. Don\u2019t try to make friends with your ex-partner, at least not until you\u2019re over it. You just have to go out with new people and keep moving.</p> <p>\u201cNo drugs can help one build new social connections and daily routines. The pain of rejection is too great, and too primordial. It had a real function for millions of years. In my opinion, only time \u2013 or a new lover \u2013 can truly heal you.\u201d</p>",

Fisher, meanwhile, is adamant the best approach is a simple one: follow the addiction model. \u201cThrow out the cards and letters: stuff them in a box, put them in the attic,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t write, don\u2019t call, get some exercise \u2013 it increases dopamine and resistance to pain. Cut out sugar. Don\u2019t try to make friends with your ex-partner, at least not until you\u2019re over it. You just have to go out with new people and keep moving. \u201cNo drugs can help one build new social connections and daily routines. The pain of rejection is too great, and too primordial. It had a real function for millions of years. In my opinion, only time \u2013 or a new lover \u2013 can truly heal you.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>* * *</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tomdaley\" title=\"\">Tom Daley</a> has the large lumberjack hands and size 11 feet of a very tall man. There must be height lurking somewhere in the diver\u2019s genes, because his younger brothers are 6ft 5in (1.96m) and 6ft 3in, while his uncles are 6ft 5in and 6ft 7in. But Daley measures in at 5ft 10in, one inch shorter than his own grandmother. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, turning over the saucer-size palms to reveal knuckles that protrude like acorns, \u201cI think in some ways this sport stunted my growth.\u201d</p> <p>He explains: \u201cI started lifting weights when I was nine years old, for the diving. And that early impact\u2026 It\u2019s like with gymnasts, it keeps everyone quite small.\u201d Daley shrugs, an Olympian whatevs. This is just one of those weird compromises \u2013 inexplicable and unacceptable to the rest of us \u2013 that Olympic athletes tend to make.</p> <p>Daley is 25 now, a veteran of Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, and poised to compete in a fourth Games in Tokyo this summer. Had he grown any taller as a boy, he points out, he would not have made it as far as that first teenage trip to China. \u201cTo do what I do, you can\u2019t be big and bulky, or you spin slower in the air.\u201d He dives on his own and as part of a pair, from a fixed (not a springy) platform that hangs 10 metres over the water. To twist and turn and wheel in the air before he hits the surface, he needs a lot of compact strength. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at us without our clothes on, we\u2019re powerful but not overly muscular.\u201d</p> <p>As it happens, I have been looking at Daley without his clothes on. We meet one day in the gaps around his many fitness and training sessions, in a part of east London that isn\u2019t far from his usual pool. Daley, who has neatly trimmed dark hair and a large five-ring tattoo on the inside of one arm, shakes my hand while wearing barely-there swimmies. I ask him when this started to feel normal, meeting new people while wearing just a few inches of shiny Lycra. As a rule, he says, strangers don\u2019t tend to recognise him in clothes. \u201cSometimes they say, \u2018Where do I know you from?\u2019 And they run through the options. Actor. Singer. The penny drops when they think of me in my pants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"550b1b7f698fa5ad5333e87b7c06e143dc4f3383\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/550b1b7f698fa5ad5333e87b7c06e143dc4f3383/0_0_5280_6720/786.png\" alt=\"Head shot of diver Tom Daley\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sport made me grow as a person.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He changes into a dark tracksuit and we set off on a walk around the area, strolling around <a href=\"https://www.skdocks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">St Kath</a><a href=\"https://www.skdocks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">arine</a><a href=\"https://www.skdocks.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> Docks</a>, taking in the view through the boat masts to Tower Bridge and the city beyond. Later this afternoon he\u2019ll head home to his husband, the screenwriter and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/01/dustin-lance-black-interview-night-duty-tom-daley\" title=\"\">Dustin Lance Black</a>, and their 20-month-old son Robbie; but before that, with Tokyo looming, he has another training session to get through. He\u2019s due to have a scan on a hurt hand. It\u2019s around now in any Olympic year that everything starts to narrow and get more focused for athletes with designs on a medal, which is to say, all of them.</p> <p>Four years ago, Daley had a hugely disappointing Rio. He had already won a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-rio-platform-diving-bronze\" title=\"\">bronze medal in the pairs</a> event (his second bronze, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/london-2012-tom-daley-bronze-pool-party\" title=\"\">after London</a>) and looked a favourite to win gold, after setting a new Olympic record in the first round of the individual event. A friend of mine was poolside on semi-finals day in Brazil, when all it took was a few low-scoring dives and Daley was eliminated without even making the final. \u201cHe looked shellshocked,\u201d my friend said. \u201cHaunted. He just couldn\u2019t fathom why he\u2019d performed so underwhelmingly.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Four years of work. And it comes down to one day. A few seconds, really</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were logistical difficulties for the divers and swimmers in Brazil, including a lack of places to train outside the cramped Olympic Village (and a pool where the water, one day, turned a lurid green). But these problems affected everybody. Daley\u2019s bad day was hard to account for. As we walk, I ask him if he\u2019s come any closer to fathoming what happened.</p> <p>\u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d he says. \u201cI was 22, at my peak. I was mentally prepared. In the best physical shape I\u2019d ever been in my life. I had the experience, too, because this was my third Olympics and I knew about the pressure. I felt, for the first time, like a professional athlete; like this was serious business. I\u2019d stopped drinking alcohol for two years! I\u2019d slept nine hours every single night. I hadn\u2019t cheated, <em>ever</em>, with food, not even ice-cream.\u201d</p> <p>And then? It can be over so appallingly quickly for an Olympian. Quickest of all for platform divers such as Daley, who fly through the air for less than two seconds before the splash. Daley explains that he simply woke up on the day of the semis feeling off. \u201cThere was just <em>something</em>. You know when you wake up and nothing will click? You can\u2019t seem to get going? It was weird. Almost like I wasn\u2019t in my own body.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him if he spoke to his husband or family that morning, to try to settle himself. Oh, he says, no time. \u201cYou wake up at 6am, have breakfast and get to the pool for 7.30am, warm up and start competing at 10.\u201d It was over by brunch. I say something about the cruelty of this, a year of work condensed into a day, and Daley laughs darkly. \u201cFour years of work. You can feel good for <em>four years</em>. And it comes down to one day. A few seconds, really.\u201d</p> <p>So why go back for more?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3a18ae50cee4359a2f97169f32c07eb7b29627b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a18ae50cee4359a2f97169f32c07eb7b29627b/0_234_1885_2357/800.jpg\" alt=\"Diver Tom Daley at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At his first Olympics, in 2008. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imago/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daley has a quick-fire way of talking as soon as the thoughts come, and gives an interesting answer that seems to capture the paradox of Olympic competition. We make a really big deal of the top three winners, and largely discard the rest of the field. All of them have put in the years. Some of them might just have had an off-day at the worst possible time. But, Daley explains, \u201cthat\u2019s the thrill of it. As well as the worry of it. As well as the excitement of it. As well as the devastation of it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Tom Daley has long been a sort of Peter Pan figure in the public imagination, a small boy and an old soul. \u201cI\u2019ve had to grow up quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, you get snapshotted at the age you became well known. There\u2019s that never-grew-up thing.\u201d He was born in Plymouth, the eldest of three boys to Rob and Debbie. Aged seven, he was at the local pool when he saw older boys hurling themselves off the high board. After a couple of years of diving lessons, Daley was entering tournaments and beginning to tailor his body for competition.</p> <p>He was 14 when he went to Beijing to compete in the pairs event, the youngest member of Team GB. It hardly mattered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicgames.divingdaley\" title=\"\">he finished </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicgames.divingdaley\" title=\"\">eighth</a>, because \u2013 look at that little kid with braces in his union jack trunks! He was a sensation in the UK, and returning to school after that summer was tricky. The news cameras were there. Bullying hadn\u2019t been a problem before, but it was now. Daley\u2019s parents moved him to the private Plymouth College, where he was enrolled on an athletic scholarship.</p> <p>He did better there, socially and academically, and he credits a lot to sport. \u201cI said I thought sport stunted my growth in terms of height,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in so many other ways it made me grow as a person. I travelled alone to Australia when I was 10. I became independent. Driven. I learned about time management because, when you don\u2019t have much time, you get more done.\u201d</p> <p>When I mention to Daley how fast he\u2019s been talking, he pauses, laughs and says: \u201cI\u2019m always go-go-go. My husband says, \u2018Slow down. <em>Sit</em> down.\u2019\u201d He has trouble relaxing sometimes. \u201cOur son will be having a nap and I\u2019ll think: \u2018Laundry.\u2019 After that I\u2019ll think: \u2018Now what? Robbie\u2019s gonna be asleep for another whole hour! Oh, I know, I\u2019ll bake a cake.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f09e35258eb2dfd43355edfb5029d1e219607e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f09e35258eb2dfd43355edfb5029d1e219607e10/0_282_7700_4618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diver Tom Daley, in trunks, sitting down with arm stretched over head, February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m always go-go-go.

Sit down.\u201d\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About a decade ago, Daley says, he dealt with tragedy in his life by keeping on the go like this. His father, Rob, was a charismatic figure who went to most of the international diving tournaments, bringing along a big union jack to wave from the stands. When Daley was named the Plymouth Herald\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year, Rob celebrated by drinking beer out of the trophy. Still in his 30s, he was diagnosed with brain cancer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/28/diving-champion-tom-daleys-father-robert-dies\" title=\"\">When Rob died</a> in 2011, Daley says now, \u201cAll I wanted to do was get back on the diving board \u2013 not stop. I didn\u2019t take any time away from the pool.\u201d</p> <p>Does he regret that?</p> <p>\u201cI look back and think: did I allow myself any time to grieve? People lose people in so many different ways. Slowly, quickly, unexpectedly. Everyone deals with that differently. I left my dad\u2019s wake early, to compete at the national championships.\u201d Daley says it took him a while to recognise delayed grieving for what it was. \u201cI was so focused on the London Games in 2012. Then it happened, and I had a bronze medal around my neck, and I looked into the audience \u2013 Mum was there, my brothers, no Dad. I couldn\u2019t see the big flag he always brought. This was the moment we\u2019d been working towards \u2013 and it hit me right then.\u201d</p> <p>After London, he says, he went into a slump. \u201cOh my God, I wanted to quit. I never wanted to dive again. Everything had been about the 2012 Olympics. It was: 2012! 2012! 2012! And then it was over, and everything after it looked unknown to me.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel he could express this to people, not so much the specifics of a depression, but why he should feel depressed at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful. If you try to explain, people quite understandably say: \u2018What are you talking about? You\u2019ve just won an Olympic medal. What do you mean you\u2019re sad? What do you mean, you don\u2019t know what to do with yourself?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa489b2e91f6cb6c7a35b9b1bdb08804cc11b4f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa489b2e91f6cb6c7a35b9b1bdb08804cc11b4f7/0_234_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Daley with his father Robert and mother Debbie at home in Plymouth in  2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his parents in Plymouth in 2008, three years before his father died.

Locked eyes. It was <em>weird</em>.\u201d The man he\u2019d clocked was Dustin Lance Black, a California screenwriter and gay rights activist. Black was 20 years older, and across a diverse career had helped overturn discriminatory laws in the California constitution, as well as winning <a href=\"https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2009/?\" title=\"\">a screenwriting Oscar</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/milk\" title=\"\">Milk</a>, his 2008 biopic about campaigner Harvey Milk.</p> <p>In the restaurant Daley quizzed Black about the movie\u2019s success. \u201cHe said it was amazing, a whirlwind-like two weeks when you\u2019re <em>everything</em>. And then it was over. Back to work. But it wasn\u2019t just about work any more, it was about working to a level that could win more Oscars.\u201d It was a subtle but persistent kind of pressure, almost embarrassing to admit to out loud, Daley says, \u201cthat sounded so familiar to me\u201d.</p> <p>He recalls them flirting their way into an absurd conversation about writing a romcom about life in an Olympic village. \u201cYeah, <em>that</em> was never gonna happen,\u201d Daley says. \u201cBut we took each other\u2019s numbers, like a maybe-we\u2019ll-talk-more-in-the-future thing. I woke up next morning to a text from him.\u201d After Daley returned to London, \u201cwe spoke every day. FaceTimed. Texted.\u201d Black talked about losing his brother to cancer, \u201canother reason we connected so well. When he came to London for my birthday, it was the first time we\u2019d seen each other since the night we met. Within a week, we\u2019d named Robbie.\u201d</p> <p>When Daley says this, we\u2019re drinking takeaway coffee, and I come close to spilling mine. Excuse me?</p> <p>\u201cYeah. We talked about marriage, having a kid, what his name would be if he was a boy, all in that first week. I remember telling my best friend and she said, \u2018Tom. You\u2019ve spent seven days with him. He could be a serial killer.\u2019 But I just knew. We both did. There\u2019s only been two times in my life I\u2019ve been really sure about something. Not, \u2018Yeaaah? OK?\u2019 But <em>sure</em>. One was holding my son for the first time and the other was meeting Lance. A feeling of almost having known them for your whole life. A connection that\u2019s innate.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I will always have pride representing Team GB. I hope one day I\u2019ll be back as proud of the country as I was in 2012</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a long time it was long distance. \u201cLove makes you do crazy things. We were four weeks together, three weeks apart, four weeks together. An 11-hour flight, an eight-hour time difference, but we made it work.\u201d Black moved to the UK semi-permanently in 2016, and was granted a leave-to-remain visa shortly before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdDR1QqMiCg\" title=\"\">the couple\u2019s wedding</a> in 2017. Robbie was born in summer 2018 after being carried by a surrogate mother in California, \u201cone of our dearest friends now. We speak constantly. Surrogates are like superheroes, incredible women.\u201d</p> <p>Daley is careful when talking about how the couple have influenced each other, perhaps sensitive to the age gap and the assumption that wisdom must travel downhill. (\u201cLance always says I\u2019ve taught him a <em>lot</em>.\u201d) It seems pretty clear, though, that Daley has become more emboldened, politically, since the start of their relationship. He has been vocal on issues that many Olympic athletes fudge or avoid; two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/13/tom-daley-speaks-out-on-anti-gay-laws-in-commonwealth-nations-after-winning-gold\" title=\"\">at the Commonwealth Games</a>, Daley noted that more than half the countries taking part still criminalised homosexuality, and called for change.</p> <p>Daley admits he has been criticised by some campaigners for continuing to enter competitions in countries where there is state-encouraged homophobia. \u201cI go to Russia to compete quite often. I\u2019ve competed in the Middle East. Lots of people would say, \u2018Boycott. Don\u2019t go.\u2019 But, do you know what? I think that going there, in a married relationship, and being able to compete, and climb on to a podium as a gay man \u2013 I think that speaks louder than boycotting. I think it shows we\u2019re <em>real</em>. Visible. I think it\u2019s powerful.\u201d</p> <p>We get to a part of the harbour that has a postcard view of Tower Bridge. It was one of the symbols of the London Games, an event that can be almost painful to remember now, given the division and uncertainty that has taken root in the country since. What looked like the inauguration of new national unity turned out, in hindsight, to be something like a goodbye party. \u201cYeah,\u201d Daley agrees, \u201cI think London 2012 brought the nation together in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in recent years.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d read somewhere that, after London, he became a collector of objects imprinted with the British flag. You\u2019re a union jack guy, I start to say\u2026</p> <p>Daley interrupts: \u201cYeah. Doesn\u2019t quite have the same meaning any more, to be fair.\u201d</p> <p>Is it different wearing the colours now than then?</p> <p>\u201cUm. I mean, I will <em>always</em> have a sense of pride representing Team GB. Because I think the values of Team GB \u2013 respect, pride, determination, commitment, the big motto is \u2018One Team\u2019 \u2013 I think there\u2019s something very powerful there.\u201d Brexit has been a wedge, he acknowledges. His experiences and his views might be different from someone else\u2019s, he says, and both are valid. \u201cI think the most powerful thing in the world is to have all of these unique and different perspectives, and come together as one team. And I hope one day I\u2019ll be back as proud of the country as I was in 2012.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46292fa24f93bc9e9cec516baff6e5f0db1c67af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46292fa24f93bc9e9cec516baff6e5f0db1c67af/0_361_5500_6639/828.png\" alt=\"Topless shot of diver Tom Daley from ribs up\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you\u2019re looking at us without our clothes on, we\u2019re powerful but not overly muscular.\u2019 Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Guardian.

      "bodyText": "* * * Tom Daley has the large lumberjack hands and size 11 feet of a very tall man. There must be height lurking somewhere in the diver\u2019s genes, because his younger brothers are 6ft 5in (1.96m) and 6ft 3in, while his uncles are 6ft 5in and 6ft 7in. But Daley measures in at 5ft 10in, one inch shorter than his own grandmother. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, turning over the saucer-size palms to reveal knuckles that protrude like acorns, \u201cI think in some ways this sport stunted my growth.\u201d He explains: \u201cI started lifting weights when I was nine years old, for the diving. And that early impact\u2026 It\u2019s like with gymnasts, it keeps everyone quite small.\u201d Daley shrugs, an Olympian whatevs. This is just one of those weird compromises \u2013 inexplicable and unacceptable to the rest of us \u2013 that Olympic athletes tend to make. Daley is 25 now, a veteran of Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, and poised to compete in a fourth Games in Tokyo this summer. Had he grown any taller as a boy, he points out, he would not have made it as far as that first teenage trip to China. \u201cTo do what I do, you can\u2019t be big and bulky, or you spin slower in the air.\u201d He dives on his own and as part of a pair, from a fixed (not a springy) platform that hangs 10 metres over the water. To twist and turn and wheel in the air before he hits the surface, he needs a lot of compact strength. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at us without our clothes on, we\u2019re powerful but not overly muscular.\u201d As it happens, I have been looking at Daley without his clothes on. We meet one day in the gaps around his many fitness and training sessions, in a part of east London that isn\u2019t far from his usual pool. Daley, who has neatly trimmed dark hair and a large five-ring tattoo on the inside of one arm, shakes my hand while wearing barely-there swimmies. I ask him when this started to feel normal, meeting new people while wearing just a few inches of shiny Lycra. As a rule, he says, strangers don\u2019t tend to recognise him in clothes. \u201cSometimes they say, \u2018Where do I know you from?\u2019 And they run through the options. Actor. Singer. The penny drops when they think of me in my pants.\u201d He changes into a dark tracksuit and we set off on a walk around the area, strolling around St Katharine Docks, taking in the view through the boat masts to Tower Bridge and the city beyond. Later this afternoon he\u2019ll head home to his husband, the screenwriter and activist Dustin Lance Black, and their 20-month-old son Robbie; but before that, with Tokyo looming, he has another training session to get through. He\u2019s due to have a scan on a hurt hand. It\u2019s around now in any Olympic year that everything starts to narrow and get more focused for athletes with designs on a medal, which is to say, all of them. Four years ago, Daley had a hugely disappointing Rio. He had already won a bronze medal in the pairs event (his second bronze, after London) and looked a favourite to win gold, after setting a new Olympic record in the first round of the individual event. A friend of mine was poolside on semi-finals day in Brazil, when all it took was a few low-scoring dives and Daley was eliminated without even making the final. \u201cHe looked shellshocked,\u201d my friend said. \u201cHaunted. He just couldn\u2019t fathom why he\u2019d performed so underwhelmingly.\u201d There were logistical difficulties for the divers and swimmers in Brazil, including a lack of places to train outside the cramped Olympic Village (and a pool where the water, one day, turned a lurid green). But these problems affected everybody. Daley\u2019s bad day was hard to account for. As we walk, I ask him if he\u2019s come any closer to fathoming what happened. \u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d he says. \u201cI was 22, at my peak. I was mentally prepared. In the best physical shape I\u2019d ever been in my life. I had the experience, too, because this was my third Olympics and I knew about the pressure. I felt, for the first time, like a professional athlete; like this was serious business. I\u2019d stopped drinking alcohol for two years! I\u2019d slept nine hours every single night. I hadn\u2019t cheated, ever, with food, not even ice-cream.\u201d And then? It can be over so appallingly quickly for an Olympian. Quickest of all for platform divers such as Daley, who fly through the air for less than two seconds before the splash. Daley explains that he simply woke up on the day of the semis feeling off. \u201cThere was just something. You know when you wake up and nothing will click? You can\u2019t seem to get going? It was weird. Almost like I wasn\u2019t in my own body.\u201d I ask him if he spoke to his husband or family that morning, to try to settle himself. Oh, he says, no time. \u201cYou wake up at 6am, have breakfast and get to the pool for 7.30am, warm up and start competing at 10.\u201d It was over by brunch. I say something about the cruelty of this, a year of work condensed into a day, and Daley laughs darkly. \u201cFour years of work. You can feel good for four years. And it comes down to one day. A few seconds, really.\u201d So why go back for more? Daley has a quick-fire way of talking as soon as the thoughts come, and gives an interesting answer that seems to capture the paradox of Olympic competition. We make a really big deal of the top three winners, and largely discard the rest of the field. All of them have put in the years. Some of them might just have had an off-day at the worst possible time. But, Daley explains, \u201cthat\u2019s the thrill of it. As well as the worry of it. As well as the excitement of it. As well as the devastation of it.\u201d * * * Tom Daley has long been a sort of Peter Pan figure in the public imagination, a small boy and an old soul. \u201cI\u2019ve had to grow up quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, you get snapshotted at the age you became well known. There\u2019s that never-grew-up thing.\u201d He was born in Plymouth, the eldest of three boys to Rob and Debbie. Aged seven, he was at the local pool when he saw older boys hurling themselves off the high board. After a couple of years of diving lessons, Daley was entering tournaments and beginning to tailor his body for competition. He was 14 when he went to Beijing to compete in the pairs event, the youngest member of Team GB. It hardly mattered that he finished eighth, because \u2013 look at that little kid with braces in his union jack trunks! He was a sensation in the UK, and returning to school after that summer was tricky. The news cameras were there. Bullying hadn\u2019t been a problem before, but it was now. Daley\u2019s parents moved him to the private Plymouth College, where he was enrolled on an athletic scholarship. He did better there, socially and academically, and he credits a lot to sport. \u201cI said I thought sport stunted my growth in terms of height,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in so many other ways it made me grow as a person. I travelled alone to Australia when I was 10. I became independent. Driven. I learned about time management because, when you don\u2019t have much time, you get more done.\u201d When I mention to Daley how fast he\u2019s been talking, he pauses, laughs and says: \u201cI\u2019m always go-go-go. My husband says, \u2018Slow down. Sit down.\u2019\u201d He has trouble relaxing sometimes. \u201cOur son will be having a nap and I\u2019ll think: \u2018Laundry.\u2019 After that I\u2019ll think: \u2018Now what? Robbie\u2019s gonna be asleep for another whole hour! Oh, I know, I\u2019ll bake a cake.\u2019\u201d About a decade ago, Daley says, he dealt with tragedy in his life by keeping on the go like this. His father, Rob, was a charismatic figure who went to most of the international diving tournaments, bringing along a big union jack to wave from the stands. When Daley was named the Plymouth Herald\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year, Rob celebrated by drinking beer out of the trophy. Still in his 30s, he was diagnosed with brain cancer. When Rob died in 2011, Daley says now, \u201cAll I wanted to do was get back on the diving board \u2013 not stop. I didn\u2019t take any time away from the pool.\u201d Does he regret that? \u201cI look back and think: did I allow myself any time to grieve? People lose people in so many different ways. Slowly, quickly, unexpectedly. Everyone deals with that differently. I left my dad\u2019s wake early, to compete at the national championships.\u201d Daley says it took him a while to recognise delayed grieving for what it was. \u201cI was so focused on the London Games in 2012. Then it happened, and I had a bronze medal around my neck, and I looked into the audience \u2013 Mum was there, my brothers, no Dad. I couldn\u2019t see the big flag he always brought. This was the moment we\u2019d been working towards \u2013 and it hit me right then.\u201d After London, he says, he went into a slump. \u201cOh my God, I wanted to quit. I never wanted to dive again. Everything had been about the 2012 Olympics. It was: 2012! 2012! 2012! And then it was over, and everything after it looked unknown to me.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel he could express this to people, not so much the specifics of a depression, but why he should feel depressed at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful. If you try to explain, people quite understandably say: \u2018What are you talking about? You\u2019ve just won an Olympic medal. What do you mean you\u2019re sad? What do you mean, you don\u2019t know what to do with yourself?\u2019\u201d In 2013, during his slump, Daley was on a visit to the US when he was invited to join a friend at a party in a Los Angeles restaurant. \u201cI walked in and clocked him. Locked eyes. It was weird.\u201d The man he\u2019d clocked was Dustin Lance Black, a California screenwriter and gay rights activist. Black was 20 years older, and across a diverse career had helped overturn discriminatory laws in the California constitution, as well as winning a screenwriting Oscar for Milk, his 2008 biopic about campaigner Harvey Milk. In the restaurant Daley quizzed Black about the movie\u2019s success. \u201cHe said it was amazing, a whirlwind-like two weeks when you\u2019re everything. And then it was over. Back to work. But it wasn\u2019t just about work any more, it was about working to a level that could win more Oscars.\u201d It was a subtle but persistent kind of pressure, almost embarrassing to admit to out loud, Daley says, \u201cthat sounded so familiar to me\u201d. He recalls them flirting their way into an absurd conversation about writing a romcom about life in an Olympic village. \u201cYeah, that was never gonna happen,\u201d Daley says. \u201cBut we took each other\u2019s numbers, like a maybe-we\u2019ll-talk-more-in-the-future thing. I woke up next morning to a text from him.\u201d After Daley returned to London, \u201cwe spoke every day. FaceTimed. Texted.\u201d Black talked about losing his brother to cancer, \u201canother reason we connected so well. When he came to London for my birthday, it was the first time we\u2019d seen each other since the night we met. Within a week, we\u2019d named Robbie.\u201d When Daley says this, we\u2019re drinking takeaway coffee, and I come close to spilling mine. Excuse me? \u201cYeah. We talked about marriage, having a kid, what his name would be if he was a boy, all in that first week. I remember telling my best friend and she said, \u2018Tom. You\u2019ve spent seven days with him. He could be a serial killer.\u2019 But I just knew. We both did. There\u2019s only been two times in my life I\u2019ve been really sure about something. Not, \u2018Yeaaah? OK?\u2019 But sure. One was holding my son for the first time and the other was meeting Lance. A feeling of almost having known them for your whole life. A connection that\u2019s innate.\u201d For a long time it was long distance. \u201cLove makes you do crazy things. We were four weeks together, three weeks apart, four weeks together. An 11-hour flight, an eight-hour time difference, but we made it work.\u201d Black moved to the UK semi-permanently in 2016, and was granted a leave-to-remain visa shortly before the couple\u2019s wedding in 2017. Robbie was born in summer 2018 after being carried by a surrogate mother in California, \u201cone of our dearest friends now. We speak constantly. Surrogates are like superheroes, incredible women.\u201d Daley is careful when talking about how the couple have influenced each other, perhaps sensitive to the age gap and the assumption that wisdom must travel downhill. (\u201cLance always says I\u2019ve taught him a lot.\u201d) It seems pretty clear, though, that Daley has become more emboldened, politically, since the start of their relationship. He has been vocal on issues that many Olympic athletes fudge or avoid; two years ago, at the Commonwealth Games, Daley noted that more than half the countries taking part still criminalised homosexuality, and called for change. Daley admits he has been criticised by some campaigners for continuing to enter competitions in countries where there is state-encouraged homophobia. \u201cI go to Russia to compete quite often. I\u2019ve competed in the Middle East. Lots of people would say, \u2018Boycott. Don\u2019t go.\u2019 But, do you know what? I think that going there, in a married relationship, and being able to compete, and climb on to a podium as a gay man \u2013 I think that speaks louder than boycotting. I think it shows we\u2019re real. Visible. I think it\u2019s powerful.\u201d We get to a part of the harbour that has a postcard view of Tower Bridge. It was one of the symbols of the London Games, an event that can be almost painful to remember now, given the division and uncertainty that has taken root in the country since. What looked like the inauguration of new national unity turned out, in hindsight, to be something like a goodbye party. \u201cYeah,\u201d Daley agrees, \u201cI think London 2012 brought the nation together in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in recent years.\u201d I\u2019d read somewhere that, after London, he became a collector of objects imprinted with the British flag. You\u2019re a union jack guy, I start to say\u2026 Daley interrupts: \u201cYeah. Doesn\u2019t quite have the same meaning any more, to be fair.\u201d Is it different wearing the colours now than then? \u201cUm. I mean, I will always have a sense of pride representing Team GB. Because I think the values of Team GB \u2013 respect, pride, determination, commitment, the big motto is \u2018One Team\u2019 \u2013 I think there\u2019s something very powerful there.\u201d Brexit has been a wedge, he acknowledges. His experiences and his views might be different from someone else\u2019s, he says, and both are valid. \u201cI think the most powerful thing in the world is to have all of these unique and different perspectives, and come together as one team. And I hope one day I\u2019ll be back as proud of the country as I was in 2012.\u201d Our walk around the dock takes us away from the river and into the landscaped gardens outside an office block. It\u2019s a place full of giant concrete blocks, some of them the rough dimensions of diving boards. I ask Daley if he could stand on the edge of each and try to recall where his head was before he dived. He climbs up on the blocks. \u201cSo this one is Beijing? And this one is London? And this one is Rio?\u201d He steps to the first edge. \u201cOK, so this is Beijing. I\u2019m about to dive. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing! What the scale is. It\u2019s fun. I\u2019m enjoying the experience.\u201d He moves along to a second block. \u201cThis is London. A real pressure cooker. I\u2019m expected to win a medal in front of the home crowd, but I also have the thought in my mind that Rio is going to be my peak.\u201d He moves along again. \u201cSo this is the Rio board. I\u2019m here, it\u2019s my year, it\u2019s my competition. These Olympics mean everything... And I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s such a thing as being too focused, but I\u2019m so focused I\u2019m almost distracted, if that makes sense. I\u2019m not a parent yet. I don\u2019t know if I have the perspective to know what actually matters.\u201d There\u2019s one more block. Can he predict where his head will be come summer? Oh, easy, Daley says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the Olympics means any less to me now. But I\u2019m in a different headspace. I know there\u2019s no better high than having a child. Yes, winning a medal is amazing, but there won\u2019t be a better feeling than coming back from training today and having Robbie to hold.\u201d So he steps to the edge of the concrete. \u201cThis is Tokyo. I will stand at the end of the board and be present. I\u2019ll breathe. I\u2019ll see my son and my husband in the audience. And that\u2019ll be enough.\u201d A security guard jogs across the garden, waving for Daley to climb down from the blocks. It\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019s worried about the welfare of one of the country\u2019s best medal prospects or just the integrity of the garden, but Daley gets down and apologises. The guard explains: \u201cI was worried you were about to dive off. You could get really hurt, you know?\u201d Daley grins, as if to say: once, maybe.

They show you can do anything.\u201d Houghton and Scott began their careers in an era when menstruation was rarely mentioned in the female sporting sphere but research indicating that women footballers are more prone to rupturing cruciate ligaments during the first half, or pre-ovulatory phase, of their cycle has dragged it into the spotlight. Ever the innovator, Hayes individually tailors Chelsea players\u2019 training regimes to their cycles. \u201cIt\u2019s a subject that\u2019s been a taboo and there\u2019ve been a lot of unknowns so for us to bring it into the open will be really helpful,\u201d says a manager who believes hers is the first club to adapt training schedules and nutrition plans to period patterns. \u201cUnderstanding the cycle is one part of the holistic understanding to help players prepare. It helps formulate decisions about each individual from day to day.\u201d If minimising ACL knee tears represents an important plus, the potential downside is an excess of introspection and self-obsession but, considering Chelsea are on a run of nine straight wins and have kept five consecutive clean sheets, the new regimen can hardly be said to have disrupted the team ethic. Hayes though is aware her side have never won a WSL fixture at City. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to win up there for the first time since I\u2019ve been manager I want to make sure we produce a higher level of performance than I\u2019ve seen from the team recently,\u201d she says. \u201cOur performances have been mixed in the past couple of games. \u201cMan City are a top side and there\u2019s very little between us. But this is the most consistent Chelsea team I\u2019ve managed. We\u2019ve been able to grind results out, even when we haven\u2019t been at our best.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Since June 2019 Hong Kong has been \u2013 first figuratively, then literally \u2013 on fire. What began as a \u201csummer of discontent\u201d has become a running street battle, marked by acts of violence by both police and protesters. In November, Hong Kong\u2019s university campuses were combat zones, bristling with makeshift barricades and petrol bombs; police responded with threats of using live ammunition.</p> <p>The protests had an immediate trigger: a controversial bill proposed by the chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-china-beijing-puppet\" title=\"\">Carrie Lam</a>, that would permit extradition from HK to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Activists in HK fiercely opposed it because they feared it would break down a barrier between the legal systems of the PRC and HK, making it possible for the mainland \u2013 which has become increasingly politically repressive over the past seven years \u2013 to extradite political activists and dissidents into China\u2019s opaque and Communist party-dominated legal system. Keeping the two systems separate for at least 50 years was a keynote of basic law governing the return of HK to mainland China in 1997.</p> <p>But it\u2019s impossible to understand the vehemence of current rebellion without highlighting a string of longer-term grievances that have led to this crisis. Since HK\u2019s return to mainland government control in 1997, the island has simmered with anxiety about its government\u2019s relationship with Beijing. This unease has periodically erupted into mass demonstrations when the administration has attempted to pass legislation that would explicitly tighten Beijing\u2019s grip on local affairs.</p> <p>In 2003 (when the then chief executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/10/china.jamessturcke\" title=\"\">Tung Chee-hwa </a>tried to introduce an anti-sedition law extending mainland political control) and 2014 (when Beijing stalled attempts to democratise selection of HK\u2019s chief executive) hundreds of thousands took to the streets. Unease has intensified over the past six years, following the abduction by mainland agents of local publishers of Chinese political expos\u00e9s. Frustration at this string of encroachments on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy led to the unprecedented violence of 2019. One piece of anti-government graffiti said: \u201cIt was YOU who taught us that peaceful protest doesn\u2019t work!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fb7d76fc2c2357de27c2cfe4f52da3bf8b9f929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fb7d76fc2c2357de27c2cfe4f52da3bf8b9f929/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie Lam takes her oath in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hong Kong, July 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrie Lam takes her oath in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hong Kong, July 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joshua Wong\u2019s memoir, <em>Unfree Speech</em>, weaves an activist\u2019s biography through this contemporary history. Wong was born in 1996, on the eve of the handover. In his view, HK\u2019s first decade after returning to Chinese rule \u201cwas nothing short of catastrophic\u201d. Its economy was rocked in turn by the 1997 financial crisis, the 2002-03 Sars epidemic and a burst housing bubble. GDP shrank, unemployment rose.</p> <p>A precociously politicised child, the 12-year-old Wong blamed these failures on HK\u2019s dysfunctionally partial democracy \u2013 a product of drawn-out negotiations between the departing British and the incoming Chinese Communist party. The chief executive is selected by a small committee dominated by mainland loyalists. Only half the legislative council (LegCo, Hong Kong\u2019s parliament) is elected through open democratic vote. The other half is chosen by trade and special interest groups allied with Beijing and who vote \u201cat the bidding of the government\u201d. Wong concluded that \u201cEverything that\u2019s wrong with Hong Kong was attributable to a single culprit: our unaccountable government and the lopsided electoral system that created and facilitates it.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, Wong\u2019s first campaign fought a government attempt to introduce \u201cmoral and national education\u201d into local schools, a policy that he and many other school students saw as stealth communist brainwashing. Wong, by then 15, learnt how to draw tens of thousands of citizens to rallies, to collaborate with other civil society groups and to generate viral speeches and interviews. This was, he argues, a turning point in post-handover history: the emergence of effective, dynamic youth politics. Where the adults have failed, \u201cyoung people will take up the mantle \u2026 Politics is no longer an exclusive sport for grey-haired politicians and lifelong bureaucrats\u201d.From here, Wong plunged into 2014\u2019s pro-democracy protests<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/hong-kong-umbrella-movement-first-anniversary-democracy\" title=\"\"> (the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d)</a>, during which he was arrested for civil disobedience. Although the movement failed to deliver clear results, Wong argues that \u201cthe sweeping political awakening and civic engagement it brought about are indisputable [in giving] Hong Kongers, especially my generation, new confidence to challenge Communist China\u201d.</p> <p>By this point, he had become an international celebrity: \u201cthe face of protest\u201d, as Time magazine dubbed him.

      "bodyText": "Since June 2019 Hong Kong has been \u2013 first figuratively, then literally \u2013 on fire. What began as a \u201csummer of discontent\u201d has become a running street battle, marked by acts of violence by both police and protesters. In November, Hong Kong\u2019s university campuses were combat zones, bristling with makeshift barricades and petrol bombs; police responded with threats of using live ammunition. The protests had an immediate trigger: a controversial bill proposed by the chief executive, Carrie Lam, that would permit extradition from HK to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Activists in HK fiercely opposed it because they feared it would break down a barrier between the legal systems of the PRC and HK, making it possible for the mainland \u2013 which has become increasingly politically repressive over the past seven years \u2013 to extradite political activists and dissidents into China\u2019s opaque and Communist party-dominated legal system. Keeping the two systems separate for at least 50 years was a keynote of basic law governing the return of HK to mainland China in 1997. But it\u2019s impossible to understand the vehemence of current rebellion without highlighting a string of longer-term grievances that have led to this crisis. Since HK\u2019s return to mainland government control in 1997, the island has simmered with anxiety about its government\u2019s relationship with Beijing. This unease has periodically erupted into mass demonstrations when the administration has attempted to pass legislation that would explicitly tighten Beijing\u2019s grip on local affairs. In 2003 (when the then chief executive Tung Chee-hwa tried to introduce an anti-sedition law extending mainland political control) and 2014 (when Beijing stalled attempts to democratise selection of HK\u2019s chief executive) hundreds of thousands took to the streets. Unease has intensified over the past six years, following the abduction by mainland agents of local publishers of Chinese political expos\u00e9s. Frustration at this string of encroachments on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy led to the unprecedented violence of 2019. One piece of anti-government graffiti said: \u201cIt was YOU who taught us that peaceful protest doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Joshua Wong\u2019s memoir, Unfree Speech, weaves an activist\u2019s biography through this contemporary history. Wong was born in 1996, on the eve of the handover. In his view, HK\u2019s first decade after returning to Chinese rule \u201cwas nothing short of catastrophic\u201d. Its economy was rocked in turn by the 1997 financial crisis, the 2002-03 Sars epidemic and a burst housing bubble. GDP shrank, unemployment rose. A precociously politicised child, the 12-year-old Wong blamed these failures on HK\u2019s dysfunctionally partial democracy \u2013 a product of drawn-out negotiations between the departing British and the incoming Chinese Communist party. The chief executive is selected by a small committee dominated by mainland loyalists. Only half the legislative council (LegCo, Hong Kong\u2019s parliament) is elected through open democratic vote. The other half is chosen by trade and special interest groups allied with Beijing and who vote \u201cat the bidding of the government\u201d. Wong concluded that \u201cEverything that\u2019s wrong with Hong Kong was attributable to a single culprit: our unaccountable government and the lopsided electoral system that created and facilitates it.\u201d In 2012, Wong\u2019s first campaign fought a government attempt to introduce \u201cmoral and national education\u201d into local schools, a policy that he and many other school students saw as stealth communist brainwashing. Wong, by then 15, learnt how to draw tens of thousands of citizens to rallies, to collaborate with other civil society groups and to generate viral speeches and interviews. This was, he argues, a turning point in post-handover history: the emergence of effective, dynamic youth politics. Where the adults have failed, \u201cyoung people will take up the mantle \u2026 Politics is no longer an exclusive sport for grey-haired politicians and lifelong bureaucrats\u201d.From here, Wong plunged into 2014\u2019s pro-democracy protests (the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d), during which he was arrested for civil disobedience. Although the movement failed to deliver clear results, Wong argues that \u201cthe sweeping political awakening and civic engagement it brought about are indisputable [in giving] Hong Kongers, especially my generation, new confidence to challenge Communist China\u201d. By this point, he had become an international celebrity: \u201cthe face of protest\u201d, as Time magazine dubbed him. His memoir appealingly backs away from individual grandstanding, though, and he is consistently modest about his own achievements: \u201cthe true heroes\u201d of his political story \u201care the amazing people of Hong Kong\u201d. In 2016, perhaps the high point of Wong\u2019s career, his pro-self-determination party Demosisto secured its first seat at LegCo. But since then he and his fellow activists have increasingly fallen victim to the government\u2019s attritional strategy of \u201clawfare\u201d, which stifles oppositional activism by doling out punitive sentences for protest. Two months shy of his 21st birthday, Wong and two of his closest comrades were sentenced to up to eight months\u2019 imprisonment for participating in the umbrella movement three years previously. This was part of a broader pattern of the government\u2019s \u201crelentless pursuit of political activists through the criminal justice system\u201d \u2013 and helps explain why the 2019 extradition bill lit the touchpaper of public anger. Wong\u2019s sense of mission \u2013 his dedication to fighting for HK\u2019s long-term political future \u2013 stems substantially from his upbringing as a devout Christian: \u201cGod \u2026 put me on this world for a reason.\u201d But the book is also careful to reveal Wong\u2019s boyish side. His recollections are conspicuously studded with references to the superhero cartoons and films that seem to dominate his imagination. \u201cI lived the life of Peter Parker,\u201d he recalls of his 2012 campaign. \u201cLike Spider-Man\u2019s alter ego, I went to class during the day and rushed out to fight evil after school.\u201d \u201cIf Carrie Lam resembled Darth Vader,\u201d he analogises about the architect of the infamous extradition bill, \u201cthe Hong Kong Police Force would be the armour-clad, blaster-brandishing stormtroopers terrorising villagers across the galaxy.\u201d True to this Star Wars frame of reference, the book posits a Manichean opposition between the interests of democratic HK and mainland China, charting the ambition of the increasingly repressive PRC government to use its international \u201csharp power\u201d to export its \u201cbrand of one-party rule in Asia and beyond\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When my grandmother died I did not go to her funeral. I was 16 at the time, so it wasn\u2019t that I was too young. Instead, the agreed family line was that I was too sick, in between hospital stays for anorexia. But even if I\u2019d been in the rudest of health I wouldn\u2019t have gone. All my life, I\u2019d avoided my grandmother \u2013 why would that change now that she\u2019d died?</p> <p>Of course I loved my Grandma Sala, but I enjoyed her a lot more in theory than in practice. I loved how beautiful she was, and that she was French; having a French grandparent, albeit one who lived in Miami, seemed incredibly exotic when I was growing up in New York. She told me to call her <em>grande-m\u00e8re</em>, and you\u2019d better believe that I dropped that into conversation with friends at any opportunity, along with references to how \u201cchic\u201d she was, another word I learned from her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My grandmother always looked as if she was on her way to a fashion show, even when she was going to the supermarket</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And she was chic, incredibly so. While other Jewish grandmothers in Miami wore shapeless shift dresses and garish prints, my grandmother always looked as if she was on her way to a fashion show, even when she was going to the supermarket. Her American husband, my Grandpa Bill, dressed the part of a true Floridian, in his white trousers and pastel golf shirts, and he would sit with us by the pool, letting my sister and I twirl his handlebar moustache. My grandmother, however, would sit alone \u2013 under an umbrella, separate from us, reading the French fashion magazines her brothers still sent her from Paris. She wore distinctly French styles \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent-like peasant tops, Chanel-esque jackets, mini Dior handbag in her lap. She looked as French as my grandfather looked American, the soft, elegant looks of a Renoir painting, but overlaid with the melancholy of an Edward Hopper.</p> <p>Bill and Sala were my paternal grandparents and although I loved them both, they did not seem to love one another, or so it appeared to me as a child. When we visited them, they snapped at one another continuously, which scared me because I never saw my parents fight. I loved to talk about my grandmother when she wasn\u2019t there \u2013 but when she was, I fled. She would hold me just that bit too close, looking at me as if she was asking for something I knew I could never give. I squirmed away from a love that felt oppressive, because, for reasons I was in no way capable of articulating then, I found my grandmother difficult. If pressed, I would have said that she was \u201cweird\u201d; but what I meant was that she seemed sad, and sad adults are confusing for children, especially ones as sheltered as I was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e94ecff895ffeb85217d563f901c77ba6e0c9699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e94ecff895ffeb85217d563f901c77ba6e0c9699/198_108_1824_1094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Glass siblings with their mother in Henri and Sonia\u2019s apartment in about 1932, L-R: Henri, Sonia, Sala, Chaya and Jacques.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Glass siblings with their mother in Henri and Sonia\u2019s apartment in about 1932, L-R: Henri, Sonia, Sala, Chaya and Jacques.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have one memory of her running away from me. When I was five, my parents took me to Europe for the first time. We went to Deauville, a seaside town in Normandy, to meet my French family \u2013 Sala\u2019s family, in other words. I knew that my grandmother had left France a long time ago to escape what was vaguely described to me as \u201cthe war\u201d, before marrying my grandfather in New York. But I hadn\u2019t, until we went to Deauville, ever thought about what she\u2019d left behind. On the first night, we arranged to meet everyone in the hotel dining room: my grandmother\u2019s older brothers, Henri Glass and Alex Maguy, and Henri\u2019s wife, Sonia. Sala flew over from Miami to join us, but that first night she was late. As I waited with my parents and this trio of impossibly old French people, I spotted my grandmother in the doorway, hanging back, watching us. Then I noticed something else: she was crying. She turned around and rushed out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Grandma?\u201d I asked my mother, but she shook her head and put her finger to her lips. I looked to my father. He was looking towards where his mother had disappeared, before going after her.</p> <p>It was a lovely holiday. Alex Maguy \u2013 whose surname was \u201cGlass\u201d, like Henri\u2019s and Sala\u2019s, though he went by Maguy professionally \u2013 made the biggest impression: this namedropping art dealer, full of fire and fury, but always gentle with me. Sonia, who looked like a firecracker with her red hair and blue eye shadow, taught me how to play bridge and introduced me to pain au chocolat. Gentle, kind Henri couldn\u2019t speak English, so we would just nod and smile shyly at each other across the table. And then there was Sala, clinging on to Henri\u2019s arm, growing quieter as the week went on.</p> <p>Afterwards, I went back to New York and everyone I met in Deauville slowly, inexorably died. Sala died in 1994 and although she had made a life for herself in America, she never stopped seeming sad to me, and her sadness never stopped unnerving me. I never let her get close, and to this day there is a cold part of me that recoils from neediness. For years afterwards, thinking about all this made me feel things I couldn\u2019t articulate. Again, I probably would have said it made me feel weird, when what I really meant was that it made me feel terrible. So I deliberately didn\u2019t think about it at all.</p> <p>As I got older, I spent some time with Alex, the last surviving Glass sibling. I\u2019d have lunch with him in his flat, surrounded by his collection of paintings by Monet and Matisse and Picasso, and I\u2019d never question why his supremely glamorous life in Paris was so different from my grandmother\u2019s in Miami. But after he died in 1999, when I was 21, I suddenly couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that and more. I knew there was a story about what had happened to the Glasses during and after the war, but even thinking about it felt like touching a bruise. I started alternately tapping this tender spot, and running away in horror at what I was doing. I spent whatever free time I had in archives in France, Poland and New York, and then hid my notebooks around my flat, kidding myself that I wasn\u2019t doing what I was, in fact, doing.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2006, when I was working on the Guardian\u2019s fashion desk, I came up with what seemed like a painless way to write about my grandmother: I would write about her relationship with fashion, and how, despite living in the US for almost 60 years, she had used her clothes to emphasise her un-Americanness.</p> <p>My uncle Rich, my father\u2019s younger brother, was living in my grandparents\u2019 former apartment, and fortunately for me, he had kept most of her things. So I flew to Miami, intending to go through my grandmother\u2019s closet and describe her wardrobe, using it as a way to write about her, because writing about her without any proxy still felt too much like staring into the sun. I opened her closet and started to go through her belongings. At the back, I spotted a shoebox, covered in more than a decade\u2019s worth of dust. I was sure it would contain another pair of battered kitten-heeled sandals but, determined to be thorough, I pulled it out. It did not contain sandals. Instead, inside were the secrets my grandmother had kept all her life. They included:</p> <p>A small album featuring photos of Alex, Henri and Sala, younger than I\u2019d ever seen them before. There were also photos of Sala embracing a man whose face had been gouged out by someone\u2019s \u2013 presumably my grandmother\u2019s \u2013 fingernail;</p> <p>Photos of a man I\u2019d never seen before with round spectacles. In some photos he was with a group of other men, standing in or next to a cabin;</p> <p>A letter in French saying that \u201cla famille Glass\u201d was hiding in Paris under an assumed name;</p> <p>Letters between the Glasses spanning over half a century;</p> <p>Photos of Alex Maguy with Pablo Picasso;</p> <p>A sketch of a man holding a gun to his head that was signed, \u201cAvec amiti\u00e9, Picasso.\u201d</p> <p>For the next 13 years, I followed these clues, often feeling like Casaubon in Middlemarch, the silly fool who embarks on an impossible book project that he never finishes. Originally I planned to write just about my grandmother, not her brothers, but it quickly became clear that this was impossible: their lives were completely entwined. Also, Alex, Henri and the third brother, Jacques \u2013 the man in the round glasses whom I had never met \u2013 each had extraordinary and strikingly different stories, and I couldn\u2019t let them fade away, like old photos in the back of a closet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her brothers led lives of masculine adventure. My grandmother, on the other hand, represented the quiet feminine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I learned that Henri invented a machine that microfilmed and shrunk down documents, and that during the war he had travelled in secret all over France with his machine, saving public and private archives from Vichy and Nazi forces. After the war, Henri\u2019s microfilms helped to rebuild towns and ports. Multiple times, he was nearly arrested and saved only by the fake ID card Sonia got for him on the black market, which said he was a Catholic named Henri Classe. After the war, this machine would make him enormously wealthy. Sonia, who stayed hidden in Paris during the war, was in even worse danger; although her German was good, it\u2019s not easy for a firecracker to stay in the shadows. She moved out of her and Henri\u2019s apartment in central Paris and rented one under a false name by the Bois de Vincennes. But her former neighbours frequently pinned denunciation letters to her door, attempting to turn her in to the Gestapo. Sonia would rip them off and, in one case, posted a note to my grandmother in the US, to let her know what was happening.</p> <p>Jacques, the brother I never met, was arrested in 1942 and sent to Pithiviers, a French concentration camp. He also posted my grandmother memorabilia to keep her updated, in this case, photos of himself and his fellow prisoners. Incredibly, he was allowed out for a day to visit his newborn daughter. Henri and Alex met him by his wife\u2019s bed and begged him to go into hiding, saying they would help him. But Jacques refused, because he had given his word to the prison guards. So he went back and soon after was shipped out \u2013 on the same train as Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\" title=\"\">author of Suite Fran</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\" title=\"\">\u00e7aise</a> \u2013 to Auschwitz, where he was killed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c826d803e9c71dcd0f45e1a2af16dbca537ec348\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c826d803e9c71dcd0f45e1a2af16dbca537ec348/449_1262_7473_9340/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sala\u2019s brother Alex Maguy welcoming  her and her sons, Ronald (Freeman\u2019s father, front)  and Richard, to Paris in 1948.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sala\u2019s brother Alex Maguy welcoming her and her sons, Ronald (Freeman\u2019s father, front) and Richard, to Paris in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By far the most time-consuming brother to research was Alex. The files on him, which were scattered across France in various archives, were so fat they took me years to go through. Originally a couturier, whose closest friend in the business was Christian Dior, Alex joined the Foreign Legion as soon as war was declared, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery in combat. But when France fell to the Germans, he was arrested and put on a train to the camps \u2013 which he escaped by climbing out through the roof and jumping off. Alex spent the rest of the war hiding in a farmhouse in central France \u2013 which I eventually found \u2013 while working for the resistance. Afterwards, he switched careers from fashion to art and was a celebrated gallerist in Paris. Picasso drew the poster for one of his most important exhibitions and the two men became close friends, initially because the artist so admired Alex\u2019s wartime record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b75e5dbc1d711b851670f67c2b6e77e4db61e3a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b75e5dbc1d711b851670f67c2b6e77e4db61e3a1/35_100_1764_2204/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Maguy (right) with Pablo Picasso in the late 60s. \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Maguy (right) with Pablo Picasso in the late 60s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74121dab0447ad9e44956c10d96e400edffc5b1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74121dab0447ad9e44956c10d96e400edffc5b1b/49_19_2422_3026/800.jpg\" alt=\"A sketch by Picasso signed \u2018Avec amiti\u00e9\u2019, discovered in Sala\u2019s apartment after her death.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sketch by Picasso signed \u2018Avec amiti\u00e9\u2019, discovered in Sala\u2019s apartment after her death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henri, Jacques and Alex led lives of masculine adventure, which were recorded in official archives. My grandmother, on the other hand, spent the war as a housewife in Long Island. She represented the quiet feminine: domestic, private \u2013 what George Eliot described as \u201ca hidden life\u201d, one of \u201cunrecorded acts\u201d, filled not with adventure but emotional drama, and that is not something I would find in an archive. Instead, I needed to talk to those who knew her best, and that meant her sons \u2013 my father Ronald, and my uncle Rich. I dreaded hurting them by asking difficult questions, but it turned out that what had hurt them most was feeling they had to keep these stories to themselves. Slowly, Sala\u2019s life, one she\u2019d always kept in the shadows, came into focus.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Despite seeming like the embodiment of Frenchness to me, Sala and her brothers weren\u2019t French at all; they were Polish. They were born and raised in Chrzan\u00f3w, then famous for its large market place, but better known today for being only 20km from Auschwitz, so close that the towns considered themselves to be sisters. In 1918, the pogroms began and the Glass family fled to Paris, to join their cousins, the Ornsteins. These pogroms terrified the Glasses but ultimately saved their lives, because any Jew who was still in Chrzan\u00f3w at the beginning of the second world war was killed.</p> <p>The siblings fell in love with Paris: its beauty, its sense of style and, of course, its safety, which was to prove all too transitory. Henri and Sala made themselves over to be as French as possible, and with the enthusiasm of converts, lost their Polish accents and dressed in the most Parisian of clothes, which Alex made for them.</p> <p>All of them worked in the fashion business \u2013 or \u201cschmatte\u201d trade, to use the Yiddish term. Fashion \u2013 like the movie industry today \u2013 was then considered a Jewish industry, specifically a Jewish immigrant industry. Partly this was a practical issue: in contrast to many other professions at the time, there were no quota limits on how many Jews could work in it. On a more emotional level, fashion (like art, another profession that was then heavily Jewish) is an industry that celebrates beauty. It is not surprising that Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who had experienced so much ugliness in their lives, might crave a corrective. Alex and Jacques ran a tailoring shop in the Marais, the then Jewish quarter in Paris, and Sala, a talented artist, made patterns for mass-produced clothing: swirling, psychedelic drawings filled with colour, excitement and happiness. At 25, she was independent, living in a city she loved, with a family she adored, and was engaged to a young man \u2013 a dentist and socialist \u2013 with whom she was deeply in love. And then in February 1937, it was all taken away from her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The American man reached across the table and told her he\u2019d fallen in love with her at first sight. Marry me, he begged</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One night, Alex brought an American man over to Sala\u2019s apartment for dinner. He was, Alex told her, a millionaire from Manhattan. Suddenly over dinner, the American man, who had been staring at Sala since he arrived, reached across the table and told her he\u2019d fallen in love with her at first sight. Marry me, he begged, come with me to America. Sala laughed this off, but after the American left, Alex \u2013 who closely followed what was happening in Germany \u2013 told her she had to do it, because staying in Paris was a death sentence. This guy was rich and a good friend, Alex said; she\u2019d never get a better offer. To Sala\u2019s horror, Henri agreed, and so, in what must have been a state of shock, in June 1937, Sala sailed to New York, to marry a man she didn\u2019t know, leaving behind everything she loved. When she arrived and her beaming husband-to-be drove her to her new home, she realised some things pretty quickly: this man was not a millionaire, he did not live in Manhattan, and he did not work in the fashion business. He didn\u2019t even really know Alex. He ran a gas station out on Long Island and he just happened to meet Alex one day while on holiday in France. Alex, banking on my grandmother\u2019s beauty to woo this man, had then lied to her in the hope of getting her out of Europe. This is how my grandparents met.</p> <p>My grandfather Bill loved Sala very deeply, and would do so for the rest of his life. But while she appreciated him as a good man and a good husband, she didn\u2019t love him the same way, and this hurt him. She was miserable in his small town and complained often, to his astonishment. Hadn\u2019t he saved her from the Nazis? She was a lot less grateful than he\u2019d expected. She was no longer making the art she loved; instead, she was a housewife and dependent on a man she barely knew. The fights started soon after they married. She was all alone in this strange place, and once the war started, she spent years not knowing whether her family was alive or dead.</p> <p>By the end of the war, she was the mother of two sons. There was no way she could survive as a single mother in Paris, a city emotionally and economically destroyed by the war. So she resolved to wait until Bill died, when she could return to France. The grandmother I met 40 years later was someone who was still waiting for her life to begin.</p> <p>Sala endured a specifically female tragedy: she gave up her true love, her dreams and professional fulfilment for protection by marriage with someone she did not love. Alex got a medal for going to war, but no one was going to give her plaudits for what she did. On the contrary, this kind of self-sacrifice was so expected of women that, in the eyes of those around her, it would have been extraordinary if she had refused to do it.</p> <p>The story of my grandmother confused people, especially Jewish Americans, who understandably assume that any story about escaping the war to the US is a happy one. But individual lives are more complicated than great sweeps of history, and while Sala was alone and frustrated in America, Alex and Henri went on to live gloriously successful lives in France. Sala had done what she had to in order to survive, but in saving herself she lost everything that had made her life worth living. Other things took their place \u2013 her children, eventually her grandchildren \u2013 and she was demonstratively affectionate to them, naturally loving, but also desperate to justify to herself the path her life had taken. If she loved them enough, if they loved her enough, then maybe it would have been worth it. This is the need I sensed in her as a child, but was too young to understand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aac2e86e1b7f966f521ac317d95a6252107f5878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac2e86e1b7f966f521ac317d95a6252107f5878/357_2036_7045_4227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sala (centre) with Alex and a friend, early 30s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sala (centre) with Alex and a friend, early 30s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sala never saw her former fiance again; he almost certainly died in the war. She also never lived in France again. Thwarting his wife to the very end, Bill lived into his 90s, and just as he started to decline, Sala had a massive stroke that stilled both her body and her tongue. At Bill\u2019s funeral, people remarked on how affecting it was to see her in her wheelchair, crying silently as she looked at her husband\u2019s coffin. But she wasn\u2019t sad that Bill had died. She was sad that the day she had waited for had finally come, and it didn\u2019t matter any more. All those fantasies of living in Paris, of travelling to Israel: all gone. Two years later, she died in a US hospital, far from the place she still thought of as home, 60 years after leaving it.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Once the Glass siblings died, my extended family drifted apart. None of us were good at staying in touch, and we\u2019d all got the same message from the Glasses: that the past should be pushed away and not discussed. So didn\u2019t that include our own families? But as perhaps Jews know better than most, you can never entirely escape your past.</p> <p>Once I finally started to slough off the anorexia that had blanketed my teens and 20s, I realised there was some kernel in me, one that I could neither explain nor understand, that meant I wanted to work in fashion. Like the Glasses I, too, wanted to see beauty.</p> <p>After finishing university, I lived in Paris and started working as a freelance fashion journalist. This eventually translated into the job on the Guardian\u2019s fashion desk, where I was to stay for eight years. One of my favourite parts of the job was covering the shows and one day, when I was at the Dior show in Paris, I felt a hand on my shoulder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3760de9cdf02be4c77c1309c9d202efe9505cb33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3760de9cdf02be4c77c1309c9d202efe9505cb33/166_97_2119_1466/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sala and Bill with their granddaughter Hadley in the late 70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sala and Bill with their granddaughter Hadley in the late 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you my cousin?\u201d asked a handsome man. It was Alexandre de Betak, Henri and Sonia\u2019s grandson. He worked then \u2013 and still does \u2013 as a fashion show producer, collaborating with brands such as Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent. But probably his most enduring relationship has been with Dior, whose shows he has worked on for years, just as Alex Maguy\u2019s strongest relationship in France was with Dior himself. Neither De Betak nor I knew of this connection until I started researching this book.</p> <p>Soon after that, I met another cousin, Philippe Ornstein, the grandson of one of the Glasses\u2019 cousins, Maurice Ornstein, who was killed in the war. Philippe and I also found each other through fashion: he was then working as a fashion publicist, and when we met it felt as if we had grown up together.</p> <p>For decades, I ran away from this story, researching it with my right hand and fearfully covering my eyes with my left. I told myself that it was self-indulgent to write my family history \u2013 who would be interested in reading about Grandma? But the truth is, I just found it too painful to leave alone, picking at it like a scab. Even before I knew the details of Sala\u2019s story, I\u2019ve always known that I would not exist if the Holocaust hadn\u2019t happened \u2013 because then Sala would never have come to America. For a long time, this added another dimension to my well-established sense of Jewish guilt: that I was alive only because of the suffering of other people, and one person in particular \u2013 my grandmother. But Sala would not have seen it that way. In her eyes, we were not the compensation for what she had left behind but the explanation for it. I had avoided her sadness when she was alive, but two decades after her death it still felt so palpable to me that my research took up an entire bookshelf \u2013 and still, I couldn\u2019t bear to write the story. Then in January 2018, I sat down and did just that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa4ebcc42dcdba1217ee21200ddf25e29d074100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa4ebcc42dcdba1217ee21200ddf25e29d074100/684_904_5035_6293/800.jpg\" alt=\"Freeman\u2019s grandparents Sala and Bill in Long Island, mid 50s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freeman\u2019s grandparents Sala and Bill in Long Island, mid 50s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is probably no coincidence that I finally committed in the shadow of the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump\u2019s election. Neither of these political shifts were about keeping out the Jews, but they were about keeping out immigrants, and the story of the Glasses was one of immigration, from Poland to France, and France to America. Alongside that, antisemitism was on the rise throughout Europe in a way I never thought I\u2019d see in my lifetime, on both the right and the left. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/11/europe/antisemitism-poll-2018-intl/\" title=\"\">A 2018 survey found that</a> one in five Europeans believe Jews have \u201ctoo much influence in the media and politics\u201d. In France, antisemitic acts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/12/french-police-investigate-antisemitic-attacks-in-paris-simone-veil\" title=\"\">rose by 74% between 2017-2018</a>. As I was writing, furious arguments raged across British politics about antisemitism, particularly within the Labour party, where non-Jews on the left suddenly felt very comfortable telling Jews that they knew better what is and isn\u2019t antisemitic. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/feb/06/antisemitic-incidents-hit-new-high-in-2019-according-to-study\" title=\"\">reports of anti</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/feb/06/antisemitic-incidents-hit-new-high-in-2019-according-to-study\" title=\"\">semitic acts in Britain</a> rose every year as I worked on the book, culminating in 2019 with 1,805 incidents, the highest number in 35 years. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html\" title=\"\">41% of Americans now don\u2019t even know what Auschwitz is</a>. Reading these news stories quashed any concerns I had that writing about the past, or my family, was self-indulgent.</p> <p>But my obsession with this story had little to do with political prescience on my part. Instead, it was because of the people involved, each one such an extraordinary force of personality that I couldn\u2019t shake them off decades after they died.</p> <p>Sala had longed to move back to Europe, to be with her family, to have lunches in Paris with them, to go to the fashion shows, to live the life of her choosing. She never got to do that \u2013 but I do. Because she gave up everything, I get to live her dream. I think of her every time I walk along the Boulevard Saint-Germain; when meeting one of my cousins for lunch in the Marais; when I go to a fashion show. I think of all the Glasses every time my train pulls into the Gare du Nord \u2013 how they arrived in Paris from Poland by train a century ago, knowing no one and owning less. How far they went in their lives; how politics and fate tore them apart.

      "bodyText": "When my grandmother died I did not go to her funeral. I was 16 at the time, so it wasn\u2019t that I was too young. Instead, the agreed family line was that I was too sick, in between hospital stays for anorexia. But even if I\u2019d been in the rudest of health I wouldn\u2019t have gone. All my life, I\u2019d avoided my grandmother \u2013 why would that change now that she\u2019d died? Of course I loved my Grandma Sala, but I enjoyed her a lot more in theory than in practice. I loved how beautiful she was, and that she was French; having a French grandparent, albeit one who lived in Miami, seemed incredibly exotic when I was growing up in New York. She told me to call her grande-m\u00e8re, and you\u2019d better believe that I dropped that into conversation with friends at any opportunity, along with references to how \u201cchic\u201d she was, another word I learned from her. And she was chic, incredibly so. While other Jewish grandmothers in Miami wore shapeless shift dresses and garish prints, my grandmother always looked as if she was on her way to a fashion show, even when she was going to the supermarket. Her American husband, my Grandpa Bill, dressed the part of a true Floridian, in his white trousers and pastel golf shirts, and he would sit with us by the pool, letting my sister and I twirl his handlebar moustache. My grandmother, however, would sit alone \u2013 under an umbrella, separate from us, reading the French fashion magazines her brothers still sent her from Paris. She wore distinctly French styles \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent-like peasant tops, Chanel-esque jackets, mini Dior handbag in her lap. She looked as French as my grandfather looked American, the soft, elegant looks of a Renoir painting, but overlaid with the melancholy of an Edward Hopper. Bill and Sala were my paternal grandparents and although I loved them both, they did not seem to love one another, or so it appeared to me as a child. When we visited them, they snapped at one another continuously, which scared me because I never saw my parents fight. I loved to talk about my grandmother when she wasn\u2019t there \u2013 but when she was, I fled. She would hold me just that bit too close, looking at me as if she was asking for something I knew I could never give. I squirmed away from a love that felt oppressive, because, for reasons I was in no way capable of articulating then, I found my grandmother difficult. If pressed, I would have said that she was \u201cweird\u201d; but what I meant was that she seemed sad, and sad adults are confusing for children, especially ones as sheltered as I was. I have one memory of her running away from me. When I was five, my parents took me to Europe for the first time. We went to Deauville, a seaside town in Normandy, to meet my French family \u2013 Sala\u2019s family, in other words. I knew that my grandmother had left France a long time ago to escape what was vaguely described to me as \u201cthe war\u201d, before marrying my grandfather in New York. But I hadn\u2019t, until we went to Deauville, ever thought about what she\u2019d left behind. On the first night, we arranged to meet everyone in the hotel dining room: my grandmother\u2019s older brothers, Henri Glass and Alex Maguy, and Henri\u2019s wife, Sonia. Sala flew over from Miami to join us, but that first night she was late. As I waited with my parents and this trio of impossibly old French people, I spotted my grandmother in the doorway, hanging back, watching us. Then I noticed something else: she was crying. She turned around and rushed out of the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Grandma?\u201d I asked my mother, but she shook her head and put her finger to her lips. I looked to my father. He was looking towards where his mother had disappeared, before going after her. It was a lovely holiday. Alex Maguy \u2013 whose surname was \u201cGlass\u201d, like Henri\u2019s and Sala\u2019s, though he went by Maguy professionally \u2013 made the biggest impression: this namedropping art dealer, full of fire and fury, but always gentle with me. Sonia, who looked like a firecracker with her red hair and blue eye shadow, taught me how to play bridge and introduced me to pain au chocolat. Gentle, kind Henri couldn\u2019t speak English, so we would just nod and smile shyly at each other across the table. And then there was Sala, clinging on to Henri\u2019s arm, growing quieter as the week went on. Afterwards, I went back to New York and everyone I met in Deauville slowly, inexorably died. Sala died in 1994 and although she had made a life for herself in America, she never stopped seeming sad to me, and her sadness never stopped unnerving me. I never let her get close, and to this day there is a cold part of me that recoils from neediness. For years afterwards, thinking about all this made me feel things I couldn\u2019t articulate. Again, I probably would have said it made me feel weird, when what I really meant was that it made me feel terrible. So I deliberately didn\u2019t think about it at all. As I got older, I spent some time with Alex, the last surviving Glass sibling. I\u2019d have lunch with him in his flat, surrounded by his collection of paintings by Monet and Matisse and Picasso, and I\u2019d never question why his supremely glamorous life in Paris was so different from my grandmother\u2019s in Miami. But after he died in 1999, when I was 21, I suddenly couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that and more. I knew there was a story about what had happened to the Glasses during and after the war, but even thinking about it felt like touching a bruise. I started alternately tapping this tender spot, and running away in horror at what I was doing. I spent whatever free time I had in archives in France, Poland and New York, and then hid my notebooks around my flat, kidding myself that I wasn\u2019t doing what I was, in fact, doing. *** In 2006, when I was working on the Guardian\u2019s fashion desk, I came up with what seemed like a painless way to write about my grandmother: I would write about her relationship with fashion, and how, despite living in the US for almost 60 years, she had used her clothes to emphasise her un-Americanness. My uncle Rich, my father\u2019s younger brother, was living in my grandparents\u2019 former apartment, and fortunately for me, he had kept most of her things. So I flew to Miami, intending to go through my grandmother\u2019s closet and describe her wardrobe, using it as a way to write about her, because writing about her without any proxy still felt too much like staring into the sun. I opened her closet and started to go through her belongings. At the back, I spotted a shoebox, covered in more than a decade\u2019s worth of dust. I was sure it would contain another pair of battered kitten-heeled sandals but, determined to be thorough, I pulled it out. It did not contain sandals. Instead, inside were the secrets my grandmother had kept all her life. They included: A small album featuring photos of Alex, Henri and Sala, younger than I\u2019d ever seen them before. There were also photos of Sala embracing a man whose face had been gouged out by someone\u2019s \u2013 presumably my grandmother\u2019s \u2013 fingernail; Photos of a man I\u2019d never seen before with round spectacles. In some photos he was with a group of other men, standing in or next to a cabin; A letter in French saying that \u201cla famille Glass\u201d was hiding in Paris under an assumed name; Letters between the Glasses spanning over half a century; Photos of Alex Maguy with Pablo Picasso; A sketch of a man holding a gun to his head that was signed, \u201cAvec amiti\u00e9, Picasso.\u201d For the next 13 years, I followed these clues, often feeling like Casaubon in Middlemarch, the silly fool who embarks on an impossible book project that he never finishes. Originally I planned to write just about my grandmother, not her brothers, but it quickly became clear that this was impossible: their lives were completely entwined. Also, Alex, Henri and the third brother, Jacques \u2013 the man in the round glasses whom I had never met \u2013 each had extraordinary and strikingly different stories, and I couldn\u2019t let them fade away, like old photos in the back of a closet. I learned that Henri invented a machine that microfilmed and shrunk down documents, and that during the war he had travelled in secret all over France with his machine, saving public and private archives from Vichy and Nazi forces. After the war, Henri\u2019s microfilms helped to rebuild towns and ports. Multiple times, he was nearly arrested and saved only by the fake ID card Sonia got for him on the black market, which said he was a Catholic named Henri Classe. After the war, this machine would make him enormously wealthy. Sonia, who stayed hidden in Paris during the war, was in even worse danger; although her German was good, it\u2019s not easy for a firecracker to stay in the shadows. She moved out of her and Henri\u2019s apartment in central Paris and rented one under a false name by the Bois de Vincennes. But her former neighbours frequently pinned denunciation letters to her door, attempting to turn her in to the Gestapo. Sonia would rip them off and, in one case, posted a note to my grandmother in the US, to let her know what was happening. Jacques, the brother I never met, was arrested in 1942 and sent to Pithiviers, a French concentration camp. He also posted my grandmother memorabilia to keep her updated, in this case, photos of himself and his fellow prisoners. Incredibly, he was allowed out for a day to visit his newborn daughter. Henri and Alex met him by his wife\u2019s bed and begged him to go into hiding, saying they would help him. But Jacques refused, because he had given his word to the prison guards. So he went back and soon after was shipped out \u2013 on the same train as Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky, author of Suite Fran\u00e7aise \u2013 to Auschwitz, where he was killed. By far the most time-consuming brother to research was Alex. The files on him, which were scattered across France in various archives, were so fat they took me years to go through. Originally a couturier, whose closest friend in the business was Christian Dior, Alex joined the Foreign Legion as soon as war was declared, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery in combat. But when France fell to the Germans, he was arrested and put on a train to the camps \u2013 which he escaped by climbing out through the roof and jumping off. Alex spent the rest of the war hiding in a farmhouse in central France \u2013 which I eventually found \u2013 while working for the resistance. Afterwards, he switched careers from fashion to art and was a celebrated gallerist in Paris. Picasso drew the poster for one of his most important exhibitions and the two men became close friends, initially because the artist so admired Alex\u2019s wartime record. Henri, Jacques and Alex led lives of masculine adventure, which were recorded in official archives. My grandmother, on the other hand, spent the war as a housewife in Long Island. She represented the quiet feminine: domestic, private \u2013 what George Eliot described as \u201ca hidden life\u201d, one of \u201cunrecorded acts\u201d, filled not with adventure but emotional drama, and that is not something I would find in an archive. Instead, I needed to talk to those who knew her best, and that meant her sons \u2013 my father Ronald, and my uncle Rich. I dreaded hurting them by asking difficult questions, but it turned out that what had hurt them most was feeling they had to keep these stories to themselves. Slowly, Sala\u2019s life, one she\u2019d always kept in the shadows, came into focus. *** Despite seeming like the embodiment of Frenchness to me, Sala and her brothers weren\u2019t French at all; they were Polish. They were born and raised in Chrzan\u00f3w, then famous for its large market place, but better known today for being only 20km from Auschwitz, so close that the towns considered themselves to be sisters. In 1918, the pogroms began and the Glass family fled to Paris, to join their cousins, the Ornsteins. These pogroms terrified the Glasses but ultimately saved their lives, because any Jew who was still in Chrzan\u00f3w at the beginning of the second world war was killed. The siblings fell in love with Paris: its beauty, its sense of style and, of course, its safety, which was to prove all too transitory. Henri and Sala made themselves over to be as French as possible, and with the enthusiasm of converts, lost their Polish accents and dressed in the most Parisian of clothes, which Alex made for them. All of them worked in the fashion business \u2013 or \u201cschmatte\u201d trade, to use the Yiddish term. Fashion \u2013 like the movie industry today \u2013 was then considered a Jewish industry, specifically a Jewish immigrant industry. Partly this was a practical issue: in contrast to many other professions at the time, there were no quota limits on how many Jews could work in it. On a more emotional level, fashion (like art, another profession that was then heavily Jewish) is an industry that celebrates beauty. It is not surprising that Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who had experienced so much ugliness in their lives, might crave a corrective. Alex and Jacques ran a tailoring shop in the Marais, the then Jewish quarter in Paris, and Sala, a talented artist, made patterns for mass-produced clothing: swirling, psychedelic drawings filled with colour, excitement and happiness. At 25, she was independent, living in a city she loved, with a family she adored, and was engaged to a young man \u2013 a dentist and socialist \u2013 with whom she was deeply in love. And then in February 1937, it was all taken away from her. One night, Alex brought an American man over to Sala\u2019s apartment for dinner. He was, Alex told her, a millionaire from Manhattan. Suddenly over dinner, the American man, who had been staring at Sala since he arrived, reached across the table and told her he\u2019d fallen in love with her at first sight. Marry me, he begged, come with me to America. Sala laughed this off, but after the American left, Alex \u2013 who closely followed what was happening in Germany \u2013 told her she had to do it, because staying in Paris was a death sentence. This guy was rich and a good friend, Alex said; she\u2019d never get a better offer. To Sala\u2019s horror, Henri agreed, and so, in what must have been a state of shock, in June 1937, Sala sailed to New York, to marry a man she didn\u2019t know, leaving behind everything she loved. When she arrived and her beaming husband-to-be drove her to her new home, she realised some things pretty quickly: this man was not a millionaire, he did not live in Manhattan, and he did not work in the fashion business. He didn\u2019t even really know Alex. He ran a gas station out on Long Island and he just happened to meet Alex one day while on holiday in France. Alex, banking on my grandmother\u2019s beauty to woo this man, had then lied to her in the hope of getting her out of Europe. This is how my grandparents met. My grandfather Bill loved Sala very deeply, and would do so for the rest of his life. But while she appreciated him as a good man and a good husband, she didn\u2019t love him the same way, and this hurt him. She was miserable in his small town and complained often, to his astonishment. Hadn\u2019t he saved her from the Nazis? She was a lot less grateful than he\u2019d expected. She was no longer making the art she loved; instead, she was a housewife and dependent on a man she barely knew. The fights started soon after they married. She was all alone in this strange place, and once the war started, she spent years not knowing whether her family was alive or dead. By the end of the war, she was the mother of two sons. There was no way she could survive as a single mother in Paris, a city emotionally and economically destroyed by the war. So she resolved to wait until Bill died, when she could return to France. The grandmother I met 40 years later was someone who was still waiting for her life to begin. Sala endured a specifically female tragedy: she gave up her true love, her dreams and professional fulfilment for protection by marriage with someone she did not love. Alex got a medal for going to war, but no one was going to give her plaudits for what she did. On the contrary, this kind of self-sacrifice was so expected of women that, in the eyes of those around her, it would have been extraordinary if she had refused to do it. The story of my grandmother confused people, especially Jewish Americans, who understandably assume that any story about escaping the war to the US is a happy one. But individual lives are more complicated than great sweeps of history, and while Sala was alone and frustrated in America, Alex and Henri went on to live gloriously successful lives in France. Sala had done what she had to in order to survive, but in saving herself she lost everything that had made her life worth living. Other things took their place \u2013 her children, eventually her grandchildren \u2013 and she was demonstratively affectionate to them, naturally loving, but also desperate to justify to herself the path her life had taken. If she loved them enough, if they loved her enough, then maybe it would have been worth it. This is the need I sensed in her as a child, but was too young to understand. Sala never saw her former fiance again; he almost certainly died in the war. She also never lived in France again. Thwarting his wife to the very end, Bill lived into his 90s, and just as he started to decline, Sala had a massive stroke that stilled both her body and her tongue. At Bill\u2019s funeral, people remarked on how affecting it was to see her in her wheelchair, crying silently as she looked at her husband\u2019s coffin. But she wasn\u2019t sad that Bill had died. She was sad that the day she had waited for had finally come, and it didn\u2019t matter any more. All those fantasies of living in Paris, of travelling to Israel: all gone. Two years later, she died in a US hospital, far from the place she still thought of as home, 60 years after leaving it. *** Once the Glass siblings died, my extended family drifted apart. None of us were good at staying in touch, and we\u2019d all got the same message from the Glasses: that the past should be pushed away and not discussed. So didn\u2019t that include our own families? But as perhaps Jews know better than most, you can never entirely escape your past. Once I finally started to slough off the anorexia that had blanketed my teens and 20s, I realised there was some kernel in me, one that I could neither explain nor understand, that meant I wanted to work in fashion. Like the Glasses I, too, wanted to see beauty. After finishing university, I lived in Paris and started working as a freelance fashion journalist. This eventually translated into the job on the Guardian\u2019s fashion desk, where I was to stay for eight years. One of my favourite parts of the job was covering the shows and one day, when I was at the Dior show in Paris, I felt a hand on my shoulder. \u201cAren\u2019t you my cousin?\u201d asked a handsome man. It was Alexandre de Betak, Henri and Sonia\u2019s grandson. He worked then \u2013 and still does \u2013 as a fashion show producer, collaborating with brands such as Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent. But probably his most enduring relationship has been with Dior, whose shows he has worked on for years, just as Alex Maguy\u2019s strongest relationship in France was with Dior himself. Neither De Betak nor I knew of this connection until I started researching this book. Soon after that, I met another cousin, Philippe Ornstein, the grandson of one of the Glasses\u2019 cousins, Maurice Ornstein, who was killed in the war. Philippe and I also found each other through fashion: he was then working as a fashion publicist, and when we met it felt as if we had grown up together. For decades, I ran away from this story, researching it with my right hand and fearfully covering my eyes with my left. I told myself that it was self-indulgent to write my family history \u2013 who would be interested in reading about Grandma? But the truth is, I just found it too painful to leave alone, picking at it like a scab. Even before I knew the details of Sala\u2019s story, I\u2019ve always known that I would not exist if the Holocaust hadn\u2019t happened \u2013 because then Sala would never have come to America. For a long time, this added another dimension to my well-established sense of Jewish guilt: that I was alive only because of the suffering of other people, and one person in particular \u2013 my grandmother. But Sala would not have seen it that way. In her eyes, we were not the compensation for what she had left behind but the explanation for it. I had avoided her sadness when she was alive, but two decades after her death it still felt so palpable to me that my research took up an entire bookshelf \u2013 and still, I couldn\u2019t bear to write the story. Then in January 2018, I sat down and did just that. It is probably no coincidence that I finally committed in the shadow of the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump\u2019s election. Neither of these political shifts were about keeping out the Jews, but they were about keeping out immigrants, and the story of the Glasses was one of immigration, from Poland to France, and France to America. Alongside that, antisemitism was on the rise throughout Europe in a way I never thought I\u2019d see in my lifetime, on both the right and the left. A 2018 survey found that one in five Europeans believe Jews have \u201ctoo much influence in the media and politics\u201d. In France, antisemitic acts rose by 74% between 2017-2018. As I was writing, furious arguments raged across British politics about antisemitism, particularly within the Labour party, where non-Jews on the left suddenly felt very comfortable telling Jews that they knew better what is and isn\u2019t antisemitic. At the same time, reports of antisemitic acts in Britain rose every year as I worked on the book, culminating in 2019 with 1,805 incidents, the highest number in 35 years. Meanwhile, 41% of Americans now don\u2019t even know what Auschwitz is. Reading these news stories quashed any concerns I had that writing about the past, or my family, was self-indulgent. But my obsession with this story had little to do with political prescience on my part. Instead, it was because of the people involved, each one such an extraordinary force of personality that I couldn\u2019t shake them off decades after they died. Sala had longed to move back to Europe, to be with her family, to have lunches in Paris with them, to go to the fashion shows, to live the life of her choosing. She never got to do that \u2013 but I do. Because she gave up everything, I get to live her dream. I think of her every time I walk along the Boulevard Saint-Germain; when meeting one of my cousins for lunch in the Marais; when I go to a fashion show. I think of all the Glasses every time my train pulls into the Gare du Nord \u2013 how they arrived in Paris from Poland by train a century ago, knowing no one and owning less. How far they went in their lives; how politics and fate tore them apart. And I think of how we all came back together, in the end. \u2022 House Of Glass by Hadley Freeman is published by Harper Collins (\u00a316.99).

Well, I reckon Waititi has kiboshed this question once and for all because this is a celebrity cause we should all get behind. Because I, too, have a dream. It\u2019s that one day I will be able to use a laptop without giving myself sciatica.</p> <p>Like Waititi, I have hideous shoulder \u2013 and back, and neck \u2013 problems and when they first arose two years ago, I assumed I could blame my kids (another thing to add to the list). But no, it turned out that my job was at fault, according to the doctors I saw, who pointed squarely at my tiny laptop. (I won\u2019t, for legal reasons, name the brand. Let\u2019s just say Waititi and I think very much alike on this issue.) Hunching over this stupid keyboard gave me a slipped disc, which in turn gave me a pinched nerve. The all-consuming pain reached its mind-melding peak on my last research trip for my book. (Have I mentioned that I\u2019ve written a book? You can read about it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/22/grandmother-sadness-story-hadley-freeman\">here</a>!) Alas, my trip was to Auschwitz and so, while my nerves shrieked with raw pain, I walked around this monument to death and all I could think was, \u201cTruly, no one has ever suffered as much as me.\u201d (I don\u2019t accept twee movies about the Holocaust, but I\u2019m apparently fine with dumb jokes about it.)</p> <p>I went home, had a steroid shot, which helped a bit, and swapped the tiny laptop for a chunky PC, which helped a lot more, and was able to finish the book. But still I hunch over my phone like a velociraptor, giving myself the dreaded \u201ctext neck\u201d, and I start to feel the pain incoming.</p> <p>What are we doing to ourselves? What are we allowing to be done to us? We were designed to stand up straight, look forward and hunt (yes, for animals: sorry, Joaquin), not scrunch ourselves around these stupid, tiny, silver rectangles. So although I cannot support Waititi\u2019s movie, I will storm the ramparts for his cause. Metaphorically, I mean. Storming is just terrible for my back these days.</p>",

Well, I reckon Waititi has kiboshed this question once and for all because this is a celebrity cause we should all get behind. Because I, too, have a dream. It\u2019s that one day I will be able to use a laptop without giving myself sciatica. Like Waititi, I have hideous shoulder \u2013 and back, and neck \u2013 problems and when they first arose two years ago, I assumed I could blame my kids (another thing to add to the list). But no, it turned out that my job was at fault, according to the doctors I saw, who pointed squarely at my tiny laptop. (I won\u2019t, for legal reasons, name the brand. Let\u2019s just say Waititi and I think very much alike on this issue.) Hunching over this stupid keyboard gave me a slipped disc, which in turn gave me a pinched nerve. The all-consuming pain reached its mind-melding peak on my last research trip for my book. (Have I mentioned that I\u2019ve written a book? You can read about it here!) Alas, my trip was to Auschwitz and so, while my nerves shrieked with raw pain, I walked around this monument to death and all I could think was, \u201cTruly, no one has ever suffered as much as me.\u201d (I don\u2019t accept twee movies about the Holocaust, but I\u2019m apparently fine with dumb jokes about it.) I went home, had a steroid shot, which helped a bit, and swapped the tiny laptop for a chunky PC, which helped a lot more, and was able to finish the book. But still I hunch over my phone like a velociraptor, giving myself the dreaded \u201ctext neck\u201d, and I start to feel the pain incoming. What are we doing to ourselves? What are we allowing to be done to us? We were designed to stand up straight, look forward and hunt (yes, for animals: sorry, Joaquin), not scrunch ourselves around these stupid, tiny, silver rectangles. So although I cannot support Waititi\u2019s movie, I will storm the ramparts for his cause. Metaphorically, I mean. Storming is just terrible for my back these days.",

      "body": "<p>I was not at all surprised to hear Andy Farrell talking about the importance of \u201cIrishness\u201d this week. It is something I picked up on before the start of the tournament when Farrell was repeatedly talking about how Ireland had to stand for something. In other words what was their raison d\u2019etre? International rugby is so congested at the top. On any given day, anyone is capable of beating anyone else and the Six Nations is even tighter. I genuinely believe that in international rugby it is no longer enough just to want to win. You have to have a reason. We saw it in the World Cup with South Africa. It was obvious what the Springboks stood for. They were all about fighting for hope and change in South Africa and that was far more powerful than that of their rivals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/bono-andy-farrell-ireland-the-edge-england-six-nations\">Bono drops in to help give Andy Farrell's Ireland the edge against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farrell is now trying to work out Ireland\u2019s reason for being and there are parallels with when Eddie Jones took over England. Before the 2016 Six Nations Jones spoke of the need to get back to the strong English tradition of having a good set piece. He had come in after a disastrous World Cup campaign but rather than make wholesale changes in personnel he kept largely the same group of players but set about altering the mindset. Granted, Farrell was already part of the setup under Joe Schmidt, and Ireland\u2019s World Cup campaign was disappointing rather than disastrous, but he is doing the same kind of thing with largely the same group of players. Like Jones, Farrell has already set about bringing external voices into the group. Training camps can be very insular places so the benefit of having people like Bono or Paul O\u2019Connell in Ireland\u2019s case, or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or Dave Brailsford for England, is huge.</p> <p>We have heard from a number of Ireland players lamenting how regimented things were under Schmidt, how that affected them during the World Cup and how, under Farrell, things have already changed for the better. I think it\u2019s a tough balance, though. Let\u2019s not forget how impressive Ireland were during 2018. They could not sustain it for another year, as numerous postmortems have shown, but in part is that not up to the players? It is like how we often talk about England needing to get to half-time to adapt and turn things around. It is no use Ireland players \u2013 and players with a lot of caps and a lot of experience \u2013 getting to the end of a World Cup and then complaining. The best and the most successful teams have enough player power to implement changes needed in the middle of the storm, not at the end of it.</p> <p>Farrell will know that but I\u2019m sure he has listened to the feedback from the players and it was interesting to hear him acknowledge this week how he thought Ireland had dropped off from 2018 in terms of physicality.</p> <p>One would suspect Schmidt realised that, as demonstrated by his decision not to take Devin Toner to the World Cup and pick Jean Kleyn instead.

      "bodyText": "I was not at all surprised to hear Andy Farrell talking about the importance of \u201cIrishness\u201d this week. It is something I picked up on before the start of the tournament when Farrell was repeatedly talking about how Ireland had to stand for something. In other words what was their raison d\u2019etre? International rugby is so congested at the top. On any given day, anyone is capable of beating anyone else and the Six Nations is even tighter. I genuinely believe that in international rugby it is no longer enough just to want to win. You have to have a reason. We saw it in the World Cup with South Africa. It was obvious what the Springboks stood for. They were all about fighting for hope and change in South Africa and that was far more powerful than that of their rivals. Farrell is now trying to work out Ireland\u2019s reason for being and there are parallels with when Eddie Jones took over England. Before the 2016 Six Nations Jones spoke of the need to get back to the strong English tradition of having a good set piece. He had come in after a disastrous World Cup campaign but rather than make wholesale changes in personnel he kept largely the same group of players but set about altering the mindset. Granted, Farrell was already part of the setup under Joe Schmidt, and Ireland\u2019s World Cup campaign was disappointing rather than disastrous, but he is doing the same kind of thing with largely the same group of players. Like Jones, Farrell has already set about bringing external voices into the group. Training camps can be very insular places so the benefit of having people like Bono or Paul O\u2019Connell in Ireland\u2019s case, or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or Dave Brailsford for England, is huge. We have heard from a number of Ireland players lamenting how regimented things were under Schmidt, how that affected them during the World Cup and how, under Farrell, things have already changed for the better. I think it\u2019s a tough balance, though. Let\u2019s not forget how impressive Ireland were during 2018. They could not sustain it for another year, as numerous postmortems have shown, but in part is that not up to the players? It is like how we often talk about England needing to get to half-time to adapt and turn things around. It is no use Ireland players \u2013 and players with a lot of caps and a lot of experience \u2013 getting to the end of a World Cup and then complaining. The best and the most successful teams have enough player power to implement changes needed in the middle of the storm, not at the end of it. Farrell will know that but I\u2019m sure he has listened to the feedback from the players and it was interesting to hear him acknowledge this week how he thought Ireland had dropped off from 2018 in terms of physicality. One would suspect Schmidt realised that, as demonstrated by his decision not to take Devin Toner to the World Cup and pick Jean Kleyn instead. Toner has come straight back in but the early signs of Ireland\u2019s first two matches are good in terms of reaching those levels of physicality. I look back to Ireland\u2019s win at Twickenham two years ago and the things that stood out were their fantastic set piece, their ball retention, their creativity and how utterly belligerent they were in sticking to a gameplan. At the moment I think we\u2019re seeing those traits but in addition a bit more variation in what they are doing in the opposition\u2019s 22. There seems an added layer of subtlety to their attack.

      "body": "<p>About 15 years ago, Hilary Mantel got on a plane to Russia, on a cultural visit to Perm, near the Ural mountains. I was part of the group. As we readied ourselves for the flight, she explained that she\u2019d be quiet for the next few hours; she was planning to immerse herself in a new project. It was, she explained, set in Tudor England, at the time of the great break with Rome, and featured both Henry VIII and his notorious chief adviser, Thomas Cromwell. And so if we would excuse her, she had lots to do.</p> <p>Now, here we are, in the author\u2019s home in the genteel Devon seaside town of Budleigh Salterton, with more than 1.5m copies of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/wolf-hall-hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Wolf Hall</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/13/bring-up-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">Bring Up the Bodies</a></em> sold and the conclusion of her epic trilogy, <em>The Mirror &amp; the Light</em>, sending pre-orders through the roof.

In her hands, Cromwell is a shape-shifter: the brutalised boy who disappears into the cosmopolitan whirl of continental Europe and returns to work his way to the heart of the Tudor court. And the books that tell his story are, she tells me, \u201cabout all the big important things that matter, about sex and power and high politics, statecraft and forgery and delusion and lies\u201d.</p> <p>Mantel had the idea for <em>Wolf Hall</em> before she was ever published. \u201cAs soon as I started writing, I knew this was what I\u2019d been working towards,\u201d she says, \u201cthat confidence right at the beginning of having arrived where I should be.\u201d But surely having written 10 novels, including <em>A Place of Greater Safety</em>, her vivid exploration of the French Revolution, and <em>Beyond Black</em>, the tale of mediums in middle England that immediately preceded <em>Wolf Hall</em>, she had experienced that feeling before?</p> <p>\u201cNot the absolute rightness, the congruence, between author and subject, that I felt with the first paragraphs of <em>Wolf Hall</em>,\u201d she says. Later, when we are drinking tea and looking out over the horizon, she says that starting the trilogy was \u201clike at last delivering what\u2019s within you \u2026 an enormous shout from a mountaintop\u201d. This is not to disavow her previous books, though she is shrewdly droll about her status in the world of publishing. \u201cI had reasonably healthy sales with Beyond Black and that was for the first time. I\u2019d had good reviews always, but no sales. And I felt very much like a niche product, you know, very much a minority interest.\u201d</p> <p>Mantel has always had a canny understanding of the business of writing. <em>A Place of Greater Safety</em> was the first novel she wrote: \u201cI just thought of myself as a historical novelist, and I thought, do the French Revolution, and then do Thomas Cromwell. And then I couldn\u2019t get that first novel published, so I started writing contemporary fiction. And then I learned that I wasn\u2019t just a historical novelist. But it was there, all the time.\u201d Those early novels, beginning with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/17/-sp-hilary-mantel-profile-adaptation-wolf-hall\" title=\"\">Every Day Is Mother\u2019s Day</a></em> in 1985, and looping through <em>Vacant Possession</em>, <em>Eight Months on Ghazzah Street</em>, in which she drew on time spent living in Saudi Arabia, and <em>An Experiment in Love</em>, explored among other things the troublesome double-binds in which women frequently find themselves. Those narratives\u2019 vexed interest in the desire for personal freedom and self-creation, and their preoccupation with class and circumstance, is clearly related to the fascination she has for Cromwell.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a tragedy like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/12/othello-rsc-stratford-hugh-quarshie-lucian-msamati-joanna-vanderham\" title=\"\">Othello</a></em>,\u201d she says, \u201cthere used to be all that lit crit stuff about his fatal flaw and so on. And now we can see his problem is he\u2019s black. Structurally, there\u2019s a built-in decisive disadvantage. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of person he is and what decisions he makes. And I think with Cromwell, you\u2019ve got the equivalent that he\u2019s starting out from the wrong place. So what he does achieve every day seems like spitting in the eye of the pattern laid down. You have to understand, the 16th century is a time when ambition was a dirty word, because it was like being cheeky to God.\u201d</p> <p>In Tudor England, it wouldn\u2019t just have been the nobles who wanted low-born Cromwell to know his place, she says, but the general populace as well. \u201cThey were saying we don\u2019t want to be ruled by people like that, we want to be ruled by the nobs, the equivalent of Old Etonians, Jacob Rees-Mogg.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd1f702b207d66713c8ed041b701a041862a0a5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd1f702b207d66713c8ed041b701a041862a0a5b/431_171_2162_2702/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Company Productions Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mantel was fascinated to find in her research that the idea of the English that we associate with the stiff-upper-lip cliches of the Victorian era were far from the way 16th-century Europeans viewed them. \u201cThey thought the English were kind of berserkers: first of all, they spoke a barbarous language that no one could understand; and then they were really impious and they were extremely violent. So it was like a nation full of old-style football hooligans.\u201d She also became convinced that, at the time of the break with Rome, one of <em>Wolf Hall</em>\u2019s chief characters, Cardinal Wolsey, was determined to move England closer to Europe and to enhance its power; Cromwell himself saw the schism as a way to broker an alliance with Germany and Scandinavia that would reconfigure the whole power structure of Europe. \u201cSo that\u2019s a kind of picture of Europe with which we\u2019re terribly unfamiliar and yet it could have happened.\u201d</p> <p>It is clear from the way Mantel talks about Wolsey and Cromwell the emotional connection she feels with them. \u201cI love Wolsey,\u201d she laughs, \u201cbecause he enjoyed it all so much. I know all the reasons for thinking badly of him but I can never be quite persuaded. And I absolutely understand why you\u2019d be englamoured by him. And also he seems to me to have been a man with a heart and I can quite understand Cromwell\u2019s long loyalty to him.\u201d As for Cromwell, it is the sheer chutzpah of his self-invention that appeals. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m really exploring is the universal question of what\u2019s luck? What\u2019s fate? Does anybody make their own luck? How far can you write your own story? And he\u2019s someone whose whole career ought not to be possible. But at some point in early middle age, he just grabs the pen and starts writing it.\u201d</p> <p>It is, perhaps, an experience to which Mantel relates. Her memoir<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\" title=\"\">Giving Up the Ghost</a></em> tells the story of a fractured upbringing in Derbyshire (\u201cMy childhood ended so, in the autumn of 1963; the past and the future equally obscured by the smoke from my mother\u2019s burning boats\u201d, she writes of her parents\u2019 split and her mother\u2019s remarriage) and an emergence into adulthood marred by serious illness, ignored, disbelieved and misdiagnosed. For severe endometriosis, she was prescribed anti-psychotics; at 27, she describes \u201chaving my fertility confiscated and my insides rearranged\u201d. One doctor, for reasons unexplained, but with more energy to his statement \u201cthan any I had heard him make\u201d, told her not to write. Racked with pain and filled with drugs, her body swelled; and periods of severe and debilitating ill health have recurred throughout her life, as chronicled in her 2010 hospital diary, <em>Ink in t</em><em>he Blood</em>.</p> <p>Along with pain and physical disintegration, ghosts stalk her work. \u201cI do have the sense of it being a very proximate world,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes the barrier seems like an enormous stone wall and sometimes it\u2019s just whisper thin. But you can be misunderstood in talking about it. Because none of it can be literal. It\u2019s all just a series of metaphors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0857e4fc68a561d5f8ff69cc9c24a7eb7277f382\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0857e4fc68a561d5f8ff69cc9c24a7eb7277f382/0_115_3800_2281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mantel wins the 2012 Man Booker prize for Bring Up the Bodies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mantel wins the 2012 Man Booker prize for <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em>Giving Up the Ghost</em>, Mantel interrogates the question of whether she should be writing about herself at all. \u201cI suppose the topic of censorship and self-censorship has always loomed very large for me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat are you allowed to say and who is allowed to say what? And I have taken these books as a kind of project of territorial expansion because they\u2019re right on the central ground of Englishness. Which, as I said in the memoir, I didn\u2019t feel I possessed. I wondered where was this England? Because it didn\u2019t seem to be where I was growing up.\u201d</p> <p>She describes Cromwell as a man who rises without trace, and who imparts animating energy to everything he touches. Mantel, too, combines a certain fragility with a distinct pugnaciousness. Between <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em> and <em>The Mirror &amp; the Light</em>, she published a collection of short stories, <em>The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher</em>; in the title piece, she imagined a woman whose flat is infiltrated by a man determined to kill the politician for the wrongs she has visited on Ireland. It caused, perhaps predictably, so much outrage that Mantel felt \u201cthat we\u2019d taken off into the territory of farce when people were suggesting that the police be brought in over the fictional killing of a dead woman\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It will be offensive on a scale like they\u2019ve never seen. I shall be absolutely revelling in my capacity to give offence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, she says, she\u2019d like to turn the story into a stage play; despite her workload, she\u2019s got \u201ca big box of material\u201d. Is she worried about poking the sleeping bear? She bursts out laughing. \u201cIt will be offensive on a scale like they\u2019ve never seen. I shall be absolutely revelling in my capacity to give offence. So whether it will come to fruition or not, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by those people.\u201d</p> <p>In a speech in 2013, Mantel referred to Kate Middleton, by then the Duchess of Cambridge, as \u201ca jointed doll on which certain rags are hung\u201d; a woman whose primary purpose was to provide the heir apparent with heirs of his own. Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron voiced their disapproval but, \u201cif anything,\u201d she says now, \u201cI think my plea was to consider, these are human beings. I\u2019m on her side, not one of her persecutors.\u201d With the royal family yet again in crisis, she connects the current obsession with royal bodies to the themes she\u2019s probing in <em>The Mirror </em><em>&amp; the Light</em>: \u201cWhat is a king? Is he a sort of super-being? Or is he a kind of beast? Does he even rise to the status of human? And all this is explored through Henry\u2019s body. So it\u2019s very much a theme I\u2019ve been conscious of continually. And, of course, it was completely misunderstood by numbskulls.\u201d</p> <p>Mantel\u2019s husband Gerald, a geologist who now manages the many moving parts of his wife\u2019s working life, is ready to drive me to the station. We speak, finally, of the pleasure and opportunities that working on the stage and TV adaptations of <em>Wolf Hall </em>and <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em> have given her. \u201cYou can reach a point in your career as a writer, mid-career or a little bit beyond that, where actually you\u2019ve got good at doing something so you just do it. Sometimes you need to refresh your practice. I think that\u2019s what the plays did for me. It was the boost I needed to rethink the possibilities of how to work.\u201d</p> <p>At 67, she knows that she won\u2019t tackle another project on the scale of the Tudor trilogy (\u201cit\u2019s just maths, really\u201d). But while she\u2019s been writing it, there are other projects she\u2019s put on hold, \u201call put away in notebooks and if I had the energy and concentration and the will, I could pull half a dozen books out of the cupboard, like the conjuror pulling handkerchiefs.\u201d At other moments, she thinks, \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, what she\u2019d really like is a fortnight off. \u201cOr better still, a month. Just think of it. I could remake myself. And I would then be ready to go with all sorts of things. I\u2019ve always known, even with my physical health, that it takes very little time for me to be sorted out and on the go again. I\u2019m very sort of bouncy in that way.\u201d Is there much point of winning two Booker prizes if you can\u2019t have a month off? \u201cWell,\u201d she says, thoughtfully, \u201cit\u2019s a good question isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> Hilary Mantel will discuss The Mirror &amp; the Light (4th Estate) at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 6 March. <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/141053-hilary-mantel-mirror-and-light-2020?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9MvGkOTY5wIVGeDtCh1lTwHREAAYASAAEgLbm_D_BwE\" title=\"\">southbankcentre.co.uk</a></em></p>",

What\u2019s fate? Does anybody make their own luck? How far can you write your own story? And he\u2019s someone whose whole career ought not to be possible. But at some point in early middle age, he just grabs the pen and starts writing it.\u201d It is, perhaps, an experience to which Mantel relates. Her memoir Giving Up the Ghost tells the story of a fractured upbringing in Derbyshire (\u201cMy childhood ended so, in the autumn of 1963; the past and the future equally obscured by the smoke from my mother\u2019s burning boats\u201d, she writes of her parents\u2019 split and her mother\u2019s remarriage) and an emergence into adulthood marred by serious illness, ignored, disbelieved and misdiagnosed. For severe endometriosis, she was prescribed anti-psychotics; at 27, she describes \u201chaving my fertility confiscated and my insides rearranged\u201d. One doctor, for reasons unexplained, but with more energy to his statement \u201cthan any I had heard him make\u201d, told her not to write. Racked with pain and filled with drugs, her body swelled; and periods of severe and debilitating ill health have recurred throughout her life, as chronicled in her 2010 hospital diary, Ink in the Blood. Along with pain and physical disintegration, ghosts stalk her work. \u201cI do have the sense of it being a very proximate world,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes the barrier seems like an enormous stone wall and sometimes it\u2019s just whisper thin. But you can be misunderstood in talking about it. Because none of it can be literal. It\u2019s all just a series of metaphors.\u201d In Giving Up the Ghost, Mantel interrogates the question of whether she should be writing about herself at all. \u201cI suppose the topic of censorship and self-censorship has always loomed very large for me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat are you allowed to say and who is allowed to say what? And I have taken these books as a kind of project of territorial expansion because they\u2019re right on the central ground of Englishness. Which, as I said in the memoir, I didn\u2019t feel I possessed. I wondered where was this England? Because it didn\u2019t seem to be where I was growing up.\u201d She describes Cromwell as a man who rises without trace, and who imparts animating energy to everything he touches. Mantel, too, combines a certain fragility with a distinct pugnaciousness. Between Bring Up the Bodies and The Mirror &amp; the Light, she published a collection of short stories, The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher; in the title piece, she imagined a woman whose flat is infiltrated by a man determined to kill the politician for the wrongs she has visited on Ireland. It caused, perhaps predictably, so much outrage that Mantel felt \u201cthat we\u2019d taken off into the territory of farce when people were suggesting that the police be brought in over the fictional killing of a dead woman\u201d. Now, she says, she\u2019d like to turn the story into a stage play; despite her workload, she\u2019s got \u201ca big box of material\u201d. Is she worried about poking the sleeping bear? She bursts out laughing. \u201cIt will be offensive on a scale like they\u2019ve never seen. I shall be absolutely revelling in my capacity to give offence. So whether it will come to fruition or not, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by those people.\u201d In a speech in 2013, Mantel referred to Kate Middleton, by then the Duchess of Cambridge, as \u201ca jointed doll on which certain rags are hung\u201d; a woman whose primary purpose was to provide the heir apparent with heirs of his own. Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron voiced their disapproval but, \u201cif anything,\u201d she says now, \u201cI think my plea was to consider, these are human beings. I\u2019m on her side, not one of her persecutors.\u201d With the royal family yet again in crisis, she connects the current obsession with royal bodies to the themes she\u2019s probing in The Mirror &amp; the Light: \u201cWhat is a king? Is he a sort of super-being? Or is he a kind of beast? Does he even rise to the status of human? And all this is explored through Henry\u2019s body. So it\u2019s very much a theme I\u2019ve been conscious of continually. And, of course, it was completely misunderstood by numbskulls.\u201d Mantel\u2019s husband Gerald, a geologist who now manages the many moving parts of his wife\u2019s working life, is ready to drive me to the station. We speak, finally, of the pleasure and opportunities that working on the stage and TV adaptations of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies have given her. \u201cYou can reach a point in your career as a writer, mid-career or a little bit beyond that, where actually you\u2019ve got good at doing something so you just do it. Sometimes you need to refresh your practice. I think that\u2019s what the plays did for me. It was the boost I needed to rethink the possibilities of how to work.\u201d At 67, she knows that she won\u2019t tackle another project on the scale of the Tudor trilogy (\u201cit\u2019s just maths, really\u201d). But while she\u2019s been writing it, there are other projects she\u2019s put on hold, \u201call put away in notebooks and if I had the energy and concentration and the will, I could pull half a dozen books out of the cupboard, like the conjuror pulling handkerchiefs.\u201d At other moments, she thinks, \u201cAre you mad?\u201d In the meantime, what she\u2019d really like is a fortnight off. \u201cOr better still, a month. Just think of it. I could remake myself. And I would then be ready to go with all sorts of things. I\u2019ve always known, even with my physical health, that it takes very little time for me to be sorted out and on the go again. I\u2019m very sort of bouncy in that way.\u201d Is there much point of winning two Booker prizes if you can\u2019t have a month off? \u201cWell,\u201d she says, thoughtfully, \u201cit\u2019s a good question isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u2022 Hilary Mantel will discuss The Mirror &amp; the Light (4th Estate) at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 6 March. southbankcentre.co.uk",

When the Tories took power in 1979, these were \u201cthe two inner-city areas of greatest need\u201d, according to his 1987 book, Where There\u2019s a Will. Both had miles of derelict docks, populations that had been shrinking for decades and great difficulty attracting investment. Liverpool had also seen intense riots in 1981 \u2013 to the deep alarm of the government.</p> <p>The Labour governments of the previous two decades had understood but largely failed to reverse this downward spiral \u2013 just like New Labour more recently in the \u201cleft behind\u201d areas of the north and the Midlands. Hopes that a Tory government would do better \u2013 let alone one led by Thatcher \u2013 were not high.</p> <p>Yet like Johnson now, Thatcher needed to demonstrate quickly to voters that the national revival she\u2019d promised was actually happening, so she gave Heseltine almost free rein. He visited Liverpool constantly, listened carefully to local people, bullied Whitehall and business into providing funding for the city, and helped drive through showy regeneration projects, including the redevelopment of the Victorian Albert Dock complex, and an ambitious garden festival, featuring pagodas and a light railway, held on landscaped waste ground beside the Mersey in 1984.</p> <p>Meanwhile in London, he established the Docklands Development Corporation, and used its almost unlimited powers to take over and clear the old quaysides for a new, white-collar business district. Canary Wharf was built there, the City of London expanded eastwards into it, and the whole British economy tilted further towards financial services.</p> <p>The latter shift has been a mixed blessing, nationally. And so has Canary Wharf, locally. Despite an influx of bankers since the 80s, as both workers and residents, east London still has some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/29/indices-multiple-deprivation-poverty-england\" title=\"\">capital\u2019s poorest boroughs</a>. Many of the jobs created in London Docklands have been for badly paid security guards and cleaners, tending office towers largely sealed off from the streets around them. Heseltine\u2019s Liverpool legacy has been mixed, too. He was granted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/mar/13/michael-heseltine-liverpool-freeman-margaret-thatcher\" title=\"\">freedom of the city in 2012</a> for his work. But its population continued to shrink for two decades after his initiatives, only beginning to recover in the 2000s. After 1984, the garden festival site fell back into dereliction, and much of the rest of the waterfront still awaits redevelopment. Liverpool today is a city of handsome new and restored buildings, but the overgrown spaces between them can still make its revival feel provisional.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8391105784b6a4d6c8279c9f35e36ad7c334cd5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8391105784b6a4d6c8279c9f35e36ad7c334cd5f/224_0_4658_2796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canary Wharf in London\u2019s Docklands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Many of the jobs created in London Docklands have been for badly paid security guards and cleaners, tending office towers largely sealed off from the streets around them.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The political impact of Heseltine\u2019s work was also uneven. The Conservative vote in Liverpool and east London did not increase \u2013 it fell. In 1983 the county of Merseyside had five Tory MPs, nearly a third of the total; since 1997 it has had either one or none. Similarly, north-east and south-east London had 18 Tory MPs in 1983; now there are eight. Voters in neglected places may use an election to tell politicians to pay their problems some attention, but once that\u2019s happened, other election issues often come crowding back in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/21/tories-new-right-culture-war-leftwing-economics-labour\">The Tories have evolved as the left plays the same old tune | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the Thatcher government did gain a more subtle, national benefit from its patchy regeneration programme \u2013 one that some Tories may have in mind now. Heseltine\u2019s hi-vis social conscience softened the image of what was, in essence, a harsh government. When he started his work in Liverpool in 1981, the alliance between the Liberals and the newly founded SDP, which appealed strongly to voters who felt Thatcher was too extreme, was ahead of the Tories in the polls. But as the decade went on that challenge faded. A \u201clevelling up\u201d programme of public works by the Johnson government may similarly distract centrist voters from his authoritarian and deregulatory policies.</p> <p>Either way, we shouldn\u2019t get too carried away by all the Tory talk about the north. Even after December\u2019s election, fewer than a fifth of their Commons seats are there. As usual, the majority of Tory MPs are from the south, with its unique and ancient concentration of Tory interest groups \u2013 the City of London, the most prosperous homeowners, the most famous private schools. The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may represent a northern constituency, but his CV \u2013 Winchester College, Oxford University, work in the City for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/new-chancellor-rishi-sunak-challenged-over-hedge-fund-past\" title=\"\">hedge fund</a> and Goldman Sachs \u2013 is as southern as they come.</p> <p>Countries with more equal regions, such as France and Germany, are not so dominated by a single rightwing party. Even if Johnson really is a \u201cHezza\u201d, it\u2019s hard to see the Conservatives treating the south like everywhere else.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Meanwhile in London, he established the Docklands Development Corporation, and used its almost unlimited powers to take over and clear the old quaysides for a new, white-collar business district. Canary Wharf was built there, the City of London expanded eastwards into it, and the whole British economy tilted further towards financial services. The latter shift has been a mixed blessing, nationally. And so has Canary Wharf, locally. Despite an influx of bankers since the 80s, as both workers and residents, east London still has some of the capital\u2019s poorest boroughs. Many of the jobs created in London Docklands have been for badly paid security guards and cleaners, tending office towers largely sealed off from the streets around them. Heseltine\u2019s Liverpool legacy has been mixed, too. He was granted the freedom of the city in 2012 for his work. But its population continued to shrink for two decades after his initiatives, only beginning to recover in the 2000s. After 1984, the garden festival site fell back into dereliction, and much of the rest of the waterfront still awaits redevelopment. Liverpool today is a city of handsome new and restored buildings, but the overgrown spaces between them can still make its revival feel provisional. The political impact of Heseltine\u2019s work was also uneven. The Conservative vote in Liverpool and east London did not increase \u2013 it fell. In 1983 the county of Merseyside had five Tory MPs, nearly a third of the total; since 1997 it has had either one or none. Similarly, north-east and south-east London had 18 Tory MPs in 1983; now there are eight. Voters in neglected places may use an election to tell politicians to pay their problems some attention, but once that\u2019s happened, other election issues often come crowding back in. Yet the Thatcher government did gain a more subtle, national benefit from its patchy regeneration programme \u2013 one that some Tories may have in mind now. Heseltine\u2019s hi-vis social conscience softened the image of what was, in essence, a harsh government. When he started his work in Liverpool in 1981, the alliance between the Liberals and the newly founded SDP, which appealed strongly to voters who felt Thatcher was too extreme, was ahead of the Tories in the polls. But as the decade went on that challenge faded. A \u201clevelling up\u201d programme of public works by the Johnson government may similarly distract centrist voters from his authoritarian and deregulatory policies. Either way, we shouldn\u2019t get too carried away by all the Tory talk about the north. Even after December\u2019s election, fewer than a fifth of their Commons seats are there. As usual, the majority of Tory MPs are from the south, with its unique and ancient concentration of Tory interest groups \u2013 the City of London, the most prosperous homeowners, the most famous private schools. The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may represent a northern constituency, but his CV \u2013 Winchester College, Oxford University, work in the City for a hedge fund and Goldman Sachs \u2013 is as southern as they come. Countries with more equal regions, such as France and Germany, are not so dominated by a single rightwing party. Even if Johnson really is a \u201cHezza\u201d, it\u2019s hard to see the Conservatives treating the south like everywhere else. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>There are so many Warholian moments in this superb biography that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. There is the time someone turned up to a party at the Factory dressed as a box of Brillo. Or the great man\u2019s habit of answering a routine \u201cHow are you?\u201d with a whispery \u201cI\u2019m OK but I have diarrhoea.\u201d Or the social nightmare of being invited round to watch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/apr/04/andy-warhol-films-ica-chelsea\" title=\"\">unwatchable <em>Sleep</em></a>, a home movie consisting of five hours of a naked man snoozing. How to get through the ordeal without dropping off and starting to dribble on Andy\u2019s shoulder? (Actually, this would never have happened \u2013 Warhol hated such physical contact and was capable of throwing out any guest who overstepped the mark.)</p> <p>It is a testimony to Blake Gopnik\u2019s skill that he is able to acknowledge how silly these provocations sound while simultaneously insisting on their enduring art historical significance. Dressing up as a box of Brillo may count as a stunt, but Gopnik, a veteran critic and contributor to the New York Times, sees it as the logical extension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/art\" title=\"\">Marcel Duchamp\u2019s gesture </a>50 years earlier when he exhibited a porcelain pissoir as art. Responding to someone\u2019s standard greeting with a detailed report on your bowel movements may be childish but it also pointedly disrupts the genteel discourse of a rapidly capitalising art market. The fact that today we are inclined to roll our eyes at such anecdotes is evidence not of Warhol\u2019s nullity, but of his continuing ubiquity. Whether we like it or not, we are still living in his world. This spring\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/28/andy-warhol-trans-portraits-tate-modern\" title=\"\">Warhol exhibition at Tate Modern </a>is one of the most eagerly awaited of recent years.</p> <p>All the same, it would be wrong to imply that Gopnik\u2019s book is one that Warhol might have written himself or, indeed, even liked very much. Far from being a ready-made, assembled from the detritus of the scholarly-industrial complex, <em>Warhol: A Life As Art</em> is the product of years studying 100,000 or so original documents housed in Pittsburgh\u2019s Andy Warhol Museum. The artist was a lifelong hoarder, and Gopnik\u2019s research is intricately based on a florid haul of engagement diaries, business letters, love notes, theatre tickets and tax returns. To help the reader keep their bearings through nearly 1,000 pages, each chapter starts with a handy precis along the lines of \u201cClassmates and teachers\u201d; \u201cA dose of failure\u201d; \u201cWindow dressing\u201d. It is a charmingly old-fashioned touch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"756b25ffa47c25e1094fc86f3f419e8233a807e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756b25ffa47c25e1094fc86f3f419e8233a807e8/0_189_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warhol portrait of Muhammad Ali, 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warhol portrait of Muhammad Ali, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Gopnik feels the need to supply these handholds because of the vertiginous nature of the claims he is about to make. The first, and most audacious, is that Warhol has \u201covertaken Picasso as the most important and influential artist of the 20th century\u201d, even ascending to a spot on \u201cthe top peak of Parnassus, beside Michelangelo and Rembrandt\u201d. This is big talk, but Gopnik persuasively assembles his case over the course of this mesmerising book, which is as much art history and philosophy as it is biography. For instance, rather than get caught up in the stale debate about whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/21/artsfeatures.warhol\" title=\"\">Warhol\u2019s silk-screens</a> of Marilyn, Jackie and Mao were art, design, pop, mechanical reproduction or simply a bad joke, Gopnik argues that they serve to demolish the very terms on which such a discussion rests. \u201cAt his best, Warhol didn\u2019t think outside the box,\u201d he insists; \u201che thought outside any artistic universe whose laws would allow boxes to exist \u2026 Warhol always wanted to make work for a world where X and not-X would be true at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Gopnik is also keen to dislodge the many canards about Warhol\u2019s private life. The most adhesive of these is the one about him surrounding himself with every kind of kink and freak while remaining fastidiously hors de sexual combat. Gopnik carefully rummages through the laundry basket to reveal plenty of evidence that Warhol was an enthusiastic player in the NYC gay scene from the moment he first stepped off the Greyhound bus from Pittsburgh in 1949. What\u2019s more, despite his self-consciousness about his patchy skin and baldness, there\u2019s plenty of photographic and anecdotal evidence that Warhol had a gym-honed body with particularly good legs, and plenty of body hair. If we are determined to continue seeing Our Andy as fey and de-natured, Gopnik suggests, then it says more about our lingering homophobia that cannot bear to contemplate an artistic genius \u201ccaught in the act with men\u201d.</p> <p>The other myth he is keen to stamp on is the one about Warhol being deeply devout. While in his later years he took to popping in to the fabulously turreted St Vincent Ferrer on the Upper East Side, Warhol treated religion just as he treated everything else, which is to say entirely on his own terms. He avoided mass because it went on too long \u2013 five minutes, he opined, was quite enough for anyone \u2013 and shunned confession because he was convinced the priests would recognise him through the grille and gossip about his sins (and potentially disappoint him, perhaps, if they didn\u2019t). He liked the clothes, the buildings and the props, and was not above splashing holy water around at home \u201cas a kind of heavenly disinfectant\u201d, but he left it to his mother, who was also his housemate, to keep the Warhola clan in good standing with their Rusyn-Carpathian God.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d1f857e4b0486b2135ce658204fedabdbde3877\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d1f857e4b0486b2135ce658204fedabdbde3877/0_30_4431_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Campbell\u2019s soup cans on display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Campbell\u2019s soup cans on display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u2019s the soup. \u201cAlmost every recollection of Warhol\u2019s early days comes clogged with soup cans,\u201d notes Gopnik wearily, and then proceeds to kick them away one by one.

In Depression-era Pittsburgh, no one was flush enough to buy ready-mades for the table. Instead, Julia Warhola mushed together some water, salt, pepper and ketchup (the latter was allowed because it was Heinz, and Heinz owned Pittsburgh) into an approximation of something from the old country.

      "bodyText": "There are so many Warholian moments in this superb biography that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. There is the time someone turned up to a party at the Factory dressed as a box of Brillo. Or the great man\u2019s habit of answering a routine \u201cHow are you?\u201d with a whispery \u201cI\u2019m OK but I have diarrhoea.\u201d Or the social nightmare of being invited round to watch the unwatchable Sleep, a home movie consisting of five hours of a naked man snoozing. How to get through the ordeal without dropping off and starting to dribble on Andy\u2019s shoulder? (Actually, this would never have happened \u2013 Warhol hated such physical contact and was capable of throwing out any guest who overstepped the mark.) It is a testimony to Blake Gopnik\u2019s skill that he is able to acknowledge how silly these provocations sound while simultaneously insisting on their enduring art historical significance. Dressing up as a box of Brillo may count as a stunt, but Gopnik, a veteran critic and contributor to the New York Times, sees it as the logical extension of Marcel Duchamp\u2019s gesture 50 years earlier when he exhibited a porcelain pissoir as art. Responding to someone\u2019s standard greeting with a detailed report on your bowel movements may be childish but it also pointedly disrupts the genteel discourse of a rapidly capitalising art market. The fact that today we are inclined to roll our eyes at such anecdotes is evidence not of Warhol\u2019s nullity, but of his continuing ubiquity. Whether we like it or not, we are still living in his world. This spring\u2019s Warhol exhibition at Tate Modern is one of the most eagerly awaited of recent years. All the same, it would be wrong to imply that Gopnik\u2019s book is one that Warhol might have written himself or, indeed, even liked very much. Far from being a ready-made, assembled from the detritus of the scholarly-industrial complex, Warhol: A Life As Art is the product of years studying 100,000 or so original documents housed in Pittsburgh\u2019s Andy Warhol Museum.

With a rate of 3%, Kent Reliance\u2019s Regular Savings Account Issue 3 is one of the highest-paying, though this one-year account \u2013 which lets you deposit up to \u00a3500 per month \u2013 has to be opened and operated in-branch (Kent Reliance has nine branches). Close behind are HSBC and its First Direct arm, which both have Regular Saver accounts for their current account customers paying 2.75%, fixed for 12 months. You can save up to a total of \u00a33,000 and \u00a33,600 per year respectively. Coventry building society\u2019s Regular Saver pays 2.5% \u2013 it lasts for 12 months and lets you pay in up to \u00a3500 per month. Kids can get in on the act with Yorkshire building society\u2019s Child\u2019s Regular Saver, paying 3.8%, which lets you save up to \u00a3100 per month for one year. Fix your rate Unfortunately fixed savings rates are continuing to tumble, says data provider Moneyfacts.co.uk. \u201cA year ago, savers would have found a top one-year fixed-rate bond paying 2.15%, but today not even the top five-year fixed-rate bond will pay this return,\u201d its finance expert Rachel Springall said on Wednesday. Deals are tending to come and go at the moment: check out the likes of Moneyfacts to see what the latest position is. Those prepared to tie up their money for one year and five years respectively could still get 1.7% and 2%-plus from a few providers. The best of the easy access deals Marcus by Goldman Sachs was offering a rate of 1.35%, but this week trimmed it to 1.3%. This is an online account, though you can give some instructions by phone. It can be opened with as little as \u00a31, and up to \u00a3250,000 can be paid in. You can pay money to and from your Marcus account from your linked UK current account. It was the exact same story with over-50s specialist Saga\u2019s Easy Access Savings Account, which also saw its rate cut from 1.35% to 1.3%. That rate is boosted by a fixed 0.2% interest bonus for the first 12 months only. You can pay in anything between \u00a31 and the maximum balance of \u00a3100,000. Then there\u2019s the \u201c1 Year Limited Access Saver Issue 3\u201d from Yorkshire building society, which pays 1.3%. It can be opened with a minimum of \u00a3100 and can be managed online. But you can\u2019t fund the account from an existing Yorkshire account.",

One hundred years later, the same \u201clesser question of sex\u201d would put black women in a similar bind of loyalty between civil rights and the second-wave feminist movement. A split similar to that between mainstream suffragists (Anthony and Catt) and radicals (Woodhull and Paul) would visit the second-wave feminists, decades later.</p> <p>DuBois reveals the root of the refusal to give women the vote: deep-seated misogyny whose grip on public mores surpassed even vicious racism. DuBois reminds us of this fundamental truth throughout her book. Each time it comes as a shock.</p> <p>The day before Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration in March 1913, Alice Paul planned an audacious and unprecedented parade from the Capitol, past the White House to the US Treasury. Inez Milholland led the demonstration astride her horse, followed by a flower-covered cart carrying a banner with the message: \u201cAmendment to the Constitution of the United States Enfranchising the Women of the Country.\u201d</p> <p>Women converged by the thousands (including black delegations from Illinois and Howard University) and marched in ladylike fashion. A mob of men broke through deliberately passive police lines and seized the women, wrenching at their clothes and signs and harassing them \u201cwith all manner of smutty conversation\u201d. The army had to be called in.</p> <p>Paul took notes from the militant British suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst (British women \u2013 some of them \u2013 gained the vote in February 1918) and started a White House picketing campaign in 1917 \u2013 the very first time activists had done so.</p> <p>Women taunted Wilson with signs such as: \u201cMR PRESIDENT WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE?\u201d Picketers were attacked, arrested and imprisoned. Dozens, including Paul, were tortured and force-fed. Suffragist defiance forced Wilson and Congress to relent.</p> <p>Which brings us the real reason that the triumph of 26 August 1920 was anticlimactic. By 1970, second-wave feminists had barely begun to find traction in seeking equal financial, legal, medical and personal rights \u2013 none of which had significantly improved since 1920. As radical feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in The Dialectic of Sex: \u201cBy the time the vote was granted, the long channeling of feminist energies into the limited goal of suffrage \u2013 seen initially as only one step to political power \u2013 had thoroughly depleted the Women\u2019s Rights Movement. The monster Ballot had swallowed everything else.\u201d</p> <p>In her fascinating depiction of suffrage\u2019s epic journey, DuBois proves Firestone right.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-richard-nixon-2016-witness-revolution\">Clara Bingham</a>\u2019s most recent book is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Revolution-Radicals-Resisters-Hippies/dp/0812983262\">Witness to the Revolution: Radicals, Resisters, Vets, Hippies, and the Year America Lost its Mind and Found its Soul</a></p></li> </ul>",

One hundred years later, the same \u201clesser question of sex\u201d would put black women in a similar bind of loyalty between civil rights and the second-wave feminist movement. A split similar to that between mainstream suffragists (Anthony and Catt) and radicals (Woodhull and Paul) would visit the second-wave feminists, decades later. DuBois reveals the root of the refusal to give women the vote: deep-seated misogyny whose grip on public mores surpassed even vicious racism. DuBois reminds us of this fundamental truth throughout her book. Each time it comes as a shock. The day before Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration in March 1913, Alice Paul planned an audacious and unprecedented parade from the Capitol, past the White House to the US Treasury. Inez Milholland led the demonstration astride her horse, followed by a flower-covered cart carrying a banner with the message: \u201cAmendment to the Constitution of the United States Enfranchising the Women of the Country.\u201d Women converged by the thousands (including black delegations from Illinois and Howard University) and marched in ladylike fashion. A mob of men broke through deliberately passive police lines and seized the women, wrenching at their clothes and signs and harassing them \u201cwith all manner of smutty conversation\u201d. The army had to be called in. Paul took notes from the militant British suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst (British women \u2013 some of them \u2013 gained the vote in February 1918) and started a White House picketing campaign in 1917 \u2013 the very first time activists had done so. Women taunted Wilson with signs such as: \u201cMR PRESIDENT WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE?\u201d Picketers were attacked, arrested and imprisoned. Dozens, including Paul, were tortured and force-fed. Suffragist defiance forced Wilson and Congress to relent. Which brings us the real reason that the triumph of 26 August 1920 was anticlimactic. By 1970, second-wave feminists had barely begun to find traction in seeking equal financial, legal, medical and personal rights \u2013 none of which had significantly improved since 1920. As radical feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in The Dialectic of Sex: \u201cBy the time the vote was granted, the long channeling of feminist energies into the limited goal of suffrage \u2013 seen initially as only one step to political power \u2013 had thoroughly depleted the Women\u2019s Rights Movement. The monster Ballot had swallowed everything else.\u201d In her fascinating depiction of suffrage\u2019s epic journey, DuBois proves Firestone right.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Pensions</strong></h2> <p><strong>Current rules</strong></p> <p>Tax relief has long been a core incentive to encourage saving for retirement. If you earn \u00a330,000 a year and save \u00a32,000 into a pension, you get \u00a3400 in tax relief. If you earn \u00a380,000 a year and put \u00a315,000 into a pension, you get \u00a36,000 in tax relief (slightly different rates apply in Scotland). Effectively you obtain tax relief on whatever the maximum \u201cmarginal\u201d rate of income tax you are paying is. Someone earning \u00a330,000 a year has a top rate of tax of 20%, so they have 20% tax relief, while the high earner enjoys a 40% rate.</p> <p>The way it works is that the money is taken from your salary and goes into your pension pot entirely untaxed \u2013 ie without the 20% or 40% tax removed. But this relief is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/pensions-tax-relief-set-to-cost-government-almost-40bn\" title=\"\">hugely expensive</a>. The loss of income tax and employer\u2019s national insurance as a result of the various reliefs adds up to \u00a339.9bn, or more than the entire <a href=\"https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/brief-guides-and-explainers/public-finances/\" title=\"\">defence budget</a> (\u00a329bn).</p> <p>The government caps some of the cost by limiting to \u00a340,000 the maximum amount you can pay into a pension and still receive tax relief \u2013 called the annual<a href=\"https://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/saving-into-a-pension/pensions-and-tax/the-annual-allowance\" title=\"\"> allowance</a>.

      "bodyText": "Pensions Current rules Tax relief has long been a core incentive to encourage saving for retirement. If you earn \u00a330,000 a year and save \u00a32,000 into a pension, you get \u00a3400 in tax relief. If you earn \u00a380,000 a year and put \u00a315,000 into a pension, you get \u00a36,000 in tax relief (slightly different rates apply in Scotland). Effectively you obtain tax relief on whatever the maximum \u201cmarginal\u201d rate of income tax you are paying is. Someone earning \u00a330,000 a year has a top rate of tax of 20%, so they have 20% tax relief, while the high earner enjoys a 40% rate. The way it works is that the money is taken from your salary and goes into your pension pot entirely untaxed \u2013 ie without the 20% or 40% tax removed. But this relief is hugely expensive. The loss of income tax and employer\u2019s national insurance as a result of the various reliefs adds up to \u00a339.9bn, or more than the entire defence budget (\u00a329bn). The government caps some of the cost by limiting to \u00a340,000 the maximum amount you can pay into a pension and still receive tax relief \u2013 called the annual allowance. Also, you can only build up a total pension pot of \u00a31,055,000 without triggering substantial extra charges, called the lifetime allowance. Possible changes There is speculation that Rishi Sunak will strip higher earners of their 40% tax relief, equalising everybody at 20% or possibly levelling rates at 30%.

I joined the Dragons swimming group when I was eight and by the time I was 13 I was competing for Great Britain.</p> <p>I was fortunate that my swimming journey coincided with a focus on the Paralympics.

High in the hills behind the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the forested Massif des Maures is home to rustic villages that are hubs of activity, linked by forest trails with views to make the heart soar.</p> <p>Down on the Riviera, development creeps on, but at the village of <strong>La Garde-Freinet</strong>, the views of steep wooded hills clad with oak and chestnut forests have changed little since David Hockney came to paint here in the 1970s \u2013 the result being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_an_Artist_(Pool_with_Two_Figures)\" title=\"\">Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures</a>). The village has attracted a host of other artists, too (though not all were lucky enough, like Hockney, to be based at Vanessa Redgrave\u2019s house Le Nid du Duc), which gives it a distinctly arty vibe. Along cobbled streets lined with crumbling ochre and peach houses, are antique and bric-a-brac shops, art galleries, cafes and restaurants. At the top of the village are the ruins of a medieval fort, with views down on its jumble of terracotta roofs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51ae8a4afa9f91bd95ad2abcee9c40c43d8ea446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51ae8a4afa9f91bd95ad2abcee9c40c43d8ea446/0_197_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pine forest in the Massif des Maures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pine forest in the Massif des Maures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From La Garde-Freinet, it\u2019s a hair-raising journey into the heart of the Maures on a road that weaves like a high-ropes course, offering jaw-dropping views for the passengers, and heart-stopping bends for the driver. An hour away, deep in the forest, is <strong>Collobri\u00e8res</strong>, a village famed for its chestnuts. Factory tours at the family-run <strong><a href=\"https://www.confiserieazureenne.com/\" title=\"\">Confiserie Azur</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.confiserieazureenne.com/\" title=\"\">\u00e9enne </a></strong>show how they make the candied variety, <em>marrons glac\u00e9s</em>, which are best tried in their homemade ice-cream.</p> <p>The rest of the village serves chestnuts every other way possible: in hearty <em>daube </em>stews studded with roast chestnuts, as flour in cakes and in the heady <em>liqueur de chataigne</em>. There are vineyards, too, and the cooperative winery just outside the village offers tastings of local wines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"676d68991bf6a7b4a44ecf1de0f3e2c097113156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/676d68991bf6a7b4a44ecf1de0f3e2c097113156/0_245_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The village square in Collobri\u00e8res.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The village square in Collobri\u00e8res.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even without its gastronomic assets, Collobri\u00e8res would be a beguiling village to explore: a narrow river, shaded by plane trees, runs through its heart and its sleepy streets are home to antique shops, galleries, a blacksmith-cum-knifemaker, and friendly cafes and restaurants. For a great view, climb to the 16th-century ruins of <strong>Saint-Pons church</strong>, damaged by fire in the early 20th century.</p> <p>Back along the road to La Garde-Freinet, is a Carthusian monastery that rose from its own ashes. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.mpmtourisme.com/patrimoine-culturel/chartreuse-verne\" title=\"\">Chartreuse de la Verne </a></strong>burned down three times in the 13th and 14th centuries, but the immaculate stone edifice was largely restored over the past couple of centuries. There\u2019s a self-guided tour of the most historic parts, including the sparse quarters where the monks once lived. The current incumbents, the white-cloaked Sisters of Bethlehem, do an impressive line in exquisitely painted ceramics at extraordinarily reasonable prices (you wonder if they\u2019ve accounted for inflation in the outside world). A walk in the peaceful woods that surround the monastery will bring you up close to the twisted trunks of the chestnut trees; you might also catch a glimpse of the many wild boar that roam the woods.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2668e7f601b3ca4ccdf96aee60c97362991bdb65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2668e7f601b3ca4ccdf96aee60c97362991bdb65/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bedroom at Villa Fontane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bedroom at Villa Fontane, near La Garde-Freinet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sawday's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a train to Nice or Marseille and hire a car for the 90-minute drive to La Garde-Freinet.

From Pont-en-Royans, the Bourne gorge leads towards jaw-dropping scenery: the vast <strong>Cirque de Bournillon</strong> cliff face and the Moulin Marquis waterfall.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Combe Laval road is as spectacular as it is terrifying: merely a ledge chiselled out of the rock during the 19th century for moving timber.

It\u2019s a seasidey kind of place, with shops selling souvenirs and homewares, as well as <em>cr\u00eaperies</em> in which to indulge in the local <em>galettes</em>, buckwheat pancakes \u2013 the best ones in town are at <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/louisedebretagne/about/\" title=\"\">Louise de Bretagne</a></strong> (6 rue Poncelin), a smart, family-run restaurant with stone walls and wooden beams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7367307e5bc129a7365ec21234c632faeb2f4b73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7367307e5bc129a7365ec21234c632faeb2f4b73/0_0_7303_4382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Town square in Le Conquet with tourists\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The town square in Le Conquet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For days on the beach, there\u2019s no need to travel far: <strong>Plage de Portez</strong> is great for rock-pooling as well as picnics. It\u2019s tucked away behind the newly renovated Hotel Sainte-Barbe, a concrete marvel that lay derelict for years and is now a vibrant hub, thanks to its excellent restaurant and rooftop bar \u2013 it looks down on the harbour from its lofty heights towards the Kermovan peninsula, which is great for walks. Beyond it is the glorious <strong>Plage des Blancs Sablons</strong> which is an easy stroll via a bridge across the Ria estuary (or a 10-minute drive). The huge sweep of white sand is backed by grassy dunes and bracken, and ideal for lounging when the sun shines, or a bracing walk when it doesn\u2019t. More sheltered is the <strong>Plage de Corsen</strong>, 20 minutes north, its golden sand tucked under cliffs looking on to gentle turquoise water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c9e9a4592113d126d3f8e226ccdd57736c112973\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e9a4592113d126d3f8e226ccdd57736c112973/0_196_4762_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le phare du Creac\u2019h, Ushant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le phare du Creac\u2019h, Ushant</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eug\u00e9nie Ragot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Le Conquet is the most westerly town in mainland France, you can go further. Ferries ply the bumpy Iroise Sea, with its hundreds of islets and a tapestry of currents, taking an hour and a half to reach the 8km-long island of <strong>Ushant</strong> (Ouessant in French), which really is the last stop before the open Atlantic. On arriving at Port du Stiff, hire bikes on the quayside to cross its heather-clad moorland and freewheel downhill to the \u201ccapital\u201d Lampaul. The island\u2019s most westerly spot \u2013 the Pointe de Pern \u2013 is fierce even on a sunny day: the noise of the ocean crashing against the black rocks is deafening and makes an extraordinary sight. With so many ships succumbing to Ushant\u2019s jagged edge, it\u2019s little wonder there are six lighthouses on or around the coast, the tallest of which - the Phare du Cr\u00e9ac\u2019h \u2013 has one of the most powerful lights in the world.</p> <p>The island of <strong>Mol\u00e8ne</strong>, just half an hour from Le Conquet, is much smaller: you can walk its circumference in half an hour. It\u2019s a haven for seabirds, which wheel overhead as you wander between the stony coves, and before the trip back, make sure to tuck into the local delicacy: <em>saucisse de Mol\u00e8ne</em> is a sausage smoked over seaweed.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903e615f0604b077c611c4b7294538368789dbde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903e615f0604b077c611c4b7294538368789dbde/0_45_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainte Barbe hotel on rocks over sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hotel Sainte-Barbe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leopold Pascal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Le Conquet is an hour and 20 minutes\u2019 drive from Roscoff (ferry from Plymouth, from \u00a3288 return for a car and two adults, with en suite cabin on the outward sailing, with <a href=\"https://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/ferry-routes/ferries-france/plymouth-roscoff\" title=\"\">Brittany Ferries</a>). <strong><a href=\"https://www.hotelsaintebarbe.com/\" title=\"\">Hotel Sainte-Barbe</a></strong> (doubles from \u20ac158 room-only) has 34 rooms, many perched over the water.

A good base is <strong>Compi\u00e8gne</strong>, an elegant town where cobbled streets lead between timber-framed and brick houses, sophisticated boutiques and smart restaurants, such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesferlempins.fr/\" title=\"\">Les Ferlempins</a></strong>, serving local and organic produce.</p> <p>The crowning glory is its imperial palace, <strong><a href=\"https://chateaudecompiegne.fr/\" title=\"\">Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne</a></strong>, loved by Napoleon in the same way that Louis XVI adored Versailles (though it is smaller). It makes for a peaceful experience: wander the creaking parquet floorboards of the state rooms and ogle the chandelier-filled ballroom. The chateau is home to the Mus\u00e9e Nationale de la Voiture, with a collection of ornate horse-drawn carriages dating from the 17th century. On a sunny day though, the parkland is the place to be, with its rose garden and woodland bisected by the wide, grassy Avenue des Beaux Monts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81af41833038b2a4571e0c996c56eba2dd9bcf33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81af41833038b2a4571e0c996c56eba2dd9bcf33/0_36_4960_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne\u2019s opulent interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne\u2019s opulent interior</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno Beucher/Oise Tourisme</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast to Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne, which was loved by its regal and imperial incumbents, <strong><a href=\"http://www.chateau-pierrefonds.fr/\" title=\"\">Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds</a></strong>, on the edge of Compi\u00e8gne forest, is something of a folly. Its multiple circular, crenellated towers scream \u201cmedieval castle\u201d so loudly it was chosen as the setting for the BBC series Merlin. In the mid-1800s, Napoleon III wanted the ruined 14th-century chateau rebuilt, and commissioned Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc (who also renovated Mont-St-Michel and Carcassonne) to redesign it in medieval style. Yet, in an imperial version of Grand Designs, the money ran out, Viollet-le-Duc died and Napoleon III was deposed before much of the interior decor was done. Today, its stark rooms contain gargantuan statues (intended for the exterior) and a magnificent judicial hall with an ornate arched ceiling and a fireplace adorned with statues of Empress Eug\u00e9nie and her ladies-in-waiting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d94a245de7bd792fb98c7186dad565eaf44a278\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d94a245de7bd792fb98c7186dad565eaf44a278/0_24_3071_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forest clearing with museum and memorials\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glade of the l\u2019Armistice near Compi\u00e8gne</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Pierre Gilson/Orise Tourisme</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere in the forest, the <strong>Glade of the Armistice</strong> recalls a more poignant chapter in history: at dawn on 11 November 1918, two trains \u2013 one from France, one from Germany \u2013 rolled into the discreet and remote railway sidings in order to sign the armistice that would put an end to four years of devastating warfare. The clearing and the small Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Armistice were renovated in 2018 to commemorate the centenary. Inside, there\u2019s a replica of the railway carriage that hosted the summit and engaging exhibits telling the story of the end of the first world war. It also demonstrates how three wars (the Franco-Prussian war, and the first and second world wars) were so closely linked, and how, in an act of revenge, Hitler insisted France sign the 1940 armistice on this same spot, destroying the memorials that had been erected in the 1920s.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"841477fa7d040c62582298309020e04612f09f7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/841477fa7d040c62582298309020e04612f09f7b/0_65_1565_939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bedroom at Villa le Chatelet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bedroom at Villa le Chatelet, built for L\u00e9o Delibes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong>Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, then a 40-minute train ride to Compi\u00e8gne.

The foothills of the Pyrenees are great for walking and exploring cute villages, and its coast has golden swathes of sand beaten by Atlantic rollers or, in the case of <strong>Saint-Jean-de-Luz</strong>, a gentle bay perfect for paddling. This seaside town makes a good base, being equidistant from glamorous Biarritz in the north and the mountains to the south.</p> <p>The plain exterior of St-Jean-Baptiste church in the old town hides an astounding baroque altarpiece decorated with dozens of golden saints; the other walls host four levels of dark-wood seating galleries that rise to the roof. In 1660, the French king Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain got hitched here and, in so doing, ended centuries of conflict between the two countries.</p> <p>The local sweetmeats continue the romantic vibe: <em>mouchous</em> are the small macarons named for the Basque word for \u201ckiss\u201d.

The cliffs along the coast to the south towards Spain are fascinating too \u2013 slanting grey strata make them look like layers of cardboard.

      "bodyText": "Var, Provence Everybody has heard of Saint-Tropez, but an hour inland from the fashionistas\u2019 favourite resort is a very different kind of Provence. High in the hills behind the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the forested Massif des Maures is home to rustic villages that are hubs of activity, linked by forest trails with views to make the heart soar. Down on the Riviera, development creeps on, but at the village of La Garde-Freinet, the views of steep wooded hills clad with oak and chestnut forests have changed little since David Hockney came to paint here in the 1970s \u2013 the result being Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures). The village has attracted a host of other artists, too (though not all were lucky enough, like Hockney, to be based at Vanessa Redgrave\u2019s house Le Nid du Duc), which gives it a distinctly arty vibe. Along cobbled streets lined with crumbling ochre and peach houses, are antique and bric-a-brac shops, art galleries, cafes and restaurants. At the top of the village are the ruins of a medieval fort, with views down on its jumble of terracotta roofs. From La Garde-Freinet, it\u2019s a hair-raising journey into the heart of the Maures on a road that weaves like a high-ropes course, offering jaw-dropping views for the passengers, and heart-stopping bends for the driver. An hour away, deep in the forest, is Collobri\u00e8res, a village famed for its chestnuts. Factory tours at the family-run Confiserie Azur\u00e9enne show how they make the candied variety, marrons glac\u00e9s, which are best tried in their homemade ice-cream. The rest of the village serves chestnuts every other way possible: in hearty daube stews studded with roast chestnuts, as flour in cakes and in the heady liqueur de chataigne. There are vineyards, too, and the cooperative winery just outside the village offers tastings of local wines. Even without its gastronomic assets, Collobri\u00e8res would be a beguiling village to explore: a narrow river, shaded by plane trees, runs through its heart and its sleepy streets are home to antique shops, galleries, a blacksmith-cum-knifemaker, and friendly cafes and restaurants. For a great view, climb to the 16th-century ruins of Saint-Pons church, damaged by fire in the early 20th century. Back along the road to La Garde-Freinet, is a Carthusian monastery that rose from its own ashes. The Chartreuse de la Verne burned down three times in the 13th and 14th centuries, but the immaculate stone edifice was largely restored over the past couple of centuries. There\u2019s a self-guided tour of the most historic parts, including the sparse quarters where the monks once lived. The current incumbents, the white-cloaked Sisters of Bethlehem, do an impressive line in exquisitely painted ceramics at extraordinarily reasonable prices (you wonder if they\u2019ve accounted for inflation in the outside world). A walk in the peaceful woods that surround the monastery will bring you up close to the twisted trunks of the chestnut trees; you might also catch a glimpse of the many wild boar that roam the woods. Way to go Take a train to Nice or Marseille and hire a car for the 90-minute drive to La Garde-Freinet. Just outside the village is charming B&amp;B Villa Fontane (doubles from \u20ac80 B&amp;B) run by a Franco-Australian couple. There\u2019s also a g\u00eete sleeping six and a heated pool. More information at visitvar.fr. * * * Dr\u00f4me and Is\u00e8re, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes South of Lyon lies an extraordinary landscape: to the east are the plateaux and gorges of the Vercors and, further west, vineyards border the Rh\u00f4ne. To the south, the mighty river snakes towards an area of gastronomic abundance \u2013 nougat in Mont\u00e9limar, olives in Nyons. The city of Valence makes a great base. A walking tour of its old town should include its Romanesque cathedral, the 16th-century Maison des T\u00eates with its ornate facade, walls and ceilings of carved faces. The market stalls in various town squares are a feast for the eyes and the stomach, with produce from land around the city. Valence is also famous for being the home town of chef Anne-Sophie Pic \u2013 but eschew the pomp at her three-Michelin-star restaurant for other Pic group spots, such as the lively bistro Andr\u00e9 next door or, in the centre, the Daily Pic cafe, where meals are served in glass parfait jars, with no plastic to be found. It\u2019s a 45-minute drive east to Pont-en-Royans, gateway to Vercors regional park. The village\u2019s medieval houses perch precariously over the River Bourne; look at them from the river beach opposite before exploring the village\u2019s water museum with exhibits on water conservation and hydroelectric power. The highlight, though, is its Bar \u00e0 Eaux, a tasting room offering sips of mineral waters from all around the world. There are 1,600 varieties and the difference in flavours is extraordinary. From Pont-en-Royans, the Bourne gorge leads towards jaw-dropping scenery: the vast Cirque de Bournillon cliff face and the Moulin Marquis waterfall. Elsewhere, the Combe Laval road is as spectacular as it is terrifying: merely a ledge chiselled out of the rock during the 19th century for moving timber. Only a small stone wall separates you from a 1,000-metre plummet and the spectacular mountain panorama beyond. To the south of Valence, Dr\u00f4me is on the fringes of Provence; drive south first to sleepy Mont\u00e9limar to tuck into its honeyed nougat, then head east \u2013 on winding roads that cut through vineyards, lavender fields and cherry orchards \u2013 to arrive at the village of Grignan. Its golden-stone houses are high on a hill, topped with a Renaissance chateau, and it is surrounded by lavender fields. Its narrow streets spiral upwards; as you wander, breathe in the scent of rosemary and jasmine wafting from the walled gardens, and gaze across the landscape from the chateau\u2019s courtyards. Continue to Nyons, known as Petit Nice for its yellow and terracotta houses. The hilly landscape around it channels the climate from the Med to create the conditions for growing olives and even before you reach the town you\u2019ll see its groves of ancient trees. Way to go Eurostar via Lille to Lyon Part-Dieu, then TGV to Valence. In Valence, Hotel Victoria is a contemporary-design boutique hotel (doubles from \u20ac120 room only), while in Grignan, Le Clair de la Plume (doubles from \u20ac99 room only) is in a 17th- and 19th-century mansion.

Not many Brits make it out this far, preferring to zip across Brittany to beaches on its south coast, or on towards the Vend\u00e9e. Yet those who hang a right out of the port at Roscoff and drive just over an hour west to Le Conquet will enjoy soft blond beaches and a string of wild islands that are the last stop before North America. Le Conquet is a charm: its streets are lined with dinky stone cottages with shutters and doors in pillar-box red or ocean blue; gardens brim with sugar-pink hydrangeas; and lobster pots are piled high. It\u2019s a seasidey kind of place, with shops selling souvenirs and homewares, as well as cr\u00eaperies in which to indulge in the local galettes, buckwheat pancakes \u2013 the best ones in town are at Louise de Bretagne (6 rue Poncelin), a smart, family-run restaurant with stone walls and wooden beams. For days on the beach, there\u2019s no need to travel far: Plage de Portez is great for rock-pooling as well as picnics. It\u2019s tucked away behind the newly renovated Hotel Sainte-Barbe, a concrete marvel that lay derelict for years and is now a vibrant hub, thanks to its excellent restaurant and rooftop bar \u2013 it looks down on the harbour from its lofty heights towards the Kermovan peninsula, which is great for walks. Beyond it is the glorious Plage des Blancs Sablons which is an easy stroll via a bridge across the Ria estuary (or a 10-minute drive). The huge sweep of white sand is backed by grassy dunes and bracken, and ideal for lounging when the sun shines, or a bracing walk when it doesn\u2019t. More sheltered is the Plage de Corsen, 20 minutes north, its golden sand tucked under cliffs looking on to gentle turquoise water. Though Le Conquet is the most westerly town in mainland France, you can go further. Ferries ply the bumpy Iroise Sea, with its hundreds of islets and a tapestry of currents, taking an hour and a half to reach the 8km-long island of Ushant (Ouessant in French), which really is the last stop before the open Atlantic. On arriving at Port du Stiff, hire bikes on the quayside to cross its heather-clad moorland and freewheel downhill to the \u201ccapital\u201d Lampaul. The island\u2019s most westerly spot \u2013 the Pointe de Pern \u2013 is fierce even on a sunny day: the noise of the ocean crashing against the black rocks is deafening and makes an extraordinary sight. With so many ships succumbing to Ushant\u2019s jagged edge, it\u2019s little wonder there are six lighthouses on or around the coast, the tallest of which - the Phare du Cr\u00e9ac\u2019h \u2013 has one of the most powerful lights in the world. The island of Mol\u00e8ne, just half an hour from Le Conquet, is much smaller: you can walk its circumference in half an hour. It\u2019s a haven for seabirds, which wheel overhead as you wander between the stony coves, and before the trip back, make sure to tuck into the local delicacy: saucisse de Mol\u00e8ne is a sausage smoked over seaweed. Way to go Le Conquet is an hour and 20 minutes\u2019 drive from Roscoff (ferry from Plymouth, from \u00a3288 return for a car and two adults, with en suite cabin on the outward sailing, with Brittany Ferries). Hotel Sainte-Barbe (doubles from \u20ac158 room-only) has 34 rooms, many perched over the water. It also has parking (rare in Le Conquet) and is minutes from the harbour. * * * Oise, Picardy The lesser-known Oise department of Picardy is a land of forests and chateaux steeped in history, be it the follies of imperial rule or heart-wrenching tales from the first world war. A good base is Compi\u00e8gne, an elegant town where cobbled streets lead between timber-framed and brick houses, sophisticated boutiques and smart restaurants, such as Les Ferlempins, serving local and organic produce. The crowning glory is its imperial palace, Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne, loved by Napoleon in the same way that Louis XVI adored Versailles (though it is smaller). It makes for a peaceful experience: wander the creaking parquet floorboards of the state rooms and ogle the chandelier-filled ballroom. The chateau is home to the Mus\u00e9e Nationale de la Voiture, with a collection of ornate horse-drawn carriages dating from the 17th century. On a sunny day though, the parkland is the place to be, with its rose garden and woodland bisected by the wide, grassy Avenue des Beaux Monts. In contrast to Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne, which was loved by its regal and imperial incumbents, Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds, on the edge of Compi\u00e8gne forest, is something of a folly. Its multiple circular, crenellated towers scream \u201cmedieval castle\u201d so loudly it was chosen as the setting for the BBC series Merlin. In the mid-1800s, Napoleon III wanted the ruined 14th-century chateau rebuilt, and commissioned Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc (who also renovated Mont-St-Michel and Carcassonne) to redesign it in medieval style. Yet, in an imperial version of Grand Designs, the money ran out, Viollet-le-Duc died and Napoleon III was deposed before much of the interior decor was done. Today, its stark rooms contain gargantuan statues (intended for the exterior) and a magnificent judicial hall with an ornate arched ceiling and a fireplace adorned with statues of Empress Eug\u00e9nie and her ladies-in-waiting. Elsewhere in the forest, the Glade of the Armistice recalls a more poignant chapter in history: at dawn on 11 November 1918, two trains \u2013 one from France, one from Germany \u2013 rolled into the discreet and remote railway sidings in order to sign the armistice that would put an end to four years of devastating warfare. The clearing and the small Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Armistice were renovated in 2018 to commemorate the centenary. Inside, there\u2019s a replica of the railway carriage that hosted the summit and engaging exhibits telling the story of the end of the first world war. It also demonstrates how three wars (the Franco-Prussian war, and the first and second world wars) were so closely linked, and how, in an act of revenge, Hitler insisted France sign the 1940 armistice on this same spot, destroying the memorials that had been erected in the 1920s. Way to go Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, then a 40-minute train ride to Compi\u00e8gne. The three-room Villa du Ch\u00e2telet (doubles from \u20ac100 B&amp;B) is in walking distance of the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Armistice and was built for 19th-century composer L\u00e9o Delibes. Owner Alix de Lauzanne also runs a cookery school in the house, and her four-course table d\u2019h\u00f4te dinners (\u20ac45pp with wine) are superb. More information on the area from oisetourism.co.uk. * * * French Basque country Tucked away in the curve where France runs into Spain, the Basque country offers a different flavour of France, with its red or green timber-framed architecture, its own curious language and piquant cuisine. The foothills of the Pyrenees are great for walking and exploring cute villages, and its coast has golden swathes of sand beaten by Atlantic rollers or, in the case of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, a gentle bay perfect for paddling. This seaside town makes a good base, being equidistant from glamorous Biarritz in the north and the mountains to the south. The plain exterior of St-Jean-Baptiste church in the old town hides an astounding baroque altarpiece decorated with dozens of golden saints; the other walls host four levels of dark-wood seating galleries that rise to the roof. In 1660, the French king Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain got hitched here and, in so doing, ended centuries of conflict between the two countries. The local sweetmeats continue the romantic vibe: mouchous are the small macarons named for the Basque word for \u201ckiss\u201d. Buy a box in the town centre at Maison Adam, founded in the year of those royal nuptials. For something healthier, the daily market (Les Halles, 7am-1pm) sells charcuterie, glossy nectarines and succulent apricots, Pyrenean cheeses and crusty bread for a picnic on the nearby beach, a glorious crescent of fine yellow sand. Pointe de Sainte-Barbe, a short walk north, offers a spectacular view of the bay towards the neighbouring village of Ciboure, with the green silhouette of the Pyrenees as a backdrop. Also on the opposite shore is the 15th-century fort at Socoa, with a walkable sea wall shielding the bay from the ferocious Atlantic. The cliffs along the coast to the south towards Spain are fascinating too \u2013 slanting grey strata make them look like layers of cardboard. For a better look, the Nivelle V (\u20ac10/\u20ac8) pleasure boat pootles from the quay in St Jean de Luz down to the Spanish border town of Hondarribia and back. Ciboure is worth exploring: walk up past its pelota court (the Basque racquet game) and into winding streets lined with four-storey villas, with red and white timber frames and shuttered facades. Here, characterful restaurant Chez Mattin serves Basque specialities such as axoa stew flavoured with the local mild Espelette chillies. The village from which the pepper takes its name is an hour\u2019s drive into the mountains, and its houses are strung with garlands \u2013 ristras - of the dried red peppers like bunting. Its bijou boutiques are rammed with local crafts, and there\u2019s more Basque cuisine on the sunny terrace of bar-restaurant Aintzina (440 Karrika Nagusia). Way to go Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, then TGV Paris Montparnasse to St-Jean-de-Luz. La R\u00e9serve (doubles from \u20ac105 room-only) is a four-star hotel on the cliffs behind Pointe de Sainte-Barbe, with views along the coast to Biarritz.

      "body": "<p>Oh, how you spoil us, the internet. Watching a comedian\u2019s latest show used to involve waiting for one of about eight comics to release a VHS/DVD or, gulp, leaving the house. Today, we hold the whip hand. Such is our desire to sit around watching standup in our pyjamas, streaming services can\u2019t get them out fast enough. Netflix is our most deep-pocketed and reliable dealer, pumping out no less than 45 original shows in 2019, up from one in 2012. But there are other providers, notably Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer, and smaller outfits such as NextUp and Go Faster Stripe, which do a fine job of mopping up lesser-known comics and hidden gems.</p> <p>To the bean-counters at Netflix et al, the appeal of these \u201cspecials\u201d is obvious: they are cheap to make compared with sitcoms and films, but they still attract a lot of eyeballs. And to the ambitious comic, it can mean the difference between national and international success. This has led to little outbreaks of creativity here and there, as comedians embrace the format\u2019s increasing dominance. Maria Bamford\u2019s decision to record her show The Special Special Special! in a living room, in front of an audience of just two (her baffled but supportive parents), was inspired and in keeping with her unorthodox act. In his BBC series Comedy Vehicle, Stewart Lee literally spoke down to the audience at home through a camera at the side of the stage. The streaming services are starting to experiment now, too, with shorter, snackable shows of just 15 to 30 minutes, as a way of showcasing rising stars. All of which means that the humble TV viewer might require some help to hack through this jungle of options. So, in that spirit, we have put together 50 of the best standup specials you can find online. <em>PF</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/09/comedian-ali-wong-netflix-baby-cobra-fresh-off-the-boat\">Ali Wong </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY9h-0x1Oao\"><br></a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY9h-0x1Oao\">Baby Cobra</a> <em>Netflix</em></h2> <p>Baby Cobra didn\u2019t just give us Ali Wong, she of the death stare and the dead-on observations; it also created a sub-genre of special: the heavily pregnant ones.

      "bodyText": "Oh, how you spoil us, the internet. Watching a comedian\u2019s latest show used to involve waiting for one of about eight comics to release a VHS/DVD or, gulp, leaving the house. Today, we hold the whip hand. Such is our desire to sit around watching standup in our pyjamas, streaming services can\u2019t get them out fast enough. Netflix is our most deep-pocketed and reliable dealer, pumping out no less than 45 original shows in 2019, up from one in 2012. But there are other providers, notably Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer, and smaller outfits such as NextUp and Go Faster Stripe, which do a fine job of mopping up lesser-known comics and hidden gems. To the bean-counters at Netflix et al, the appeal of these \u201cspecials\u201d is obvious: they are cheap to make compared with sitcoms and films, but they still attract a lot of eyeballs. And to the ambitious comic, it can mean the difference between national and international success. This has led to little outbreaks of creativity here and there, as comedians embrace the format\u2019s increasing dominance. Maria Bamford\u2019s decision to record her show The Special Special Special! in a living room, in front of an audience of just two (her baffled but supportive parents), was inspired and in keeping with her unorthodox act. In his BBC series Comedy Vehicle, Stewart Lee literally spoke down to the audience at home through a camera at the side of the stage. The streaming services are starting to experiment now, too, with shorter, snackable shows of just 15 to 30 minutes, as a way of showcasing rising stars. All of which means that the humble TV viewer might require some help to hack through this jungle of options. So, in that spirit, we have put together 50 of the best standup specials you can find online. PF Ali Wong Baby Cobra Netflix Baby Cobra didn\u2019t just give us Ali Wong, she of the death stare and the dead-on observations; it also created a sub-genre of special: the heavily pregnant ones. You haven\u2019t seen physical comedy mastered until you\u2019ve seen a woman, seven-and-a-half-months pregnant, writhing about, re-enacting some moves she \u201clearned in Atlanta\u201d. Best bit: \u201cI don\u2019t want to \u2018lean in\u2019 OK? I want to lie down.\u201d EEJ Amy Schumer Growing Netflix America\u2019s premier purveyor of pussy gags has a new shtick: she\u2019s pregnant! This provides enough amusing material to fill the hour, even if it doesn\u2019t leave space for Schumer to address her recurrent career controversies, from joke-stealing to oblivious \u201cwhite feminism\u201d. Best bit: On joining a protest of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court confirmation: \u201cI want to be able to tell this kid I did everything I could \u2026 And DC, I heard, has the best cocaine.\u201d EEJ Asian Network Comedy Edinburgh Festival BBC iPlayer A half-hour from the 2019 fringe featuring Eshaan Akbar, Arnab Chanda, an outre Shazia Mirza set on hot jihadis, and master of deadpan Sumit Anand with a bulletin from the frontline of Indian culture and creativity. Best bit: Mirza: \u201cA few days after Brexit a friend of mine was abused on the street in Birmingham. She was wearing Asian clothes, so it was her own fault.\u201d BL Bec Hill I\u2019ll Be Bec LIVR.co.uk After the viral success of her lo-fi flipcharts, the irreverent Aussie\u2019s terrific new special \u2013 an ingenious time-travel tale \u2013 is only available in VR. Sign up for a free headset and all you need is a decent smartphone to jack in. Best bit: A daffy Lord\u2019s Prayer remix from the future: \u201cOwl father, hoo \u2026\u201d GV Bill Burr I\u2019m Sorry You Feel That Way Netflix A bullish comic taking on complaint culture and over-sensitivity could be a bad combination, but Burr is no orthodox reactionary, and his delivery is often more aggressive than his message. He also looks at his own religious background and notions of masculinity. Best bit: His adoption oneupmanship. PF Bill Hicks Relentless NextUp/Netflix Hicks\u2019s final release before his death showcases the power of his nihilistic truth-telling. The Iraq war, smoking/drugs and gun control all get the treatment. He is remembered for his political stances, but this is a reminder that his evangelical oratory made for brilliant comedy. Best bit: The military weapons catalogue. PF Billy Connolly An Audience With Amazon (\u00a31.89) Look past the 1980s optics \u2013 Connolly\u2019s flouncy zebra shirt, Sir Clive Sinclair in the celeb crowd \u2013 and this is a righteous celebration of the Big Yin\u2019s livewire wit, from his days as a Clydeside welder to finding his first grey pube. Best bit: An incontinence pants routine that will leave you requiring them. GV Bo Burnham Make Happy Netflix Teen musical comedy prodigy-turned-standup superstar, at 25 Burnham made Make Happy: casually brilliant, abundant in smarts, cynicism and aggressive misdirection, and fraught by his tortured self-hyperawareness. He went on to write and direct the movie Eighth Grade \u2013 but his comedy is a must-see. Best bit: \u201cA lesser comedian would have milked that for four verses. And a better comedian wouldn\u2019t have done it at all. I\u2019m right in the sweet spot!\u201d BL Bridget Christie Stand Up for Her Netflix One of the decade\u2019s great standups, combining clowning and campaigning comedy to sublime effect. This brings together her biggest-hitting feminist material: on sexist advertising, old-school chauvinism and \u201cvintage vaginas\u201d. Best bit: Her Bic for Her routine: \u201cLook, I can write down a list of things what ladies want \u2026 Chocolate! Jewellery! Abortion!\u201d BL Chris Rock Tamborine Netflix Rock\u2019s first special for a decade includes some bitter ramblings of a recently divorced dad (\u201cHousewives are the most gangster motherfuckers\u201d), but also his trademark insight into American racism \u2013 updated for the Trump era \u2013 plus an introspective vulnerability that\u2019s all new. Best bit: \u201cBad apple? That\u2019s a lovely name for murderer.\u201d EEJ Comedians of the World Netflix This globetrotting strand showcases 47 comics from more than a dozen territories performing polished half-hours in their native language (roughly half are in English). UK/US talent includes sly satirist Nish Kumar and saucy Nailed It! host Nicole Byer, but venturing further afield reveals the irks and quirks that animate standups from Brazil, India, the Middle East and more. Best bit: Iranian-German comic Enissa Amani biting the hand that feeds by slagging off sub-par Netflix subtitles. GV Dave Chappelle Equanimity &amp; The Bird Revelation Netflix It\u2019s true, late-era Chappelle is sometimes guilty of lazy provocation, but a comic of his skill always entertains. Even the way he puffs on an e-cig between punchlines is funnier than most standups on their best night. Best bit: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to ruin an orgy than you think. All you gotta do is wait for it to get kind of quiet and then go: \u2018Eww.\u2019\u201d EEJ Doug Stanhope No Place Like Home NextUp One of comedy\u2019s most uncomfortable watches broadcasts from his home town of Bisbee, Arizona, with off-colour, orthodoxy-baiting material on global poverty, mental health and beheading videos. Often brilliant, often hard to stomach. Best bit: \u201cIsis is using social media to recruit disenfranchised, angry youth. And that\u2019s what I do! That\u2019s my demographic!\u201d BL Eddie Murphy Raw Amazon Prime It\u2019s still the highest-grossing standup film of all time, but Murphy has admitted parts of his 1987 special now make him cringe. The homophobic slurs have certainly dated, although Raw\u2019s Cosby mockery seems prescient. And the purple leather outfit? Timeless. Best bit: Murphy\u2019s impression of his stepfather angrily misremembering Motown lyrics must be appreciated in full. EEJ Flight of the Conchords Live in London Now TV The best musical comedians in the world toured in 2018 with this blissfully entertaining show, stuffed with old favourites, beautifully wrought newbies and deadpan banter. As this Hammersmith Apollo recording proves: age does not wither them. Best bit: \u201cYou just never know how love will end / But never ever introduce her to your handsomest friend\u201d from the song Father and Son. BL Hannah Gadsby Nanette Netflix This is the hour that brought a small-town Tasmanian global recognition. Others deconstruct the form, do biting satire or emotional vulnerability, but few combine all three. Plus there is something here that none of those \u201cKings of Comedy\u201d could muster: Gadsby\u2019s invaluable perspective. Best bit: \u201cI may as well come out now \u2026 I identify as tired.\u201d EEJ Hannibal Buress Comedy Camisado Netflix Buress became notorious in 2014 after his Bill Cosby routine reignited legal interest in the sex pest. This 2016 special touches briefly on that fallout but mostly explores the Chicago standup\u2019s appealingly languid interests. Best bit: \u201cI don\u2019t have fuck-you money, I\u2019ve got strongly-worded-email money.\u201d GV Hans Teeuwen Live in London NextUp Good luck working out what\u2019s going on when Teeuwen takes to the stage. Here as elsewhere, the in-yer-face Dutch absurdist keeps you perpetually off-balance as he tinkles the ivories, bellows a Scandinavian war song and recounts sex with a water buffalo. Best bit: The improving on Mozart number. BL Hasan Minhaj Patriot Act Netflix A blend of standup and TED talk, this series seems to annoy all the right people, including the US military, Hindu nationalists in India and Duterte supporters in the Philippines. Minhaj\u2019s earnest optimism might be American, but his reach is truly global. Best bit: \u201cThere are over 10,000 apps for mental health. That fact alone gives me anxiety.\u201d EEJ Ilana Glazer The Planet Is Burning Amazon Prime Ignore that earnest title, the broad from Broad City isn\u2019t about to bend your ear on climate change. Instead, it\u2019s the same twerk-tastic, sexually confident energy we\u2019ve come to love in her TV alter ego, with added Hebrew school anecdotes. Best bit: \u201cThe Amazon is on fire and my special is on Amazon \u2026and it is fiiiiire.\u201d EEJ James Acaster Repertoire Netflix A suite of four standup shows, bringing TV viewers up to date with his live career. Recognise, Represent and Reset are as they were originally intended: tall tales of being an undercover cop, a juror and a criminal mastermind-turned-snitch, respectively. Recap is a new show set in witness protection. The shows are puzzles, rewarding and precisely constructed, and he finds new perspectives on the most mundane subjects. He\u2019s dry, absurd, awkward and utterly brilliant. Best bit: His dissection of he/she/they. PF Jayde Adams Serious Black Jumper Amazon Prime Jayde is on a mission to be taken more seriously, Bristolian accent and all. The solution? A Steve Jobs makeover and this set, which disco-dances on the limits of celebrity feminism, like one of her drag queen pals of old. Best bit: \u201cI don\u2019t even run in my own nightmares.\u201d EEJ Jenny Slate Stage Fright Netflix Ten years on from her infamous SNL blunder (she dropped the F-bomb in her very first show and only lasted one season), Slate returns to standup. The show is no dark baring of the soul \u2013 it focuses on her Jewish heritage and her haunted childhood home \u2013 but ripples of nervous energy make her brilliantly skittish set even more magnetic. Best bit: Her parents\u2019 sleeping habits, involving nudity and a sleep apnoea machine. HG Jerry Seinfeld Jerry Before Seinfeld Netflix Shot in the same Manhattan club where he got his start in the 1980s, 2017\u2019s Jerry Before Seinfeld special sees the sitcom champ looking wistfully back with some low-stakes but well-sculpted material. Best bit: \u201cI had glasses at 10, braces at 12. I said to my parents: \u2018Let\u2019s not stop now \u2026 how about a hearing aid?\u2019\u201d GV John Mulaney Kid Gorgeous Netflix Like a Simpsons approximation of a standup brought to life: classical in style, family-friendly and a toothy grin. His second Netflix special is a doozy, with routines on college fees, meeting famous people, and the greatest Trump routine to date. Best bit: There\u2019s a horse, loose, in the hospital. PF John-Luke Roberts All I Wanna Do Is... Go Faster Stripe (\u00a35) Absurdist fans gather. Roberts combines surrealism with his considerable chops for writing jokes and inhabiting characters. This show doubles as both a run-through of \u201call the other Spice Girls\u201d, and a heartfelt appreciation of laughter in the face of confusion. Best bit: \u201cCrone spice.\u201d PF Jordan Brookes Body of Work NextUp The breakthrough show from the comic who won last year\u2019s Edinburgh comedy award, in which the sinewy strange-behaviour merchant covers \u201cbad thought-marbles\u201d, talking body parts and his dead gran. Best bit: \u201cNana was one of those women who\u2019d walk into a room and you\u2019d go: \u2018There\u2019s Nana\u2019\u201d \u2013 and the ensuing routine. BL Josie Long Cara Josephine Sohotheatreondemand.com (\u00a34) The usually enthusiastic comic is in a contemplative mood here: recovering from a big breakup, obsessed with outdoor swimming, and able to deliver a seemingly innocuous story about her sister\u2019s wedding with an emotional sledgehammer of a punchline. An 80-minute softening of the soul we can all benefit from. Best bit: A surprisingly touching anecdote about her ex responding to period blood. HG Katherine Ryan In Trouble Netflix Joan Rivers (RIP) has many successors but Ryan, all Botox and badass takedowns, must be her truest heir. This sees her not yet grown into her Glitter Room greatness, but nonetheless hilarious on her rural Canadian roots. Best bit: \u201cYeah, but you bitches aren\u2019t normal, you\u2019re ordinary. It\u2019s different.\u201d EEJ The League of Gentlemen Live Again! BBC iPlayer Local shop, loco people: Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith reactivated their beloved Royston Vasey grotesques for this 2018 show, with some genuine pathos amid the unsettling humour and gooey slapstick. Best bit: Herr Lipp leads the audience in a highly inappropriate German lesson. GV Leslie Jones Time Machine Netflix Here\u2019s the Saturday Night Live veteran and Chris Rock\u2019s favourite standup, in a special directed by Game of Thrones\u2019s Benioff and Weiss, no less. She is reflecting on the decades, but once she gets to partying, even a loose eyelash can\u2019t stop her. Best bit: Recreating at length the fully choreographed dance routine that a 20-year-old Jones once whipped out to impress Prince. EEJ Liam Williams Live from the BBC BBC iPlayer A rare opportunity to see the Pls Like man in standup mode. This set may not burn as brightly as his best work, but its account of eye tests, foot injuries and climate change still finds the downcast Yorkshireman on fine, mordant form. Best bit: The \u201cNo, those are next year\u2019s daffodils come early!\u201d gag about a warming world. BL Margaret Cho PsyCHO Amazon The San-Franciscan sitcom pioneer has been effortlessly upending racist and sexist stereotypes for decades, and has picked up several starry showbiz anecdotes along the way. There is also a scream-worthy sex story here that has her loyal audience in hysterics. Best bit: \u201cAsian women have a lot of power. We\u2019re sort of like blondes, but no one thinks we\u2019re stupid.\u201d EEJ Maria Bamford The Special Special Special! Netflix As if Bamford\u2019s standup wasn\u2019t twisted enough, this 2012 set is filmed in her living room, to an audience of just two people \u2013 her mum and dad. Bamford pulls no punches for them, in a claustrophobically intense hour on God, mental health and existential despair. Best bit: \u201cMy mom is very religious, and she said: \u2018Whatever you think about all the time, that\u2019s what you worship.\u2019 If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d like everyone to pop open their Diet Coke cans and turn to page 37 of their People magazines.\u201d BL Mark Thomas Check Up: Our NHS @ 70 Go Faster Stripe (\u00a35) A documentary/comedy show in which Thomas reports back from the frontline of an increasingly privatised NHS, with stories of shadowing staff and interviews with bigwigs. The power of his oratory and his love for the subject makes it an affecting watch. Best bit: The 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony reveal. PF Michelle Wolf Joke Show Netflix Most female standups have feminist material, but Wolf and her distinctive voice never let up, including extended musings on menstruation, childbirth and abortion. It\u2019s all evidence for her central premise: women are grosser than men. And maybe, therefore, funnier too? Best bit: \u201cI would wanna breastfeed, but only because I would want to use breast milk the way a clown uses a flower with water in it.\u201d EEJ Miles Jupp Fibber in the Heat Go Faster Stripe (\u00a35) A true story of derring-do: a young, cricket-obsessed Jupp bluffs his way on to an England tour as a \u201cjournalist\u201d, then rubs shoulders and drinks heavily with his commentator heroes. A metaphorical straight drive for four. Best bit: Drinking with the England captains. PF Mo Gilligan Momentum Netflix A slick power hour from the young comic and Channel 4 chatshow host, recorded last April at a packed Hackney Empire in London. Gilligan recreates classroom trauma and nightclub mating rituals with impudence and swagger. Best bit: A medley of rasta nursery rhymes, including Old MacDonald\u2019s ganja farm. GV Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl Netflix Comedy was the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll as far back as 1982, when the UK\u2019s surrealist supergroup performed a greatest hits set at an iconic LA venue. A cheeky barbershop quartet, silly walks and some disconcerted Mounties all feature. Best bit: Nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more. GV Nish Kumar Soho Theatre Live Sohotheatreondemand.com (\u00a34) Here\u2019s what Britain\u2019s leading political comic would look like if he barely talked politics: a top-notch hour from The Mash Report man on pessimism, ego, insomnia \u2013 and on how he does and doesn\u2019t choose to address race in his comedy. Best bit: The \u201cWhite people? Beyond the odd bit of imperialism \u2026 big fan!\u201d routine. BL The Paddock 24 Unique Live Comedy Acts YouTube A series of short, snappy sets, recreating the anarchic energy of a late night comedy gig. Comics include Edinburgh prize winner Jordan Brookes fantasising about what he could have said after an argument, Kemah Bob as Republican club comic parody Lil\u2019 Test Ease and a monologue about Tom &amp; Jerry from master of oddities Johnny White Really-Really. Best bit: Lola &amp; Jo\u2019s instructional dance class about how to be single at a wedding. HG Phil Wang The Comedy Lineup Netflix Rising UK standup Phil Wang \u2013 last year\u2019s show at the Edinburgh fringe sold out before it opened \u2013 dropped this 15-minute set in 2018 as part of standup collection The Comedy Lineup. He packs a lot in, about horror movies, being mixed race, and the imminent Chinese invasion \u2013 and whets the appetite for more. Best bit: \u201cIf you look at me, and squint really hard \u2013 that\u2019s racist!\u201d BL Rob Delaney Jackie Amazon Prime In middle age, standup can sometimes lapse into comfortable cliche, but the Catastrophe star tackles topics such as weight gain and parenting with a refreshing combination of GI charm and beaming misanthropy. He\u2019s like the Ken Doll Frankie Boyle. Best bit: Confronting his own prejudice: \u201cJust because I dress like a gas station attendant, why can\u2019t he have a little flair and be happy?! Why do I fucking care? But I do.\u201d EEJ Romesh Ranganathan Irrational Amazon Prime The prolific standup\u2019s 2016 debut special sees him bellyaching about Wagamama, Gogglebox and his poor old mum, but crucially the most lacerating observations are about himself. Best bit: \u201cChristmas is difficult at my house because I can\u2019t pretend to be Santa.\u201d Pause. \u201cBecause I have a lazy eye.\u201d GV Sarah Silverman A Speck of Dust Netflix She\u2019s less overtly shocking these days, and perhaps the better for it. Her 2017 show combines personal stories (of her brush with death) and weighty issues (abortion law), with her trademark fearlessness and intelligence. Best bit: Her sister vomiting story. PF Simon Amstell Set Free Netflix With the serenity of someone who\u2019s done a lot of yoga and therapy, Amstell is a different, wiser beast nowadays, but he\u2019s lost none of his sharpness. Set Free sees him navigate monogamy, awkward sex parties and daddy issues. Best bit: His post-MDMA poos. PF Sofie Hagen Live from the BBC BBC iPlayer A brief but handy introduction to a rising star. This 20-minuter, filleted from her 2016 best newcomer show, features material on a sexual encounter gone wrong and her past as a Westlife superfan. Best bit: Her Westlife fan fiction. PF Stewart Lee Content Provider Amazon (\u00a33.49) If the four series of Comedy Vehicle on iPlayer aren\u2019t enough, this savage two-hour show from 2019 doubles down on Lee\u2019s deconstructive impulses and acidic hubris. It also features deadpan debriefs from comics wizard Alan Moore. Best bit: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just racists who voted to leave Europe. Cunts did as well.\u201d GV Tiffany Haddish Black Mitzvah Netflix The Girls Trip star\u2019s hard-knock childhood in South Central LA provides plenty of material, but self-pity isn\u2019t in her repertoire. Instead, she interweaves her raucous anecdotes with homespun scientific theory and a mischievous twinkle that\u2019s utterly beguiling. Best bit: \u201cI\u2019m not no alcoholic. [Takes a sip from her drink] My parasites is the alcoholic.\u201d EEJ Vir Das For India Netflix After two Netflix specials introducing Das to international audiences, with this third instalment he returns the favour by building a bridge of gags to connect his country of birth with second-generation Indian-Americans and non-Indians alike. Best bit: \u201cI have to submit my fingerprint to enter your country, which is why when you come to mine, I take the same fingerprint and put it on your head.\u201d EEJ",

He encountered his toughest management challenge six months after leaving the public sector: potty-training a child who had inherited the pigheaded stubbornness of his parents. One day, I returned from a work trip to find Dan in the kitchen, a pair of trousers in one hand, a nappy in the other, his face the picture of despair. \u201cAt least when I was at work,\u201d he railed, \u201cpeople bloody listened to me occasionally!\u201d</p> <p>There are fundamental things to consider when you\u2019re swapping roles, Major says. You may feel unmoored, cast adrift, unable to fix your new foundations. \u201cRole-swapping can feel very isolating at times. Building new support systems is important to consider in this mix.\u201d Support might come from old or new friends, family or online communities, she adds, but it\u2019s crucial that it begins at home. \u201cRegular communication and conversation between the couple to check if things are working, and how they\u2019re working, is key.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Role-swaps don\u2019t only cause upheaval in relationships like ours, though. Take what happened when Dan Cuthill, a medical copywriter, and his partner Jack Wright, who was then working in visual merchandising for a fashion brand, had it forced upon them. They were buying their first flat together, a dream fixer-upper in London. Dan was freelancing at advertising agencies, earning the money to pay for it. Jack, meanwhile, was spending hours preoccupied with planning their new flat\u2019s decor. Then a bombshell dropped: Jack\u2019s company was moving all operations to Italy and he was offered a huge promotion to run a department. The couple agreed he should take up the position, but initially it was tough. Dan was left to do the \u201chouse stuff\u201d alone, while Jack was often too busy for proper conversations about mutual decisions. It was a complete role reversal. \u201cI\u2019d always been laissez-faire about work,\u201d Jack says, \u201cand now I was doing 14-hour days, replying to texts from Dan at 2am, saying, \u2018You\u2019re doing a great job, thank you\u2019, then falling asleep.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dan felt out of his depth with the practical tasks that Jack did every day (\u201cI\u2019m a colour-blind copywriter,\u201d he points out). All the same, he sorted out plasterers and builders, and turned the flat into a blank canvas for them to work on later, together. \u201cThankfully,\u201d he says, \u201cthat gamble paid off.\u201d After two years, Jack came home; the pair are now setting up a business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We've become more flexible with each other, and things are far less preordained</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their relationship has been improved by the reversal, they say. \u201cWe\u2019ve become more flexible with each other, and things are far less preordained,\u201d Jack explains. \u201cIt\u2019s all, \u2018You cook\u2019, \u2018Oh, all right\u2019 or, every now and then, \u2018Shall we not do that?\u2019\u201d This is possible partly because they stepped out of their comfort zones and learned to trust each other. \u201cPlus,\u201d Dan says, \u201cJack did brilliantly in his job in Italy, as I knew he would. He never thought he could do that, but I did. I\u2019m very proud of him.\u201d</p> <p>Major says that spending a day, a week, or even simply a bit more time, in the other person\u2019s role can be insightful: \u201cWe get to truly understand what they\u2019re doing when we\u2019re not there.\u201d</p> <p>This was a process my Dan and I went through as well. During my maternity leave, I had found it hard to convey how brain-zapping childcare was; Dan got it entirely when he took up the reins. I also found out how it felt to be the person coming in from work, trying to spend time with your family, while your head had been elsewhere all day. It was exhausting. But the realisation that we now understood each other better was instructive and comforting.

      "bodyText": "Blue passports will be issued for the first time in almost three decades from next month to mark Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, the government has announced. They will replace the standard-issue burgundy passports that were rolled out across EU countries from 1988. The home secretary, Priti Patel, welcomed the switch back to blue, but pro-European campaigners and nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland predicted the new passports would result in Britons entering the slow lane at airports and ports throughout the EU. The Home Office says the blue passport will be \u201cthe greenest British passport ever\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe carbon footprint produced through manufacture will be reduced to net zero, through projects such as planting trees.\u201d It is also promoting the passport as the most technologically advanced. The spokesperson said there was \u201ca raft of new and updated security features, including a hard-wearing, super-strength polycarbonate data page, which contains innovative technologies embedded into the document, to keep personal data secure\u201d. The new-look passport incorporates the latest and most secure printing and design techniques, the spokesperson said, which would offer better protection against identity theft and fraud. Patel said: \u201cLeaving the European Union gave us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path in the world. By returning to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one.\u201d The home secretary\u2019s enthusiasm was not shared by the European Movement. Edward McMillan-Scott, the group\u2019s patron and an MEP for 30 years, said the blue passport would be seen as offensive to many Europeans. \u201cIt will be seen as a symbol of the attitude prevailing in the Conservative party towards the rest of Europe that is isolationist, ignorant and self-destructive,\u201d he said. McMillan-Scott said recent scenes captured on Twitter of long queues at passport control in Amsterdam\u2019s Schipol airport involving British tourists were \u201conly the precursor for what is to come with these passports\u201d. He said: \u201cWhen I was an MEP, I remember being given a special blue pass that was meant to make it easier for me to pass through border checks on my way to Brussels and Strasbourg.

I don\u2019t think mine would be worth so much. To become an influencer your timing has to be right, your look has to be right and you have to be super lucky.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2020 to clarify that the research predicting how much money people could make on TikTok was carried out by Online Casinos, not Morning Consult as stated in an earlier version; the latter did research on the popularity of social media influencers.</p>",

It\u2019s happy, and of people doing fun videos. You go there to get uplifted, and it feels less commercial, which could actually make partnerships more valuable. \u201cEndorsements are always valuable, but it can be shocking how one person\u2019s endorsement is worth lots more than other people\u2019s. I don\u2019t think mine would be worth so much. To become an influencer your timing has to be right, your look has to be right and you have to be super lucky.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2020 to clarify that the research predicting how much money people could make on TikTok was carried out by Online Casinos, not Morning Consult as stated in an earlier version; the latter did research on the popularity of social media influencers.",

      "bodyText": "Across university campuses in California on Friday, students and faculty members marched, chanted and waved signs in support of the graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz who have been waging a months-long strike for a cost-of-living-adjustment amid soaring rents. But despite that widespread support, many of those same UC Santa Cruz graduate students were readying themselves for the possibility of losing their teaching jobs and being forced to drop out of school. Since December, 233 graduate student instructors and teaching assistants have refused to submit nearly 12,000 grades from the fall quarter. And as of this month, the strike as expanded to include all teaching and grading duties, with research assistants refusing to do additional work. The students are striking for a $1,412-a-month cost-of-living-adjustment, something they say they desperately need amid the towering rents in Santa Cruz and the growing housing crisis in California. Graduate students at UC Santa Cruz currently make $2,434 a month before taxes, but many students \u201cend up spending 50% and oftentimes 60% to 70% of their wages on rent\u201d, said Jane Komori, a third-year graduate student studying the history of consciousness. \u201cThis cost-of-living-adjustment is what we would require to no longer be rent-burdened. It\u2019s nothing extravagant. The median rent for a one-bedroom in Santa Cruz is nearly $3,000. We\u2019re not asking for that. We\u2019re just asking enough of a wage increase so we can be out of our rent burden, address our other expenses, and teach and research as we\u2019re meant to.\u201d Classes and office hours have been canceled throughout the strike. The administration responded with two supplemental programs that will cost about $7m a year \u2013 one that will offer a yearly $2,500 need-based housing fellowship and another that offers doctoral students a five-year funding program. The supplemental programs would not be nearly enough for graduate students to get by in Santa Cruz, Komori said. Two weeks ago, the students escalated their strike, and one week ago, the University of California president, Janet Napolitano, announced that the strike \u201cwill have consequences, up to and including the termination of existing employment at the University\u201d. Lori Kletzer, the executive vice-chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, set a deadline for 11:59pm Friday for all graduate students to turn in their grades. \u201cWe are giving these students one final opportunity to fulfill their teaching responsibilities and show that they can fulfill future responsibilities,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThose who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.\u201d For many students, that will mean having to drop out of their programs, Komori said. For international students like Komori, who is from Canada, that can put visas at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s a big scary decision for a lot of people, but there\u2019s been a lot of really positive conversations,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing is that our administration hasn\u2019t guaranteed that we won\u2019t face some kind of discipline or retaliation even if we do turn in the grades.

Komori adds that a mass firing could \u201csignificantly affect\u201d the number of courses the school could offer in the next academic quarter. The graduate students are represented by United Auto Workers Local 2865, which negotiated a contract in 2018 that got them a 3% wage increase and included a no-strike clause \u2013 meaning this current strike, known as a \u201cwildcat strike\u201d, has been taken without the union\u2019s approval. More than 80% of the members on campus voted against the contract initially. The administration has cited this as a reason for not negotiating with the graduate students. \u201cTo accede to the demands of a group of employees engaged in an unauthorized wildcat strike would undercut the very foundation of an agreement negotiated in good faith by the UAW and ratified by thousands of members across the system,\u201d Napolitano said. The administration agrees the \u201chousing crisis is complex, systemic, and at the same time, deeply personal for many\u201d, Kletzer wrote. \u201cWhere we differ, however, is in the approach to solve this problem.\u201d Meanwhile, the movement is growing.

The dispute over policy escalated in the week leading up to the caucuses, with the union reporting that its leaders were being trolled by people who said they were Sanders supporters. During the Wednesday night Democratic debate, Sanders disowned any supporters who may have acted inappropriately. It was a rare, contentious moment for the candidate, who largely stayed above the fray during the fiercest debate of the election cycle. Sanders also suggested some of the online vitriol blamed on his supporters might be coming from Russia. On Friday, amid reports US officials had warned Sanders that Russia was trying to help his campaign, Sanders said he learned about the interference a month ago. His communication director said the information was leaked ahead of the Nevada caucuses to sabotage the candidate. \u201cThe Republican establishment is getting nervous,\u201d Sanders told supporters at his rally. \u201cThe Democratic establishment is getting nervous. And they\u2019re going a little bit nuts! \u201cYou know what: when we stand up together, they ain\u2019t gonna stop us.\u201d Nevada\u2019s large labor movement has been divided on Sanders. Whereas the local Culinary Union \u2013 which has not endorsed any candidate \u2013 appeared to implicitly criticize him, the Clark county Education Association, which represents more than 18,000 educators, endorsed Sanders last month. Across the state, Sanders\u2019 ambitious, progressive message seem to have landed with supporters looking for change. Tanya Duncan, a 47-year-old Reno resident. \u201cHe genuinely cares about what he\u2019s doing. He has his heart and soul in it,\u201d said Duncan, who works as a financial analyst. She said she appreciated Sanders\u2019 plans on student debt and healthcare. \u201cHe\u2019s going to negotiate on the side of the people.\u201d",

The super PAC also raised $2 million from financier and philanthropist George Soros\u2019 Democracy PAC, which didn\u2019t give to any big Democratic PACs in 2019.

And in a measure of voter enthusiasm, more black voters said they had reservations about Ms. Klobuchar or Mr. Buttigieg, or were very uncomfortable with their candidacies, than said they were enthusiastic or comfortable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e4fef628f08e133247479b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T15:00:25.334Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mike Bloomberg </strong>has taken his trolling of <strong>Trump </strong>beyond Twitter to Phoenix and Las Vegas, where the president is campaigning today.</p> \n  <p>Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has placed billboards near Trump\u2019s Vegas hotel and along potential motorcade routes as the president heads to his campaign rally later today.</p> \n  <p>The billboards include messages like, \u201cDonald Trump lost the popular vote\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump eats burnt steak.\u201d </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1230866013178167298\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bloomberg campaign's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gslayen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gslayen</a> on the ads: \"Americans deserve to know that Donald Trump cheats at golf and went broke running a casino.\"<br><br>The billboards are placed near Trump's Vegas hotel, on roads to/from the airport, and for several hours on Harmon Corner. <a href=\"https://t.co/3qst7WmXGm\">https://t.co/3qst7WmXGm</a></p>\u2014 Ben Siegel (@benyc) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1230866013178167298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 21, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cAmericans deserve to know that Donald Trump cheats at golf and went broke running a casino,\u201d a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said in a statement.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e4fe8aa8f086a28115affe9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T14:37:59.614Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Larry Kudlow, Trump</strong>\u2019s top economic adviser, said he thought <strong>Roger Stone</strong>\u2019s sentence should be \u201cvacated,\u201d calling the president\u2019s former associate a \u201clongtime friend.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EamonJavers/status/1230854410722578437\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cRoger Stone is a long-time friend of mine, I totally agree with the president,\u201d says Larry Kudlow, adding that he believes Stone\u2019s trial should be vacated.

Either Trump is shorter than he looks, or that\u2019s a big garbage can. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e4fc8b58f08e133247477ba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T12:11:46.646Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US and Taliban say they will sign agreement on 29 February</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The United States and the Taliban will sign an agreement on 29 February at the end of a week long period of violence reduction in Afghanistan, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the Taliban said on Friday.</p> \n  <p>As Reuters reports: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Afghan, international and Taliban forces will observe the reduced violence period beginning at midnight (1930 GMT), an Afghan official and Taliban leaders said earlier. </p> \n   <p>\u201cFollowing lengthy negotiations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States of America, both parties agreed to sign the finalised accord in the presence of international observers,\u201d a Taliban spokesman said in a statement.</p> \n   <p>Both sides would also make arrangements for the release of prisoners, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.</p> \n   <p>Separately, Pompeo said in a statement that the United States and the Taliban have been engaged in talks to facilitate a political settlement in Afghanistan and to reduce the U.S. presence in the region.</p> \n   <p>The agreement will be signed upon the successful implementation of an understanding with the Taliban on a significant and nationwide reduction in violence, Pompeo added.</p> \n   <p>The agreement could represent a chance for peace in the country after years of war and a U.S. troop presence that dates back to 2001.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e4faba38f0811db2fafbbd6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T10:08:34.007Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. </p> \n  <p>It was an eventful evening yesterday in US politics.

      "bodyText": "That does it for me here on the west coast as we close out the blog after a busy afternoon. Let\u2019s take a quick look back at some of the day\u2019s biggest news items: News of the day goes to the revelation that both Trump and Sen. Sanders have been the apparent beneficiaries of Russian interference. But while Trump has continued to minimize and downplay whatever impact Russian trolls may have played in the 2016 election as well as the campaign for re-election in 2020, Sanders has made clear he\u2019s no friend of Vladimir Putin. \u201cHe is an autocratic thug,\u201d Sanders said of the Russian leader. Check out my colleagues Joan\u2019s latest story to read more. Days after Sen. Elizabeth Warren eviscerated Mike Bloomberg onstage at the democratic debate, she again blasted the former NYC mayor for releasing only three accusers from non-disclosure agreements that hav until now bound them to silence. Warren called Bloomberg to issue a blanket release of all accusers if he\u2019s serious about transparency. And as Trump capped a 4-day visit to the western US, he took the opportunity to mock his foes at a mid-day rally. That included more taking more shots at the Oscars and mocking former VP Joe Biden for a lifelong speech impediment that has been widely reported on. Today Trump wrapped a four-day visit to the western US with a rally in Las Vegas, doubling down on his mockery of the Oscars and Joe Biden\u2019s speech impediment as he called on his base to help defeat the \u201cradical socialist Democrats\u201d in November. The ridicule of Biden\u2019s stutter isn\u2019t new. This January the Atlantic focused on Biden\u2019s speech, and the lengths he\u2019s gone to in order to overcome it, in a profile. That didn\u2019t stop Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former White House press secretary, from taking to Twitter to mock Biden\u2019s performance in a debate. And it provoked a response by Biden, himself. Huckabee Sanders was roundly criticized for making the joke, but that didn\u2019t mean it was off limits for Trump, apparently. Talking to the crowd, Trump cracked wise the former vice president\u2019s speech. Democrats in Nevada have once again changed plans for how votes will be tracked in the caucuses, the day before voters cast their ballots. After announcing results would be relayed online via Google form last week, Democrats have seemingly reversed course and decided instead to instruct precinct leaders to call and text votes in to a dedicated hotline, the New York Times reported on Friday. The change was announced through a memo sent by Alana Mounce, the state party\u2019s executive director, to the presidential campaigns. \u201cThe hotline report will be the primary source of the precinct caucus results reported on Caucus Day,\u201d Ms. Mounce wrote. The email made no mention of the Google document forms initially slated to be used for the caucuses. Nevada Democrats initially planned to use the app used in the Iowa caucuses but abandoned those plans after the first state\u2019s caucus went terribly wrong due to technological issues. Nevada, like Iowa, adopted new rules from the Democratic National Committee this year requiring states to report three sets of numbers from the caucuses: the initial vote number, the number of votes a candidate receives after \u201crealignment\u201d \u2013 when voters choose new candidates if their top choice fails to receive enough support \u2013 and the number of state delegates ultimately awarded to candidates. In order to report these numbers, volunteers are expected to use a caucus \u201ctool\u201d on iPads distributed by the Democratic party to precinct chairs. This is meant to help avoid some of the technical difficulties experienced in Iowa by chairs unable to download the app. Nevada Democrats were reportedly consulting with Google on best practices for using the document forms, but Google did not confirm. Nevada Democrats did not respond to request for comment regarding the change. Cash-strapped democratic candidates are relying more and more on super PACs, which can raise unlimited money. That\u2019s one takeaway from a new report from Politico, which says it got its first look this week at how the start of the presidential primaries are shaping the money chase. Other takeaways include: The Democratic Party\u2019s biggest donors are getting in on the action. \u201cPriorities USA, the main Democratic super PAC preparing to back the party\u2019s nominee against Trump, took in $5 million from hedge fund magnate Donald Sussman in January \u2014 more than double the biggest check Sussman cut in 2019. The super PAC also raised $2 million from financier and philanthropist George Soros\u2019 Democracy PAC, which didn\u2019t give to any big Democratic PACs in 2019. And it raised $1 million from real estate broker George Marcus, who only donated big money to downballot causes in 2019,\u201d Politico reports. Big differences in cash will lead to big differences in airtime. Sanders, Bloomberg and financier Tom Steyer have all dropped big money on TV ads and bought more than $2m of upcoming airtime. Bloomberg has earmarked $10m for ads in coming days. Joe Biden and ex-South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, meanwhile, don\u2019t have any television airtime currently reserved in Super-Tuesday states. Klobuchar\u2019s third-place finish in New Hampshire primary was preceded by January fundraising bump She took in $5.5m in January \u2014 close to Buttigieg\u2019s $6.6 million but well shy of Biden\u2019s $8.9 m. Trump\u2019s cash dwarfs the rest of the field\u2019s. Except Bloomberg\u2019s. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee have netted $452 million since January 2019. Bloomberg, meanwhile, has said he may spend $1 billion to defeat Trump this year. The former NYC mayor has nearly outspending every other candidate after spending $409 million through January, according to Politico. Mike Bloomberg said Friday that three women who made complaints against him and until now have been covered by non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, can be released from the agreements and speak openly about their experiences. CNN has publicly identified a woman behind one of those NDAs, reporting: \u201cA senior Bloomberg adviser tells CNN that the woman behind one of the three NDAs is Sekiko Garrison, who accused Bloomberg in the 1990s of repeatedly saying crass things in the workplace. Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser has said that Bloomberg \u201cdid not make any of the statements alleged in the Sekiko Garrison case.\u201d But Elizabeth Warren, who took Bloomberg to the woodshed on live TV during this week\u2019s debate, quickly called out the former New York mayor, saying that the situation calls for a blanket release of all accusers. Here\u2019s a dispatch from our west coast political reporter Maanvi Singh from Nevada, where she\u2019s on the ground keeping an eye on the lead up to tomorrow\u2019s caucus: Another group that 2020 hopefuls are hoping to win over are senior citizens. Several campaigns have stopped by the MLK senior center in North Las Vegas. Jill Biden didn\u2019t make it to a monthly birthday celebration there today, choosing not to cross a Carpenters Union picket line protesting working conditions at a nearby construction site, according to the Biden campaign. The campaign offered to transport anyone interested to a Biden rally in the evening. On Thursday, Joaquin Castro dropped by the center. And Tom Steyer visited last week. At the Friday event \u2014 where attendees were happy to eat and dance with or without Biden \u2014 Marshall Collins, 90, said he\u2019d already voted early. \u201cI voted for Biden,\u201d he said -- though he\u2019s happy to vote for any Democrats. \u201cI hope things come together in the election. There\u2019s too many Democrats right now.\u201d Collins\u2019 second choice is Steyer, he said. \u201cAll I care\u201d \u2014 regardless of who the candidate is \u2014 \u201cis if he does what he says he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Collins said. David Outland, 60, was another Biden supporter. \u201cI like sleepy Joe,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cHe probably had more experience than anyone else.\u201d Outland said he wishes the candidates would reach out more to older Nevadans. \u201cBoots on the ground, like we used to do,\u201d he said. He\u2019d like to know more about the other candidates, he said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s too confusing.\u201d The former Vice President is the only one he\u2019s familiar with. Yvette, 62, who said didn\u2019t want to use her full name because she didn\u2019t want Trump supporters to come after her on Facebook, said she\u2019s going to vote for any Democrat. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my benefits because Trump got pissed,\u201d she said. \u201cOr to have our kids locked up.\u201d As we blog, pundits on CNN discuss the interesting dynamic between Sanders and Trump that today\u2019s news on Russian interference sets up. While Sanders has both acknowledged and condemned Russian interference across the board, Donald Trump and his supporters have continued to dismiss and downplay the role Russian actors may have played in getting him elected. The New York Times reported today that US intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign in an effort to re-elect Trump. The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, the president berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump was particularly irritated that Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the leader of the impeachment proceedings, was at the briefing. During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump\u2019s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he had been tough on Russia and that he had strengthened European security... Mr. Trump has long accused the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russia\u2019s 2016 interference as the work of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy intent on undermining the validity of his election. Intelligence officials feel burned by their experience after the last election, when their work became a subject of intense political debate and is now a focus of a Justice Department investigation. Pundits note that it will be interesting to see how Trump responds as he\u2019s potentially pulled between two conflicting impulses: To throw mud at Sanders and his position as a frontrunner versus the desire to protect the legitimacy of his presidency. Today\u2019s surprise Russian-interference news aside, Sanders\u2019 campaign marches on in their efforts to reach out to Latino voters in often overlooked corners of California. Sanders emerged early on as a front-runner in California, a position his campaign has attributed to a massive ground game across the Golden State. Young Latino voters in particular have embraced the Vermont senator for his history of supporting unions and taking to the streets in protest. Reuters has more on the efforts in California: A record 32 million Latinos are projected to be eligible to vote in the general election, exceeding the number of black eligible voters for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center. About 62% of Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 34% affiliate with or lean to the Republican Party, the organization says... Across California, and in neighboring Nevada and Texas, the Sanders campaign has also put on soccer matches and house parties, some billed as \u201cTamales for T\u00edo Bernie,\u201d an affectionate Spanish-language term for \u201cUncle Bernie.\u201d The campaign wants to be deeply embedded in Latino communities, said Bianca Recto, communications director for the campaign in Nevada. She said at least half of the 200 paid staff on the ground ahead of the caucuses are people of color, many of them locals. \u201cIt\u2019s Bernie\u2019s message that resonates to the economic hardships of people and not treating constituencies as if they\u2019re a monolith, as if they\u2019re a one-issue voter,\u201d Recto said. As news trickles out that the Russian government is currently working to aid Sen. Sanders through online disinformation tactics, the Vermont Senator has suggested that a recent dust-up over purported Sanders supporters and culinary workers in Nevada can be traced to Russian bots. Sanders said in a statement:\u201cIn 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.\u201d After the culinary union distributed flyers that was critical of Sanders\u2019 health care plan and broadly supportive of Warren\u2019s, members of the union-members said they received threatening messages from who they believed to be Sanders supporters, or so-called Bernie Bros. So far no evidence has been reported that ties Russian interference to the controversy. US officials told Bernie Sanders that the Russian government is working to help him secure the Democratic nomination, the Washington Post reported Friday. And new reports are emerging that Sanders knew a month ago about the interference. Asked why the news is only coming out now, Sanders pointed to the Nevada caucuses and suggested media was to blame. Unlike Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed the role Russia may have played in the last election, Sanders has acknowledged the meddling, but has worked to distance himself from Russia and Putin. \u201cI don\u2019t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cMy message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Mario Koran, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Bernie Sanders has reportedly been briefed on Russian efforts to aid his presidential campaign, which the Vermont senator denounced in a statement. Trump dismissed reports of Russia\u2019s preference for him in the 2020 election as \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Mike Bloomberg said he would release three women who complained about comments he allegedly made from non-disclosure agreements, after Elizabeth Warren criticized his company\u2019s use of the contracts. A new poll showed Bloomberg\u2019s favorability dropping by about 20 points after his widely panned debate performance on Wednesday. The White House is reportedly trying to identify \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d serving in the administration to block them from promotion. Mario will have more coming up, so stay tuned. In light of the report that Russia is attempting to interfere in the Democratic presidential primary to benefit Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s worth returning to this earlier tweet from the former CIA chief of Russian operations on the Kremlin\u2019s reported preference for Trump: Bernie Sanders denounced Russia\u2019s reported efforts to interfere with the 2020 election on the Vermont senator\u2019s behalf. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I do not consider Vladimir Putin a good friend. He is an autocratic thug who is attempting to destroy democracy and crush dissent in Russia,\u201d Sanders said of the Russian president. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the Russians want to undermine American democracy by dividing us up and, unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts, and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election.\u201d Reiterating his claim from Wednesday night\u2019s debate, Sanders suggested some of the online vitriol blamed on his supporters may be coming from Russia. \u201cSome of the ugly stuff on the internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters,\u201d Sanders said. During this week\u2019s debate, Bernie Sanders suggested \u201cvicious attacks\u201d against Nevada\u2019s Culinary Union, which were blamed on his supporters, may be coming from Russia. \u201cAll of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s happening, but it would not shock me.\u201d Twitter responded by saying that it would have disclosed any evidence it collected of a disinformation campaign. The news about Russian efforts to aid Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign comes one day after reports emerged that the Kremlin was interfering with the 2020 election to benefit Trump. The president pushed back against the reports of Russia\u2019s preference for him by suggesting Vladimir Putin would rather have one of the \u201cdo-nothing Democrats\u201d in the White House. \u201cWouldn\u2019t he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?\u201d Trump said moments ago at his Las Vegas rally. \u201cThese people are crazy.\u201d Bernie Sanders has reportedly been briefed on Russian efforts to aid his presidential campaign. The Washington Post reports: President Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also been informed about the Russian assistance to the Vermont senator, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. It is not clear what form that Russian assistance has taken. U.S. prosecutors found a Russian effort in 2016 to use social media to boost Sanders campaign against Hillary Clinton, part of a broader effort to hurt Clinton, sow dissension in the American electorate and ultimately help elect Donald Trump. \u2018I don\u2019t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,\u2019 Sanders said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u2018My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.\u2019 In his statement addressing the non-disclosure agreements, Mike Bloomberg acknowledged that such contracts can be harmful to workplace culture. \u201cI recognize that NDAs, particularly when they are used in the context of sexual harassment and sexual assault, promote a culture of silence in the workplace and contribute to a culture of women not feeling safe or supported,\u201d Bloomberg said. Compare that to what he said on Wednesday\u2019s debate stage: \u201cThey signed those agreements, and we\u2019ll live with it.\u201d Elizabeth Warren was the first of Bloomberg\u2019s opponents to raise the issue of the NDAs during the debate, but other candidates quickly piled on. \u201cYou think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don\u2019t want anybody to know about what you did to me? That\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Joe Biden said. \u201cThe way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d It is important to note, however, that Mike Bloomberg is not releasing everyone who signed one of his company\u2019s non-disclosure agreements. Bloomberg is only allowing three women who complained about his alleged comments to be released from the agreements they signed. A number of political commentators marveled at the fact that it took Mike Bloomberg two full days after the debate to release a statement about the non-disclosure agreements. Bloomberg appeared blindsided when Elizabeth Warren raised the issue on Wednesday\u2019s debate stage, which was surprising considering the former New York mayor\u2019s history of making sexist comments was thoroughly reported in the days leading up to the debate. Mike Bloomberg responded to criticism over his company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment claims by saying he would release three women who complained about comments he allegedly made from their non-disclosure agreements. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of reflecting on this issue over the past few days and I\u2019ve decided that for as long as I\u2019m running the company, we won\u2019t offer confidentiality agreements to resolve claims of sexual harassment or misconduct going forward,\u201d Bloomberg said. Elizabeth Warren raised the issue of the NDAs during Wednesday night\u2019s debate, pressing Bloomberg to commit to releasing the men and women who signed them from legal jeopardy. \u201cNone of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn\u2019t like a joke I told,\u201d Bloomberg said of the NDAs. \u201cThere\u2019s agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and that\u2019s up to them. They signed those agreements, and we\u2019ll live with it.\u201d The Nevada Democratic Party is asking site leaders for tomorrow\u2019s caucuses to sign non-disclosure agreements, according to CNN. Nevada is the first state to hold caucuses since the disastrous Iowa contest earlier this month, which resulted in a days-long delay in reporting of results. Democratic leaders in Nevada have said they have taken steps to prevent that sort of chaos, but the NDAs certainly don\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence on that front. Echoing his earlier tweet, Trump dismissed reports of Russia interfering in the 2020 election to benefit him as \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cHere we go again,\u201d said Trump, who has previously cast doubt upon the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election to help him beat Hillary Clinton. \u201cAren\u2019t people bored?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. He went on to argue that Russian President Vladimir Putin would rather have one of the \u201cdo-nothing Democrats\u201d as president. \u201cWouldn\u2019t he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese people are crazy.\u201d At his Las Vegas rally, Trump once again lamented the South Korean film \u201cParasite\u201d winning best picture at the 2020 Academy Awards. \u201cThe movie was made in South Korea,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey used to call it best foreign movie. Now, we do it that way. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d The president made a similar comment yesterday during his Colorado Springs rally, prompting this comeback from the film\u2019s movie studio: Trump has taken the stage for his Las Vegas campaign rally, his third this week. The president kicked off by mocking Democrats for their mishandling of the Iowa caucuses and predicting the chaos would be repeated in tomorrow\u2019s Nevada caucuses. \u201cI hear their computers are all messed up, just like they were in Iowa,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey can\u2019t count votes.\u201d Democratic officials in Nevada are taking preemptive steps to try to avoid the days-long delay in reporting of results that occurred in Iowa. A new poll taken after this week\u2019s debate shows Mike Bloomerg\u2019s favorability down 20 points among likely Democratic primary voters. Bloomberg\u2019s overall level of support dropped 3 points in the Morning Consult poll, putting him behind Joe Biden as Bernie Sanders maintains a double-digit lead. No other candidate besides Bloomberg saw a statistically significant swing in support, considering the poll\u2019s 2-point margin of error. Additional polls will be needed to confirm whether Bloomberg\u2019s support is indeed falling, but the survey indicates the former New York mayor\u2019s campaign might be on rocky ground after his widely panned debate performance on Wednesday. Trump will soon take the stage for his Las Vegas campaign rally, his third this week after appearances in Phoenix and Colorado Springs. Trump has been counterprogramming the early contests in the Democratic presidential primary by holding rallies in the same states that are voting. He has already done this before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and Nevada will hold its caucuses tomorrow. Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who became a key figure in Trump\u2019s impeachment, reportedly has a book deal. The AP reports: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt confirmed Friday to The Associated Press that it had acquired Yovanovitch\u2019s planned memoir, currently untitled. According to the publisher, the book will trace her long career, from Mogadishu, Somalia, to Kyiv and \u2018finally back to Washington, D.C. \u2014 where, to her dismay, she found a political system beset by many of the same challenges she had spent her career combating overseas.\u2019 \u2018Yovanovitch\u2019s book will deliver pointed reflections on the issues confronting America today, and thoughts on how we can shore up our democracy,\u2019 Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said in an announcement. Yovanovitch testified to House investigators in November that she was pushed out her role in Kyiv, after decades of foreign service, because of a smear campaign by the president\u2019s allies, namely Rudy Giuliani. A number of prominent Democrats offered birthday wishes to John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights icon who is turning 80 today. Lewis announced late last year that he has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer but said he would continue his work in Congress despite his illness. \u201cI have been in some kind of fight -- for freedom, equality, basic human rights -- for nearly my entire life. I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now,\u201d Lewis, who marched alongside Martin Luther King, said at the time. \u201cWhile I am clear-eyed about the prognosis, doctors have told me that recent medical advances have made this type of cancer treatable in many cases, that treatment options are no longer as debilitating as they once were, and that I have a fighting chance. ... I may miss a few votes during this period, but with God\u2019s grace I will be back on the front lines soon.\u201d All senators will reportedly receive a briefing on election security on March 10, after intelligence officials briefed the House intelligence committee last week. Following reports of intelligence officials telling commitee members Russia is interfering in the 2020 election, Nancy Pelosi announced last night that all House members would receive a similar briefing on March 10. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is blaming some vandalism at their campaign offices on supporters of Bernie Sanders, despite lacking any proof. \u201cThis latest incident at our Knoxville campaign office is exactly what we\u2019ve been warning about,\u201d Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who is responsible for this vandalism, but we do know it echoes language from the Sanders campaign and its supporters.\u201d Some of Sanders\u2019 opponents have accused the frontrunner candidate of enabling online vitriol by not denouncing certain supporters\u2019 behavior strongly enough. After Nevada\u2019s Culinary Union distributed a flier criticizing Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan, union leaders said they were the subject of \u201cvicious attacks\u201d from the Vermont senator\u2019s supporters. Sanders condemned that behavior, but Pete Buttigieg raised the issue again during this week\u2019s debate. \u201cLeadership is about what you draw out of people,\u201d the former Indiana mayor said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you inspire people to act.\u201d But Sanders blamed the attacks on \u201ca few people who make ugly remarks\u201d and \u201care not part of our movement.\u201d Mike Bloomberg\u2019s billboards denouncing Trump for, among other things, losing the popular vote and cheating at golf are clearly visible on the Strip in Las Vegas, where the president is campaigning today. Trump will hold a campaign rally in Las Vegas in about an hour and a half, and it seems likely the president will have some comments about \u201cMini Mike,\u201d as he calls the former New York mayor. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The White House is reportedly trying to identify \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d serving in the administration to block them from promotion. Trump dismissed reports of Russia\u2019s preference for him in the 2020 race as a Democratic \u201cmisinformation campaign.\u201d The president said he is considering four candidates for the role of director of national intelligence, although congressman Doug Collins said he would not take the job, despite Trump naming him as a possibility yesterday. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Some government officials are blaming House intelligence commitee Democrats for asking \u201cleading questions\u201d during last week\u2019s election security briefing in order to hear an assessment that Russia favors Trump in this year\u2019s race. Bloomberg News reports: In response to questions from Democrats, lawmakers were told that Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, prefer Trump over his Democratic challengers and is still actively interfering in this year\u2019s election, according to the people. But little information has emerged on any specific or ongoing interference by Russia detailed in the briefing last week. The information provided to the committee was described by one official as more of a general assessment. Democrats asked leading questions to obtain the analysis that Russia favors Trump\u2019s re-election, according to a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter. The White House suspects Democrats hoped the intelligence analysis would be leaked, an official said. ... The president expressed his frustration to [acting director of national intelligence Joseph] Maguire in an Oval Office meeting the day after the House briefing, according to officials. Trump was told that [Shelby] Pierson, who delivered the briefing, felt her comments were being misrepresented and that she could only say that the Russians were continuing to interfere in U.S. politics -- not that they were putting a finger on the scale to help Trump. It\u2019s unclear which four candidates Trump is considering for the job of director of national intelligence, but one frontrunner for the role has already ruled it out. The president told reporters yesterday that he was considering Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary commitee, for the job. But Collins, who is running for a Senate seat in Georgia, said he would not take the job in an interview this morning. \u201cThis is not a job that\u2019s of interest to me at this time, and it\u2019s not one that I\u2019d accept,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEverybody knows I\u2019m a supporter of the president, they know how much I supported him through sham impeachment and everything else,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m running against a senator who was just newly appointed who decided to support the president three weeks before she got the appointment.\u201d Collins has launched a primary challenge to senator Kelly Loeffler, who was recently appointed to Georgia\u2019s vacant seat and has since been backed by Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm. After Trump dismissed reports of Russia\u2019s preference for him in the 2020 race as a Democratic \u201cmisinformation campaign,\u201d the former CIA chief of Russian operations tweeted this: House intelligence committee Republicans reportedly pushed back against intelligence officials\u2019 conclusion that the Kremlin was interfering in the 2020 campaign to aid Trump, arguing the president has been tough on Russia. But Trump has repeatedly cast doubt upon the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered with the 2016 race and has peddled the baselss claim that it was actually Ukraine who meddled in the election. In her testimony during the impeachement hearings, Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia expert, called the accusation against Ukraine a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d pushed by Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announced a round of congressional endorsements today through her Courage to Change political action committee, which she launched last month. The New York Times has more details on the initiative: The endorsements of the congressional candidates \u2014 including one who is challenging Senate Democrats\u2019 preferred candidate in Texas \u2014 amount to a powerful stamp of approval for a diverse group of newcomers. They also are a clear sign that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a celebrity of the liberal left, intends to leverage her influence among activists to try to reshape the Democratic Party. ... Her own upset victory in 2018 over a 20-year Democratic congressman has inspired a slew of Democratic primary challenges across the nation targeting powerful incumbents \u2014 though many have little chance of winning. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who toppled a top party leader in her primary election, has carefully selected the races in which she is intervening with an eye for districts where her seal of approval would help the primary challenger prevail. Trump\u2019s newly installed head of the Presidential Personnel Office, Johnny McEntee, is reportedly instructing administration officials to identify \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d and block them from promotion. Axios reports: Johnny McEntee called in White House liaisons from cabinet agencies for an introductory meeting Thursday, in which he asked them to identify political appointees across the U.S. government who are believed to be anti-Trump, three sources familiar with the meeting tell Axios. ... But McEntee suggested the most dramatic changes may have to wait until after the November election. Trump has empowered McEntee \u2014 whom he considers an absolute loyalist \u2014 to purge the \u2018bad people\u2019 and \u2018Deep State.\u2019 McEntee told staff that those identified as anti-Trump will no longer get promotions by shifting them around agencies. As a reminder, McEntee was previously fired from the White House by former chief of staff John Kelly because he had been denied a security clearance, partly due to an online gambling problem. Trump also said moments ago that his administration would continue offering subsidies to farmers until various trade deals \u201cfully kick in.\u201d Over the past two years, the Trump administration has spent $28 billion on subsidies to farmers harmed by the president\u2019s trade wars. Last year marked a 14-year high in payments to the nation\u2019s farmers. Some critics of the policy have complained that the substantial funds are a means of appeasing some of the president\u2019s supporters and that they come at the expense of other programs, like food stamps. Trump is on a tweeting streak, now saying he has \u201cfour great candidates\u201d for the role of director of national intelligence. Trump announced Wednesday that Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany and one of the president\u2019s most loyal allies, would replace Joseph Maguire as the acting director of national intelligence. Maguire had been considered a frontrunner for the permanent job, but Trump reportedly soured on that prospect after one of Maguire\u2019s staffers briefed the House intelligence commitee on Russian election interference last week. Reacting to Russia\u2019s alleged election interference in the 2020 campaign, Trump dismissed reports of the Kremlin\u2019s preference for him as a Democratic \u201cmisinformation campaign.\u201d The president had repeatedly cast doubt upon the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 race to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. During the impeachment inquiry and trial, the president and his allies repeatedly pushed the debunked claim that Ukraine was the one who had meddled in the 2016 race. It now appears Trump is looking to cast doubt upon the latest news of Russian election interference as well. Nancy Pelosi said last night that all House members would receive a briefing on election security following reports of Trump\u2019s anger at intelligence officials for briefing lawmakers on Russian interference in the 2020 campaign. Officials briefed the House intelligence commitee last week on Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to sway the 2020 election in Trump\u2019s favor, but this briefing would be for all members. Joe Biden is counting on strong performances in Nevada tomorrow and South Carolina next week to reinvigorate his presidential campaign after disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden has especially pointed to South Carolina, where more than half of primary voters were African American in 2016, as the launchpad for his candidacy. However, a new poll shows Biden and Bernie Sanders are now essentially tied with black voters, who had tilted strongly in favor of Biden until recently. The Wall Street Journal reports: Mr. Biden has long bet that his strong support among black voters would be the linchpin of his candidacy. Journal/NBC News surveys in 2019 found that about half of black voters who said they would participate in Democratic primaries named Mr. Biden as their top choice for nominee. In the new poll, both he and Mr. Sanders had support from just under one-third of black voters. ... The survey found that black Democrats have reservations about several candidates who fared well in Iowa and New Hampshire: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both drew single-digit support when black Democratic primary voters were asked their top choice for nominee. And in a measure of voter enthusiasm, more black voters said they had reservations about Ms. Klobuchar or Mr. Buttigieg, or were very uncomfortable with their candidacies, than said they were enthusiastic or comfortable. Mike Bloomberg has taken his trolling of Trump beyond Twitter to Phoenix and Las Vegas, where the president is campaigning today. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has placed billboards near Trump\u2019s Vegas hotel and along potential motorcade routes as the president heads to his campaign rally later today. The billboards include messages like, \u201cDonald Trump lost the popular vote\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump eats burnt steak.\u201d \u201cAmericans deserve to know that Donald Trump cheats at golf and went broke running a casino,\u201d a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said in a statement. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said he thought Roger Stone\u2019s sentence should be \u201cvacated,\u201d calling the president\u2019s former associate a \u201clongtime friend.\u201d Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison yesterday for obstructing the congressional Russia investigation, and his allies are now angling for a presidential pardon. Speaking in Las Vegas yesterday, Trump said he wanted to see Stone\u2019s case \u201cplay out\u201d in the courts, but he did not rule out the possibility of an eventual pardon. Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates said Trump\u2019s reported frustration with intelligence officials for briefing lawmakers on Russian election interference is a \u201cscreaming red siren.\u201d Yates was famously dismissed from her role as acting attorney general in 2017, when she instructed the justice department not to defend Trump\u2019s travel ban. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Paul Owen. We are just one day away from the Nevada caucuses, and Democratic leaders in the state are expressing confidence that they will avoid the chaos of the Iowa caucuses. Speaking of the Iowa caucuses, the recanvass of results is still ongoing, as Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are neck-and-neck in the state delegate equivalent column. The Des Moines Register reports: The campaigns for Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg each requested full recounts of 63 Iowa caucus precincts, according to the Iowa Democratic Party. Sanders, a U.S. Senator for Vermont, requested a recount for 10 precincts; Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, asked for a recount of of 54 precincts. One precinct was duplicated. The party will respond to the requests within 48 hours of receiving the recount requests. Party officials will give an estimated time to complete the recount if the requests are deemed valid. The two candidates are virtually tied in state delegate equivalents, the traditional measure of victory in the caucus, although a recount of presidential preference cards filed by caucusgoers could change that. Under current reporting, Buttigieg holds a 14-12 lead over Sanders in national delegates from Iowa. As a reminder, the AP, the outlet of record for elections, has so far refused to declare a winner in the Feb. 3 caucuses because of inconsistencies in the results and the race\u2019s razor-thin margin. Former congressman Dana Rohrabacher has confirmed that he told Julian Assange that Donald Trump would give him a pardon if he gave him information proving that Russians had not been the source of the leaked Democratic emails that are thought to have been part of Moscow\u2019s campaign to swing the 2016 for Trump. The WikiLeaks chief\u2019s lawyers said in court in London on Wednesday that Rohrabacher had offered the pardon on Trump\u2019s behalf. The White House denied that claimed Trump \u201cbarely knows\u201d the former Republican politician. (Trump invited him to a White House meeting in 2017.) Rohrabacher \u2013 known as one of the most pro-Russian politicians in Washington \u2013 told Yahoo News: I spoke to Julian Assange and told him if he would provide evidence about who gave WikiLeaks the emails I would petition the president to give him a pardon. He knew I could get to the president. He said he did not discuss the issue directly with Trump, and said he only wanted \u201ctruthful\u201d information from Assange. He apparently believes a conspiracy theory that Seth Rich, a murdered former Democratic staffer, was the true source of the leak. The pardon claim was made before the opening next week of Assange\u2019s legal battle to block attempts to extradite him to the US, where he faces charges for publishing hacked documents. The Kremlin has responded to the reports that US intelligence officials briefed members of Congress that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election to boost Donald Trump \u2013 as the intelligence community believes it did in 2016. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: These are more paranoid announcements which, to our regret, will multiply as we get closer to the election. They have nothing to do with the truth. The Kremlin denies meddling in the 2016 election too. It\u2019s been another wild week in American politics, with a Democratic debate shaking up the field again and Donald Trump tangling with the justice system in multiple dramatic ways. But who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down as Nevada gets ready to vote in the primary race on Saturday? 5/5: Elizabeth Warren It feels like each of the main Democratic candidates is being given their chance to shine, and this week it was Elizabeth Warren\u2019s. Shedding her usual professorial demeanor, the leftwing Massachusetts senator tore into billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg as he struggled to shake off numerous scandals this week. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against: a billionaire who calls women \u2018fat broads\u2019 and \u2018horse-faced lesbians\u2019,\u201d Warren said at the beginning of Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump, I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d Warren saw her best day of fundraising yet following the debate, and will be hoping to see the same kind of boost rival Amy Klobuchar got at the ballot box following her strong debate performance in New Hampshire. The Massachusetts liberal is neck and neck with Pete Buttigieg for third place in Nevada on Saturday \u2013 if she can overtake Joe Biden and reach second she may give her campaign the jolt of energy she has been waiting for. 4/5: Bernie Sanders The leftwing Vermont senator is now firmly in pole position, with a 14-point lead going into Nevada and an 11-point lead over the rest of the Democratic field nationally. Will the Democratic establishment now unite behind a centrist who could block Sanders\u2019 progress? If so, they need to get their act together fast. If Sanders wins, will Democratic elites fall in behind a man who has never joined their party and whom many see as a cuckoo in the nest? Maybe they\u2019ll be forced to \u2013 polling shows Democratic voters aren\u2019t worried about Sanders in the way the party\u2019s bigwigs seem to be. Could this unapologetic socialist beat Donald Trump? That\u2019s the great unknown. But as Sanders is fond of pointing out, he consistently polls ahead of the president nationally and in some swing states. Sanders outrider Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested this week he could end up compromising on his sweeping healthcare proposals \u2013 perhaps baby steps towards an eventual rapprochement between Sanders and the party hierarchy. 3/5: Roger Stone Well, he didn\u2019t get nine years in jail\u2026 but Trump\u2019s longtime friend and aide will not have been delighted with his 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Stone remains free while he appeals against the sentence, and Trump \u2013 who was criticised by his own attorney general for interfering with the case \u2013 said on Thursday he wanted to see that process \u201cplayed out\u201d before getting involved formally. \u201cI would love to see Roger exonerated,\u201d the president said, leaving open the possibility of a pardon if his friend is not. Trump showed again this week how willing he is to use that power, issuing several pardons and commutations to people found guilty of public corruption \u2013 and perhaps paving the way for an eventual more controversial one for Stone. 2/5: Michael Bloomberg Political junkies were openly slavering at the prospect of the former New York mayor joining the Democratic field on the debate stage for the first time this week \u2013 something only possible because the party changed its rules on qualification. Yet it came after the unearthing of controversy after controversy about Bloomberg \u2013 from his alleged sexist and misogynistic remarks as a boss, to anti-trans, anti-black and anti-Latino remarks and continued ill feeling about the discriminatory impact of his policing policy. His fellow Democrats hit him again and again during the debate, with Warren leading the charge. In response he was stiff, high-handed and somewhat testy. \u201cNone of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn\u2019t like a joke I told,\u201d he said about staff who had signed non-disclosure agreements \u2013 which sounded perhaps less exculpatory than he imagined. Sanders even managed to point out that Bloomberg, like him, had had heart problems. \u201cWe both have two stents!\u201d the socialist senator exclaimed memorably. 1/5: Stephen Miller and his wife The level of partisanship in the US being what it is, the New York Times including the wedding of Trump\u2019s controversial immigration adviser to Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary in its soft-focus high-society nuptials column was never going to pass without comment. The two \u201cboth work in the Trump White House\u201d, the article noted benignly, although a link to a piece about \u201cThe White Nationalist Websites Cited by Stephen Miller\u201d did sort of give the game away. As liberal Twitter expressed its outrage, comedian Samantha Bee set up a registry sending gifts to immigration charities in the couple\u2019s honour \u2013 which was then contributed to by Miller\u2019s uncle, a frequent critic of his nephew. Miller has been the driving force behind Trump administration policies such as the Muslim ban and family separation at the border, and is thought to be the speechwriter behind some of Trump\u2019s most alarming nativist addresses. 0/5: A man who has a life-size emotional support cut-out of Trump The US transportation department has proposed a crackdown on some of the more outlandish emotional-support animals people have been taking with them on planes, including peacocks, ducks, pigs and iguanas. But no one said anything about life-size cut-outs of Donald Trump, until Nelson Gibson of Florida took his with him to a doctor\u2019s appointment. \u201cThey told me it was too much and it wasn\u2019t a rally,\u201d he lamented to TV station WPBF, after having happily got away with bringing a picture of Trump and a small cut-out of himself with the president to previous appointments. The life-size cardboard likeness, it seemed, crossed the line. \u201cWhat I would really like to happen is for them not to infringe upon my father\u2019s freedom of expression and speech and allow him to bring in the life-size cardboard cutout that takes up less service area than a garbage can,\u201d the man\u2019s son said. Either Trump is shorter than he looks, or that\u2019s a big garbage can. The United States and the Taliban will sign an agreement on 29 February at the end of a week long period of violence reduction in Afghanistan, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the Taliban said on Friday. As Reuters reports: Afghan, international and Taliban forces will observe the reduced violence period beginning at midnight (1930 GMT), an Afghan official and Taliban leaders said earlier. \u201cFollowing lengthy negotiations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States of America, both parties agreed to sign the finalised accord in the presence of international observers,\u201d a Taliban spokesman said in a statement. Both sides would also make arrangements for the release of prisoners, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. Separately, Pompeo said in a statement that the United States and the Taliban have been engaged in talks to facilitate a political settlement in Afghanistan and to reduce the U.S. presence in the region. The agreement will be signed upon the successful implementation of an understanding with the Taliban on a significant and nationwide reduction in violence, Pompeo added. The agreement could represent a chance for peace in the country after years of war and a U.S. troop presence that dates back to 2001. Good morning. It was an eventful evening yesterday in US politics. Here\u2019s what you might have missed: US intelligence officials are reported to have warned members of Congress last week that Russia was trying to interfere in the 2020 election campaign in favour of Donald Trump, in a briefing that led to the abrupt removal of the acting director of national intelligence. Roger Stone, a longtime ally of Trump\u2019s and a self-described political dirty trickster, was sentenced to more than three years in prison for his attempts to sabotage a congressional investigation that posed a political threat to the president. After his sentencing, a representative for Stone urged Trump to \u201cright this horrible wrong\u201d and pardon him \u2013 before the president suggested he might do so. A heavily edited video of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s performance at Wednesday\u2019s Democratic debate in Nevada has prompted fresh questions about disinformation policies on social media platforms. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s strong debate performance has re-energized her campaign and fired up supporters in Nevada before the state\u2019s Democratic caucuses. Trump has taken a typically bizarre jab at the Oscars for awarding this year\u2019s best picture honor to Parasite, because the film is South Korean. \u201cThe winner is a movie from South Korea, what the hell was that all about?\u201d Trump asked at a rally. \u201cWe got enough problems with South Korea with trade and on top of it, they give them the best movie of the year.\u201d Today, Trump and vice-president Mike Pence will hold a rally in Las Vegas, an event obviously meant to wind up the Democrats as they get ready for the next vote in their primary season in Nevada tomorrow. Leading Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Amy Klobuchar are all campaigning there today. Mike Bloomberg is not on the ballot \u2013 he is joining the race on 3 March for Super Tuesday. Sanders \u2013 the socialist Vermont senator who is now the frontrunner in the Democratic race \u2013 seems to have increased his lead in Nevada. Latest polling averages show him with an impressive 14-point lead over his ailing centrist rival Biden. The former VP\u2019s fellow moderate Buttigieg and Warren \u2013 like Sanders, a leftwing senator \u2013 are neck and neck close behind Biden, with businessman Tom Steyer and centrist Klobuchar fighting for fifth place. Sanders has also strengthened his lead in national Demcoratic polling, and is now 11 points clear of Biden in the popular-vote horse-race. Bloomberg is now in third place, and very close behind Biden. Warren, Buttigieg and Klobuchar slot in after that. We\u2019ll cover all this and more throughout the day right here.",

He has made 10 heavyweight title defences in the five years since winning the WBC\u2019s version of the championship, one more than Mike Tyson and Joe Frazier in their reigns.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/tyson-fury-muhammad-ali-deontay-wilder-heavyweight-title-boxing\">Tyson Fury has to channel Muhammad Ali \u2026 with his feet not his mouth | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So why has it not happened? Some of it is down to boxing\u2019s decision to throw itself behind a paywall amid an explosion of entertainment alternatives. Some can be attributed to the emergence of four sanctioning bodies, an alphabet soup that has fractured a championship that was once handed over cleanly from one to the next. A bit more can be chalked up to plain old lousy promotion.</p> \n<p>Mainly, though, it is down to competition. Specifically, Wilder\u2019s lack of a big-name rival as a yardstick of how good he really may be. In Tyson Fury, he has found one. This very odd couple will come together for the second time in 15 months on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where they faced off one final time at Friday afternoon\u2019s weigh-ins.</p> \n<p>The impeccably fit Wilder came in at a career-high 231lb and Fury tipped the scales at 273lb before a rollicking capacity crowd squarely behind the challenger, the latest nod to the American\u2019s bewildering domestic conundrum. Fury has been open about his intent to pack on ballast for the rematch, eating six meals and drinking eight litres of water daily in search of a size advantage against the lighter American. It\u2019s a bold tactic for a fighter who weighed 256\u00bdlb in their first encounter and in the same range for interim bouts against Tom Schwarz (263lb) and Otto Wallin (254\u00bdlbs), yet the 42lb weight difference on Saturday night will be two pounds less than when they fought in December 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c32ece3dcc70720b65678e4d80b45fe009a1a75e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c32ece3dcc70720b65678e4d80b45fe009a1a75e/0_0_5000_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury jaw at one another from a distance on Friday after weighing in for their heavyweight title fight at the MGM Grand.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Afterward, both fighters pointed and barked at one another from a distance for two minutes rather than come together for the traditional staredown, which the Nevada Athletic Commission had banned following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/deontay-wilder-taunts-tyson-fury-about-his-mental-health\">shoving match at Wednesday\u2019s final press conference</a>. \u201cI just told him, \u201824 hours, 24 hours,\u2019\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe\u2019s nervous. Nervous energy as always.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the waiting is over the two unbeaten giants with 71 professional wins between them, the two best fighters currently in boxing\u2019s prestige division, will meet in the most important heavyweight championship fight since the second fight between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield in 1999. The big-fight atmosphere on the Las Vegas strip has offered a throwback to those days: Fans queued outside the arena since early Friday morning to catch a brief glimpse of Wilder and Fury on the scales, with the state fire marshal locking down all entrances due to the excessive crowds at least an hour before it started.</p> \n<p>With a win, Wilder will take his first step into the discussion of the all-time great heavyweights. Make no mistake: this is a legacy-defining fight on both sides. Should the Gypsy King win back the title, it is not hyperbolic to say it would complete one of the greatest comebacks in modern sporting history given the depths of his very public bout with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/deontay-wilder-taunts-tyson-fury-about-his-mental-health\" title=\"\">addiction and mental illness</a>, which saw him balloon to nearly 25st during a 31-month layoff.</p> \n<p>But Fury, who did not make a single defence of the IBF, WBA and WBO titles he won from Wladimir Klitschko, says he plans to fight only three more times even if he wins on Saturday night. For Wilder, the sky is the limit. He has already been called the biggest puncher in the history of boxing (with apologies to Ron Lyle and Earnie Shavers), but at the moment, his career-best win is against the Cuban veteran Luis Ortiz. Until he adds a top-flight name like Fury to his ledger, it is all barroom theory.</p> \n<p>Wilder must solve the enigma who left him looking ordinary for long stretches of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/02/tyson-fury-wbc-heavyweight-boxing-deontay-wilder-split-draw\" title=\"\">their first meeting</a> in downtown Los Angeles, when the 6ft 9in Fury spent most of the evening racking up points and using every trick in the book to negate Wilder\u2019s heat-seeking right hand. The American finally scored a knockdown in the ninth round and an even heavier one in the 12th, which left Fury seemingly unconscious on the way down, but the challenger somehow made it to his feet and to the final bell, where the ringside judges handed down a stalemate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9961c176-1d89-4c75-8f96-beaa3aaf9ea6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_M2kIKd7KDM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But, rather than go into an immediate rematch, each took a pair of fights in the interim.</p> \n<p>\u201cRound 12 has been on his mind since day one,\u201d Wilder said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s why he stayed away from the [immediate] rematch. Round 12 has been living in his head for a while.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fury has made no secret of his intention to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/18/tyson-fury-deontay-wilder-boxing\" title=\"\">go for a knockout</a> in Saturday\u2019s fight, even if the tactics fly in the face of conventional wisdom. But Wilder, on several occasions during the final run-up, has said he does not believe a word that comes out of the challenger\u2019s mouth.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried too much about what he says, I just want to see what he does,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cI am a man of action.\u201d</p> \n<p>Should Wilder win, all conversation will turn to a unification showdown with Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua, who holds the other three belts in boxing\u2019s prestige division. That could mean an opportunity to crown the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 2000.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when Deontay Wilder would have been one of his country\u2019s most famous sportsmen, which makes the 34-year-old among the biggest casualties of boxing\u2019s retreat toward the margins of the American mainstream. There is no good reason why Wilder, a crowd-pleasing knockout merchant in a chiselled 6ft 7in package who is unbeaten in 43 professional fights, with 41 wins inside the distance, should not be a household name by now. He has made 10 heavyweight title defences in the five years since winning the WBC\u2019s version of the championship, one more than Mike Tyson and Joe Frazier in their reigns. So why has it not happened? Some of it is down to boxing\u2019s decision to throw itself behind a paywall amid an explosion of entertainment alternatives. Some can be attributed to the emergence of four sanctioning bodies, an alphabet soup that has fractured a championship that was once handed over cleanly from one to the next. A bit more can be chalked up to plain old lousy promotion. Mainly, though, it is down to competition. Specifically, Wilder\u2019s lack of a big-name rival as a yardstick of how good he really may be. In Tyson Fury, he has found one. This very odd couple will come together for the second time in 15 months on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where they faced off one final time at Friday afternoon\u2019s weigh-ins. The impeccably fit Wilder came in at a career-high 231lb and Fury tipped the scales at 273lb before a rollicking capacity crowd squarely behind the challenger, the latest nod to the American\u2019s bewildering domestic conundrum. Fury has been open about his intent to pack on ballast for the rematch, eating six meals and drinking eight litres of water daily in search of a size advantage against the lighter American. It\u2019s a bold tactic for a fighter who weighed 256\u00bdlb in their first encounter and in the same range for interim bouts against Tom Schwarz (263lb) and Otto Wallin (254\u00bdlbs), yet the 42lb weight difference on Saturday night will be two pounds less than when they fought in December 2018. Afterward, both fighters pointed and barked at one another from a distance for two minutes rather than come together for the traditional staredown, which the Nevada Athletic Commission had banned following the shoving match at Wednesday\u2019s final press conference. \u201cI just told him, \u201824 hours, 24 hours,\u2019\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe\u2019s nervous. Nervous energy as always.\u201d When the waiting is over the two unbeaten giants with 71 professional wins between them, the two best fighters currently in boxing\u2019s prestige division, will meet in the most important heavyweight championship fight since the second fight between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield in 1999. The big-fight atmosphere on the Las Vegas strip has offered a throwback to those days: Fans queued outside the arena since early Friday morning to catch a brief glimpse of Wilder and Fury on the scales, with the state fire marshal locking down all entrances due to the excessive crowds at least an hour before it started. With a win, Wilder will take his first step into the discussion of the all-time great heavyweights. Make no mistake: this is a legacy-defining fight on both sides. Should the Gypsy King win back the title, it is not hyperbolic to say it would complete one of the greatest comebacks in modern sporting history given the depths of his very public bout with addiction and mental illness, which saw him balloon to nearly 25st during a 31-month layoff. But Fury, who did not make a single defence of the IBF, WBA and WBO titles he won from Wladimir Klitschko, says he plans to fight only three more times even if he wins on Saturday night. For Wilder, the sky is the limit. He has already been called the biggest puncher in the history of boxing (with apologies to Ron Lyle and Earnie Shavers), but at the moment, his career-best win is against the Cuban veteran Luis Ortiz. Until he adds a top-flight name like Fury to his ledger, it is all barroom theory. Wilder must solve the enigma who left him looking ordinary for long stretches of their first meeting in downtown Los Angeles, when the 6ft 9in Fury spent most of the evening racking up points and using every trick in the book to negate Wilder\u2019s heat-seeking right hand. The American finally scored a knockdown in the ninth round and an even heavier one in the 12th, which left Fury seemingly unconscious on the way down, but the challenger somehow made it to his feet and to the final bell, where the ringside judges handed down a stalemate. But, rather than go into an immediate rematch, each took a pair of fights in the interim. \u201cRound 12 has been on his mind since day one,\u201d Wilder said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s why he stayed away from the [immediate] rematch. Round 12 has been living in his head for a while.\u201d Fury has made no secret of his intention to go for a knockout in Saturday\u2019s fight, even if the tactics fly in the face of conventional wisdom. But Wilder, on several occasions during the final run-up, has said he does not believe a word that comes out of the challenger\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not worried too much about what he says, I just want to see what he does,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cI am a man of action.\u201d Should Wilder win, all conversation will turn to a unification showdown with Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua, who holds the other three belts in boxing\u2019s prestige division. That could mean an opportunity to crown the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 2000. Regardless, \u201cI just want to let the world know that we have a badass named Deontay Wilder here in America, and he ain\u2019t going nowhere for a very long time,\u201d Wilder said.",
