      "body": "<h2>1. Julia Jacklin finding a superfan in Lana Del Rey was a very big deal</h2> <p> Jacklin\u2019s excellent second album took on life during and after a breakup, from the gnawing anxiety over what an ex-lover might do with intimate photographs to expectations about how to bounce back after everything has changed. But the most devastating moment in a record full of them was Don\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You, a murmured plea to a relationship that seems to be ending in slow motion.</p> <p>The song found a fan in Lana Del Rey, who invited the Blue Mountains-born, Melbourne-based singer-songwriter to perform it with her at a concert in Denver last month. Seeing Del Rey sing Jacklin\u2019s lyrics (\u201cWhat if I cleaned up, what if I worked on my skin? / I could scrub until I am red, hot, weak and thin\u201d) in a 10-second video on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gDCFhBGHE/\">Instagram</a> was definitive proof of Jacklin\u2019s well-deserved international breakthrough. <em><strong>\u2013 Katie Cunningham</strong></em></p> <h2>2.

Enter J McFarlane\u2019s Reality Guest, a project anchored by one of Australian DIY\u2019s more influential figures \u2013 Twerps\u2019 Julia McFarlane \u2013 that\u2019s startlingly, brilliantly fresh. Sitting firmly at the more avant-garde end of minimal wave, JMRG\u2019s debut Ta Da utilises a bracing spareness to embed itself in your psyche; only ever featuring McFarlane\u2019s voice and two or three instruments, it\u2019s an understated record that\u2019s rich and expansive. Released days into 2019, the album has a magnetic, transfixing quality about it. Befitting its title, Ta Da is a hell of a magic trick. <em><strong>\u2013 Shaad d\u2019Souza</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>3. Custard\u2019s David McCormack becoming a cartoon dog made perfect sense</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ec4126d744b6de6d647250bc39dfaad736ddaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90ec4126d744b6de6d647250bc39dfaad736ddaf/0_0_5565_3710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David McCormack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David McCormack, the frontman of the 90s band Custard and the voice of Bluey\u2019s dad in Bluey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty-five years ago, McCormack was the voice of an indie-rock band called Custard. Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/16/custards-dave-mccormack-on-voicing-blueys-dad-im-popular-at-school-drop-off-time\">he\u2019s the voice of Bandit, the doggo daddy of Bluey</a> \u2013 the internationally beloved animated ABC children\u2019s television series about an irrepressible blue heeler pup. For the goofball McCormack, such a career trajectory makes perfect sense.</p> <p>Since launching in October 2018, Bluey has become the most downloaded program in the history of the ABC\u2019s iView, with more than 150m plays. McCormack, who has two young daughters of his own, says the role has made him popular at school drop-off time. Meanwhile, Custard\u2019s Brisbane peers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/02/regurgitators-pogogo-show-doing-a-kids-album-really-feels-true-to-our-nature\">Regurgitator have also made a children\u2019s album</a>, touring with kid-friendly versions of old songs, including I Sucked a Lollipop to Get Where I Am. <em><strong>\u2013 Andrew Stafford</strong></em></p> <h2>4. The return of 90s Darren Hayes was a pleasant surprise</h2> <p>Savage Garden had one of the most economical careers in Australian musical history, both in a financial sense and in not outstaying their welcome. They released two albums in less than three years, both of which sounded like greatest hits collections, selling 23 million copies and spawning 15 hit singles.</p> <p>Darren Hayes\u2019 solo work moved well away from Savage Garden\u2019s pop balladeering, so it was a pleasant surprise when he turned up in October on Cub Sport\u2019s tender I Never Cried So Much in My Whole Life sounding so much like circa-97 Hayes that I swear \u2013 truly, madly \u2013 that I heard the CD skip at one point. <em>\u2013 <strong>Nathan Jolly</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>5. Warren H Williams\u2019 show in Alice Springs was a joyful family affair</strong></h2> <p>Stages at Northern Territory gigs are always shared with family members if they\u2019re around. It gives the shows a feeling of fluidity, joy and generosity. <br><br>The gig of the Arrente man, country musician and <a href=\"https://caama.com.au/support-caama-radio\">CAAMA radio</a>\u2019s longest-running broadcaster Warren H Williams at Monte\u2019s Lounge in Alice Springs was no exception, as he hauled up his daughter, two sons and perhaps an aunty or two.</p> <p>After the gig, in the clean desert air, I chatted with an American stationed at Pine Gap intelligence facility as Williams was hailed by six female octogenarians from the local lapidary club who said they used to see his dad, Gus Williams, play country music too. <em>\u2013 <strong>Kate Hennessy</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>6.

Holiday Sidewinder\u2019s glittery debut album (Personal Best Records, funded through sales of her worn, sealed satin underwear) is bumper to bumper with exes, such as the mystery man at the Holiday Inn (\u201cWe wear the slippers and robes / But we can\u2019t take them home / We get our rubbers and drinks / Out of vending machines\u201d). </p> <p>It\u2019s a shame-free zone of which Grace Jones would approve. Sonically, analogue disco pop rules the roost \u2013 Kim Wilde and Sophie Ellis-Bextor are fans \u2013 but it\u2019s also aesthetically showbizzy. The video to Leo is an homage to 90s Versace ads, and the album art depicts Sidewinder in fabulous aerobics-disco get-up. <em>\u2013 <strong>Jenny Valentish</strong></em></p> <h2>7. Nick Cave\u2019s folksy newsletter was surprisingly therapeutic</h2> <p>I only signed up to Cave\u2019s the Red Hand Files newsletter in May this year. But looking back, I can see how these playful questions and answers randomly popping into my inbox shone an increasingly welcome light through a pretty shitty time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/09/i-thought-the-elvis-fan-festival-would-be-funny-it-cracked-me-open-and-changed-my-life\">I thought the Elvis fan festival would be funny.

(And sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theredhandfiles.com/into-my-arms-love/\">just aches</a>.) They never quite squared with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/10/the-film-music-of-nick-cave-and-warren-ellis-princes-of-darkness-offer-light-relief\">musician\u2019s cultivated hubris</a>, which made them all the more effective \u2013 just a wise, worn friend, emailing (me) to say everything\u2019s all right, and if not, you\u2019re not alone. <em><strong>\u2013Marcus Teague</strong></em></p> <h2>8. The Beasts of Bourbon are <strong>still here, even without the hard liquor</strong></h2> <p>The Beasts of Bourbon were everything that was tough about Australian rock\u2019n\u2019roll. From their name upwards, there was an outlaw recklessness that at times perhaps overshadowed the broken-down vulnerability of their songs. The band were confronted by mortality in 2018 when bassist Brian Hooper and guitarist Spencer P Jones died after long illnesses. With a new name (the Beasts) and a shared feeling of loss and brotherhood, they convened for Still Here (Bang Records), an album honouring their bandmates\u2019 passing not with maudlin musing but with a noble tip of the hat and an irreverent approach that breaks the sadness. <em>\u2013 <strong>Bob Gordon</strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison\u2019s response to questions about the link between catastrophic fires and climate change is right. Right in a narrow, technical sense which only serves to emphasise how wrong he is. The prime minister is right that Australia only contributes a small proportion of global carbon emissions, though an honest figure is closer to 3.6 % rather than the 1.3 % he is so fond of quoting. He is right that if Australia stopped burning coal tomorrow and transitioned to a zero-emission economy next week, the forests would still burn, the pastures and crops would still wither, the stock would still starve, the corals would still bleach and the coasts would still be battered by storms and surges. We know this. We know that Morrison can\u2019t grab his hose and put out the fires. But we also know that a plumber who skips a Friday afternoon job to pick up the kids is not the same as a prime minister who skips the country for a holiday during an escalating disaster. To make this comparison is to insult all those paid and volunteer emergency workers who sacrifice their family life to protect the communities they serve. We know that the climate crisis is a global problem. We know that the gigatonnes of greenhouse gases already emitted have locked the world into terrifying future, and that, as a country of \u201cdrought and flooding rains\u201d Australia is particularly at risk. We know all these things. And we know that Morrison\u2019s patronising response to this catastrophe only confirms that he doesn\u2019t understand the question Australia is asking. Australians aren\u2019t asking for miracles \u2013 we\u2019re begging for leadership. We are begging for leadership on the national stage. This must start with an honest acknowledgement of the problem. An unqualified admission that we are facing a climate crisis and that we must act. We are begging for leadership stripped of hubris. Leadership that is willing to seek and acknowledge the expertise of scientists, engineers, land managers, economists, emergency services chiefs and health professionals. Leadership that is willing to use that expertise to develop strategies to mitigate the crisis. We are begging for leadership stripped of political partisanship that will reach across the aisle and seek common ground and national unity. We are begging for leadership that is courageous enough to tell us the truth. We know that taking effective action will involve costs. But it could also bring opportunities. Australia is fortunate to be well-endowed with renewable resources and technological expertise. With government leadership and support, the transition to a zero-carbon economy could benefit our economy in the medium term and generate much-needed regional jobs. We are begging for leadership on the international stage. The crisis facing Australia\u2019s farms, forests, coasts and vulnerable ecosystems can only be addressed in the long term if there is meaningful global action. A government that truly wants to help our firefighters and farmers must lead the fight for a global response. But a government which pleads for special treatment and resorts to dodgy accounting to meet woefully inadequate commitments has no international credibility. A government whose policies are ranked among the world\u2019s worst carries no moral authority. And without that moral authority the government has no clout to advance the only long-term solution to this crisis \u2013 an international framework for the rapid decarbonisation of the global economy. Instead of leading, Morrison hides behind the marketing strategy of a boldfaced lie which he hopes will be miraculously self-fulfilling if it is repeated often enough. The lie that Australia is leading the world in mitigation and will meet its international obligations at a canter. Let\u2019s be brutally honest. A specious argument about Australia\u2019s past emissions completely misses the point. Right now, at the advent of 2020, despite our natural and technological advantages, Australia is one of the world\u2019s highest per-capita emitters of greenhouse gases. Regardless of the past, this single, verifiable fact places a moral obligation on Australia to be a world leader when it comes to emissions reduction. Instead Australia wilfully obstructs effective international action and provides cover for other countries to do likewise. The great tragedy of this lack of leadership is the opportunity squandered. Australia has squandered the international authority it gained as a progressive force in the postwar years. Australia has squandered the opportunity to be a global leader in the industries of the future. Australia has squandered the opportunity to protect its people from an increasingly hostile future. All of this to protect the interests of fossil industries who have known for decades that their accumulating wealth is literally costing the Earth. Australia is facing a crisis. This scorching summer has given us a glimpse of a frightening future. It has also exposed the failings of the hyperpartisan politics that increasingly mocks our system of representative democracy. The question Australia is asking Scott Morrison is not whether an effective climate policy will extinguish the fires. The question is whether he can show the leadership necessary to unite us and take the difficult decisions required to avoid the greater catastrophe that these horrific fires portend.

      "bodyText": "Two super funds into which a court has found Westpac wrongly tipped customers through a telemarketing campaign have been identified by the prudential regulator as among the poorest performers in Australia. The BT Lifetime Super Employer Plan and BT Business Super were two of 10 into which Westpac persuaded its customers to roll their superannuation as part of a marketing campaign that brought more than $646m in deposits into the bank between 2013 and 2016. In data comparing low-cost MySuper funds published on 10 December, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said both funds underperformed compared with a model investment portfolio it set up. The BT Lifetime Super Employer Plan underperformed Apra\u2019s model portfolio by a whopping 1.1% a year over five years while BT Business Super delivered between 0.41% and 0.43% a year over the same period. BT Business Super also suffered from high fees that gobbled more than 2.1% a year for balances of less that $10,000 while BT Lifetime Super Employer fees ate a more modest, but still substantial 1.87% a year, the regulator said. In October, the full federal court found that Westpac broke the law during the telemarketing campaign because it provided personal advice to people about their finances without properly considering their individual positions. Westpac has applied to the high court for leave to appeal the judgment, adding to what is shaping as a busy year ahead in the courtroom for the bank. Westpac is currently facing federal court action from financial intelligence agency Austrac over money-laundering and child-exploitation allegations, while another regulator, Asic, has appealed its loss in a lawsuit over responsible lending known as the \u201cwagyu and shiraz\u201d case. The superannuation marketing campaign, run by a group within Westpac known as the \u201cSuper Activations\u201d team, was designed to get customers to move super they held in accounts with other institutions into their account at the bank\u2019s subsidiary, BT. Bank employees phoned more than 95,000 customers during the 2013-16 period, more than 31,000 of whom agreed to roll their super into their BT account. Some customers also received marketing material urging them to consolidate their super for the chance to win $20,000 in cash and telling them they could \u201ccould save on fees\u201d by doing so. \u201cBy combining all your super into your BT super account, you could stop paying multiple fees and help your super grow,\u201d customers were told in another marketing email. \u201cThe whole approach of Westpac was to obtain an advantage for itself without engaging with the personal circumstances of the customers so as to avoid the consequences of the responsibilities of providing personal advice,\u201d chief justice James Allsop said in his judgment. Justice Michael O\u2019Bryan said that Westpac breached consumer protections contained in the Corporations Act, including the overriding obligation to act \u201cefficiently, honestly and fairly\u201d when providing a financial service. \u201cThe advice it gave to its members was partial and incomplete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt failed to act in the best interests of its members and it failed to ensure that the financial services covered by its AFSL [Australian Financial Services licence] were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly.\u201d A Westpac spokesman declined to comment.",

The team\u2019s hold on fourth place was in jeopardy. There were questions about Mount and his young teammates. There were questions of Lampard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Willian double earns Chelsea win at Tottenham and racism mars game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What was needed were <em>cojones</em>. Clearly, an effective tactical plan was a must but, first and foremost, Chelsea needed to show their character. That was exactly how it played out. Willian hogged the headlines after scoring both goals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in the 2-0 win</a> but Mount, in the other inside-forward position in Lampard\u2019s reconfigured 3-4-3 system, was not far behind.</p> <p>Mount showed for the ball, accepting the responsibility that Lampard had called for; taking risks and driving the team forward \u2013 and he was not alone. It was easy to tell that the manager\u2019s words had registered by the way Mount answered a question about them. Plainly, they had been discussed during the week. For Mount and Chelsea, this felt like a turning point.</p> <p>\u201cThat reaction was key,\u201d Mount said. \u201cHe [Lampard] said after the last game that we didn\u2019t have enough balls. We wanted to get on the ball and play \u2013 to show everyone we\u2019re not a team who will get pushed over easy, that we have that fight within us. People were doubting us. But we knew the Spurs game could be the turning point. The [recent] performances weren\u2019t good enough but this was the perfect game to show our mentality and belief.\u201d</p> <p>Mount stressed that in a derby it was imperative to win the physical and mental battles; to earn the right to play, although he overstretched the point a little when he said \u201cthe tactical side goes out of the window\u201d. For Lampard, this was a tactical triumph and it would have felt all the sweeter having come against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, his mentor when he played at Chelsea.</p> <p>Lampard\u2019s Derby beat Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United in last season\u2019s Carabao Cup, winning on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, but this was a higher level \u2013 a game with implications for Champions League qualification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ac94824b398e461e254c84f36fd3f1a80cef043\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ac94824b398e461e254c84f36fd3f1a80cef043/0_0_4988_3513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea manager Frank Lampard celebrates after the win over Tottenham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea manager Frank Lampard celebrates after the win over Tottenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Shopland/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lampard\u2019s formation switch was perfectly judged and it seemed to surprise Mourinho. The Spurs manager, who had started with his preferred 4\u20112\u20113\u20111, matched Chelsea after half-time with three at the back but, by then, Willian had scored his goals and the damage was done.</p> <p>Mourinho had begun by asking his players to press high when Chelsea had the ball at the back; Moussa Sissoko advanced from his deeper-sitting midfield role to reinforce the line behind Harry Kane. Yet Chelsea simply played through them, with Mateo Kovacic showing some nice moves, or around them with long diagonals towards the wing\u2011backs, where Mount and Willian created overloads.

      "bodyText": "Mason Mount heard the criticism from Frank Lampard and he took it as a personal affront and a challenge. The chips were down at Chelsea after the 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth on the Saturday before last and Lampard had dwelt on the timidity of his players in possession. \u201cSome responsibility is on the players to excite the fans \u2013 to have the personality and the balls to take the ball in an area and beat someone or play forwards,\u201d he said. The pressure was on at Tottenham on Sunday, with the Bournemouth result making it Chelsea\u2019s fourth defeat in five Premier League games. The team\u2019s hold on fourth place was in jeopardy. There were questions about Mount and his young teammates. There were questions of Lampard. What was needed were cojones. Clearly, an effective tactical plan was a must but, first and foremost, Chelsea needed to show their character. That was exactly how it played out. Willian hogged the headlines after scoring both goals in the 2-0 win but Mount, in the other inside-forward position in Lampard\u2019s reconfigured 3-4-3 system, was not far behind. Mount showed for the ball, accepting the responsibility that Lampard had called for; taking risks and driving the team forward \u2013 and he was not alone. It was easy to tell that the manager\u2019s words had registered by the way Mount answered a question about them. Plainly, they had been discussed during the week. For Mount and Chelsea, this felt like a turning point. \u201cThat reaction was key,\u201d Mount said. \u201cHe [Lampard] said after the last game that we didn\u2019t have enough balls. We wanted to get on the ball and play \u2013 to show everyone we\u2019re not a team who will get pushed over easy, that we have that fight within us. People were doubting us. But we knew the Spurs game could be the turning point. The [recent] performances weren\u2019t good enough but this was the perfect game to show our mentality and belief.\u201d Mount stressed that in a derby it was imperative to win the physical and mental battles; to earn the right to play, although he overstretched the point a little when he said \u201cthe tactical side goes out of the window\u201d. For Lampard, this was a tactical triumph and it would have felt all the sweeter having come against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, his mentor when he played at Chelsea. Lampard\u2019s Derby beat Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United in last season\u2019s Carabao Cup, winning on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, but this was a higher level \u2013 a game with implications for Champions League qualification. Lampard\u2019s formation switch was perfectly judged and it seemed to surprise Mourinho. The Spurs manager, who had started with his preferred 4\u20112\u20113\u20111, matched Chelsea after half-time with three at the back but, by then, Willian had scored his goals and the damage was done. Mourinho had begun by asking his players to press high when Chelsea had the ball at the back; Moussa Sissoko advanced from his deeper-sitting midfield role to reinforce the line behind Harry Kane. Yet Chelsea simply played through them, with Mateo Kovacic showing some nice moves, or around them with long diagonals towards the wing\u2011backs, where Mount and Willian created overloads. Chelsea grew in confidence. They had the control. Mourinho was sufficiently annoyed to suggest Lampard had played 3\u20114\u20113 because some of the Chelsea players were familiar with the system from Antonio Conte\u2019s time at Stamford Bridge. In other words, the approach was not Lampard\u2019s own work. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to clone anyone\u2019s system,\u201d Lampard shot back. Mount noted Lampard had used the formation this season, including in the 2-1 Champions League win at Lille on 2 October. \u201cYou saw how tight and together we were as a team [against Spurs],\u201d Mount said. \u201cWe knew where to be in terms of positions, the movements off the ball. That\u2019s the important thing with a change of formation \u2013 everyone needs to know where to be, how to press and how to work off the ball because we came up against a team who are good on the ball. They had to go longer sometimes and we had to get back in and work off that second ball.\u201d The stain on the occasion came when the Chelsea defender Antonio R\u00fcdiger heard racist abuse from the crowd and there were three announcements over the PA system to acknowledge that \u201cracist behaviour from spectators is interfering with the game\u201d. Mount said Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol, which he experienced when England\u2019s Euro 2020 away qualifier against Bulgaria in October was disrupted by racist chanting, \u201ccould be something that is introduced in Premier League football\u201d. He added: \u201cIt [racism] is still happening and there have to be things in place to stop it because it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d As for the football, Mount and Chelsea could take heart and the question, as Lampard put it, was whether they could \u201ckeep reproducing\u201d such levels. \u201cWe knew we had to stay in fourth place, give the fans an early Christmas present,\u201d Mount said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to start falling back and having to worry about what is below.\u201d",

Chelsea Football Club will not tolerate any form of racism, nor is there a place at this club for anyone who is found to have engaged in such behaviour. If a season ticket holder or member is involved, we will take the strongest possible action against them including bans. We will also support any potential criminal proceedings by the relevant authorities.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was at least one other clash among Tottenham supporters in the stadium where stewards were alerted to racist language after the first public announcement.

      "bodyText": "English football\u2019s racism crisis took a new twist after it emerged that a Chelsea supporter was arrested for allegedly racially abusing Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Son Heung-min on Sunday during the Premier League match that had to be paused because a monkey chant was aimed at Chelsea\u2019s Antonio R\u00fcdiger by members of the home crowd. Anthony Taylor, the referee, stopped play after R\u00fcdiger claimed he had heard racist taunts during the second half of Chelsea\u2019s victory over their London rivals. An announcement on the public address system informed the crowd at the Tottenham stadium that \u201cracist behaviour from spectators is interfering with the game\u201d. The announcement was made on two further occasions, in line with Premier League protocols. Spurs have vowed to take the \u201cstrongest possible action\u201d against anyone found guilty of abusing R\u00fcdiger, who is understood to have been left angry following the latest example of the racism blighting the game. The alleged abuse occurred shortly after he had been involved in the incident that led to Son being sent off. The Metropolitan police are investigating the alleged racist chanting and it also confirmed that a supporter was ejected from the ground and arrested after committing a racially aggravated public order offence. It is understood the supporter targeted Son, who did not hear any insults aimed at him, and the incident was reported to the authorities by other Chelsea fans. A Chelsea spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of an alleged racist incident involving a Chelsea supporter at yesterday\u2019s match. Chelsea Football Club will not tolerate any form of racism, nor is there a place at this club for anyone who is found to have engaged in such behaviour. If a season ticket holder or member is involved, we will take the strongest possible action against them including bans. We will also support any potential criminal proceedings by the relevant authorities.\u201d There was at least one other clash among Tottenham supporters in the stadium where stewards were alerted to racist language after the first public announcement. One person was asked to leave by stewards and fans who reported the incident were contacted by Spurs on Monday. A spokesman for the Met said: \u201cPolice were made aware of alleged racist chanting during the second half of the Tottenham vs Chelsea match on Sunday 22 December. Officers will work with the club in an attempt to identify any people responsible.\u201d Tottenham added that they are \u201cexhaustively investigating\u201d the allegations made by R\u00fcdiger, promising to impose life bans on anyone found guilty. \u201cWe have engaged lip readers to study the footage and contacted Chelsea for further information from their players,\u201d read a statement. The Spurs manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, believes that self-policing from supporters is a positive step. \u201cIf I have to say something it is to ask my supporters, the Tottenham supporters, to keep doing exactly the same that they are doing with the team, which is supporting the team in a season that has not been easy at all,\u201d he said. \u201cTo ask them to be exactly the same and obviously to look to the guy to the left and look to the guy to the right, and listen to the guy behind me and listen to the guy in front of me. And if anyone has any little manifestation, to try in there in between them to kill it immediately. That\u2019s the only thing I can ask for.\u201d Mourinho added that the problem extends beyond football: \u201cSociety needs help. Then football is a micro society. Do we need help? Yes, but society needs help. We need to eradicate any form of discrimination. And what I fear is that it is going to happen again in the future. That\u2019s the problem. \u201cWhat I see is an evolution in the protocol.

He has been found guilty of breaching the ICC\u2019s code of conduct on five occasions and has been suspended twice.</p> <p>When Australia arrived for the 2018 Test series that would be defined by the ball-tampering scandal, Steve Smith hinted his side would look to antagonise Rabada.

I can still be that aggressive bowler who intimidates. But I\u2019ve learned to pick my moments. It takes a sound, steady mind to maintain the balance and I\u2019m more mature now.\u201d</p> <p>The last book Rabada read was Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War and he uses the word \u201cbattle\u201d on several occasions when speaking of the contest against England.</p> <p>One of the more intriguing subplots of the series will focus on the duel of the leading quicks in each team and in Jofra Archer, Rabada has a ready made adversary for the next two months.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a quality bowler, there\u2019s no question,\u201d he says of England\u2019s spearhead, who was back bowling in the nets on Monday after recovering from a virus that has hit their camp. \u201cI get asked about him a lot and I\u2019m always getting compared to the other top fast bowlers in the world. I take it as a compliment. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s [Jasprit] Bumrah or [Pat] Cummins or Archer. We\u2019ve all got egos as fast bowlers. You need to have an ego but there is no jealousy. When someone does better than me it just motivates me. I\u2019ve always said I want to be recognised as the best in the world and competition drives me towards that goal.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the aforementioned, it is Archer who has left the most memorable mark on the minds of South African cricket fans. On the opening day of the World Cup in May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/31/jofra-archer-england-cricket-world-cup#maincontent\" title=\"\">Archer\u2019s extra bite</a> off the Oval surface beat Hashim Amla\u2019s attempted pull shot for pace. The ball cannoned into the veteran\u2019s helmet and sent a shock wave that was felt on Africa\u2019s southern tip.</p> <p>South Africans play their sport with an overt machismo. On the cricket field the fast bowler is the apex predator and from Allan Donald to Dale Steyn, there has been a ceaseless line of demon quicks. This is one aspect of the game in which they have traditionally had an edge over England. The addition of Archer evens the contest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/22/england-stuart-broad-jofra-archer-fitness-south-africa\">England ask Stuart Broad and Jofra Archer to make \u2018honesty call\u2019 on fitness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou want to go out and return the favour when someone hits your batter,\u201d Rabada says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t let your emotions get the better of you. You need to use that motivation to rev you up but you can\u2019t think irrationally. My job is to take wickets. Sometimes that means getting aggressive and bowling short but sometimes it means having more control. My record shows I know when to do this.\u201d</p> <p>In 40 Tests, Rabada has taken 183 wickets at an average of 22.5. Only Steyn, Cummins and Vernon Philander have a better average this decade with more than 100 dismissals. He has struggled this year with injury and a lack of intensity and pace, including at a disappointing World Cup, and that led some to believe he has bowled too many balls at his relatively young age. But new faces in the camp have had a revitalising impact.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like a fresh start,\u201d Rabada said of the appointments of Mark Boucher as the coach, Jacques Kallis as the batting consultant and Charl Langeveldt as the bowling coach. \u201cWe\u2019re motivated to get out there and put a tough year behind us.\u201d</p> <p>Rabada\u2019s story is not solely defined by what he does on the cricket field. Being a black South African athlete 25 years after the end of apartheid means his performances carry greater significance. But unlike his teammates Temba Bavuma and Lungisani Ngidi, Rabada\u2019s journey did not begin in poverty.

      "bodyText": "\u201cSometimes you do think of physically hurting the opposition with the ball,\u201d Kagiso Rabada says, matter of factly, as he explains what sets the greatest exponents of his art apart. South Africa\u2019s 24-year-old fast bowler, who became the youngest player to be ranked No 1 in the world two years ago, has all the attributes necessary to be one of them. Able to consistently top 90mph, he glides across the surface as he charges towards the wicket, bowling as if his body was designed for this single purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not just skill that makes the great fast bowlers in history what they are,\u201d Rabada says as he prepares for the four-Test series against England that begins on Boxing Day in Centurion. \u201cThey all have that intensity that makes it uncomfortable for batsmen to stand up to. The aggression is something that is naturally in me. It makes me a better bowler. It helps me bowl faster for longer. I haven\u2019t always been in control of it but I\u2019m getting better.\u201d Rabada has had his run-ins with authorities since his career began as a 19-year-old in 2014. He has been found guilty of breaching the ICC\u2019s code of conduct on five occasions and has been suspended twice. When Australia arrived for the 2018 Test series that would be defined by the ball-tampering scandal, Steve Smith hinted his side would look to antagonise Rabada. He was initially suspended during the series for making contact with Smith after dismissing him during the second Test, only for it to be overturned on appeal. \u201cI look back and I acknowledge I\u2019ve lost control in the past,\u201d Rabada says. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding that balance. I can still be that aggressive bowler who intimidates. But I\u2019ve learned to pick my moments. It takes a sound, steady mind to maintain the balance and I\u2019m more mature now.\u201d The last book Rabada read was Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War and he uses the word \u201cbattle\u201d on several occasions when speaking of the contest against England. One of the more intriguing subplots of the series will focus on the duel of the leading quicks in each team and in Jofra Archer, Rabada has a ready made adversary for the next two months. \u201cHe\u2019s a quality bowler, there\u2019s no question,\u201d he says of England\u2019s spearhead, who was back bowling in the nets on Monday after recovering from a virus that has hit their camp. \u201cI get asked about him a lot and I\u2019m always getting compared to the other top fast bowlers in the world. I take it as a compliment. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s [Jasprit] Bumrah or [Pat] Cummins or Archer. We\u2019ve all got egos as fast bowlers. You need to have an ego but there is no jealousy. When someone does better than me it just motivates me. I\u2019ve always said I want to be recognised as the best in the world and competition drives me towards that goal.\u201d Of all the aforementioned, it is Archer who has left the most memorable mark on the minds of South African cricket fans. On the opening day of the World Cup in May Archer\u2019s extra bite off the Oval surface beat Hashim Amla\u2019s attempted pull shot for pace. The ball cannoned into the veteran\u2019s helmet and sent a shock wave that was felt on Africa\u2019s southern tip. South Africans play their sport with an overt machismo. On the cricket field the fast bowler is the apex predator and from Allan Donald to Dale Steyn, there has been a ceaseless line of demon quicks. This is one aspect of the game in which they have traditionally had an edge over England. The addition of Archer evens the contest. \u201cYou want to go out and return the favour when someone hits your batter,\u201d Rabada says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t let your emotions get the better of you. You need to use that motivation to rev you up but you can\u2019t think irrationally. My job is to take wickets. Sometimes that means getting aggressive and bowling short but sometimes it means having more control. My record shows I know when to do this.\u201d In 40 Tests, Rabada has taken 183 wickets at an average of 22.5. Only Steyn, Cummins and Vernon Philander have a better average this decade with more than 100 dismissals. He has struggled this year with injury and a lack of intensity and pace, including at a disappointing World Cup, and that led some to believe he has bowled too many balls at his relatively young age. But new faces in the camp have had a revitalising impact. \u201cIt feels like a fresh start,\u201d Rabada said of the appointments of Mark Boucher as the coach, Jacques Kallis as the batting consultant and Charl Langeveldt as the bowling coach. \u201cWe\u2019re motivated to get out there and put a tough year behind us.\u201d Rabada\u2019s story is not solely defined by what he does on the cricket field. Being a black South African athlete 25 years after the end of apartheid means his performances carry greater significance. But unlike his teammates Temba Bavuma and Lungisani Ngidi, Rabada\u2019s journey did not begin in poverty. He is the son of a doctor and a lawyer and attended one of the most expensive schools in the country in the affluent northern suburbs of Johannesburg. \u201cI know I grew up privileged but that doesn\u2019t change that my skin colour is black, that in the past I wouldn\u2019t have been given this opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cWe [black athletes in South Africa] want to inspire young people and challenge people with closed mindsets. But players should get looked at for their skill as well. Maybe that can be a message to journalists. Where we come from is part of our story but it shouldn\u2019t be the only part.\u201d With Philander having announced he will be joining Steyn in international retirement at the end of this series, Rabada is the undisputed figurehead of the South Africa attack. Once seen as volatile, he enters a new stage in his career with added responsibility on and off the field.",

Tasmania has had unusual weather patterns for the start of summer with westerly winds pushing across the island, dumping rain on the west coast and drying out the east coast. That\u2019s good news for the Tasmanian Wilderness world heritage area, which was significantly burned in 2016, but bad news for the holiday villages along the east Coast. The east coast is incredibly dry \u2013 drier than it was in 2013, when the Dunalley bushfire destroyed 93 homes. \u201cThe area of fire concern is much wider,\u201d Arnol said. \u201cWhere in 2015 it may have been 10-15km out from the coast, it\u2019s now about 50km from the coast that\u2019s dry.\u201d The TFS has begun setting up tanks at strategic points along the coast. This weekend will see a return to Tasmania\u2019s normal summer weather pattern, of high-pressure systems bringing hot northerly winds which swing around to south-westerlies, making it difficult to control fire behaviour. The forecast for 29 and 30 December is for temperatures in the 30s and dry lightning. About 9,550ha of Tasmania has burned so far this season.",

      "body": "<p>The director of the Cornley polytechnic drama society appears on stage to greet the audience. The company, he says, has put together a little holiday show called The Spirit of Christmas. We are privileged to be able to sit and watch it come apart.</p> <p>The CPDS is a fictional troupe, a creation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/25/company-behind-play-that-goes-wrong-scores-west-end-hat-trick\" title=\"\">the Mischief Theatre Company</a>, the people behind the West End and Broadway hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/10/play-that-goes-wrong-review\" title=\"\">The Play That Goes Wrong</a>, as well as Peter Pan Goes Wrong, which was adapted for television and followed by A Christmas Carol Goes Wrong in 2017.</p> <p>It is a formula, it seems, that can be applied widely to good effect. Now Mischief Theatre are back with a six-part series, The Goes Wrong Show (BBC One), beginning with this Yuletide effort, which doesn\u2019t look as if it would be very good if everything went to plan. Fortunately, nothing does.</p> <p>The plot, insofar as there is one, is negligible: it\u2019s Christmas Eve and a little girl is sad because her parents, beset by holiday stress, are fighting. In desperation, she writes to Father Christmas for help. Even this simple story is hard to follow, so burdened is the production by incompetence, unprofessionalism and bad luck.</p> <p>The props have been placed in all the wrong boxes, forcing the hapless actors to cook the Christmas decorations and trim the tree with sausage links. Father Christmas gets stuck on his way down the chimney. \u201cMy sack\u2019s caught in the flue!\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that,\u201d someone mutters backstage. \u201cOf course I can,\u201d says Santa. \u201cIt\u2019s a literal sack. I\u2019m not talking about my balls.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually he makes his appearance, crashing into the room headfirst. He\u2019s lucky \u2013 one of his elves never makes it out, and has to deliver all his lines from inside the chimney. Cues are missed. Father Christmas drinks real sherry by mistake, and embarks on an on-stage bender.</p> <p>Obviously things going wrong is funny, but the main pleasure in the chaos is the sheer precision of it. Co-written by cast members Henry Lewis, Henry Shields and Jonathan Sayer, The Goes Wrong Show relies on incredibly elaborate errors going right.

      "bodyText": "The director of the Cornley polytechnic drama society appears on stage to greet the audience. The company, he says, has put together a little holiday show called The Spirit of Christmas. We are privileged to be able to sit and watch it come apart. The CPDS is a fictional troupe, a creation of the Mischief Theatre Company, the people behind the West End and Broadway hit The Play That Goes Wrong, as well as Peter Pan Goes Wrong, which was adapted for television and followed by A Christmas Carol Goes Wrong in 2017. It is a formula, it seems, that can be applied widely to good effect. Now Mischief Theatre are back with a six-part series, The Goes Wrong Show (BBC One), beginning with this Yuletide effort, which doesn\u2019t look as if it would be very good if everything went to plan. Fortunately, nothing does. The plot, insofar as there is one, is negligible: it\u2019s Christmas Eve and a little girl is sad because her parents, beset by holiday stress, are fighting. In desperation, she writes to Father Christmas for help. Even this simple story is hard to follow, so burdened is the production by incompetence, unprofessionalism and bad luck. The props have been placed in all the wrong boxes, forcing the hapless actors to cook the Christmas decorations and trim the tree with sausage links. Father Christmas gets stuck on his way down the chimney. \u201cMy sack\u2019s caught in the flue!\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that,\u201d someone mutters backstage. \u201cOf course I can,\u201d says Santa. \u201cIt\u2019s a literal sack. I\u2019m not talking about my balls.\u201d Eventually he makes his appearance, crashing into the room headfirst. He\u2019s lucky \u2013 one of his elves never makes it out, and has to deliver all his lines from inside the chimney. Cues are missed. Father Christmas drinks real sherry by mistake, and embarks on an on-stage bender. Obviously things going wrong is funny, but the main pleasure in the chaos is the sheer precision of it. Co-written by cast members Henry Lewis, Henry Shields and Jonathan Sayer, The Goes Wrong Show relies on incredibly elaborate errors going right. Although it\u2019s performed as a stage show, a lot of the visual gags depend on camera angles that reveal more than they are supposed to. There is a clockwork choreography to the whole thing. Ironically, it must take a tremendous amount of work to look this under-rehearsed. If the jokes are simple, they are also durable. For example, someone picks up a mince pie, and the plate comes with it. It\u2019s not so much the relentless goings wrong as the determination to cover for each fresh disaster and plough ahead that makes it progressively funnier. Everyone on stage is playing two parts: the character and the desperate actor behind his or her eyes. All are condemned by that purgatorial maxim, the show must go on.

The gruesome killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 stunned Saudi Arabia\u2019s western allies, plunging the kingdom into its worst diplomatic crisis since the 9/11 attacks. Five of the 11 officially unidentified men on trial were sentenced to death and three more were handed a combined 24 years in prison, the deputy public prosecutor, Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan, told reporters in Riyadh on Monday. The investigation also concluded that Saud al-Qahtani, one of the crown prince\u2019s most trusted advisers, was investigated and found to have no proven involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death, Shalaan added. The findings contradict the conclusion of the CIA and other western intelligence agencies that Prince Mohammed directly ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination, an allegation the kingdom has strenuously denied. Qahtani, along with 16 other Saudis, was sanctioned by the US last year for his alleged role in the killing. Shalaan also said \u201cthere was no premeditation to kill at the beginning of the mission\u201d \u2013 a finding at odds with extensive evidence showing that a 15-man hit squad had arrived in Istanbul with an intention to kill. The crown prince\u2019s father, King Salman, ordered a shake-up of top security posts after Khashoggi\u2019s death, but the ensuing Saudi investigation has been widely criticised as a cover-up operation designed to shield the heir to the throne and those around him from allegations of wrongdoing. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, a UN special rapporteur who authored an inquiry into Khashoggi\u2019s death but was barred from access to the secretive trial, said the ruling that the murder was a spontaneous rather than premeditated crime was \u201canything but justice\u201d. \u201cUnder international human rights law, the killing of Khashoggi was an extrajudicial execution for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBottom line: the hitmen are guilty, sentenced to death.

On a purported audio recording from inside the consulate two Saudi officials were heard discussing how to cut up and transport Khashoggi\u2019s body before he entered. Prince Mohammed, who has cultivated an image of liberal reformer, emerged particularly tarnished after questions were raised over how such an operation could have been carried out without his consent or knowledge.

According to the UN report the other six defendants were Asiri, Mansour Othman Abahussain, Mohammed Saad Alzahrani, Mustafa Mohammed Almadani, Saif Saad Alqahtani and Muflih Shaya Almuslih, reportedly a member of the consulate\u2019s staff. In total 21 people were arrested and 10 more called for questioning, the public prosecutor\u2019s office said. No other details were immediately given about the rulings in the highly secretive trial, which began in January and was conducted over nine sessions. The identities of the convicted men were not immediately confirmed by Saudi officials. Most observers, including UN investigators, have been repeatedly barred from hearings, although a handful of diplomats, including from Turkey, as well as members of Khashoggi\u2019s family, were allowed to attend the sessions. The death penalty in Saudi Arabia is carried out by beheading. The convicted defendants may appeal against the preliminary verdicts, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Cengiz said the announcement was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. \u201cAs we will never forget you, we will not forget your murderers, and also those who are trying to cover up your murder,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. Salah, one of Khashoggi\u2019s sons, said his family had achieved justice thanks to the verdict of Saudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor. According to the Washington Post, the journalist\u2019s four adult children have received payments and property from the royal family as blood money in lieu of a public apology. Pictures of the grieving Salah shaking Prince Mohammed\u2019s hand after being summoned to a royal palace in Riyadh in the weeks following his father\u2019s death were widely condemned as a ruthless photo opportunity.",

The result is being celebrated as a victory against outdated stereotypes about gay people. Yew Fook Sam, also known as Sam, faced deportation earlier this year after an immigration judge questioned why he could not prove any past relationships to help prove his sexuality. The Home Office relented and granted him asylum for five years following a campaign by Sam\u2019s friends at Open Table, an ecumenical Christian community for LGBTQ+ people. Sam, 67, said it was \u201cthe best Christmas present ever\u201d when he received the news. \u201cOh my god, I was so happy. I was at college when my lawyer rang me and I was screaming and shouting, I was so joyful. My classmates were wondering what was going on,\u201d he said. He has been studying travel and tourism at Liverpool college, where he is LGBT class representative, and hopes to become a tour guide, showing visitors from the Far East around the north-west of England.

Labour Together, which is running what it calls a cross-factional commission into the party\u2019s worst election showing since 1935, will assess what went wrong in the December poll. Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Lucy Powell MP, his campaign manager for the 2015 election, are leading the initiative alongside the MP Shabana Mahmood and representatives from unions, local parties and community groups. They will be taking soundings from the leftwing campaign group Momentum and the centre-left group Progress. Although expected leadership contender Lisa Nandy is a member of Labour Together, the review is not designed to back her campaign, Powell told the Guardian. \u201cWe are making sure that those actively seeking leadership themselves or actively helping the leadership candidates are not involved.

There was criticism on social media after the review launched that Miliband is not well placed to guide the party on how to reform for the future considering his defeat to David Cameron in 2015. Powell responded by saying Miliband retained his Labour seat in the \u201cred wall\u201d as others fell to the Tories; has been campaigning in the traditional heartland of Doncaster regularly for the past four years; and has as much to offer \u201cas the next person\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Powell said of the criticism. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got something to contribute at different stages.

On Saturday, several media outlets misrepresented comments the grime artist Stormzy made about racism. In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, in response to the question of whether Britain is still racist, the bestselling musician said, \u201cdefinitely, 100%\u201d. The quote was used in headlines and articles to suggest that Stormzy had said the UK was \u201c100% racist\u201d \u2013 this is the difference between saying the UK absolutely has a problem with racism and everyone in the country is a racist. Stormzy claimed afterwards that the outlets were \u201cintentionally spinning my words\u201d. As sad as it is, the fact that an interview so constructive and insightful could be twisted \u2013 with Stormzy being demonised by the media \u2013 is in no way surprising. Jump forward one day, and there was another incident of racist abuse at a football match, followed by a viral clip of former England player Gary Neville pointing out that racism is a problem not just in football but in the \u201chighest office in the country\u201d. The Sky Sports host David Jones intervened to say that these were the views of Gary Neville and not Sky Sports. Jones has since apologised for \u201cshutting down\u201d the discussion, explaining that he believed he had to intervene when Neville suggested the Conservative and Labour parties \u201cwere to blame\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Though Westminster has fallen quiet for the Christmas period, the contest to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party continues. Here is the latest list of runners and riders. Definite Emily Thornberry: She was the first to declare she was running, but the odds are not great for the shadow foreign secretary. In a bumpy start to the process, she was involved in a spat with the former Labour MP Caroline Flint over comments Thornberry allegedly made about leave voters. (Thornberry denies making the remarks.) One move to differentiate herself from Corbyn has been to say that if Labour floundered in the polls under her leadership, she would quit. She said she would also leave if MPs told her they did not have confidence in her. Clive Lewis: An unexpected entrant in the days before Christmas, Lewis is on the left and has been fairly loyal to Corbyn, serving as a shadow minister. He ranks in the middle of the table in terms of odds and there will be concern that he might split the vote with Rebecca Long-Bailey. His proposals include listening to the party membership more. He has at least one volunteer working on his campaign and is also the first to set up a leadership website, Clive For Leader. Expected to run Rebecca Long-Bailey: Despite not saying a word herself, there has been an intense amount of briefing around the shadow business secretary\u2019s intention to run. She is the closest to Corbyn of the likely candidates, is considered John McDonnell\u2019s protege and is allegedly being pushed forward by his inner circle. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, who is Long-Bailey\u2019s flatmate, has decided to run for deputy to give her a clean shot. Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign would have the weight of big-hitting party associates behind it, including Momentum\u2019s Jon Lansman and the Unite boss, Len McCluskey. Lisa Nandy: She hasn\u2019t declared, nor has she ruled herself out. Yet from the very first few days after the election she was touted as contender, and she is conducting a large \u201clistening\u201d exercise, visiting seats where Labour lost. On Monday she visited Ashfield, which was lost to the Tories after decades in Labour hands. Her pitch focuses on revitalising towns. The number of think pieces and public commentary on Labour\u2019s future from Nandy suggests it is reasonable to expect a bid shortly after Christmas. Keir Starmer: The bookies\u2019 favourite has made significant noises that he is interested in running for leader and is due to launch his campaign properly in the new year. In an interview with the Guardian he said he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d it. The rise in membership of the party is believed to come from moderate remainers and could work in his favour.

      "bodyText": "A pre-Christmas rally fuelled by hopes of waning trade tensions have pushed share prices to a fresh high and on course for their biggest rise in a decade. Donald Trump\u2019s promise that a US-China trade pact would be signed \u201cvery shortly\u201d sent the MSCI gauge of stock markets around the world to new record levels. The boost to share prices was led by Wall Street where both the S&amp;P 500 \u2013 a measure of the performance of the US\u2019s leading companies \u2013 and the technology-rich Nasdaq both traded at unprecedented levels. MSCI\u2019s all-country world index has risen nearly 3% this month amid optimism that 2020 will see a de-escalation of the protectionist stand-off between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the European Union. The index is up 23% in 2019, set for its best year since 2009. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, said sentiment in stock markets was driven by developments in the trade war. \u201cIt\u2019s a rally being based upon momentum buying now. Stocks are being marked up, and it will continue right up until year end,\u201d he said. The scene had been set for an upbeat day of trading after China announced it was to cut tariffs on more than 850 goods from 1 January in order to boost its flagging economy. In a move designed to draw a contrast with Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational approach, Beijing said there would be a temporary cut in duties on products ranging from frozen pork to semiconductors. An outbreak of swine flu prompted the reduction in tariffs on imported pork but China\u2019s willingness to cut the cost of other goods coming into the country reflected concern at the slowest growth rate in 30 years. China\u2019s finance ministry said in a statement that the changes were made to \u201cincrease imports of products facing a relative domestic shortage, or foreign speciality goods for everyday consumption\u201d. Calculations by Bloomberg showed that the tariff cuts will affect almost $400bn (\u00a3309bn) of foreign goods sold to China annually, out of a total import bill of $2tn. Last year Beijing announced a temporary cut in duties on 706 products. The move comes amid expectations that Beijing and Washington are about to sign a phase one trade agreement under which the US will cut tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for greater market access for American farm products. Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said Beijing\u2019s decision to lower import tariffs was a positive step towards a de-escalation of global trade tensions. \u201cIt also represents a positive signal ahead of the expected conclusion of a first-phase trade deal between the US and China. \u201cBy slashing tariffs, China seeks to boost slowing economic growth through a reduction in business and consumers\u2019 costs. It also seeks to boost pork imports as African swine fever has decimated local production. Finally, China also reaffirms its free-trade stance, in sharp contrast with US protectionist rhetoric.\u201d The list of products on which duties will be cut reflects the way in which China\u2019s rapid growth has led to a range of problems from pollution to obesity. Tariffs for some asthma and diabetes medications will be set at zero, the ministry said, noting that the increased purchases of foreign goods would be in line with the growing needs of the Chinese people. China will also lower temporary import tariffs for ferroniobium \u2013 used as an additive to high-strength low-alloy steel and stainless steel for oil and gas pipelines, cars and trucks \u2013 from 1% to zero in 2020 to support its hi-tech development.",

But perhaps the most influential account of Labour\u2019s failure is the one coming from commentators who insist the result vindicates the argument they have been making for a decade: that the left has deserted its \u201ctraditional\u201d working-class base by becoming too liberal. Labour was correct, holds this view, to move left on economics but it should seek to win back socially conservative voters by \u201cmoving right on culture\u201d \u2013 or, to use the phrase of the economist Paul Collier, learn to \u201ctalk the language of belonging\u201d.</p> <p>This is not just an issue for the UK. In western Europe, the established social democratic parties have all seen a long-term decline in support among parts of their working-class base, linked to changes in capitalist production and the rise of political movements that focus on identity and values. The beneficiaries have often been rightwing populists, part of a global wave of movements whose solution to the turbulence of capitalism is a retrenchment of borders, be it physical or cultural.</p> <p>These movements might differ in style and approach but they all propose to redefine their respective nations along narrower lines: against cosmopolitan elites, against religious, cultural or racial minorities, against outsiders. To regain lost ground, goes the argument, the left must make a fuller embrace of nationalism \u2013 something it has failed to do in the past because the intellectuals who shape party policy are squeamish about it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What the 'language of belonging' almost always seems to boil down to is tougher immigration control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What the advocates of this position usually fail to mention is that centre-left parties have repeatedly done this \u2013 and fallen flat on their faces. The link between Labour and voters usually described as its \u201ctraditional\u201d working-class base has been decaying since the early 2000s, and subsequent leaders have tried a variety of techniques to win them back. Under Tony Blair \u2013 a politician adept at using the language and symbols of the nation (his ascent to power in 1997 was accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/tony-blair-posing-with-the-white-cliffs-of-dover-in-the-news-photo/71143960\" title=\"\">a photo</a> of him posing on the white cliffs of Dover) \u2013 Labour tried to shore up its nationalist credentials with highly visible crackdowns on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/04/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices\" title=\"\">asylum seekers</a> and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/may/18/immigration.ukcrime\" title=\"\">foreign criminals</a>\u201d, as the BNP began to appear in former industrial towns once dominated by the left. </p> <p>As prime minister, Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/30/brown-british-jobs-workers\" title=\"\">noisily promised</a> \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d in the wake of the financial crash but came across as insincere \u2013 a feeling crystallised by the moment he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-bigoted-woman\" title=\"\">caught on mic</a> calling a member of the public bigoted.</p> <p>His successor as Labour leader, Ed Miliband, made a more considered attempt to marry a slight shift to the left on economics with the conservative communitarian ideas of Blue Labour: the result was that he managed both to lose Labour\u2019s strongholds in Scotland and be portrayed by the London media as un-English (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/01/ralph-miliband-what-daily-mail-said\" title=\"\">in some quarters</a> with a nasty dig at his Jewish refugee heritage).</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with calls for the left to talk about belonging. What matters is how belonging is defined \u2013 and who gets to do the talking. All too often the assumption is that the left should drape itself in patriotic clothing as a shortcut to power. This ends up with the worst of both worlds: the politicians look insincere, and they reinforce the notion that belonging can only be articulated in exclusionary ways. </p> <p>The conversations we need to have cannot be conducted via a media and political establishment that excludes much of the country it purports to speak for. Those who push for the left to become more nationalistic are overwhelmingly part of the liberal elite they criticise. They are Oxford economists, magazine editors, politics professors and professional thinktankers. What they propose is to add a dose of nationalism to a political system where power remains in the hands of small circles of technocrats.

      "bodyText": "When a party fares as badly as Labour did this election, there are so many reasons for defeat that everyone can simply pick their favourite. Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit, an overstuffed manifesto, an inept campaign, hostile media, Conservative lies. All of these and more are held up by competing factions. But perhaps the most influential account of Labour\u2019s failure is the one coming from commentators who insist the result vindicates the argument they have been making for a decade: that the left has deserted its \u201ctraditional\u201d working-class base by becoming too liberal. Labour was correct, holds this view, to move left on economics but it should seek to win back socially conservative voters by \u201cmoving right on culture\u201d \u2013 or, to use the phrase of the economist Paul Collier, learn to \u201ctalk the language of belonging\u201d. This is not just an issue for the UK. In western Europe, the established social democratic parties have all seen a long-term decline in support among parts of their working-class base, linked to changes in capitalist production and the rise of political movements that focus on identity and values. The beneficiaries have often been rightwing populists, part of a global wave of movements whose solution to the turbulence of capitalism is a retrenchment of borders, be it physical or cultural. These movements might differ in style and approach but they all propose to redefine their respective nations along narrower lines: against cosmopolitan elites, against religious, cultural or racial minorities, against outsiders. To regain lost ground, goes the argument, the left must make a fuller embrace of nationalism \u2013 something it has failed to do in the past because the intellectuals who shape party policy are squeamish about it. What the advocates of this position usually fail to mention is that centre-left parties have repeatedly done this \u2013 and fallen flat on their faces. The link between Labour and voters usually described as its \u201ctraditional\u201d working-class base has been decaying since the early 2000s, and subsequent leaders have tried a variety of techniques to win them back. Under Tony Blair \u2013 a politician adept at using the language and symbols of the nation (his ascent to power in 1997 was accompanied by a photo of him posing on the white cliffs of Dover) \u2013 Labour tried to shore up its nationalist credentials with highly visible crackdowns on asylum seekers and \u201cforeign criminals\u201d, as the BNP began to appear in former industrial towns once dominated by the left. As prime minister, Gordon Brown noisily promised \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d in the wake of the financial crash but came across as insincere \u2013 a feeling crystallised by the moment he was caught on mic calling a member of the public bigoted. His successor as Labour leader, Ed Miliband, made a more considered attempt to marry a slight shift to the left on economics with the conservative communitarian ideas of Blue Labour: the result was that he managed both to lose Labour\u2019s strongholds in Scotland and be portrayed by the London media as un-English (in some quarters with a nasty dig at his Jewish refugee heritage). There is nothing wrong with calls for the left to talk about belonging. What matters is how belonging is defined \u2013 and who gets to do the talking. All too often the assumption is that the left should drape itself in patriotic clothing as a shortcut to power. This ends up with the worst of both worlds: the politicians look insincere, and they reinforce the notion that belonging can only be articulated in exclusionary ways. The conversations we need to have cannot be conducted via a media and political establishment that excludes much of the country it purports to speak for. Those who push for the left to become more nationalistic are overwhelmingly part of the liberal elite they criticise. They are Oxford economists, magazine editors, politics professors and professional thinktankers. What they propose is to add a dose of nationalism to a political system where power remains in the hands of small circles of technocrats. We will hear a lot of talk in the coming months about the need for Labour to listen to voters. Good. But what use is listening if you are then planning to offer yet more of the same? How about finding ways to help people speak \u2013 and take decisions \u2013 for themselves? Furthermore, what \u201cthe language of belonging\u201d almost always seems to boil down to is tougher immigration control. Yet it\u2019s essential to remember that this is a policy, not a campaign slogan. As the hostile environment and the Windrush scandal show all too clearly, this isn\u2019t just talk. Hardening immigration controls comes with a body count \u2013 whether or not the affected individuals are regarded as \u201cbelonging\u201d to the nation. Immigration control can also work to entrench division rather than make people feel more secure. Think of the UK\u2019s asylum policy, a flashpoint for rightwing discontent for several decades. In response to a xenophobic moral panic fuelled by rightwing newspapers in the late 1990s, New Labour placed asylum seekers on a cashless vouchers system and forced them to live in \u201cdispersed\u201d accommodation around the UK, often in deprived areas. The Cameron government privatised asylum seekers\u2019 housing in 2012, pushing people to smaller, more peripheral towns. All this was done under the guise of making British citizens feel safer and more secure. In practice it treats refugees like unwanted guests and gives the impression to longstanding communities that they are having problems \u201cdumped\u201d on them. This is the kind of detail that the people pontificating about \u201cbelonging\u201d rarely grapple with. If Labour were to make a nationalist turn now, it would risk finishing off the parts of its base it has so far retained. Cas Mudde, a leading expert on the far right, argues that copying the right is a dead end and that while centre-left parties may be in trouble, the values that underpin them still have widespread support. But that doesn\u2019t mean the left can\u2019t talk about the nation: the different, contradictory things it means to people, what this says about our histories and where we would like to be in the future. That won\u2019t be comfortable. But talking about belonging \u2013 about solidarity, community, looking out for one another \u2013 is precisely where the left should be strongest. The question has to be how people divided by class, region, history, experience and outlook can build something better together \u2013 not which of those groups should be prized over the others, and treated as more authentic. \u2022 Daniel Trilling is author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe",

      "bodyText": "Back in London, the stock market has enjoyed something of a Santa Rally. The FTSE 100 ended the day 41 points higher, or 0.5%, at 7623, a five-month high. Nearly every sector rose, led by consumer stocks, energy companies, tech companies and industrial firms. China\u2019s easing of tariffs helped the mood, as investors look for a breakthrough in the trade war. The smaller FTSE 250 jumped 0.8%, amid signs of rising business confidence for 2020: But sterling had a weaker day, dropping 0.75 of a cent to a three-week low around $1.293. Brexit anxiety still seems to be bubbling away, although liquidity was also thin in the City so we shouldn\u2019t get too worried/excited. Here\u2019s our latest on the Boeing shake-up: On that note, goodnight, and see you tomorrow for the Christmas Eve session... GW Dennis Muilenburg\u2019s position at Boeing was clearly at risk, once regulators refused to allow the 737 Max to resume flights early next year. As Sky News puts it: Last Tuesday, the US aircraft maker announced that it would temporarily halt production of the grounded 737 MAX aircraft in January. The decision was widely seen as a humiliating admission that the fleet\u2019s fate lies in the hands of regulators after its own timetable to return the planes to service dragged by months. Boeing\u2019s stock is leading the Dow Jones risers in New York, up 2.5% right now. That, and China\u2019s plan to cut some tariffs, has lifted the Dow by 118 point or 0.4% to 28,572 -- on track for a new record close. And here\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, on China\u2019s decision to cut tariffs on hundreds of products -- the day\u2019s big news, apart from Boeing. China is to cut tariffs on more than 850 goods from 1 January in order to boost growth in the world\u2019s second biggest economy. In a move designed to draw a contrast with Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist approach to trade, Beijing said there would be a temporary cut in duties on products ranging from frozen pork to semiconductors. An outbreak of swine flu prompted the reduction in tariffs on imported pork but China\u2019s willingness to cut the cost of other goods coming into the country reflected concern at the slowest growth rate in 30 years. Here\u2019s the Financial Times\u2019s take: The news came days after the largest US exporter sent shockwaves through its supply chain by announcing that it would halt production at its 12,000-strong Renton pant near Seattle. With regulators still reviewing Boeing\u2019s fixes to the Max airlines have been pushing back their estimates for when they will be able to fly it again, with United saying it will not return to service until June. Mr Muilenburg, who spent his entire career with Boeing, was widely criticised for a faltering response to the crashes which killed 346 people and the board indicated that it was aware of the need to improve communication, not least with the Federal Aviation Authority, its domestic regulator. More here: Boeing CEO Muilenburg out after 737 failure Boeing\u2019s new CEO, David Calhoun, says: I strongly believe in the future of Boeing and the 737 MAX. I am honored to lead this great company and the 150,000 dedicated employees who are working hard to create the future of aviation.\u201d Muilenburg\u2019s replacement, chairman David Calhoun, faces a massive task. He need to win regulatory approval to get the 737 Max flying again, and persuade customers that the aircraft is genuinely safe to travel on. Reuters says that Muilenburg\u2019s days have been numbered for some times, but is Calhoun the right person to turn Boeing around? Speculation that Muilenburg would be fired had been circulating in the industry for months, intensifying in October when the board stripped him of his chairman title. A Boeing official said the board deliberated over the weekend and they made the decision to fire Muilenburg in a phone call on Sunday. Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the appointment of Calhoun, who previously served as head of Blackstone Group\u2019s private equity portfolio operation, will provide needed short-term stability, but not the long-term \u201cemphasis on engineering\u201d the company needs. \u201cCalhoun is respected in the industry,\u201d Aboulafia said on Monday. \u201cBut long-term, does he bring the right tool kit? Private equity leans companies out. That\u2019s not Boeing\u2019s problem right now.\u201d Here\u2019s David Madden of CMC Markets: Boeing confirmed that Dennis Muilenburg has resigned from the company amid the 737 Max crisis. David Calhoun has been named as CEO as well as president. The industrial giant is trying to put the 737 Max catastrophes behind it, and the removal of Muilenburg is a part of that strategy, but the group will find it tough to shake off the reputation of the two disasters. The stock is higher on account of the news. Boeing\u2019s shares have jumped by over 3% in early trading in New York, as traders welcome Muilenburg\u2019s exit. Alistair Osborne of The Times argues that Boeing\u2019s board should have acted months ago: Aviation analyst Alex Macheras points to the growing backlast against Boeing, and its chief. Here\u2019s our news story on the sudden departure of Boeing\u2019s CEO: Boeing on Monday fired its chief executive Dennis Muilenburg as the company battles to regain the trust of regulators, customers and the public after two fatal crashes of its best-selling plane, the 737 Max, that claimed 346 lives. The Seattle-based company said its chairman David Calhoun will take over as CEO in January.... Muilenburg\u2019s departure comes a week after Boeing finally suspended production of the 737 Max, having failed to persuade regulators to allow the plane to resume flying. Wall Street has given its verdict -- Boeing\u2019s shares are up 2% in pre-market trading following news of Muilenburg\u2019s resignation. NEWSFLASH: Boeing\u2019s chief executive has resigned. Dennis Muilenburg is leaving the aircraft maker following heavy criticism of the 737 Max crisis, in which two fatal crashes killed hundreds of passengers. In a statement, Boeing says its board decided a new CEO was needed, saying: \u201cThe Board of Directors decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the Company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholder. More to follow.... Economics professor Nouriel Roubini reckons that Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China will rebound on the US. He suspects that the US president\u2019s habit of clashing with America\u2019s allies will undermine efforts to rein in China\u2019s expansionist instincts, and to reform Western capitalism. He writes: The west may not like China\u2019s authoritarian state capitalism, but it must get its own house in order. Western countries need to enact economic reforms to reduce inequality and prevent damaging financial crises, as well as political reforms to contain the populist backlash against globalisation, while still upholding the rule of law. Unfortunately, the current US administration lacks any such strategic vision. The protectionist, unilateralist, illiberal Trump apparently prefers to antagonise US friends and allies, leaving the west divided and ill-equipped to defend and reform the liberal world order that it created. The Chinese probably prefer that Trump be re-elected in 2020. He may be a nuisance in the short run, but, given enough time in office, he will destroy the strategic alliances that form the foundation of American soft and hard power. Like a real-life \u201cManchurian Candidate,\u201d Trump will \u201cmake China great again.\u201d China\u2019s vice-premier Li Keqiang has hinted that Beijing could cut its benchmark interest rate. That\u2019s another sign that the administration wants to stimulate its economy, on top of today\u2019s move to cut tariffs in January. According to state television channel CCTV, Li said the government will consider more measures to lower financing costs for smaller companies. That could include broad-based and \u201ctargeted\u201d cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), relending and rediscounting. Li was speaking during a visit to Sichuan province. There\u2019s little cheer in the UK\u2019s retail sector today. Shop visitor numbers were down 8% last Saturday, compared to a year ago, dashing hopes of a last rush to the tills. That\u2019s a blow to the high street, and out of town malls, who have already suffered weak trading this year. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Saturday was not so super for retailers last weekend, as numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres fell by nearly 8% on the previous year. With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and have learned to hang on for last-minute bargains. More than a third (36%) of Brits have left gift-buying until the last few days before Christmas, according to Argos. It said that 10% more men than women leave gift-buying until very late, with the most popular gift bought in its stores on Christmas Eve last year being an electric toothbrush. Don\u2019t spoil the surprise, Sarah! More here..... Here\u2019s our news story on the Vimto profits warning: Hopes of a trade war breakthrough mean Wall Street should post its best year since 2013, with the S&amp;P 500 index up around 28% this year. Fears of a recession have eased, as Reuters explains: U.S. stock index futures touched new record highs on Monday, as President Donald Trump said over the weekend that the United States and China would \u201cvery shortly\u201d sign their so-called Phase One trade pact. The Phase One deal, announced earlier this month, helped fuel a rally on Wall Street, with its three main indexes hitting record closing highs on Friday. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 also registered its biggest weekly percentage gain since early September. China said it will lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork and avocado to some types of semiconductors next year. As the year draws to a close the benchmark index has risen 28.5% in 2019, putting it on track for its best annual performance since 2013. On Friday, markets also cheered data which showed a rise in consumer spending, adding to a slew of encouraging data that has helped put a damper on recession fears, which plagued markets earlier this year. The US stock market could hit a record high of its own today. The main indices are up 0.1% in the futures market, as traders take heart from China\u2019s plan to cut tariffs. Switzerland\u2019s stock index, the SMI, just hit a record high. It\u2019s up 34 points, or 0.3%, in a pre-Christmas rally. Trade war optimism, and the weaker pound, has driven the FTSE 100 index to a five-month high. The Footsie index just struck 7617 points for the first time sine July. As this chart shows, the FTSE 100 is up 400 points, or over 5%, since the general election. Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, suspects the optimism will face in 2020. It\u2019s possible that there will be some bounce in activity given the clarity on Brexit, but any improvement in sentiment is likely to fade as the next Brexit deadline draws closer\u201d. UBS predicts the UK will only grow by 0.9% in 2020, a very weak performance, following 1.2% this year. Spying on one senior executive is unfortunate. Two looks incredibly suspicious. So there are red faces at Credit Suisse today, which has admitted that its HR boss was tracked by private detectives earlier this year. My colleague Kayleena Makortoff explains: The bank has confirmed that its former head of human resources Peter Goerke was followed for \u201cseveral days\u201d in February this year by private detectives hired on behalf of the bank. This follows the revelation that Iqbal Khan, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division, had been chased by investigators through the streets of Zurich in September. Credit Suisse insisted at the time that the Khan incident was a one-off and that its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, had no knowledge of it. However, on Monday it confirmed the second case involving Goerke and once again cleared Thiam of any responsibility. It is understood that the surveillance of Goerke was conducted after he was told he was being bumped off the executive team and demoted to a senior adviser role, which he still holds. Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in London are turning higher, on the final full trading day before Christmas. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms, many focused on the UK, is up 1% today at 21,900. The blue-chip FTSE 100 is now up 33 points, or 0.45%. China\u2019s tariff-reduction plan is cheering investors (those who haven\u2019t departed for festive fun). But there\u2019s another factor - the pound is now dipping, back below $1.30 (-0.25% today). Bloomberg points out that medical products, orange juice and logs will also benefit from China\u2019s lower tariffs: There\u2019s not much drama in the foreign exchange market. Sterling inched up to $1.303, up 0.2%, having fallen steadily last week as Brexit fears reappeared. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says traders are more interested in Christmas than currencies today: We\u2019ve made it past the shortest day, but markets are still struggling to wake up and the morning\u2019s FX range could be covered by a handkerchief. Sterling\u2019s bounced a bit, the won is weaker, the market\u2019s got mince pies on the mind. Here\u2019s Agathe Demarais, Global Forecasting Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, on China\u2019s tariff cuts: China\u2019s decision to lower import tariffs on 850 goods from January 1st represents a positive sign of de-escalation amid global trade tensions. It also represents a positive signal ahead of the expected conclusion of a first-phase trade deal between the US and China. By slashing tariffs, China seeks to boost slowing economic growth through a reduction in business and consumers costs. It also seeks to boost pork imports as African Swine Fever has decimated local production. Finally, China also re-affirms its free-trade stance, in sharp contrast with US protectionist rhetoric. Despite this positive sign, we continue to expect that the US-China conflict will persist in 2020 as it spills over into other areas than trade, such as the financial and tech spheres. A new sweeteners tax has dealt a bitter blow to Nichols, the maker of Vimto. Nichols has issued a profits warning this morning, saying 2020 profits could be materially lower than hoped. It blamed a new 50% tax on all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks, imposed in Saudi Arabia and the UAE at the start of December. Vimto, the fruit and herb-flavoured drink, is a popular drink in the region during Radaman -- when Nichols makes 80% of its sales. Nichols says it will invest more in promoting Vimto, to combat the price hike. It told shareholders: The Saudi Arabian and UAE tax authorities have recently implemented an excise tax of 50%, to be levied on the retail price of non-carbonated sweetened drinks. This tax will be applied to all non-carbonated drinks containing either natural or artificial sweeteners, including sales of Vimto products. Therefore, unlike the UK soft drinks levy, product reformulation is not an option. Shares in Nichols are down 17% this morning. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe, says investors are optimistic that the trade wars will cool down in 2020. He writes: It\u2019s been a strong run up to Christmas for the stock markets and it seems traders are taking a little breather in this shortened trading week. European stocks are trading slightly in negative territory at the start of the week, although there\u2019s very little we can read into this, given the lower festive volumes and news flow. It\u2019s been a good few week\u2019s for investors, spurred primarily by the de-escalation in the trade war, with Trump only this weekend claiming it will be signed very shortly. Donald Trump continues to tantalise us with the prospect of a trade deal with China. On Saturday, the US president claimed that he will sign off a preliminary deal very soon. He told a Turning Point USA event in Florida that: \u201cWe just achieved a breakthrough on the trade deal and we will be signing it very shortly.\u201d But what\u2019s the hold up? Back in October, Trump announced that a Phase One deal was agreed. Over a week ago,US and China officials both announced that the details were pretty much finalised. But still, no signing ceremony, and no firm details of the agreement. This is worst than waiting for Santa! Shares in NMC Healthcare, the UAE\u2019s largest healthcare provider, have surged nearly 25% after it responded to an attack from short-seller Muddy Waters. NMC has launched an \u2018independent review\u2019 of its books, days after Muddy Waters claimed that its asset values, cash balance, reported profits and debt levels could be inaccurate. That sent NMC\u2019s share slumping last week, from \u00a326 to \u00a313 in a few days. They\u2019re now back at \u00a316.14 this morning, at the top of the FTSE 100. With two days until Christmas, European stock markets are notably quiet. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 18 points, or 0.25%; technology, consumer non-cyclicals and industrials are the only sectors rising today. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 is also a little weaker, down 0.1%. Many traders will have squared their books ahead of the festive break, banking profits (or swallowing losses) for the year. Beijing\u2019s tariff-reduction plan wasn\u2019t enough to stop Chinese stocks falling today. The CSI 300 index has shed 1.3%, its biggest fall in six weeks, led by a slump in tech shares. That\u2019s because a major state-controlled fund announced plans to cut its stakes in certain technology companies. Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, says Beijing is sending a message....and also trying to support its economy. \u201cThe move in lowering import tariffs reflects that the government wants to reaffirm its stance to the world on freer trade amid the trade war. Domestically, lowering import tariffs are helpful in reducing business and consumer costs. Bloomberg has calculated that China imported $389bn of the products whose tariffs are being lowered. That\u2019s a significant amount - China imported around $2 trillion of goods, according to customs data. Analysts are welcoming China\u2019s plan to cut tariffs. It is \u201canother positive step in the US-China trade story\u201d, says David Madden of CMC Markets (who gets a bonus point for not signing off for Christmas yet). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Christmas has come early, for those looking for a reduction in the trade tensions that have hurt the world economy this year. Overnight, Beijing has announced it is lowering the tariffs on more than 850 imports, making it cheaper for Chinese firms to buy products from abroad. Items on the list range from frozen pork (where domestic supplies have suffered from African swine fever) to high-tech parts and industrial products. The move kicks in on 1 January. The goal is to lower trade barriers to support China\u2019s economy, where growth has recently slowed to a 20-year low. China\u2019s finance ministry says lower tariffs should \u201cincrease imports of products facing a relative domestic shortage, or foreign speciality goods for everyday consumption.\u201d These new temporary import tariffs are significantly lower than China\u2019s \u201cmost-favoured-nation duty\u201d tariffs - the lowest permanent levy. For example, the tariffs on frozen pork will be cut to 8% from 12%, frozen avocado will drop from 30 % to 7%, and semiconductors will not incur any tariff at all, Reuters reports. After more 18 months of watching tariffs going up, as the US and China traded blows, it\u2019s encouraging to see them being lowered. It may bolster hopes that presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will finally sign their Phase One trade deal soon (perhaps at Davos next month?!). But.... it could also indicate that China\u2019s economy is continuing to slow, needing a boost. The move comes as the financial markets wind down for Christmas. Stocks have dipped in Asia overnight, and we\u2019re expecting a subdued day in Europe too.",

      "bodyText": "A former Navy Seal controversially granted clemency for war crimes by Donald Trump last month was photographed with the president in Florida at the weekend, and handed over a gift to thank him for reversing his demotion. Chief petty officer Eddie Gallagher, who was convicted of posing with the dead body of a teenage Islamic State terrorist he had just killed in Iraq in 2017, posted photographs to his Instagram account showing himself and his wife Andrea meeting the president and first lady, Melania Trump, at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. \u201cFinally got to thank the President and his amazing wife by giving them a little gift from Eddie\u2019s deployment to Mosul,\u201d a caption accompanying the eight photographs said, without identifying what the present was. Trump angered military leaders in November when he granted clemency to Gallagher as one of a number of interventions in cases of service members accused of killings in Afghanistan and Iraq. In Gallagher\u2019s case, Trump ordered a promotion for the special warfare operator first class who had been cleared by a military jury in 2018 of murder but convicted of posing with the body. \u201cGood story behind this, got him with my hunting knife,\u201d Gallagher had boasted in an email to a friend that contained a photograph of him holding the deceased captive by the head. Just weeks before Trump interceded, Adm Mike Gilday, the US navy\u2019s chief of operations, denied Gallagher\u2019s request for clemency and upheld a sentence of a reduction in rank. \u201cThe Navy will NOT be taking away War Fighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s Trident pin,\u201d Trump tweeted on 21 November. \u201cThe case was handled very badly from the beginning.\u201d Gallagher was allowed to retire from the service as a Seal, retaining an additional $200,000 pension he would have forfeited had his demotion stood. Navy secretary Richard Spencer was ousted by the White House in the aftermath of the controversy, and wrote a scathing opinion piece for the Washington Post attacking Trump for his \u201cshocking and unprecedented\u201d intervention in Gallagher\u2019s case, and claiming the president \u201chas very little understanding\u201d of how the military works. Gallagher\u2019s appearance at Mar-a-Lago came as little surprise to some observers, among them the legal analyst Glenn Kirschner, who accused Trump in a tweet of ushering in \u201cthe death of decency\u201d. Earlier, Gallagher was pictured with the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, at a conservative student action summit hosted by the campus activist group Turning Point USA in West Palm Beach, according to the New York Post.",

      "body": "<p>George Monbiot (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/18/demagogues-power-rewilding-party-trust-power-government\" title=\"\">The answer to demagoguery: it\u2019s called political rewilding</a>, Journal, 18 December) is spot-on, although he may be undervaluing the role of locally elected politicians. They can, in my experience, be crucial in orchestrating new possibilities.</p> <p>In my recent book Leading the Inclusive City, the evidence I present is entirely in line with Monbiot\u2019s analysis. The key challenge facing modern societies is between place-less power and place-based power.</p> <p>Place-less leaders, many of them powerful figures working for multinational companies, make decisions without considering the consequences for communities in particular localities. In contrast, place-based leaders are in touch with local feelings of identity and solidarity, and care about the quality of life of people in their locality. Many of them strive to achieve social, economic and environmental justice. Civic leaders in a large number of cities and localities across the planet already have this understanding and are implementing progressive place-based policies with great success.</p> <p>The UK is off the pace, mainly because central government policies have, since 2010, suppressed local power to a remarkable degree. Luckily there is massive political space to advance a counter-argument, as Monbiot suggests.<br><strong>Robin Hambleton</strong><br><em>Professor emeritus of city leadership, University of the West of England</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is right (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/15/labour-revival-change-community-activists-plymouth\" title=\"\">If Labour is to revive, it must tap into change on the ground</a>, Journal, 16 December). Labour has to return to its roots and rebuild trust with the people whose votes it seeks. For now, there is little it can do in parliament; there will be no effective opposition while its big beasts fight each other to a standstill. But on the ground, the new army of activists can make a difference. Here are a few suggestions: provide advocacy for people claiming benefits and fighting appeals; assist EU residents with applying for their right to stay in the UK; help volunteers and charities to bid successfully for grants that will enable them to continue their work. Time is short: Labour must show it has something to offer at street level if it is to avoid further humiliation at May\u2019s local elections.<br><strong>James Lindesay</strong><br><em>Leicester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps one way of reinventing the Labour movement would be to emulate the cooperation between the mayors of Budapest, Bratislava, Prague and Warsaw in establishing a pact to stand against rightwing central governments (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/16/islands-in-the-illiberal-storm-central-european-cities-vow-to-stand-together\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 17 December). A solid red wall of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Bradford acting in concert could certainly point the way to a fresh leftwing, progressive approach to politics springing from the grassroots of regional, municipal civic pride, which would offer a viable alternative to the tired old top-down approach.<br><strong>Neil Wigglesworth</strong><br><em>Forton, Lancashire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins was spot-on when he wrote that \u201clocal government ... remains Cinderella in the scullery\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/19/johnson-cummings-new-politics-populism-optimism\" title=\"\">This was the Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 as written by Cummings</a>, Journal, 20 December), and it\u2019s a scullery desperately short of supplies. Successive Tory governments have put ever greater responsibilities on councils while their democratic control over the services they provide has been progressively decreased and their funding has been cut repeatedly. Local democracy has been sidelined. It is time for local authorities and their constituents to band together to make their voices heard, noisily, for the sake of that democracy and of the wellbeing of our nation.<br><strong>Diana Francis</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "George Monbiot (The answer to demagoguery: it\u2019s called political rewilding, Journal, 18 December) is spot-on, although he may be undervaluing the role of locally elected politicians. They can, in my experience, be crucial in orchestrating new possibilities. In my recent book Leading the Inclusive City, the evidence I present is entirely in line with Monbiot\u2019s analysis. The key challenge facing modern societies is between place-less power and place-based power. Place-less leaders, many of them powerful figures working for multinational companies, make decisions without considering the consequences for communities in particular localities. In contrast, place-based leaders are in touch with local feelings of identity and solidarity, and care about the quality of life of people in their locality. Many of them strive to achieve social, economic and environmental justice. Civic leaders in a large number of cities and localities across the planet already have this understanding and are implementing progressive place-based policies with great success. The UK is off the pace, mainly because central government policies have, since 2010, suppressed local power to a remarkable degree. Luckily there is massive political space to advance a counter-argument, as Monbiot suggests. Robin Hambleton Professor emeritus of city leadership, University of the West of England \u2022 John Harris is right (If Labour is to revive, it must tap into change on the ground, Journal, 16 December). Labour has to return to its roots and rebuild trust with the people whose votes it seeks. For now, there is little it can do in parliament; there will be no effective opposition while its big beasts fight each other to a standstill. But on the ground, the new army of activists can make a difference. Here are a few suggestions: provide advocacy for people claiming benefits and fighting appeals; assist EU residents with applying for their right to stay in the UK; help volunteers and charities to bid successfully for grants that will enable them to continue their work. Time is short: Labour must show it has something to offer at street level if it is to avoid further humiliation at May\u2019s local elections. James Lindesay Leicester \u2022 Perhaps one way of reinventing the Labour movement would be to emulate the cooperation between the mayors of Budapest, Bratislava, Prague and Warsaw in establishing a pact to stand against rightwing central governments (Report, 17 December). A solid red wall of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Bradford acting in concert could certainly point the way to a fresh leftwing, progressive approach to politics springing from the grassroots of regional, municipal civic pride, which would offer a viable alternative to the tired old top-down approach. Neil Wigglesworth Forton, Lancashire \u2022 Simon Jenkins was spot-on when he wrote that \u201clocal government ... remains Cinderella in the scullery\u201d (This was the Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 as written by Cummings, Journal, 20 December), and it\u2019s a scullery desperately short of supplies. Successive Tory governments have put ever greater responsibilities on councils while their democratic control over the services they provide has been progressively decreased and their funding has been cut repeatedly. Local democracy has been sidelined. It is time for local authorities and their constituents to band together to make their voices heard, noisily, for the sake of that democracy and of the wellbeing of our nation.

      "body": "<p>The journalist Alex Duval Smith, who has died of cancer aged 55, was a free spirit with a remarkable gift for connecting with others across social, language or cultural barriers.</p> <p>For more than two decades she worked as a reporter and correspondent in European and African countries, for the Guardian, the Independent, the Observer, the BBC, Radio France International and France 24. She had a deep knowledge of and love for Africa and was a citizen of the world \u2013 with two nationalities and three languages; she had lived in almost a dozen countries.</p> <p>After a period in Paris, in 1998 she became the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, based in Johannesburg. It was her first assignment in Africa, from where she worked as a freelance after she left her staff position.</p> <p>Over the years she reported on wars and violence, human rights violations and tragedies, but she never turned into a cynic nor did she develop a \u201cwhite saviour\u201d attitude. She respected the people she met for her other stories that showed life in villages, and the vibrant and diverse cultures of the countries she was based in: South Africa, Mali, Ivory Coast and Senegal.</p> <p>Alex was an old school journalist \u2013 empathic, diligent and a seeker of the facts and the truth. She preferred to be \u201cout in the field\u201d rather than doing research from behind a desk. She could move with ease and charm at ambassadorial residences or presidential palaces, but her true self shone through when she was chasing stories on dusty village roads, in African markets, Polish coalmining towns or in the backstreets of Paris.</p> <p>I met Alex as a fellow journalist when she came to Warsaw in 2015 as a freelance correspondent for the Guardian, having moved from Bamako, the capital of Mali. She did not know a word of Polish at that time, but faced the new challenge with enthusiasm, creativity and her wry sense of humour.</p> <p>If her interviewees were not fluent in English, Alex would walk a mile to find someone\u2019s son-in-law who had worked as a builder in the UK and who could translate. A group of giggling schoolchildren would proudly show off their English skills so that Alex could talk to a grandmotherly <em>babcia</em> running a village shop to find out how emigration to Britain had changed local communities.</p> <p>Some of her best stories were about people who might otherwise have been overlooked, such as her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33808629\" title=\"\">piece on Doumbia</a> \u2013 \u201cMali\u2019s most dedicated postman\u201d \u2013 for the BBC in 2015.</p> <p>She would follow up on what had happened to some of the people she wrote about and sometimes get personally involved. When she was doing a story on gay activists organising a pride parade in a southern Polish town amid a great deal of homophobia, she ended up helping to print T-shirts for the march. After investigating forced early marriage in Mali, she stayed in touch to find out about the fate of some of the young girls.</p> <p>For Alex, who came out as a gay woman in her 20s it was important to support human rights, women\u2019s issues and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as write about them.</p> <p>Born in London, she was the daughter of Peter Duval Smith, a journalist, screenwriter and BBC producer who died in 1967, and Daphne Jonason, an actor. Alex was too young to have known her father, but his picture hung over her desk wherever she worked.</p> <p>Her mother had Swedish roots and they moved to Sweden when she was seven and attended the French lyc\u00e9e in Stockholm. Fluent in English, French and Swedish, she returned to London in the early 1980s and in 1986 she married Simon Clark, an actor with the RSC. The couple divorced amicably in 1993 and remained friendly. After that, she had several female partners with whom she maintained close relations throughout her life. </p> <p>She began her journalism career working shifts as a subeditor at the Guardian in the mid-80s, before becoming part of the paper\u2019s Europe section and then an assistant editor on the foreign desk. Her break as a foreign reporter came in 1995, when she was assigned a temporary post in Paris. She stayed on for three years, before being sent to Johannesburg. </p> <p>While she was working as a producer for the BBC in Dakar, Senegal, she was diagnosed with a lung tumour. Alex faced her illness as she did everything in life \u2013 with courage and positivity, determined not to let it define her. She took up art and music classes.

      "bodyText": "The journalist Alex Duval Smith, who has died of cancer aged 55, was a free spirit with a remarkable gift for connecting with others across social, language or cultural barriers. For more than two decades she worked as a reporter and correspondent in European and African countries, for the Guardian, the Independent, the Observer, the BBC, Radio France International and France 24. She had a deep knowledge of and love for Africa and was a citizen of the world \u2013 with two nationalities and three languages; she had lived in almost a dozen countries. After a period in Paris, in 1998 she became the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, based in Johannesburg. It was her first assignment in Africa, from where she worked as a freelance after she left her staff position. Over the years she reported on wars and violence, human rights violations and tragedies, but she never turned into a cynic nor did she develop a \u201cwhite saviour\u201d attitude. She respected the people she met for her other stories that showed life in villages, and the vibrant and diverse cultures of the countries she was based in: South Africa, Mali, Ivory Coast and Senegal. Alex was an old school journalist \u2013 empathic, diligent and a seeker of the facts and the truth. She preferred to be \u201cout in the field\u201d rather than doing research from behind a desk. She could move with ease and charm at ambassadorial residences or presidential palaces, but her true self shone through when she was chasing stories on dusty village roads, in African markets, Polish coalmining towns or in the backstreets of Paris. I met Alex as a fellow journalist when she came to Warsaw in 2015 as a freelance correspondent for the Guardian, having moved from Bamako, the capital of Mali. She did not know a word of Polish at that time, but faced the new challenge with enthusiasm, creativity and her wry sense of humour. If her interviewees were not fluent in English, Alex would walk a mile to find someone\u2019s son-in-law who had worked as a builder in the UK and who could translate. A group of giggling schoolchildren would proudly show off their English skills so that Alex could talk to a grandmotherly babcia running a village shop to find out how emigration to Britain had changed local communities. Some of her best stories were about people who might otherwise have been overlooked, such as her piece on Doumbia \u2013 \u201cMali\u2019s most dedicated postman\u201d \u2013 for the BBC in 2015. She would follow up on what had happened to some of the people she wrote about and sometimes get personally involved. When she was doing a story on gay activists organising a pride parade in a southern Polish town amid a great deal of homophobia, she ended up helping to print T-shirts for the march. After investigating forced early marriage in Mali, she stayed in touch to find out about the fate of some of the young girls. For Alex, who came out as a gay woman in her 20s it was important to support human rights, women\u2019s issues and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as write about them. Born in London, she was the daughter of Peter Duval Smith, a journalist, screenwriter and BBC producer who died in 1967, and Daphne Jonason, an actor. Alex was too young to have known her father, but his picture hung over her desk wherever she worked. Her mother had Swedish roots and they moved to Sweden when she was seven and attended the French lyc\u00e9e in Stockholm. Fluent in English, French and Swedish, she returned to London in the early 1980s and in 1986 she married Simon Clark, an actor with the RSC. The couple divorced amicably in 1993 and remained friendly. After that, she had several female partners with whom she maintained close relations throughout her life. She began her journalism career working shifts as a subeditor at the Guardian in the mid-80s, before becoming part of the paper\u2019s Europe section and then an assistant editor on the foreign desk. Her break as a foreign reporter came in 1995, when she was assigned a temporary post in Paris. She stayed on for three years, before being sent to Johannesburg. While she was working as a producer for the BBC in Dakar, Senegal, she was diagnosed with a lung tumour. Alex faced her illness as she did everything in life \u2013 with courage and positivity, determined not to let it define her. She took up art and music classes. Only a few weeks before her death she planned to join a choir and had started a new project \u2013 a children\u2019s book on cancer, told from the perspective of a dog, inspired by her Jack Russell terrier, Tertius. Alex is survived by two half-sisters and a half-brother, as well as by those she called her social family. \u2022 Alex Duval Smith, journalist, born 28 October 1964; died 7 December 2019",

He ended the piece by saying: \u201cI have always wished I could fly. When I die I hope that someone will scatter my ashes in this forest. Then perhaps one day an ant will pick up a little piece of that ash. Then maybe a bird will pick up the ant and fly up into the sky with it. Then at last David Bellamy will be able to fly.\u201d",

The brief noted that while state and territory governments are considered the first responders, the federal government\u2019s role is to support the governments through national coordination of efforts in the event crises cross state borders, as well as developing and implementing national mitigation policies. \u201cThe Australian government provides support to the states and territories when coordinated assistance is requested [or] jointly manages a crisis with state and territories if the crisis has the potential to affect, or has affected multiple jurisdictions.\u201d The document said the federal government had responsibility for a national crisis coordination centre for hazard monitoring across the country, as well as responsibility for the national aerial firefighting centre. In April the government set up the national disaster risk reduction framework with $130.6m set out over five years to help state and territory governments implement the strategies in the framework. The framework identifies climate risk as part of the overall national disaster risk, but strategies are focused on identifying potential disaster risks and collecting data on disasters, rather than specific action on climate change.",

      "bodyText": "In the weeks before Christmas, the main street of Braidwood is quiet. Summer is ordinarily peak tourist season, with families from Canberra stopping in on the way to Bateman\u2019s Bay, but the recent bushfires, which still burn nearby, have put an end to travel to and from the coast. Many businesses are simply closed, with handwritten signs taped to the windows\u2014 \u201cclosed today due to bushfire conditions\u201d \u2013 as shopkeepers head out with the RFS or stay in their own homes to defend them if the fire front shifts. Hot, dry winds scatter ash and powdery topsoil over town, forcing locals inside, and the pub, when it\u2019s open, is full of exhausted RFS volunteers, instantly visible in their bright yellow and soot-smeared faces. The worst days of the fire have passed but there is a lingering feeling of suspended animation in town, with nobody able to predict when the danger will pass. The town\u2019s economic future is a major source of apprehension. Over the past few years, Braidwood, formerly nicknamed \u201cDeadwood\u201d, has become rejuvenated by a steady stream of young families and newcomers, who have moved for lower prices and to join the town\u2019s long-established creative community. But many of the ventures which give Braidwood its particular flavour rely on passing trade; the Kings Highway closure has set businesses up for a very hard new year. The RFS is still being called out, and mosquito squads are travelling out to fight fires as well, with water barrels strapped to the back of utes. Those in town, left worrying about family and friends, are now beginning to contend with how life has changed since the bushfires began \u2013 a question that will occupy more and more people as the summer goes on. Kelly Sturgiss, musician and music teacher For Kelly Sturgiss, the bushfires came on the heels of a hard few months; her small business, Sturkella Music, has only recently launched, and she is still recovering from an injury sustained at her second job as a waitress. Broken glass severed a tendon in her hand, which required intensive surgery. Like many small business owners, the ongoing disruption has put her in a financially precarious situation. As a sole trader, her income is irregular, and contingent on the number of hours she works. School closures at St Bede\u2019s primary school, where she teaches privately, have meant that she\u2019s missed weeks of scheduled music lessons, and road closures have forced her to cancel the lessons she gives in Canberra. Like a lot of people, she mentions feeling guilty for worrying about her own problems when people are losing properties and homes. She knows that she is lucky, but her breathing is audible and her voice rasps; her lungs, affected by a chronic condition, have been struggling to cope with the polluted air. \u201cI am using a lot of Ventolin. My lungs have been very affected. It\u2019s a shame because I\u2019d done a lot of recovery and now I feel like I\u2019m back to square one.\u201d To help pass the time, she has opened her house to local kids, holding impromptu jam sessions and giving pointers to anyone interested. \u201cIt was really nice to be able to provide that space for children to feel a bit normal, and maybe express their feelings as well.\u201d Karuna Bajracharya, publican \u201cI think every man and his dog who\u2019s not in the RFS wishes they could be out there fighting the fires right now,\u201d Karuna Bajracharya says. \u201cWhen they started, we sat down and thought about what we\u2019re good at \u2013 and we\u2019re good at events, so we decided to do a fundraiser.\u201d Bajracharya and his wife, Karuna, run a Himalayan restaurant and bar, The Smokey Horse, which hosts a regular Sunday session. They advertised the event on social media, adding a note asking Canberrans to come patronise Braidwood businesses if they could. The response to this appeal was immediate. \u201cPeople came to the fundraiser that I\u2019d never seen before, who told us that they\u2019d come because they wanted to support Braidwood,\u201d Bajracharya says. \u201cThey went up and down the street buying their veggies and their Christmas presents. That was really touching.\u201d The fundraising event raised $3,000, which he is planning to donate directly to various local RFS branches, alongside a percentage of the bar\u2019s takings from the night. As well as running the venue, Bajracharya has been taking care of the children, while Garung commutes to Canberra for work. Snow was excited about the school closures, but Pema, his older sister, has been frustrated about missing the last few weeks. With telecommunications dropping out, she\u2019s concerned about her friends on rural properties, and ongoing news coverage of the crisis hasn\u2019t helped. \u201cThe news just makes everyone sad,\u201d she says. \u201c[The newsreaders] just make everyone scared and feel worse. I think I\u2019m OK because I live in town, but one of my friends was really panicking on the day that got bad. She lives out on a farm and her pop lives out on a farm. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to her now, but she was really worried.\u201d Jacqui Singh, mental health nurse Jacqui Singh moved to Braidwood a few years ago from the Blue Mountains in order to help care for her partner\u2019s late father. Her kids go to school in town, and are both members of the 1st Braidwood Scouts, where at the last meeting of the year Santa takes a break from his work in the RFS to drive in on a fire truck and deliver presents. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely noticed that it\u2019s been something that the whole community\u2019s feeling,\u201d she says, as children tear around. \u201cI think a lot of people have pulled together, and are trying to make the best of a situation we have no control over.\u201d Singh is the proud owner of new kidney, \u201cKareem\u201d, which she received three months ago. Before the transplant, she had dialysis at home, using a machine that was ill-equipped to deal with extreme temperatures and which would have made evacuation difficult. She\u2019s thankful that the timing worked out as it did, especially in giving her a period of respite. \u201cOne of the blessings of being off work for a period of time is that I have been able to focus on the children a bit more. Kids pick up on your anxiety, so I\u2019ve been trying to manage that so that they\u2019re not stressing out, trying to make school closures into something fun, like a pyjama day. It\u2019s been difficult, though, because of the health concerns from the smoke.\u201d Michelle Heaney and Norma Flack, op shop volunteers Michelle Heaney and Norma Flack live across the road from each other, and spend their Fridays at the op shop, sorting through donations. Sitting at a table in the back room, they recount the anxiety of the past few weeks, prompting each other when need be. Flames had reached the tree line behind Flack\u2019s house when helicopters arrived, \u201clike something out of a western\u201d, she says. Though the area has seen bushfires before, Flack had not experienced a fire as intense as this. The recent drought exacerbated the fire conditions, but Flack has witnessed the region become drier over her lifetime. \u201cOur beautiful river is not like it should be,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was magical in a good time. We used to say \u2018aren\u2019t we lucky?\u2019 Now, all that water is gone.\u201d Heaney, a long-time environmentalist, remembers Christmas beetles so thick she could scoop them out of the air. She\u2019s spent decades trying to prevent a catastrophe like these fires, being sneered at \u201cas either a greenie leftie ratbag or a latte-sipping elitist\u201d, depending on the times.

      "body": "<p>For many Australians, the day before Christmas is the fishiest time of the year. The Sydney Fish Market is famously open for a marathon 36 hours straight, as is Kailis Bros fish market in Perth and Conway Fish Trading in Melbourne\u2019s Footscray.</p> <p>But in addition to wondering where you can get seafood, when you can get seafood and how much you\u2019ll have to pay for your seafood (more than usual, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-23/prawn-prices-rise-in-nsw-as-drought-hits-supply/11818890\">this year</a>), many Australians are also unsure of how to get seafood that is sustainably sourced. A recent survey by YouGov, on behalf of the Marine Stewardship Council, found just 33% of Australians knew where to purchase sustainably sourced prawns.</p> <p>Given seafood is the most globally traded food commodity, <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/ersd201003_e.htm\">according to the World Trade Organisation</a>, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising. \u201cThe Australian fishing industry imports 70% of our seafood by volume, but exports about 50% by value,\u201d says Adrian Meder, the sustainable seafood program manager of the Australian Marine Conservation Society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/18/australias-top-restaurants-pledge-to-serve-only-sustainable-seafood\">Australia's top restaurants pledge to serve only sustainable seafood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thanks to seafood\u2019s complex supply chains and the sheer variety available, making choices that have a light impact \u2013 in terms of stock levels and collateral damage to protected species and to the marine environment \u2013 might seem daunting.</p> <p>There is also internal debate within the marine sciences about what should and should not be considered sustainable. This means sustainability advice can be contradictory, as different bodies have different methods for assessment. So, where does that leave you?</p> <h2>When a cod is not a cod</h2> <p>\u201cAround a third of seafood globally [is] being mislabelled or misdescribed,\u201d says Alex Webb, of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The council is a not-for-profit organisation, primarily funded by logo licensing and donations, which sets global standards for sustainable wild-caught seafood and offers a global labelling program called the \u201cblue fish tick\u201d. The program has a sister organisation, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, which offers certification standards and a tick for farmed fish.</p> <p>In order to qualify for a blue fish tick, fisheries have to undergo multiple stages of assessment, undertaken by an independent third party. According to the MSC, about 80% of applicants to the program drop out at the pre-assessment phase. At present, 15% of the global wild-caught fish supply by value is certified by the MSC, while in Australia that figure rises to 38%.</p> <p>The certification process places a high standard on correct labelling and provenance, Webb says. \u201cOur traceability system almost eradicates that issue. We do DNA testing that shows in over 99% of cases, seafood with that blue fish tick is what it says it is.\u201d</p> <p>Meder agrees mislabelling is \u201ca really serious issue in Australia\u201d. He gives the example of fish-and-chip shop flake, which should be gummy shark but could just as easily be mako or even \u201can endangered hammerhead shark\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually a great thing that the blue tick does: it provides a really high standard of traceability for a fish,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to buy a fish with a blue tick that isn\u2019t well accounted for.\u201d</p> <h2>When enough is not enough</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"593838ea52e019738b078bc72d435cd28027671f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/593838ea52e019738b078bc72d435cd28027671f/562_282_2304_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Stewardship Council-certified banana prawns in a supermarket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"816\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marine Stewardship Council-certified banana prawns for sale in a supermarket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MSC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the Marine Stewardship Council and Australian Marine Conservation Society are aligned on issues of traceability, they take different approaches to their recommendations.</p> <p>The Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) tries to provide a rating system that covers the vast majority of local and imported fish available in Australia, via a website and app \u2013 the <a href=\"https://goodfish.org.au/sustainable-seafood-guide/\">Sustainable Seafood Guide</a>. Fish are ranked on a traffic-light system of red \u201csay no\u201d, amber \u201ceat less\u201d and green \u201cbetter choice\u201d. With the AMCS guide, \u201cfisheries don\u2019t have a choice per se as to whether they go under the ruler\u201d, Meder says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/skoda-australia-independent-thinkers-guide/2019/nov/14/eat-with-the-seasons-josh-nilands-guide-to-sustainable-seafood\">Eat with the seasons: Josh Niland\u2019s guide to sustainable seafood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some fish that are red \u2013 based on the AMCS guide \u2013 still receive a blue tick from the MSC. Webb says the guidebook approach, which is used by the global seafood ratings alliance, of which the AMCS is a member, \u201cmay inadvertently stigmatise entire species\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is a fishery has been looked at independently by a team of scientists and there\u2019s the traceability too, so when you see the blue fish tick it\u2019s a really easy choice,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Last year, however, the MSC faced criticism internationally, <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/press_releases/?325605/WWF-Statement-on-Marine-Stewardship-Council-Reforms\">including by one of its founding stakeholders</a>, the World Wildlife Fund.</p> <p>\u201cA certification scheme, because they work closely with industry and government, may have more access to more information,\u201d Meder says. The Marine Stewardship Council \u201ctend to deliver ... with a requirement to make a certain amount of progress \u2026 whereas we tend to look just at the environmental outcomes are being met right now\u201d.</p> <h2>Is no seafood at all the most sustainable choice?</h2> <p>Meder and Webb are both keen to emphasise it is possible to eat seafood sustainably. Meder says abstaining is \u201ca valid choice, but for someone like myself, I work in this field, I\u2019m passionate about marine conservation, and a big part of that connection with the ocean ... comes through fishing and eating seafood\u201d.</p> <p>Webb says: \u201cShould we stop eating fish? No, we don\u2019t believe so, because not only do jobs and communities depend on the fishing industry, but if we were to just stop eating fish right now then we\u2019re only going to move that protein demand on the land. In terms of animal protein, fish is a low carbon protein.\u201d This suggestion dovetails with research from the journal of Global Environmental Change, which suggests a \u201clow food-chain diet\u201d that includes forage fish and mollusks is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/29/what-would-a-climate-diet-look-like-in-australia\">second only to veganism</a> in terms of its low carbon footprint.</p> <h2>A prawn that ticks both boxes</h2> <p>When it comes to making a sustainable choice, using either the blue fish tick or the Sustainable Seafood Guide is certainly better than using neither. Both Webb and Meder say consumer demand has driven significant advances in the sustainability of fisheries over the past few decades.</p> <p>If you want to be really certain about your seafood, using both the blue fish tick \u2013 to guarantee supply chain traceability \u2013 and the AMCS guide at once is the best bet. For wild-caught Christmas prawns, that means buying from the Spencer Gulf of South Australia. That fishery has earned a blue fish tick and is the first wild-caught prawn fishery to earn a green rating in the Sustainable Fish Guide.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful that, come Christmas time, we can tell Australians about a wild prawn fishery that\u2019s made our green list,\u201d Meder says. \u201cIf you asked me that question 10 years ago, I would have struggled to recommend fisheries.\u201d <br></p>",

At present, 15% of the global wild-caught fish supply by value is certified by the MSC, while in Australia that figure rises to 38%. The certification process places a high standard on correct labelling and provenance, Webb says. \u201cOur traceability system almost eradicates that issue. We do DNA testing that shows in over 99% of cases, seafood with that blue fish tick is what it says it is.\u201d Meder agrees mislabelling is \u201ca really serious issue in Australia\u201d. He gives the example of fish-and-chip shop flake, which should be gummy shark but could just as easily be mako or even \u201can endangered hammerhead shark\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a great thing that the blue tick does: it provides a really high standard of traceability for a fish,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to buy a fish with a blue tick that isn\u2019t well accounted for.\u201d When enough is not enough While the Marine Stewardship Council and Australian Marine Conservation Society are aligned on issues of traceability, they take different approaches to their recommendations. The Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) tries to provide a rating system that covers the vast majority of local and imported fish available in Australia, via a website and app \u2013 the Sustainable Seafood Guide. Fish are ranked on a traffic-light system of red \u201csay no\u201d, amber \u201ceat less\u201d and green \u201cbetter choice\u201d. With the AMCS guide, \u201cfisheries don\u2019t have a choice per se as to whether they go under the ruler\u201d, Meder says. Some fish that are red \u2013 based on the AMCS guide \u2013 still receive a blue tick from the MSC. Webb says the guidebook approach, which is used by the global seafood ratings alliance, of which the AMCS is a member, \u201cmay inadvertently stigmatise entire species\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is a fishery has been looked at independently by a team of scientists and there\u2019s the traceability too, so when you see the blue fish tick it\u2019s a really easy choice,\u201d he says. Last year, however, the MSC faced criticism internationally, including by one of its founding stakeholders, the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cA certification scheme, because they work closely with industry and government, may have more access to more information,\u201d Meder says. The Marine Stewardship Council \u201ctend to deliver ... with a requirement to make a certain amount of progress \u2026 whereas we tend to look just at the environmental outcomes are being met right now\u201d. Is no seafood at all the most sustainable choice? Meder and Webb are both keen to emphasise it is possible to eat seafood sustainably. Meder says abstaining is \u201ca valid choice, but for someone like myself, I work in this field, I\u2019m passionate about marine conservation, and a big part of that connection with the ocean ... comes through fishing and eating seafood\u201d. Webb says: \u201cShould we stop eating fish? No, we don\u2019t believe so, because not only do jobs and communities depend on the fishing industry, but if we were to just stop eating fish right now then we\u2019re only going to move that protein demand on the land. In terms of animal protein, fish is a low carbon protein.\u201d This suggestion dovetails with research from the journal of Global Environmental Change, which suggests a \u201clow food-chain diet\u201d that includes forage fish and mollusks is second only to veganism in terms of its low carbon footprint. A prawn that ticks both boxes When it comes to making a sustainable choice, using either the blue fish tick or the Sustainable Seafood Guide is certainly better than using neither. Both Webb and Meder say consumer demand has driven significant advances in the sustainability of fisheries over the past few decades. If you want to be really certain about your seafood, using both the blue fish tick \u2013 to guarantee supply chain traceability \u2013 and the AMCS guide at once is the best bet. For wild-caught Christmas prawns, that means buying from the Spencer Gulf of South Australia. That fishery has earned a blue fish tick and is the first wild-caught prawn fishery to earn a green rating in the Sustainable Fish Guide. \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful that, come Christmas time, we can tell Australians about a wild prawn fishery that\u2019s made our green list,\u201d Meder says. \u201cIf you asked me that question 10 years ago, I would have struggled to recommend fisheries.\u201d",

Questioning the very concept of Islamophobia has become another weapon in the rightwing culture war. Just last week Melanie Phillips wrote a column for the Jewish Chronicle; the <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/comment/columnists/don-t-fall-for-bogus-claims-of-islamophobia-1.494367\" title=\"\">headline on the website</a>, complete with scare quotes: \u201cDon\u2019t fall for bogus claims of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019\u201d. This is a simple but effective deflection from the profoundly serious consequences of systematic discrimination.</p> <p>Since 2013, the number of reported hate crimes has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/15/hate-crimes-double-england-wales\" title=\"\">doubled</a> in the UK; around half of all incidents of religious hatred relate to Muslims. But Islamophobia is more than hate crimes or racist rhetoric. Structural racism means a closing down of opportunity. It means limited space in the public sphere. It means disenfranchisement and underemployment and unequal treatment. Certainly, there have been some breakthroughs in terms of British Muslims in political office and other areas of public life \u2013 Sadiq Khan as mayor of London, Sayeeda Warsi as Conservative party co-chair (a post she held from 2010-12). Yet this remains the exception rather than the rule.</p> <p>A 2017 report by the Social Mobility Commission <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/young-muslims-in-the-uk-face-enormous-social-mobility-barriers\" title=\"\">found that</a> Muslims living in the UK \u201care being held back from reaching their full potential at every stage of their lives\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/07/islamophobia-holding-back-uk-muslims-in-workplace-study-finds\" title=\"\">The research found that </a>young people from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds (the largest British Muslim communities) are more likely to succeed in education and go to university than some other groups, but that this does not translate into the labour market.</p> <p>Within the economically active population (16 to 74 years), only one in five of the Muslim population is in full-time work, compared with more than one in three for the overall population in England and Wales.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, I was reporting a story about Prevent, the government\u2019s counter-extremism programme. I interviewed various Muslims from around the UK who had interacted with the programme in one way or another. Many wanted to be anonymous. These were ordinary people, not activists, and for many it felt too risky to draw attention to themselves, even if they had not been accused of wrongdoing. \u201cWe\u2019re already seen as terrorists,\u201d one young woman told me. \u201cJust look at the way people talk about our community.\u201d I thought about that young woman as it was announced that Boris Johnson would replace a promised inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservatives with a more broad-brush review of how the party handles discrimination complaints. There is compelling evidence that the Conservative party has a specific problem with Islamophobia. During the election campaign, the party continued to back several candidates who had made Islamophobic statements; a dossier of social media comments found that 25 Tory councillors had posted racist material including descriptions of Muslims as \u201cbarbarian\u201d and \u201cthe enemy within\u201d. The prime minister himself has ridiculed burqa-wearing women as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d. A poll in June conducted by YouGov for the anti-racist organisation Hope Not Hate found that more than half of Conservative party members believe that Islam threatens \u201cthe British way of life\u201d. Beyond the diluted focus of the investigation, the choice of chair suggests something other than the \u201czero tolerance\u201d of anti-Muslim prejudice that Johnson has promised. Swaran Singh has previously written that \u201cthe racism charge\u201d forced politicians to \u201cact before they have had time to think\u201d. He has also contributed to Spiked, an online publication whose editor, Brendan O\u2019Neill, has dismissed Islamophobia as an \u201cinvented term\u201d designed to \u201cchill open discussion about aspects of Islam\u201d. Of course, Singh does not necessarily share O\u2019Neill\u2019s views, but it is worth noting that this is often the terrain on which discussion of Islamophobia takes place \u2013 as an issue primarily of semantics, about whether Islam is a religion or a race, a question of free speech and \u201clegitimate criticism\u201d of a religion or an \u201cideology\u201d. Questioning the very concept of Islamophobia has become another weapon in the rightwing culture war. Just last week Melanie Phillips wrote a column for the Jewish Chronicle; the headline on the website, complete with scare quotes: \u201cDon\u2019t fall for bogus claims of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019\u201d. This is a simple but effective deflection from the profoundly serious consequences of systematic discrimination. Since 2013, the number of reported hate crimes has doubled in the UK; around half of all incidents of religious hatred relate to Muslims. But Islamophobia is more than hate crimes or racist rhetoric. Structural racism means a closing down of opportunity. It means limited space in the public sphere. It means disenfranchisement and underemployment and unequal treatment. Certainly, there have been some breakthroughs in terms of British Muslims in political office and other areas of public life \u2013 Sadiq Khan as mayor of London, Sayeeda Warsi as Conservative party co-chair (a post she held from 2010-12). Yet this remains the exception rather than the rule. A 2017 report by the Social Mobility Commission found that Muslims living in the UK \u201care being held back from reaching their full potential at every stage of their lives\u201d. The research found that young people from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds (the largest British Muslim communities) are more likely to succeed in education and go to university than some other groups, but that this does not translate into the labour market. Within the economically active population (16 to 74 years), only one in five of the Muslim population is in full-time work, compared with more than one in three for the overall population in England and Wales. It also found that nearly half of the Muslim population \u2013 46%\u2013 live in the most deprived local authority districts. This socioeconomic and class disadvantage has serious implications for access to resources, attainment, and the availability of jobs. Coupled with more direct racial discrimination \u2013 such as stereotyping by teachers and employers, and the fact that people with names that sound \u201cforeign\u201d are less likely to get job interviews \u2013 this is a toxic mix. I have reported on numerous stories that involve British Muslims. I have consistently noticed that political rhetoric has an impact on people\u2019s perception of their own ability to participate in the public sphere. The disastrous mishandling of Birmingham\u2019s \u201cTrojan horse\u201d affair \u2013 in which schools in primarily Muslim areas were accused of fomenting extremism \u2013 led to many parents and other local people retreating from governing bodies. This went far beyond the handful of individuals accused of wrongdoing. Several people I interviewed, not just in Birmingham but elsewhere in the country, cited the incident as a reason not to get involved in local politics or services at all. \u201cWhatever we do we are referred to as a national security threat, so why bother?\u201d one Muslim parent told me. From these conversations, the impact of a media and political culture that routinely demonises Muslims is clear: people step back, they don\u2019t get involved, they keep their heads down. The end result is that they do not have equal access to public debate and political participation. This is not to say that there are no Muslim individuals or organisations speaking up for their communities, but for many people, it is easier to absorb the message society is sending you and withdraw.

And to see the assassin repeatedly beaten up and cornered by bad men, even though she is one of the bad men herself, grew tiresome and a little sadistic. It had a lot to live up to after its debut, sure, but the absence of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing this time was certainly felt. <strong>RN</strong></p> <h2>Game of Thrones</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d85739e0f4e62ff4eab5064ade28ad9883b7a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d85739e0f4e62ff4eab5064ade28ad9883b7a34/67_0_1967_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game of Thrones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The be-horned bad guy ...

      "bodyText": "Line of Duty Buoyed by the success of his disbelief-stretching smash Bodyguard, Jed Mercurio\u2019s cop drama began its fifth series, and Line of Duty fever swept the country. Bookies took bets on the identity of H, and the show finally got the respect it deserved after years of providing gasp-inducing twists. The addition of Stephen Graham as a mysterious gangster with a connection to Adrian Dunbar\u2019s Supt Hastings only bolstered the show\u2019s reputation for quality guest stars (see also: Keeley Hawes, Thandie Newton). Then, just as it finally had the attention of the nation, Line of Duty went dramatically, catastrophically off-piste. Much of the conspiracy Mercurio had slowly built, shading in its edges with doubt, and seemingly implicating Hastings, was revealed to be little more than a red herring, because H was in fact (drum roll) four separate people. Yes, the one dastardly person was in fact four dastardly people, dividing the menace considerably. Sure, we didn\u2019t think it would be Hastings \u2013 lovely, principled, late-life-crisis-plagued Hastings \u2013 but we needed something, anything other than villainous morse code. Yes, morse code \u2013 morse code! \u2013 was the baddie. Time for a lie-down, Jed? HJD Killing Eve It wasn\u2019t that Killing Eve was bad this year; I still looked forward to every second of Jodie Comer being lethal in couture. But as the second season progressed, some of what had been fun the first time around was lost in translation, and some of the pitfalls it had avoided in season one became gaping sinkholes.

      "body": "<p>Fossil hunters say they have unearthed the earliest evidence yet of four-limbed vertebrates looking after their young, after discovering the entwined remains of two lizard-like creatures preserved in an ancient plant stump.</p> <p>The fossil found in Nova Scotia, Canada, is thought to be the remains of an adult and young of a newly identified species of varanopid.</p> <p>\u201c[The adult] probably would have been about 20cm in length from the tip of the snout to the base of its tail, and it would have had a long tail,\u201d said Hillary Maddin, a co-author of the research and an assistant professor at Carleton University in Canada. </p> <p>The smaller individual was found beneath the upper leg bone of the larger one, and was encircled by the larger creatures\u2019s tail \u2013 an entwinement that the team say suggests the two animals were curled up together in a den.</p> <p>The den appears to have been made in a hollowed-out stump of a plant known as a lycopsid. \u201cThese very fragile fossils, especially the baby, are preserved in a very natural-like position and would have to have been buried very quickly,\u201d said Maddin, adding that the stump was probably inundated with sediment, possibly in a storm.</p> <p>The animals are thought to have lived just over 300m years ago, pushing back the record for evidence of extended parental care among four-limbed vertebrates by about 40m years.</p> <p>Parental care is any behaviour that aids the survival of offspring, such as guarding eggs or nest-building. Extended parental care is any support for young after birth or hatching, for example providing food or protection.</p> <p>Experts say prolonged care is seen across a wide range of animals, from reptiles to birds, and is particularly common to mammals as they produce milk for their young. Such behaviour can help offspring to survive but comes at a cost to parents, who must invest time, energy and resources.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1030-z\">Nature Ecology and Evolution</a>, the team report that the new species has been named <em>Dendromaia unamakiensis</em>, derived from the ancient Greek words for tree and mother and the Mi\u2019kmaq\u2019 indigenous people\u2019s name for Cape Breton Island, where the fossil was found.</p> <p>The find was made by Brian Hebert, a fossil enthusiast who runs a gift shop and tours in the fossil-rich Joggins area of Nova Scotia and is part of Maddin\u2019s field team.</p> <p>There is a debate over whether varanopids are part of a group of animals that eventually gave rise to mammals, or whether they a sit on a different evolutionary branch leading to reptiles.</p> <p>If the former, traditional view is correct, Maddin said the new fossil suggests parental care of young cropped up early on the path that led to mammals. That such behaviour is also seen in birds and some reptiles, she said, was probably down to it evolving independently in these groups.</p> <p>Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, said the fossil find was exciting. </p> <p>\u201cThe discovery of an adult and a much smaller juvenile side by side is good evidence that they were interacting with each other in life, as it would be quite the coincidence for them to randomly die, get buried and fossilise together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although it\u2019s always tricky to infer behaviour from fossils that are hundreds of millions of years old, to me this seems to be good evidence that there was parental care going on.\u201d</p> <p>He said this was significant because it suggested such behaviour is an ancient trait. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think that something we consider so human \u2013 parents taking care of children \u2013 was developed so long ago, in such distant ancestors, when the world was so much different.\u201d </p>",

The fossil found in Nova Scotia, Canada, is thought to be the remains of an adult and young of a newly identified species of varanopid. \u201c[The adult] probably would have been about 20cm in length from the tip of the snout to the base of its tail, and it would have had a long tail,\u201d said Hillary Maddin, a co-author of the research and an assistant professor at Carleton University in Canada. The smaller individual was found beneath the upper leg bone of the larger one, and was encircled by the larger creatures\u2019s tail \u2013 an entwinement that the team say suggests the two animals were curled up together in a den. The den appears to have been made in a hollowed-out stump of a plant known as a lycopsid. \u201cThese very fragile fossils, especially the baby, are preserved in a very natural-like position and would have to have been buried very quickly,\u201d said Maddin, adding that the stump was probably inundated with sediment, possibly in a storm. The animals are thought to have lived just over 300m years ago, pushing back the record for evidence of extended parental care among four-limbed vertebrates by about 40m years. Parental care is any behaviour that aids the survival of offspring, such as guarding eggs or nest-building. Extended parental care is any support for young after birth or hatching, for example providing food or protection. Experts say prolonged care is seen across a wide range of animals, from reptiles to birds, and is particularly common to mammals as they produce milk for their young. Such behaviour can help offspring to survive but comes at a cost to parents, who must invest time, energy and resources. Writing in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, the team report that the new species has been named Dendromaia unamakiensis, derived from the ancient Greek words for tree and mother and the Mi\u2019kmaq\u2019 indigenous people\u2019s name for Cape Breton Island, where the fossil was found. The find was made by Brian Hebert, a fossil enthusiast who runs a gift shop and tours in the fossil-rich Joggins area of Nova Scotia and is part of Maddin\u2019s field team. There is a debate over whether varanopids are part of a group of animals that eventually gave rise to mammals, or whether they a sit on a different evolutionary branch leading to reptiles. If the former, traditional view is correct, Maddin said the new fossil suggests parental care of young cropped up early on the path that led to mammals. That such behaviour is also seen in birds and some reptiles, she said, was probably down to it evolving independently in these groups. Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, said the fossil find was exciting. \u201cThe discovery of an adult and a much smaller juvenile side by side is good evidence that they were interacting with each other in life, as it would be quite the coincidence for them to randomly die, get buried and fossilise together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although it\u2019s always tricky to infer behaviour from fossils that are hundreds of millions of years old, to me this seems to be good evidence that there was parental care going on.\u201d He said this was significant because it suggested such behaviour is an ancient trait. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think that something we consider so human \u2013 parents taking care of children \u2013 was developed so long ago, in such distant ancestors, when the world was so much different.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A man has been accused of attacking 16 cats, nine of which were killed, over the space of eight months in Brighton. Sussex police charged Steven Bouquet, 52, a security guard, with 16 counts of criminal damage relating to the wounding or killing of 16 cats between between 2 October 2018 and 1 June 2019. The charges are part of Operation Diverge, the force\u2019s investigation into a number of cat deaths in the city of Brighton and Hove. Bouquet, who was also charged with possessing a knife in a public place, is due to appear at Brighton magistrates court on 23 January. The South East district crown prosecutor, Sally Lakin, said: \u201cFollowing a spate of attacks on cats in the Brighton area, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has authorised Sussex police to charge Steven Bouquet with 16 charges of criminal damage, relating to attacks on 16 cats, nine of which were killed and seven were seriously injured. \u201cThe allegations relate to incidents which took place between 2 October 2018 and 1 June 2019. This is a complex case and this decision was made following a careful review of all of the evidence presented to us.\u201d The CPS said it had carefully considered which charges would be most appropriate in the case and concluded the defendant should be charged with criminal damage. \u201cThis does not in any way detract from the seriousness of the offence or the great distress these incidents will have caused the owners of the cats,\u201d the CPS said. \u201cHowever, under current legislation, cats and other animals are deemed as property.\u201d The charge of animal cruelty was thought inappropriate as the defendant was not the owner of the cats. It would also attract a lesser sentence than criminal damage.",

His painting on cardboard of a house covered in breasts with the message \u201ca house with boobs for roof tiles\u201d scrawled underneath is immediate and accessible. \u201cMy thinking is influenced a lot by how fast images [come and go] when scrolling through Instagram,\u201d he explains. \u201cNormally, when you see something, you want to instantly laugh or understand.

So there\u2019s an element in my work where you look at something and you\u2019re like, \u2018I get it, it\u2019s funny\u2019 \u2013 and then afterwards it can play on your mind.\u201d</p> <p>Working across painting, drawing, photography, installation and video, Clark\u2019s most recent output has focused on paintings that match colourful cartoons with snappy phrases: a dead doctor lays murdered at the feet of a man in a \u201cpro-life\u201d jumper, homeless people huddle behind a suited aristocrat proclaiming \u201cbalderdash, <del>I\u2019m</del> we\u2019re doing great\u201d, and a KKK member in pink robes holds up a red sock to the words \u201cwhite wash\u201d. It is political painting without the preaching. Clark\u2019s of-the-moment sketches stem from the fact that his creative process is driven by \u201cwhatever is around\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am always carrying a sketchbook and a camera,\u201d he adds. And his studio is plastered in his findings: scribbled ideas include \u201cJeff Bezos escaping burning Earth on a rocket\u201d and \u201cEarth sold to alien race by greedy politicians\u201d.</p> <p>Surrounded by notes about the apocalypse, the deception of social media and the corruption of the rich, I start to feel a bit unsettled. Is he hopeful about the future? His serious face suddenly lights up. \u201cYes. It is easy to be hopeful when you see Greta Thunberg. It is different to when I was a kid. When I got interested in politics, it was about listening to Rage Against the Machine, whereas nowadays children organise protests.\u201d As Thunberg continues to hold governments to account and Hitler disappears into a pool of gunge, I cross my fingers and pray that by the time the predictions in Clark\u2019s studio become fully fledged paintings, we still find them closer to tongue-in-cheek comedy than everyday life.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bloomberg New Contemporaries is at <a href=\"https://newcontemporaries.org.uk/exhibitions-and-events/exhibitions/bnc19-south-london-gallery\">South London Gallery</a>, 6 December to 23 February.</p></li> </ul>",

His painting on cardboard of a house covered in breasts with the message \u201ca house with boobs for roof tiles\u201d scrawled underneath is immediate and accessible. \u201cMy thinking is influenced a lot by how fast images [come and go] when scrolling through Instagram,\u201d he explains. \u201cNormally, when you see something, you want to instantly laugh or understand. You don\u2019t want to have to scroll through four or five images to work out the joke. So there\u2019s an element in my work where you look at something and you\u2019re like, \u2018I get it, it\u2019s funny\u2019 \u2013 and then afterwards it can play on your mind.\u201d Working across painting, drawing, photography, installation and video, Clark\u2019s most recent output has focused on paintings that match colourful cartoons with snappy phrases: a dead doctor lays murdered at the feet of a man in a \u201cpro-life\u201d jumper, homeless people huddle behind a suited aristocrat proclaiming \u201cbalderdash, I\u2019m we\u2019re doing great\u201d, and a KKK member in pink robes holds up a red sock to the words \u201cwhite wash\u201d. It is political painting without the preaching. Clark\u2019s of-the-moment sketches stem from the fact that his creative process is driven by \u201cwhatever is around\u201d. \u201cI am always carrying a sketchbook and a camera,\u201d he adds. And his studio is plastered in his findings: scribbled ideas include \u201cJeff Bezos escaping burning Earth on a rocket\u201d and \u201cEarth sold to alien race by greedy politicians\u201d. Surrounded by notes about the apocalypse, the deception of social media and the corruption of the rich, I start to feel a bit unsettled. Is he hopeful about the future? His serious face suddenly lights up. \u201cYes. It is easy to be hopeful when you see Greta Thunberg. It is different to when I was a kid. When I got interested in politics, it was about listening to Rage Against the Machine, whereas nowadays children organise protests.\u201d As Thunberg continues to hold governments to account and Hitler disappears into a pool of gunge, I cross my fingers and pray that by the time the predictions in Clark\u2019s studio become fully fledged paintings, we still find them closer to tongue-in-cheek comedy than everyday life.

Actually, memoir is not the right word: it\u2019s her jottings and diary entries at the time, published many years later, so the pain is raw and unfiltered.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very short book, but not an easy read. I found it particularly hard as I\u2019m going through this with my father at the moment. Even so, I was surprised by how much the feelings she articulates resonated with me. She captures the pain of seeing someone you love and have known as a strong, capable parent reduced to helplessness and dependance: \u201cYet the woman who stands before me today is the same one I knew in the past.

For example, when the protagonist is drinking a champagne cocktail, he \u201cwatched thousands of industrious gold and silver bubbles scramble up the tunnel of his glass\u201d. The occasional black and white photographs give the novel a similar texture to WG Sebald\u2019s work, though I was also reminded of Wallace Stegner, especially his novel The Spectator Bird. A retired engineering professor, tormented by regrets, shuts himself away from the world in his home. Meanwhile, his adopted daughter, an Indigenous Australian woman from the Stolen Generation, studies extinct creatures, for whom she feels a certain kinship. I would encourage fans of Sebald or Stegner to scope it out and see if it tempts them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Transcription by Kate Atkinson has entertained <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16300334\">Maggie B</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s described as \u201cA spy novel that dismantles the whole genre\u201d \u2013 not really, but it was very entertaining and meticulously researched.There was a surprise ending which I really didn\u2019t see coming and it has a very useful bibliography.

I was impressed, and moved, by her ability to write about gay men and our expressions of queer masculinity (underlining that we gay men don\u2019t own these themes as our sole territory, and that we should welcome anyone using our experiences positively in literature) and love in the book. I then found her Alabaster Egg and my admiration for her talent deepened, the way she moved between periods (Ludwig\u2019s Bavaria, Nazi Germany, and a present) and stories and, perhaps more than anything, her beautiful use of English makes her a wonderful writer. If you haven\u2019t read her, I recommend seeking her out.

The best description I can attempt is that it reads like a philosophical whodunit; which takes in animal rights and welfare, provincial politics, the role of authority in society, the role of community and how we live and relate to each other. It has a very likeable central character in Janina; a retired engineer and eccentric older lady given to serious contemplation of the animal and human worlds. It is by turns funny and deadly serious and is one of my favourite reads of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101510359\">CCCubbon</a> has just finished The Invisible Library by Genevieve Cogman:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not a long book but one which tumbles from one fantasy situation to another, from Fae folk to dragons to articulated alligators, library books to alternative worlds. This is the introductory novel and I would hope the next calmed down a little, less frantic, more developed. A little light relief and fun that needed only a modicum of concentration.</p> </blockquote> <p>Might be just the thing to read over the holiday.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.co.uk/collectables/most-expensive-sales/2019/index.shtml?cm_mmc=nl-_-nl-_-U191217-MXP-mosexpAWTRADE-_-b2cta&amp;abersp=1\">most expensive sales of the year on Abebooks</a>.

CCCubbon has just finished The Invisible Library by Genevieve Cogman: It\u2019s not a long book but one which tumbles from one fantasy situation to another, from Fae folk to dragons to articulated alligators, library books to alternative worlds. This is the introductory novel and I would hope the next calmed down a little, less frantic, more developed. A little light relief and fun that needed only a modicum of concentration. Might be just the thing to read over the holiday. Interesting links about books and reading The most expensive sales of the year on Abebooks. (Who came top? Honest Abe\u2026) I am delighted to tell you that there is a book called A Christmas With Carol: An Erotic Scrooge Variation. Lithub\u2019s pick of the most scathing reviews of 2019. The story of the review that made Jack Kerouac famous. And here is that review: \u201cOn the Road is a major novel.\u201d A beautiful book about the Earth at night from NASA. (This tip comes courtesy of Ron Charles\u2019 excellent Washington Post book club newsletter.)

Two days later the Saudis say any claims of culpability on the part of Prince Mohammed are false. 3 January 2019 The Saudi trial opens with the attorney general demanding the death penalty for five of the charged men. 19 June 2019 Agn\u00e8s Callamard, a UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings who led an investigatory team to Istanbul, issues a report saying Prince Mohammed should be investigated. The death \u201cconstituted an extrajudicial killing for which the State of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible\u201d, she said. Riyadh says the report\u2019s findings are \u201cunfounded\u201d. 10 September 2019 A transcript of audio recorded during the murder is released by Turkish media. According to the transcript, a member of the Saudi hit squad tells Khashoggi that he has to be taken back to Riyadh because of an Interpol order against him. The journalist objects, saying there is no legal case against him and that his fiancee is waiting for him outside. In his final words, Khashoggi urged his killers not to cover his mouth because he had asthma and could suffocate, Sabah newspaper reports. 30 September 2019 Prince Mohammed denies ordering the killing in an interview with US media but says he ultimately bears \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for what happened because he is one of the country\u2019s leaders. 23 December 2019 Eight of the 11 people on trial in Saudi Arabia are found guilty of the killing. Five are sentenced to death. The verdict says the Saudi investigation concluded that the killing was not premeditated and that Qahtani was cleared of any wrongdoing.",

The manager added that fellow stopper David Martin, who suffered a similar hip injury against Southampton earlier this month, is also in line to return over the festive period. He also admitted that the beleaguered Roberto \u201cdidn\u2019t have good performances\u201d when deputising for Fabianski, but offered the Spaniard a lukewarm vote of confidence as he remains on standby for a return to the side.</p> <p>Fabianski tore his hip muscle while taking a goal-kick during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/bournemouth-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 22 September</a>, and was replaced by Roberto, whose gaffe-prone run in the side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/05/west-ham-sell-roberto-sign-new-goalkeeper-husillos-leave\">could see him sold in the January transfer window</a>. The 33-year-old\u2019s form was so alarming that pressure has been heaped on Mario Husillos, the Argentinian director of football responsible for bringing him to the club last summer. He was subsequently replaced in the side by Martin but may find himself back in action if neither of his rivals for the position are passed fit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/23/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After West Ham\u2019s Premier League match against Liverpool was postponed due to the European champions\u2019 participation in the Club World Cup in Qatar, Pellegrini\u2019s side have had 12 days between games. However they now have a run of three in seven days, with the Palace match followed by the visit of Leicester on Saturday and Bournemouth on New Year\u2019s Day.</p> <p>Speaking on Monday, the manager said he would assess both keepers\u2019 fitness before the fixture at Selhurst Park: \u201cBoth of them are recovering, we will see in the next days who is able to play. I don\u2019t think either will be able to play both games in 48 hours, so we\u2019ll see in the next couple of days who will be playing at Crystal Palace. Fabianski is working every day a little bit harder. If he is not ready for the 26th [Palace], then maybe the 28th [Leicester] or the 1st [Bournemouth].\u201d</p> <p>Pellegrini added: \u201cRoberto didn\u2019t have good performances when he played but I always say he has a career behind him, a lot of experience.

      "bodyText": "Goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski is nearing full fitness and could be in contention for West Ham\u2019s Boxing Day match against Crystal Palace, Manuel Pellegrini said. The manager added that fellow stopper David Martin, who suffered a similar hip injury against Southampton earlier this month, is also in line to return over the festive period. He also admitted that the beleaguered Roberto \u201cdidn\u2019t have good performances\u201d when deputising for Fabianski, but offered the Spaniard a lukewarm vote of confidence as he remains on standby for a return to the side. Fabianski tore his hip muscle while taking a goal-kick during the 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 22 September, and was replaced by Roberto, whose gaffe-prone run in the side could see him sold in the January transfer window. The 33-year-old\u2019s form was so alarming that pressure has been heaped on Mario Husillos, the Argentinian director of football responsible for bringing him to the club last summer. He was subsequently replaced in the side by Martin but may find himself back in action if neither of his rivals for the position are passed fit. After West Ham\u2019s Premier League match against Liverpool was postponed due to the European champions\u2019 participation in the Club World Cup in Qatar, Pellegrini\u2019s side have had 12 days between games. However they now have a run of three in seven days, with the Palace match followed by the visit of Leicester on Saturday and Bournemouth on New Year\u2019s Day. Speaking on Monday, the manager said he would assess both keepers\u2019 fitness before the fixture at Selhurst Park: \u201cBoth of them are recovering, we will see in the next days who is able to play. I don\u2019t think either will be able to play both games in 48 hours, so we\u2019ll see in the next couple of days who will be playing at Crystal Palace. Fabianski is working every day a little bit harder. If he is not ready for the 26th [Palace], then maybe the 28th [Leicester] or the 1st [Bournemouth].\u201d Pellegrini added: \u201cRoberto didn\u2019t have good performances when he played but I always say he has a career behind him, a lot of experience. Maybe he was a bit unlucky but I continue to trust in him. If he has to play he will do it in the way we know he can do.\u201d The club has also been boosted by positive updates on midfielders Manuel Lanzini, who has been sidelined since November with a collarbone fracture, and Felipe Anderson. Pellegrini said: \u201cLanzini has worked without any problems for around 10 days. It\u2019s maybe more easy to return after a shoulder injury. Felipe has worked a complete week without problems after his illness. Jack Wilshere has had some problems with his groin so he hasn\u2019t worked with the squad.\u201d",

But this adaptation succeeds by hitting many of the themes of the graphic novel while reproducing almost nothing of its plot \u2013 unlike Zack Snyder\u2019s straightforward 2009 film, which slavishly reproduced the plot and misunderstood all the themes.

By comparison, Lindelof\u2019s world is muted, its emotional arcs elliptical, its careful and complex set-dressing deceptively drab.

Of course. Lots of people get screwed, but we still have Spider-Man and lots of other heroes.\u201d</p> <p>Straczynski was correct about the industry\u2019s cruelty. In 1938, Jerry Seigel and Joe Shuster were paid $130 (about $2,300 today) for the rights to Superman. They later tried to sue DC for more money, and were simply fired.

His Watchmen, like the prequels and sequels commissioned by DC, contains true heroism, a moving call to individual action and a happy ending (give or take), thanks to the heroes who catch the bad guys at the end. By contrast, the book\u2019s hapless costumed characters either fail to stop disaster or have a personal hand in bringing it about. If they learn a lesson, it\u2019s that the only worthwhile pursuit is not justice but the anodyne, laborious pleasure of love and companionship. Lindelof\u2019s show has a firm morality, but it is a morality consistent with the values of a corporate behemoth that is invested in selling Watchmen toasters.</p> <p>HBO\u2019s Watchmen, like all prestige television today, flatters the audience. It asks us to imagine a better world and then congratulates us for doing so. But it also addresses the primary problem of American moral ideals, which is the bone-deep conviction of our own innocence, and the commitment to preserving that innocence by ignoring the constant presence of white supremacy. That any show will do that work is valuable. But because anything derived from the Watchmen comic is serving the aim of DC Entertainment to profit from work created by a writer who strenuously objects to its exploitation, the decision to watch the show remains a moral question all fans will have to wrestle with when<a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/watchmen-season-2-damon-lindelof-finale-1203441149/\"> a second season is, inevitably, announced</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rhetorical questions her flyers asked were: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to run away with the circus? Who doesn\u2019t dream of travelling in a velvet-lined circus wagon, under the stars, circus music accompanying a life of freedom, family and art?\u201d Nell Gifford, the owner and ringmistress of Giffords Circus, who has died of cancer aged 46, lived that big-top dream. The Oxford-educated girl from a bohemian family ran away to the circus, not to join it but to found, with her then husband, Toti Gifford, her own; a retro-chic troupe based on Gifford\u2019s idea of a traditional travelling show, which did not exploit wild animals. \u201cOur vision was a miniature village green circus, bursting at the seams \u2026 a little band of performers who live nomadically \u2026 engrossed in the serious business of making magic,\u201d she said. Regular acts included Tweedy the clown, magicians, a tumbling troupe from Cuba and gymnasts, but Gifford was open to ideas. \u201cYou would come up with this mad idea and Nell would say, \u2018Right, let\u2019s do it,\u2019\u201d the theatre director Cal McCrystal, who directs the shows, said. Other acts have included shire horses, ponies and various birds \u2013 doves, a turkey and chickens. There would be a theme for each season\u2019s show, often harking back to a particular period. Last year the spectacular was My Beautiful Circus, a celebration of its heyday in the 1930s with all the feathers, glamour and sparkle of the era. This year\u2019s was Xanadu, an interpretation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s poem Kubla Khan, which harked back to the flower power days of the 70s. \u201cWhen I was young, my mother often used to say, \u2018Nell, you are SUCH a drama queen.\u2019 And it\u2019s true. Everything I do seems to be a massive drama,\u201d Gifford said in an interview with the Observer last year. \u201cI\u2019ve had cancer not once but twice. I didn\u2019t have one baby, I had twins. And I started my own circus. My mother was right. It\u2019s all so dramatic and full-on.\u201d She was born Eleanor Stroud in Oxford. Her father, Rick Stroud, was a television director. Her mother, Charlotte (nee Pumphrey), was the pillar of family life for Nell, her sister, Clover, and their three older half-siblings from Charlotte\u2019s first marriage, Tom, Sophy and Emma Bridgewater, the last of whom founded the eponymous pottery brand.

He had been galvanised by the South African government\u2019s refusal to allow the England team to tour in 1968 \u2013 because they called up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/20/basil-doliveira-inequality-south-africa\" title=\"\">Basil D\u2019Oliveira</a> as a replacement. D\u2019Oliveira had been born in Cape Town and classified as a \u201cColoured\u201d who could not play cricket in white areas. He left South Africa and forged a new life as a cricketer in England.</p> <p>\u201cHaving been barred from South Africa because they included a \u2018non-white\u2019 player in D\u2019Oliveira the English cricket authorities issued an invitation to the South Africans three months later to tour in the summer of 1970. I was outraged and issued a statement saying we\u2019ll stop this tour by direct action.</p> <p>\u201cThen we realised the rugby tour was happening and decided to use it as a dummy run. From the opening match, which was switched from Oxford to Twickenham at the last minute in an attempt to defend the ground against demonstrations, we made huge news. That continued through the 25-match tour from Manchester, Leicester, Edinburgh, Swansea, Dublin, wherever the Springboks were due to play. We mobilised local anti-apartheid groups which gave it an enormous power.\u201d</p> <p>The Springboks did not win any of their four Tests and they returned to South Africa in humiliation and disgrace. Hain kept up the pressure and early in 1970 the British government persuaded the cricket authorities to cancel South Africa\u2019s cricket tour. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of that campaign,\u201d Hain says. \u201cUnlike most progressive campaigns for justice it achieved its objectives 100%.\u201d</p> <p>Hain and the South African cricket historian, Andre Odendaal, have written a book about that campaign called <a href=\"https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781786615220/Pitch-Battles-Protest-Play-and-Prejudice\" title=\"\">Pitch Battles: Protest, Play and Prejudice</a> which will be published next May. The resonance of his work against apartheid is felt even more acutely this week as the first Test of England\u2019s cricket tour of South Africa begins on Boxing Day. And memories of the Springboks winning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/02/we-have-beaten-our-colonisers-springbok-rugby-fans-celebrate\" title=\"\">Rugby World Cup</a> are still so vivid. How did that victory make Hain feel \u2013 exactly 50 years on from his 1969 campaign?</p> <p>\u201cIt was sheer ecstasy and exhilaration because we\u2019d disrupted that whites-only team and ensured it was the last one to tour on a racist basis. So to have a genuinely multi-racial 2019 Springbok team with a black captain, and both tries scored by [Makazole] Mapimpi and [Cheslin] Kolbe, world-class black players, was what we were fighting for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I continued the same struggle, for the same values, in different settings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t say that it healed the nation but it was much more significant than 1995 \u2013 when Mandela wore the Springbok jersey.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI was a source of great hatred,\u201d Peter Hain says with a wry smile as he remembers how, 50 years ago this month, he led passionate anti-apartheid protests against the Springbok rugby tour of Britain and Ireland. \u201cI was seen as a traitor by South Africa\u2019s white volk [people] and the newspapers described me as public enemy No 1. They felt I\u2019d completely betrayed them and, because this meant white supremacy and apartheid, I was proud to do so.\u201d Hain, the former Labour cabinet minister who sits in the House of Lords, looks out of his Millbank office on a cold but sunlit December morning. The Houses of Parliament are just across the road and here, in the heart of the British political establishment, his white South African accent remains clear as he reflects on demonstrations that dented apartheid. Hain was 19 in 1969 when he confronted white South Africans in the sporting arena to highlight the brutal injustice of apartheid. He became a despised figure in his home country and among conservative British society. \u201cIt was startling but I soon realised it came with the territory,\u201d Hain says. \u201cThere was no social media in 1969, so it came in different forms of a vicious kind. It started with letters written in green ink and led to direct threats to kill me.\u201d A new BT Sport film called Stop the Tour, a powerful documentary by the director Louis Myles, captures the impact of the protests. It also explains how Hain\u2019s motivation was to block the South Africa cricket tour of England in 1970 \u2013 and how the touring Springbok rugby team became a dress rehearsal of vehement anti-apartheid protests from early November 1969 to late January 1970. I was an eight-year-old boy living near Johannesburg when that tour ended and it was the first time I realised the outside world hated South Africa. Our white suburban lives were shaped by racism and privilege and it needed the sports protests and eventual boycotts to force boys like me to wonder what was wrong with our country. Hain was a bogeyman in white South Africa and so, 50 years on, with our shared background and enduring love of sport, it feels evocative we should meet a month after the Springboks won the 2019 Rugby World Cup with a black captain, an Afrikaans coach and a truly mixed team picked on merit. The 1969 protests marked a seminal moment in the rise of the anti-apartheid movement in Britain. It needed another 25 years for Nelson Mandela, who was a friend of Hain\u2019s parents, to become South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected president.

      "bodyText": "Five men have been sentenced to death and another three face a total of 24 years in prison for their roles in the gruesome murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year, the Saudi public prosecutor\u2019s office has said. Eight of the 11 people on trial were found guilty of the killing, which triggered the kingdom\u2019s biggest diplomatic crisis since the 9/11 attacks as world leaders and business executives sought to distance themselves from Riyadh. However, the investigation concluded \u201cthe killing was not premeditated \u2026 the decision was taken at the spur of the moment,\u201d the deputy public prosecutor and spokesperson Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said, reading the verdict in the Saudi capital on Monday. Three senior figures, including the de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s former top adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, were cleared of wrongdoing during the trial. The verdict contradicts the conclusion of the CIA and other western intelligence agencies that Prince Mohammed directly ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination, an allegation the kingdom has strenuously denied. Qahtani was found to have no proven involvement in the killing, after he was investigated and released without charge. He has, however, been sanctioned by the US for his alleged role in the operation. Khashoggi, a US-based columnist for the Washington Post who was critical of the Saudi government, was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October last year on a visit to pick up paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. The 59-year-old\u2019s body has not been found and is thought by Turkish investigators to have been dissolved in acid. The interrogation team had orders to repatriate Khashoggi from Turkey, Shalaan said, but decided it would be impossible to transfer the journalist from the consulate to continue negotiating elsewhere. \u201cIt was agreed, in consultation between the head of the negotiating team and the culprits, to kill Jamal Khashoggi inside the consulate,\u201d Shalaan said in response to questions from journalists. The court ruled that the Saudi consul-general in Istanbul at the time, Mohammed al-Otaibi, was not guilty. He was released from prison after the verdicts were announced. Otaibi has also been sanctioned by the US due to his \u201cinvolvement in gross violations of human rights\u201d and his family is under a travel ban. The former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri, who Shalaan said had ordered Khashoggi\u2019s repatriation from Turkey, was tried but released due to insufficient evidence. The murder of Khashoggi sullied the reputation of the newly appointed crown prince, who has attempted to portray himself as a liberal reformer of the conservative country and is popular at home. The Saudi government denies the prince had knowledge of what it says was a rogue operation. The prince himself told US television in September that he took \u201cfull responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia\u201d. In the investigation into the murder, 21 people were arrested and 10 called in for questioning without arrest, according to Shalaan. All the defendants may appeal against the preliminary verdicts. No other details were immediately given about the rulings in the highly secretive trial, which was conducted over nine sessions, beginning in January. The identities of the convicted men have not been officially confirmed and UN investigators have been repeatedly barred from hearings, although a handful of diplomats, including from Turkey, as well as members of Khashoggi\u2019s family, were allowed to attend the sessions. Ankara has repeatedly sought the extradition for trial in Turkey of 18 Saudi suspects, including a 15-man hit team it says flew into Istanbul hours before the killing. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, a UN special rapporteur who authored an inquiry into Khashoggi\u2019s death, said in a tweet on Monday that the trial\u2019s conclusion was a \u201cmockery\u201d and the \u201cantithesis\u201d of justice. She has previously said the search for justice must not be left to the Saudi judicial system, which she said was \u201cso vulnerable to political interference\u201d. Dozens of high-profile critics of Prince Mohammed, including women\u2019s rights campaigners, are in prison facing trial for treason. The verdict was also met with criticism in Turkey. Yasin Aktay, a member of Turkey\u2019s ruling party and a friend of Khashoggi, said the Saudi court had failed to bring the real perpetrators to justice. \u201cThe prosecutor sentenced five hitmen to death but did not touch those who were behind the five,\u201d Aktay told the Associated Press. \u201cThese are people who cannot even use the bathroom without the permission of their superiors.

      "body": "<p>Only someone with a heart as cold as an abandoned Christmas tree would dare to suggest that Strictly Come Dancing isn\u2019t what it used to be. Any attempt at criticising the doyenne of shiny-floored Saturday night TV is to lay yourself wide open for a pelting with heavy glitterballs. But after 17 seasons, the sequins are starting to drop off the ratings behemoth.</p> <p>When Strictly first cha-cha-cha-ed on to Saturday night TV in 2004, bouffanted newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky unleashed those legs from behind the desk and she and Brendan Cole waltzed away with the glitterball trophy. The lineup was plundered from all corners of the BBC, with Bargain Hunt\u2019s David Dickinson toning down his mahogany tan to play the joker.</p> <p>Strictly has always been about much more than the dancing. There is the glory of the underdog, whether that\u2019s a lumbering John Sergeant dragging Kristina Rihanoff across the floor or Ed \u201cGangnam Style\u201d Balls and his disturbing gyrations. Viewers can smell an ambitious contestant a mile away and send them packing before Blackpool, even if they can dance (see: James Cracknell, Kirsty Gallacher). Its glory years saw showmances, big personalities (hello Nancy Dell\u2019Olio) and great journeys (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/10/debbie-mcgee-paul-daniels-cant-face-doing-magic\">Debbie McGee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/15/louise-redknapp-need-to-stand-up-and-be-strong-jamie-9-to-5\">Louise Redknapp rediscovering their inner foxes</a>). Even the Strictly curse, where spending hours crotch-to-crotch with a stranger in a bodystocking and some sequins causes chaos in the contestants\u2019 relationships, became a reason to watch. But this year\u2019s breed have as much chance of being caught doing a Seann Walsh as Anneka Rice had of winning.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqMSc4rRPj4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QqMSc4rRPj4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The current crop are the most Googled lineup. As in: you\u2019d have to Google them to check who they are. While Strictly has always avoided reality TV stars, a few YouTubers have recently snuck under the radar, including glassy-eyed vlogbot Saffron Barker. Strictly shouldn\u2019t be about trying to entertain young people on a Saturday night \u2013 they\u2019ve got TikTok for that. No, this is a show for the older crowd. Your gran, still making the most of a free TV licence while she can, the parents trapped at home with a cocktail of prosecco and celibacy, and the families who gather round the telly for the Christmas special.

      "bodyText": "Only someone with a heart as cold as an abandoned Christmas tree would dare to suggest that Strictly Come Dancing isn\u2019t what it used to be. Any attempt at criticising the doyenne of shiny-floored Saturday night TV is to lay yourself wide open for a pelting with heavy glitterballs. But after 17 seasons, the sequins are starting to drop off the ratings behemoth. When Strictly first cha-cha-cha-ed on to Saturday night TV in 2004, bouffanted newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky unleashed those legs from behind the desk and she and Brendan Cole waltzed away with the glitterball trophy. The lineup was plundered from all corners of the BBC, with Bargain Hunt\u2019s David Dickinson toning down his mahogany tan to play the joker. Strictly has always been about much more than the dancing. There is the glory of the underdog, whether that\u2019s a lumbering John Sergeant dragging Kristina Rihanoff across the floor or Ed \u201cGangnam Style\u201d Balls and his disturbing gyrations. Viewers can smell an ambitious contestant a mile away and send them packing before Blackpool, even if they can dance (see: James Cracknell, Kirsty Gallacher). Its glory years saw showmances, big personalities (hello Nancy Dell\u2019Olio) and great journeys (Debbie McGee and Louise Redknapp rediscovering their inner foxes). Even the Strictly curse, where spending hours crotch-to-crotch with a stranger in a bodystocking and some sequins causes chaos in the contestants\u2019 relationships, became a reason to watch. But this year\u2019s breed have as much chance of being caught doing a Seann Walsh as Anneka Rice had of winning. The current crop are the most Googled lineup. As in: you\u2019d have to Google them to check who they are. While Strictly has always avoided reality TV stars, a few YouTubers have recently snuck under the radar, including glassy-eyed vlogbot Saffron Barker. Strictly shouldn\u2019t be about trying to entertain young people on a Saturday night \u2013 they\u2019ve got TikTok for that. No, this is a show for the older crowd. Your gran, still making the most of a free TV licence while she can, the parents trapped at home with a cocktail of prosecco and celibacy, and the families who gather round the telly for the Christmas special. Do they want to see teenagers in a Lindyhopathon? No, they demand Ann Widdecombe dressed as an ugly sister. That\u2019s the true spirit of Strictly. At least Debbie McGee is coming back for the Christmas special, but even she can\u2019t work the same magic that the vintage days held. The moment Jeremy Vine descended from a star-shaped Christmas tree topper in a mustard suit and held a very brave Karen Clifton aloft while the Puppini Sisters tooted out All I Want for Christmas, he set one hell of a precedent. If Strictly wants to reignite its magic, it\u2019ll have to pull in the A-listers. The ghost of Strictly past saw Susanna Reid, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Abbey Clancy setting the high standards, but all 2019 could offer was two soap stars and a bloke from CBBC in the final.

Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government\u2019s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called \u201congoing severe disruption\u201d to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president\u2019s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire.

Juventus will end 2019 sitting joint-top of Serie A. Alongside them, however, are an Inter team coached by Antonio Conte, the man who led their own charge back to the summit eight seasons ago. The Nerazzurri have scored more goals while conceding fewer, and rounded out the year with a 4-0 demolition of Genoa.<br><br>Juventus finished the year on a very different note. They also won their final league game, Cristiano Ronaldo sealing victory over Sampdoria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/18/cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-bayern-munich-sampdoria-freiburg\">with a gravity-defying header on Wednesday</a>, but still had one more commitment to fulfil. This year\u2019s Supercoppa \u2013 officially rebranded as the Coca-Cola Supercup \u2013 would be played in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.<br><br>Their opponents were Lazio. Or, to put it another way, a team that beat them 3-1 in the league just two weeks ago. Juventus had evolved since: Maurizio Sarri experimenting for the first time with a front three of Ronaldo, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and Paulo Dybala.</p> \n<p>He dared to start them all together in Riyadh. The outcome was exactly the same as it had been in Rome. If anything, Juventus looked worse. They had at least started brightly against Lazio in their league fixture, grabbing an early lead only to falter after Rodrigo Bentancur exited with a knee injury and Juan Cuadrado was shown a red card.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ce7b55b24cedd9cc390df1d507a649da5ed97e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ce7b55b24cedd9cc390df1d507a649da5ed97e/0_119_3696_2218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo chooses not to join in the applause for the victors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cristiano Ronaldo chooses not to join in the applause for the victors.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There were no such mitigating factors this time around. Lazio scored first on Sunday, Luis Alberto side-footing home from 10 yards out. Despite yielding possession to Juventus, and an equaliser to Paulo Dybala on the stroke of half-time, they continued to look by far the more dangerous side.<br><br>Sarri\u2019s gamble up front yielded mixed results. Dybala and Ronaldo sparkled intermittently, which was more than could be said for the rest of the team. The Portuguese forward came closest to giving Juventus an undeserved lead when he flashed a shot over the bar from the edge of the box.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To accommodate bold selections at the top of his formation, however, Sarri felt compelled to make more cautious choices elsewhere. Mattia De Sciglio started in place of Juan Cuadrado at right-back, presumably because he could be trusted not to stray too far upfield.<br><br>Tactical discipline alone, however, does not a defender make.

      "bodyText": "The 2010s will be remembered, in Italian football, as a decade dominated by Juventus: winners of eight out of 10 Scudetti, four Coppe Italia and four Supercoppe as well. Yet they began with a different team \u2013 Inter - winning the treble. They end amidst suggestions that the Old Lady\u2019s crown might once again be starting to slip. Perhaps such talk is premature. Juventus will end 2019 sitting joint-top of Serie A. Alongside them, however, are an Inter team coached by Antonio Conte, the man who led their own charge back to the summit eight seasons ago. The Nerazzurri have scored more goals while conceding fewer, and rounded out the year with a 4-0 demolition of Genoa. Juventus finished the year on a very different note. They also won their final league game, Cristiano Ronaldo sealing victory over Sampdoria with a gravity-defying header on Wednesday, but still had one more commitment to fulfil. This year\u2019s Supercoppa \u2013 officially rebranded as the Coca-Cola Supercup \u2013 would be played in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. Their opponents were Lazio. Or, to put it another way, a team that beat them 3-1 in the league just two weeks ago. Juventus had evolved since: Maurizio Sarri experimenting for the first time with a front three of Ronaldo, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and Paulo Dybala. He dared to start them all together in Riyadh. The outcome was exactly the same as it had been in Rome. If anything, Juventus looked worse. They had at least started brightly against Lazio in their league fixture, grabbing an early lead only to falter after Rodrigo Bentancur exited with a knee injury and Juan Cuadrado was shown a red card. There were no such mitigating factors this time around. Lazio scored first on Sunday, Luis Alberto side-footing home from 10 yards out. Despite yielding possession to Juventus, and an equaliser to Paulo Dybala on the stroke of half-time, they continued to look by far the more dangerous side. Sarri\u2019s gamble up front yielded mixed results. Dybala and Ronaldo sparkled intermittently, which was more than could be said for the rest of the team. The Portuguese forward came closest to giving Juventus an undeserved lead when he flashed a shot over the bar from the edge of the box. To accommodate bold selections at the top of his formation, however, Sarri felt compelled to make more cautious choices elsewhere. Mattia De Sciglio started in place of Juan Cuadrado at right-back, presumably because he could be trusted not to stray too far upfield. Tactical discipline alone, however, does not a defender make. De Sciglio was turned inside out by Senad Lulic in the build-up to Lazio\u2019s opener, lunging clumsily after the ball and gifting his opponent time and space to pick out Sergej Milinkovic-Savic at the back post. The Serbian cut it back for Luis Alberto to finish. Where Sarri\u2019s choices backfired, Simone Inzaghi made all the right calls. Eyebrows were raised at his decision to withdraw Luis Alberto \u2013 arguably Lazio\u2019s best performer \u2013 in the 67th minute. The Spaniard\u2019s replacement, Marco Parolo, provided the flick-on from which Lulic buried a brilliant volley to make it 2-1 moments later. Danilo Cataldi, another second-half substitute, sealed the win with a free-kick off the underside of the bar. This, after Bentancur received his second yellow card for bringing down Parolo in injury time. Sarri went easy on the excuses. He did suggest that his team had looked tired, and it is true that they came into this game on a shorter rest than Lazio, who had not played in midweek. Yet the Juventus manager also insisted that his team had put together their best training session of the season immediately beforehand, and depicted the result primarily as a testament to Lazio\u2019s excellence. \u201cThey are experiencing a moment of total self-belief, a magic moment,\u201d Sarri offered during a TV interview. \u201cIf they carry on like this, there\u2019s not much for anyone else to do.\u201d Later, in the mixed zone, he went further, stating that: \u201cFor me, right now, physically and mentally, they are the best team in Europe.\u201d An admirably magnanimous response, but not one that is likely to go down well in Turin. Juventus are a club whose entire ethos is winning, and who outspend Lazio on player wages by a ratio of more than four to one. If the message here was, \u201cYou can\u2019t win them all\u201d, then the response from the boardroom might be: \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d The Supercopppa is the least important of the four trophies that Juventus were targeting this season. Yet the manner of defeat is significant, against opponents who had beaten them so recently and are threatening to muscle in on the Serie A title race. Lazio sit just six points behind Juventus and Inter, with a game in hand. Gazzetta dello Sport\u2019s match report on Monday contended that it would be \u201ceasier for an elephant to hide behind a lamp post\u201d than for Inzaghi to carry on pretending that his team is not a contender. The decade belongs to Juventus, but for the Lazio players who ended Sunday night trying to smuggle their latest trophy through an airport metal detector, this has been one heck of a year. Talking points Romelu Lukaku finishes the year second on Serie A\u2019s scoring charts after adding a brace in that win over Genoa, but it might have been three if he had not ceded to Sebastiano Esposito\u2019s request to take the penalty Inter won at 2-0. The 17-year-old academy graduate duly buried his spot-kick, becoming the youngest player ever to score for the Nerazzurri at San Siro. If your heart didn\u2019t meltat the sight of him sharing a hug and a happy cry with his mum at full-time then we may need to book you in with visits from those Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. Milan began this decade as Serie A\u2019s reigning champions. They end it on a 5-0 defeat to Atalanta. This was an astonishing \u2013 and grim - result for a team that had seemed to be heading in a better direction under Stefano Pioli. Atalanta were scintillating, but that cannot excuse the meekness of the Rossoneri. Vincenzo Montella got to eat his panettone - but only in the literal sense. Fiorentina parted ways with their manager following a 4-1 defeat to Roma on Friday, and the optimism that greeted the arrival of Franck Ribery in the summer feels like a very distant memory. \u2018Eating one\u2019s panettone\u2019 is often used as journalistic shorthand in Italy for managers hanging on to their jobs at Christmas.

Thousands of people are expected to travel on the railways on Monday to reach family and loved ones for the festive period. The operator has blamed a shortage of drivers and staff for the disruption to trains in northern England and Scotland. On Monday morning, 44 of 115 trains \u2013 38% of all services on the network \u2013 were more than half an hour late or cancelled, and a further 5% were delayed by between five and 30 minutes. Since 17 December, more than 30% of TransPennine\u2019s services each day have been severely disrupted. The company runs trains between central Manchester and cities including Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The introduction of a new fleet last month has been beset with issues. Staff and drivers are still being trained to work on the Nova trains, bought by the franchise owner FirstGroup from the Japanese manufacturer Hitachi. A number of services between Liverpool and Newcastle have also been temporarily withdrawn as a result of the implementation of a new timetable this month. Leo Goodwin, the managing director for the network, said: \u201cI am really sorry for the disruption to our customers\u2019 journeys. I know what a busy time it is with people travelling during the festive period. \u201cWe have had a number of issues to contend with: crew training caused by the late delivery of some of our new trains, a maintenance backlog and the implementation of a temporary timetable along one of our routes.\u201d On Sunday the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool urged Boris Johnson to publicly commit to ending the railway chaos in northern England. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has outlined plans for Northern to be stripped of its franchise and brought back under public control after years of late and cancelled trains. Mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotherham said TransPennine had performed worse than Northern for much of the year. \u201cA timetable needs to be set for improvements and, if they fail to deliver, TransPennine should be next,\u201d they said.",

      "body": "<p>Gloria Steinem, 85, is a feminist icon,<strong> </strong>in trademark black leather trousers and turtleneck top, hair streaked blond and back straight as a ballerina\u2019s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gloria-allred\" title=\"\">Gloria Allred</a>, sitting beside her on a green velvet couch, is, at 78, small and ferocious, one of the best-known attorneys in the world, with a four-decade history of defending women\u2019s rights and an avowed \u201cfangirl\u201d of Steinem. We are in Steinem\u2019s house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the women have convened to talk about recent high-profile cases brought by women \u2013 many of them represented by Allred \u2013 against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-dead-prison-report-latest\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/bill-cosby-sentence-sexual-assault-judge\" title=\"\">Bill Cosby</a>, as well as the forthcoming US presidential election, attacks on abortion legislature, and the history of women\u2019s rights in the US.</p> <p>The women\u2019s careers exist, to some degree, in tandem, with Steinem\u2019s decades-long work as an activist changing public consciousness that Allred may then convert into victories in court. Hers has been a controversial career, defending victims of sexual harassment in class action suits, and going after powerful men in a way that has occasioned accusations of publicity-seeking. When a high-profile story breaks featuring allegations of sexual misconduct against celebrated men, Allred\u2019s name is often not far behind. But she has also won victories in hundreds of unglamorous suits that represent the grunt-work of legal activism. In 2004, Allred successfully filed the first lawsuit in California challenging the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage; in 2008, she secured a $15m payout for 200 women in an anti-age discrimination suit against a giant electronics chain. This month, she won a sexual harassment case against Alki David, a billionaire accused of harassing a former employee. And so it goes on.</p> <p>The styles of the lawyer and the activist couldn\u2019t be more different. Steinem is softly spoken, unsurprised by anything at this point, and very much gives an impression of occupying her own astral plane. Last month she released a new collection of quotes and essays, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-truth-will-set-you-free-but-first-it-will-piss-you-off-9781911632597.html\" title=\"\">The Truth Will Set You Free, But First It Will Piss You Off</a>. Allred is sharp, energetic and poised always to pounce or defend. On the subject of her daughter, Lisa Bloom, a lawyer criticised for defending Weinstein, she says, \u201cI let Lisa, who has a different law firm from mine, speak for herself. And she has spoken for herself, and continues to do so, and I\u2019m very proud that she does.\u201d Where Steinem and Allred meet is in their history of successfully prosecuting a feminist agenda, and their ability to retain a sense of humour about it.<br></p> <p><strong>Gloria Steinem</strong> Bill Cosby and Jeffrey Epstein had town houses across from each other just two and a half blocks from here. While Epstein was alive, I thought we should have a street demonstration between the two houses \u2013 cordon off the blocks and say, we\u2019re taking back the streets!</p> <p><strong>Gloria Allred</strong> [Laughing.] That\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ve always loved your ideas, all of them. Protests are a good thing, as far as I\u2019m concerned.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> But after he was no longer here, it didn\u2019t seem... seemly.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> We\u2019re still pursuing his estate. Last week, our legal team filed three lawsuits on behalf of our clients who alleged that they were underaged girls when they were sexually victimised by Mr Epstein, and at least two of them were sex trafficked by him.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> In his plane? Not that it matters.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> No. These are serious cases, and we filed them in New York. There\u2019s a wonderful new law in New York that provides for adult victims of child sexual abuse \u2013 you have a one-year window to file lawsuits against the accused. Now, many of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, who perhaps would have been barred by previous laws from having access to the courts, are filing law suits.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> And the case just got moved from Florida to here that was also crucial, because there were a lot of cases that, due to the corruption of the Florida system, had not been pursued.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> You\u2019re very right. It\u2019s really important to them, very empowering to them, to know that they can still seek justice, even though he is deceased.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Well it\u2019s always clear to me that if I\u2019m in trouble, then I\u2019m calling you up! [Both laugh.]</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Thank you! It is clear to me that Gloria \u2013 I\u2019m going to call you Gloria number one \u2013</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Because I\u2019m older!</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Well, not for that reason, but Gloria has been in it longer than anybody I know, and with more vision, and more activism. I call her the Philosopher of the Movement. I\u2019m more like the soldier on the battlefield.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> You\u2019re the grand legal strategist!</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Well, thank you.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> You\u2019re the person who makes the system in which we live responsible. The rest of us are protesting against the system, but it\u2019s not the same as getting justice.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I think both are absolutely necessary, because what you do has an impact on the court of public opinion \u2013 to create a climate in which change is possible, probable, and will happen. Because unless the public knows what is wrong, what is happening to women, there would be no need for legislators to correct that wrong by passing new laws.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Yes. Consciousness comes first. And actually, you can see that in the progression of sexual harassment, for instance. Because it was in the early 70s that students at Cornell University were trying to describe what happened to them on summer jobs, and they invented the term sexual harassment. Then we at Ms magazine [which Steinem cofounded in 1972] did a story on sexual harassment and used puppets on the cover, so we wouldn\u2019t be too shocking \u2013 nonetheless we were pulled off the newsstands in supermarkets. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/23/how-litigation-laid-the-ground-for-accountability-after-metoo\" title=\"\">Catherine MacKinnon wrote sexual harassment</a> into law. Then three women, all black women, brought law suits because of sexual harassment. Then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/27/jor-biden-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-1991-hearings\" title=\"\">Clarence Thomas events</a> educated the country, even though the outcome was wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sexual harassment turns work into prostitution; to continue to get paid, you have to put up with this unwanted attention</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"79923860f686491888148de3daec73214b3f6097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79923860f686491888148de3daec73214b3f6097/813_1096_1018_1019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred (left) and feminist writer and activist Gloria Steinem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"79923860f686491888148de3daec73214b3f6097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79923860f686491888148de3daec73214b3f6097/2021_1178_1072_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"December 5th 2019, New York NY, Gloria Strieman &amp; Gloria Allred shot in conversation for the Guardian. Photography Christopher Lane/Guardian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So it\u2019s been a progression. And I think only with the populist cases you have brought, and the #MeToo movement, has it become a majority consciousness that it\u2019s wrong. Because otherwise it was blamed on the victim. What were you wearing, why were you there, what did you say, what did you drink, etc?</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Well, the reason that we have laws against sexual harassment, is because sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination \u2013 it\u2019s the denial of equal employment opportunity. And that is the law of our land, that women are entitled to enjoy equal employment opportunity; sexual harassment interferes with that enjoyment. It places a woman in a no-win situation: does she go along with it, and then he may get tired of her, and then she loses her job? Or does she not go along with it, and then he goes into ego-shock and she loses her job?</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> It turns work into prostitution; in order to continue to get paid you have to put up with this unwanted sexual attention.</p> <p>But actually the first case after the passage of the law was a man against a woman, in California. Remember that? It was the employee of an executive woman who she was requiring to go to bed with her, and she won the case.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Well we\u2019ve had a case that\u2019s similar, many years ago, representing a man against a woman boss. He was employed at a very large grocery chain in southern California, and the jury found that he was not sexually harassed. However, they also decided that he was retaliated against for protesting against the sexual harassment and was awarded, I believe, $16m.</p> <p>In any event, we\u2019ve always said that of course men are also entitled to protection from sexual harassment.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> I\u2019m happy to say that what we haven\u2019t had yet is the case of a woman against a woman.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I\u2019ve had this! [Both laugh.]</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Never mind. Forget I said it.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Let me put it this way: we settled those cases confidentially, so we haven\u2019t tried them. Most cases are settled confidentially. And this is true not just of our cases \u2013 most cases are settled prior to going to trial.</p> <p>This week we represented a woman who was sexually harassed, she alleged, by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/billionaire-alki-david-faces-58m-damages-battery-case-67448069\" title=\"\">Alki David</a>, the billionaire, in the work place, and the jury found in favour of us for $8.25m for our client Mahim Khan, and then awarded $50m in punitive damages against Mr David \u2013 which are damages to punish the accused for conduct that shocks the conscience of the community.</p> <p>The point is, it\u2019s accountability, it\u2019s empowerment of women, and it\u2019s a very exciting time in the #MeToo movement.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> But I still don\u2019t think we have a popular understanding of why we have this problem: because we live in a patriarchy, and by definition that means men control women\u2019s bodies as the means of reproduction. Before Europeans showed up here, the systems were matrilineal not patriarchal, and rape and sexual assault were virtually unknown, because power was equal. So it\u2019s comforting to me to realise that it\u2019s not human nature, that it wasn\u2019t always this way \u2013 and it won\u2019t always be this way.</p> <p>[The conversation turns to non-disclosure agreements, the controversial legal mechanism whereby accusers are prohibited from speaking publicly in return for a financial settlement, many of which Allred has negotiated for her clients.]</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> OK, let\u2019s talk about that. There are many misconceptions by people who are not lawyers, about confidential settlements. For example: some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/she-said-book-harvey-weinstein-twohey-kantor\" title=\"\">reporters for the New York Times, who wrote the book</a> [She Said], alleged that I entered into a confidential settlement for one of my clients in reference to Mr Weinstein. I never comment on whether I have or have not entered into a confidential settlement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They say 200 women have accused Trump of harassment. I think we should invite them all to campaign at the election</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some reporters have said, \u201cShe silenced her clients.\u201d So let me try to be concise and clear: I stand by the fact that every woman, and every man, has a right to choose whether she wishes to enter into a confidential settlement, by which she will be compensated and make that wrongdoer accountable to her. And it is her choice. It\u2019s a voluntary process and I am very disturbed by anyone who wants to take away that choice. Not everyone wants their mother, their sister, their brother, their community to know they were raped, sexually abused as a child, sexually assaulted, whatever. Some people think it might hurt them in their next job if they were known to have sued someone in their career path. And let me put one last line on that; no confidential settlement can prohibit a victim from going to the police, asking that criminal charges be filed against that same perpetrator. They can still do that. What\u2019s more, they can still testify in someone else\u2019s civil lawsuit, if they are subpoenaed.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> They can\u2019t initiate that suit \u2013</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> They can\u2019t file a lawsuit themselves, but through the confidential settlement they\u2019re saying I don\u2019t want to file a lawsuit, I just want to resolve this now. I want to be able to get a settlement, which may be as much as, or more than they would get going through three or four years of litigation. Using words like \u201chush money\u201d, or that an attorney silenced them \u2013 it\u2019s voluntary, they can say no.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> It\u2019s important to know that. You know, last night I did a book event at Symphony Space, and three women who have publicly accused President Trump of sexual harassment were there and came back to talk to me afterwards. They said that there are now 200 women \u2013 200 women! \u2013 who have accused Trump of sexual harassment, and that the press is not interested because it\u2019s not news. It\u2019s old news. So I thought we should invite all 200 women to get on buses and campaign during the next election. [Laughs.]</p> <p>[The subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/06/brett-kavanaugh-confirmed-us-supreme-court\" title=\"\">Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/06/brett-kavanaugh-confirmed-us-supreme-court\" title=\"\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/06/brett-kavanaugh-confirmed-us-supreme-court\" title=\"\">court confirmation</a> hearing comes up, and whether or not the US has advanced since Clarence Thomas was voted to the supreme court after facing accusations of sexual misconduct in 1991.]</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Well, if you look at public opinion polls, you will find that Anita Hill was not as believed as Christine Blasey Ford. It took years for her [to be believed], because consciousness was changing about sexual harassment.</p> <p>In the Kavanaugh case, I think the accuser was much more believed and Kavanaugh was much more disbelieved, but the votes were already there, because that\u2019s the nature of the people who were sitting in Congress. The public consciousness is evolving, and part of the reason why is because of Gloria and other leaders of the feminist movement. It wouldn\u2019t have happened if there was no speaking out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"425e1dce7482203ecb509f3419caa34ea4065865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/425e1dce7482203ecb509f3419caa34ea4065865/0_0_4969_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred (left) and feminist writer and activist Gloria Steinem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>GS</strong> It\u2019s always that way, with racism, with sexism, with antisemitism: it\u2019s perceived as natural, inevitable and justified, until people stand up and say, wait, this is unjust. When I was growing up in the east side of Toledo, if a woman was beaten up by her husband they said, what did she do wrong? And the goal of the cops was to get the couple back together again.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I hate to say it, but sometimes people still say that.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> But now we have laws. We didn\u2019t even have a term for it. There was nothing. So it\u2019s a process. Consciousness comes first; then describing it in terms of personal experience; then describing it in terms that enter into the law; then prosecuting.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about sex trafficking of underage girls, and I\u2019m feeling that for the first time we\u2019re seeing actual criminal prosecutions. I represent a number of accusers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/r-kelly\" title=\"\">R Kelly</a> \u2013 and I do feel that some of those accusers were ignored because they are African American. Now, Lifetime TV did a documentary about Kelly that has encouraged and empowered victims to come forward, and the US justice department [is pursuing him]. There\u2019s a state prosecution in Cook County, Illinois, and a state prosecution in Minnesota. He\u2019s charged with, among other things, the sex trafficking of underage girls. Epstein was charged with that, and now there\u2019s a serious criminal investigation into who may have conspired with Epstein to assist.</p> <p>[The subject of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s friend and alleged co-conspirator, who has denied wrongdoing, comes up.]</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I\u2019d definitely be interested in taking Ms Maxwell\u2019s deposition in a civil law suit. I\u2019ve also been saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">P</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">rince Andrew</a> needs to voluntarily come forward and speak to the FBI. He\u2019s got to do this without conditions, without delays. Because he did stay with Epstein in his New York home; in Palm Beach; in the Virgin Islands. He has information. </p> <p><strong>GS</strong> We founded this country on a rejection of royalty, so I\u2019ve never understood how anybody could seriously stand up and call themselves prince, princess, queen. Are you kidding me? [Laughs.]</p> <p>[The talk turns to reproductive rights.]</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> If we didn\u2019t have wombs, we\u2019d be fine. It all stems from that. The definition of patriarchy is controlling reproduction. And it becomes even more important when there\u2019s race and racism, because in order to maintain racial separation and racism, you have to control reproduction. So those two things are always intertwined. There\u2019s no such thing as trying to uproot racism without also uprooting sexism, and vice versa.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> The issue of reproductive rights and who controls a woman\u2019s body is so essential now, because it is being challenged. There are a lot of legislators all over the world who are still trying to control women\u2019s bodies.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> In the southern states it\u2019s still very connected to racism. The white nationalists are very upset that white women are not having as many children as women of colour and therefore hastening the day when we will no longer be a majority white country. As if that mattered. But it matters to them.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I was a person who had to have an abortion prior to Roe v Wade. Women like me had to go to people who gave back-alley abortions, who were not licensed health care providers, and I haemorrhaged and almost died \u2013 some did die, from illegal abortions. I had to be taken to a hospital with a 106-degree fever, packed in ice, and the nurse told me \u2013 and this was after getting pregnant from a rape in Mexico \u2013 the nurse told me, \u201cWell, I hope this will teach you a lesson.\u201d</p> <p>So I said, many years later, it did teach me a lesson: that abortion should be safe, legal, affordable and available. This is a key issue and you, Gloria, started to speak about this in, what, the 60s?</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> In the 70s. I went to cover an abortion speak out, when the New York state legislature was trying to decide whether to slightly liberalise New York state laws. They had invited 14 men and one nun to testify. [Laughs.] So a group of women said no, wait a minute, let\u2019s hear from women who\u2019ve had this experience.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I\u2019ve heard that there are some cemeteries near convents in which foetuses have been discovered. It may be that some nuns have gotten pregnant.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> We have seen a wave of disclosure about sexual abuse of children by priests. We haven\u2019t yet seen nuns, and that\u2019s going to be huge.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Yes. I predict that could happen. I represented a woman in the 80s. She wanted to be a nun, she was 16 years old, very religious, and we alleged that she was sexually abused by seven Catholic priests and had a baby by one of them. It\u2019s a long story, but I pursued the church for 23 years, and ultimately we were able to get her a great settlement. By litigating our case, it raised consciousness.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Well, the fact that the church imposes celibacy is ridiculous. And as Catholic historians will tell you, it\u2019s because the church didn\u2019t want to share whatever the priest was going to inherit with the family. That\u2019s where the requirement of celibacy came from.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> I\u2019ve read that. They wanted them to leave their property to the church, not to their children.</p> <p>[The conversation moves on to next year\u2019s US presidential election.]</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> I will work my heart out for any one of those [Democratic] candidates to make sure they get elected, and not Donald Trump. I think they\u2019re all good people with good hearts and good minds. Of course, there is still a big difference between the way male and female candidates are treated, and that will take a while to go away. But it is a step forward that we have multiple women candidates this time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was growing up, if a woman was beaten up by her husband, people said, what did she do wrong?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>GA</strong> We cannot tolerate four more years of Donald Trump. It has been a catastrophe, and I\u2019m actually very conservative in my use of that word. But this is a catastrophe for the country. He has packed the federal courts with judges who are incompetent and not qualified, and in many cases these people have extreme rightwing views. And of course, because there\u2019s a senate majority, the Democrats can\u2019t stop it. But the chronic lying; the shame he has brought on the country; the damage worldwide. The very anti-women policies of this administration; the roll back of civil rights for minorities, the Latinos and how they\u2019ve been attacked.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> He was not elected president.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> That\u2019s true.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> He has made us woke, that is his only good purpose. He has shown us everything that\u2019s wrong with the country at a high level.</p> <p>Also, he has helped us to get rid of the electoral college. At least 14 states have already rejected the electoral college, which you can do by constitutional amendment but it\u2019s a very long process. So what\u2019s happening is that states are voting to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. And at a certain point that makes the electoral college academic.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> That is very interesting.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Because the electoral college was a requirement of the slave states in the first place.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> And of course Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Donald Trump, popular votes. The only other good point for those of us who want a different administration, is that it has really mobilised so many of us.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Because I travel so much, I see that. I\u2019ve never seen the degree of activism, ever, in my life.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> Exactly.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> People who didn\u2019t even vote before are now running for office. It\u2019s amazing.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> We are going to see, in the coming year, more women being brave. We have the Harvey Weinstein trial starting on 6 January. I feel that, both in the political arena and in the judicial arena, women want to be constructive. They want to help to empower women and make sure men are accountable, politically or in the courts. 2020 will be a good year for women \u2013 and we should mention it\u2019s the hundredth anniversary of suffrage in this country. So we will see a lot of activism reminding everyone that women had to fight to win the right to vote, just like in the UK with the Pankhursts \u2013 my mother\u2019s from England. We want people to get out and use the vote.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure, Gloria, you\u2019re going to be involved in that effort.</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Oh, yes. Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>GA</strong> We want Gloria leading the charge to vote!</p> <p><strong>GS</strong> Voting is a very local, regional, door-to-door process. So each of us has to say: not only am I going to vote, I am going to sit with my neighbour\u2019s kids while they vote. I\u2019m going to make sure everybody in my block votes. We don\u2019t exist if we don\u2019t vote!</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gloria Steinem, 85, is a feminist icon, in trademark black leather trousers and turtleneck top, hair streaked blond and back straight as a ballerina\u2019s. Gloria Allred, sitting beside her on a green velvet couch, is, at 78, small and ferocious, one of the best-known attorneys in the world, with a four-decade history of defending women\u2019s rights and an avowed \u201cfangirl\u201d of Steinem. We are in Steinem\u2019s house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the women have convened to talk about recent high-profile cases brought by women \u2013 many of them represented by Allred \u2013 against Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby, as well as the forthcoming US presidential election, attacks on abortion legislature, and the history of women\u2019s rights in the US. The women\u2019s careers exist, to some degree, in tandem, with Steinem\u2019s decades-long work as an activist changing public consciousness that Allred may then convert into victories in court. Hers has been a controversial career, defending victims of sexual harassment in class action suits, and going after powerful men in a way that has occasioned accusations of publicity-seeking. When a high-profile story breaks featuring allegations of sexual misconduct against celebrated men, Allred\u2019s name is often not far behind. But she has also won victories in hundreds of unglamorous suits that represent the grunt-work of legal activism. In 2004, Allred successfully filed the first lawsuit in California challenging the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage; in 2008, she secured a $15m payout for 200 women in an anti-age discrimination suit against a giant electronics chain. This month, she won a sexual harassment case against Alki David, a billionaire accused of harassing a former employee. And so it goes on. The styles of the lawyer and the activist couldn\u2019t be more different. Steinem is softly spoken, unsurprised by anything at this point, and very much gives an impression of occupying her own astral plane. Last month she released a new collection of quotes and essays, The Truth Will Set You Free, But First It Will Piss You Off. Allred is sharp, energetic and poised always to pounce or defend. On the subject of her daughter, Lisa Bloom, a lawyer criticised for defending Weinstein, she says, \u201cI let Lisa, who has a different law firm from mine, speak for herself. And she has spoken for herself, and continues to do so, and I\u2019m very proud that she does.\u201d Where Steinem and Allred meet is in their history of successfully prosecuting a feminist agenda, and their ability to retain a sense of humour about it. Gloria Steinem Bill Cosby and Jeffrey Epstein had town houses across from each other just two and a half blocks from here. While Epstein was alive, I thought we should have a street demonstration between the two houses \u2013 cordon off the blocks and say, we\u2019re taking back the streets! Gloria Allred [Laughing.] That\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ve always loved your ideas, all of them. Protests are a good thing, as far as I\u2019m concerned. GS But after he was no longer here, it didn\u2019t seem... seemly. GA We\u2019re still pursuing his estate. Last week, our legal team filed three lawsuits on behalf of our clients who alleged that they were underaged girls when they were sexually victimised by Mr Epstein, and at least two of them were sex trafficked by him. GS In his plane? Not that it matters. GA No. These are serious cases, and we filed them in New York. There\u2019s a wonderful new law in New York that provides for adult victims of child sexual abuse \u2013 you have a one-year window to file lawsuits against the accused. Now, many of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, who perhaps would have been barred by previous laws from having access to the courts, are filing law suits. GS And the case just got moved from Florida to here that was also crucial, because there were a lot of cases that, due to the corruption of the Florida system, had not been pursued. GA You\u2019re very right. It\u2019s really important to them, very empowering to them, to know that they can still seek justice, even though he is deceased. GS Well it\u2019s always clear to me that if I\u2019m in trouble, then I\u2019m calling you up! [Both laugh.] GA Thank you! It is clear to me that Gloria \u2013 I\u2019m going to call you Gloria number one \u2013 GS Because I\u2019m older! GA Well, not for that reason, but Gloria has been in it longer than anybody I know, and with more vision, and more activism. I call her the Philosopher of the Movement. I\u2019m more like the soldier on the battlefield. GS You\u2019re the grand legal strategist! GA Well, thank you. GS You\u2019re the person who makes the system in which we live responsible. The rest of us are protesting against the system, but it\u2019s not the same as getting justice. GA I think both are absolutely necessary, because what you do has an impact on the court of public opinion \u2013 to create a climate in which change is possible, probable, and will happen. Because unless the public knows what is wrong, what is happening to women, there would be no need for legislators to correct that wrong by passing new laws. GS Yes. Consciousness comes first. And actually, you can see that in the progression of sexual harassment, for instance. Because it was in the early 70s that students at Cornell University were trying to describe what happened to them on summer jobs, and they invented the term sexual harassment. Then we at Ms magazine [which Steinem cofounded in 1972] did a story on sexual harassment and used puppets on the cover, so we wouldn\u2019t be too shocking \u2013 nonetheless we were pulled off the newsstands in supermarkets. Then Catherine MacKinnon wrote sexual harassment into law. Then three women, all black women, brought law suits because of sexual harassment. Then the Clarence Thomas events educated the country, even though the outcome was wrong. So it\u2019s been a progression. And I think only with the populist cases you have brought, and the #MeToo movement, has it become a majority consciousness that it\u2019s wrong. Because otherwise it was blamed on the victim. What were you wearing, why were you there, what did you say, what did you drink, etc? GA Well, the reason that we have laws against sexual harassment, is because sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination \u2013 it\u2019s the denial of equal employment opportunity. And that is the law of our land, that women are entitled to enjoy equal employment opportunity; sexual harassment interferes with that enjoyment. It places a woman in a no-win situation: does she go along with it, and then he may get tired of her, and then she loses her job? Or does she not go along with it, and then he goes into ego-shock and she loses her job? GS It turns work into prostitution; in order to continue to get paid you have to put up with this unwanted sexual attention. But actually the first case after the passage of the law was a man against a woman, in California. Remember that? It was the employee of an executive woman who she was requiring to go to bed with her, and she won the case. GA Well we\u2019ve had a case that\u2019s similar, many years ago, representing a man against a woman boss. He was employed at a very large grocery chain in southern California, and the jury found that he was not sexually harassed. However, they also decided that he was retaliated against for protesting against the sexual harassment and was awarded, I believe, $16m. In any event, we\u2019ve always said that of course men are also entitled to protection from sexual harassment. GS I\u2019m happy to say that what we haven\u2019t had yet is the case of a woman against a woman. GA I\u2019ve had this! [Both laugh.] GS Never mind. Forget I said it. GA Let me put it this way: we settled those cases confidentially, so we haven\u2019t tried them. Most cases are settled confidentially. And this is true not just of our cases \u2013 most cases are settled prior to going to trial. This week we represented a woman who was sexually harassed, she alleged, by Alki David, the billionaire, in the work place, and the jury found in favour of us for $8.25m for our client Mahim Khan, and then awarded $50m in punitive damages against Mr David \u2013 which are damages to punish the accused for conduct that shocks the conscience of the community. The point is, it\u2019s accountability, it\u2019s empowerment of women, and it\u2019s a very exciting time in the #MeToo movement. GS But I still don\u2019t think we have a popular understanding of why we have this problem: because we live in a patriarchy, and by definition that means men control women\u2019s bodies as the means of reproduction. Before Europeans showed up here, the systems were matrilineal not patriarchal, and rape and sexual assault were virtually unknown, because power was equal. So it\u2019s comforting to me to realise that it\u2019s not human nature, that it wasn\u2019t always this way \u2013 and it won\u2019t always be this way. [The conversation turns to non-disclosure agreements, the controversial legal mechanism whereby accusers are prohibited from speaking publicly in return for a financial settlement, many of which Allred has negotiated for her clients.] GA OK, let\u2019s talk about that. There are many misconceptions by people who are not lawyers, about confidential settlements. For example: some of the reporters for the New York Times, who wrote the book [She Said], alleged that I entered into a confidential settlement for one of my clients in reference to Mr Weinstein. I never comment on whether I have or have not entered into a confidential settlement. Some reporters have said, \u201cShe silenced her clients.\u201d So let me try to be concise and clear: I stand by the fact that every woman, and every man, has a right to choose whether she wishes to enter into a confidential settlement, by which she will be compensated and make that wrongdoer accountable to her. And it is her choice. It\u2019s a voluntary process and I am very disturbed by anyone who wants to take away that choice. Not everyone wants their mother, their sister, their brother, their community to know they were raped, sexually abused as a child, sexually assaulted, whatever. Some people think it might hurt them in their next job if they were known to have sued someone in their career path. And let me put one last line on that; no confidential settlement can prohibit a victim from going to the police, asking that criminal charges be filed against that same perpetrator. They can still do that. What\u2019s more, they can still testify in someone else\u2019s civil lawsuit, if they are subpoenaed. GS They can\u2019t initiate that suit \u2013 GA They can\u2019t file a lawsuit themselves, but through the confidential settlement they\u2019re saying I don\u2019t want to file a lawsuit, I just want to resolve this now. I want to be able to get a settlement, which may be as much as, or more than they would get going through three or four years of litigation. Using words like \u201chush money\u201d, or that an attorney silenced them \u2013 it\u2019s voluntary, they can say no. GS It\u2019s important to know that. You know, last night I did a book event at Symphony Space, and three women who have publicly accused President Trump of sexual harassment were there and came back to talk to me afterwards. They said that there are now 200 women \u2013 200 women! \u2013 who have accused Trump of sexual harassment, and that the press is not interested because it\u2019s not news. It\u2019s old news. So I thought we should invite all 200 women to get on buses and campaign during the next election. [Laughs.] [The subject of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court confirmation hearing comes up, and whether or not the US has advanced since Clarence Thomas was voted to the supreme court after facing accusations of sexual misconduct in 1991.] GA Well, if you look at public opinion polls, you will find that Anita Hill was not as believed as Christine Blasey Ford. It took years for her [to be believed], because consciousness was changing about sexual harassment. In the Kavanaugh case, I think the accuser was much more believed and Kavanaugh was much more disbelieved, but the votes were already there, because that\u2019s the nature of the people who were sitting in Congress. The public consciousness is evolving, and part of the reason why is because of Gloria and other leaders of the feminist movement. It wouldn\u2019t have happened if there was no speaking out. GS It\u2019s always that way, with racism, with sexism, with antisemitism: it\u2019s perceived as natural, inevitable and justified, until people stand up and say, wait, this is unjust. When I was growing up in the east side of Toledo, if a woman was beaten up by her husband they said, what did she do wrong? And the goal of the cops was to get the couple back together again. GA I hate to say it, but sometimes people still say that. GS But now we have laws. We didn\u2019t even have a term for it. There was nothing. So it\u2019s a process. Consciousness comes first; then describing it in terms of personal experience; then describing it in terms that enter into the law; then prosecuting. GA There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about sex trafficking of underage girls, and I\u2019m feeling that for the first time we\u2019re seeing actual criminal prosecutions. I represent a number of accusers of R Kelly \u2013 and I do feel that some of those accusers were ignored because they are African American. Now, Lifetime TV did a documentary about Kelly that has encouraged and empowered victims to come forward, and the US justice department [is pursuing him]. There\u2019s a state prosecution in Cook County, Illinois, and a state prosecution in Minnesota. He\u2019s charged with, among other things, the sex trafficking of underage girls. Epstein was charged with that, and now there\u2019s a serious criminal investigation into who may have conspired with Epstein to assist. [The subject of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s friend and alleged co-conspirator, who has denied wrongdoing, comes up.] GA I\u2019d definitely be interested in taking Ms Maxwell\u2019s deposition in a civil law suit. I\u2019ve also been saying Prince Andrew needs to voluntarily come forward and speak to the FBI. He\u2019s got to do this without conditions, without delays. Because he did stay with Epstein in his New York home; in Palm Beach; in the Virgin Islands. He has information. GS We founded this country on a rejection of royalty, so I\u2019ve never understood how anybody could seriously stand up and call themselves prince, princess, queen. Are you kidding me? [Laughs.] [The talk turns to reproductive rights.] GS If we didn\u2019t have wombs, we\u2019d be fine. It all stems from that. The definition of patriarchy is controlling reproduction. And it becomes even more important when there\u2019s race and racism, because in order to maintain racial separation and racism, you have to control reproduction. So those two things are always intertwined. There\u2019s no such thing as trying to uproot racism without also uprooting sexism, and vice versa. GA The issue of reproductive rights and who controls a woman\u2019s body is so essential now, because it is being challenged. There are a lot of legislators all over the world who are still trying to control women\u2019s bodies. GS In the southern states it\u2019s still very connected to racism. The white nationalists are very upset that white women are not having as many children as women of colour and therefore hastening the day when we will no longer be a majority white country. As if that mattered. But it matters to them. GA I was a person who had to have an abortion prior to Roe v Wade. Women like me had to go to people who gave back-alley abortions, who were not licensed health care providers, and I haemorrhaged and almost died \u2013 some did die, from illegal abortions. I had to be taken to a hospital with a 106-degree fever, packed in ice, and the nurse told me \u2013 and this was after getting pregnant from a rape in Mexico \u2013 the nurse told me, \u201cWell, I hope this will teach you a lesson.\u201d So I said, many years later, it did teach me a lesson: that abortion should be safe, legal, affordable and available. This is a key issue and you, Gloria, started to speak about this in, what, the 60s? GS In the 70s. I went to cover an abortion speak out, when the New York state legislature was trying to decide whether to slightly liberalise New York state laws. They had invited 14 men and one nun to testify. [Laughs.] So a group of women said no, wait a minute, let\u2019s hear from women who\u2019ve had this experience. GA I\u2019ve heard that there are some cemeteries near convents in which foetuses have been discovered. It may be that some nuns have gotten pregnant. GS We have seen a wave of disclosure about sexual abuse of children by priests. We haven\u2019t yet seen nuns, and that\u2019s going to be huge. GA Yes. I predict that could happen. I represented a woman in the 80s. She wanted to be a nun, she was 16 years old, very religious, and we alleged that she was sexually abused by seven Catholic priests and had a baby by one of them. It\u2019s a long story, but I pursued the church for 23 years, and ultimately we were able to get her a great settlement. By litigating our case, it raised consciousness. GS Well, the fact that the church imposes celibacy is ridiculous. And as Catholic historians will tell you, it\u2019s because the church didn\u2019t want to share whatever the priest was going to inherit with the family. That\u2019s where the requirement of celibacy came from. GA I\u2019ve read that. They wanted them to leave their property to the church, not to their children. [The conversation moves on to next year\u2019s US presidential election.] GS I will work my heart out for any one of those [Democratic] candidates to make sure they get elected, and not Donald Trump. I think they\u2019re all good people with good hearts and good minds. Of course, there is still a big difference between the way male and female candidates are treated, and that will take a while to go away. But it is a step forward that we have multiple women candidates this time. GA We cannot tolerate four more years of Donald Trump. It has been a catastrophe, and I\u2019m actually very conservative in my use of that word. But this is a catastrophe for the country. He has packed the federal courts with judges who are incompetent and not qualified, and in many cases these people have extreme rightwing views. And of course, because there\u2019s a senate majority, the Democrats can\u2019t stop it. But the chronic lying; the shame he has brought on the country; the damage worldwide. The very anti-women policies of this administration; the roll back of civil rights for minorities, the Latinos and how they\u2019ve been attacked. GS He was not elected president. GA That\u2019s true. GS He has made us woke, that is his only good purpose. He has shown us everything that\u2019s wrong with the country at a high level. Also, he has helped us to get rid of the electoral college. At least 14 states have already rejected the electoral college, which you can do by constitutional amendment but it\u2019s a very long process. So what\u2019s happening is that states are voting to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. And at a certain point that makes the electoral college academic. GA That is very interesting. GS Because the electoral college was a requirement of the slave states in the first place. GA And of course Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Donald Trump, popular votes. The only other good point for those of us who want a different administration, is that it has really mobilised so many of us. GS Because I travel so much, I see that. I\u2019ve never seen the degree of activism, ever, in my life. GA Exactly. GS People who didn\u2019t even vote before are now running for office. It\u2019s amazing. GA We are going to see, in the coming year, more women being brave. We have the Harvey Weinstein trial starting on 6 January. I feel that, both in the political arena and in the judicial arena, women want to be constructive. They want to help to empower women and make sure men are accountable, politically or in the courts. 2020 will be a good year for women \u2013 and we should mention it\u2019s the hundredth anniversary of suffrage in this country. So we will see a lot of activism reminding everyone that women had to fight to win the right to vote, just like in the UK with the Pankhursts \u2013 my mother\u2019s from England. We want people to get out and use the vote. I\u2019m sure, Gloria, you\u2019re going to be involved in that effort. GS Oh, yes. Absolutely. GA We want Gloria leading the charge to vote! GS Voting is a very local, regional, door-to-door process. So each of us has to say: not only am I going to vote, I am going to sit with my neighbour\u2019s kids while they vote. I\u2019m going to make sure everybody in my block votes. We don\u2019t exist if we don\u2019t vote! \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Outside the UK, I\u2019m talking about Uefa, the FAs in different countries, they can do better.\u201d The Football Association is likely to ask Spurs for their observations after missiles were thrown at Kepa Arrizabalaga, Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper. The toxic atmosphere in the stands dragged attention away from a fine performance from Chelsea, who sealed the win with two first-half goals from Willian. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, you know?\u201d the winger said. \u201cWe have to find the solution to stop this kind of thing. I think the people that did this to Toni have to not be in every stadium. I think they will have to find a solution to stop. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see this situation. We are there, we are inside the pitch to do our job and to do our best. It\u2019s difficult when these situations happen. The players have to stay concentrated and leave the decision to the referee and we did it.\u201d",

Thumbs: Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most retro of all, as far as my guests are concerned, is the fruit content \u2013 as well as chutney, the sauce boasts apple and sultanas, the last of which, in conjunction with curry powder, instantly transports us back a couple of culinary decades. Not in a bad way, you understand; this is pure nostalgic pleasure, but we agree we\u2019d like something a little bit zingier to shake our palates out of their festive comfort blankets.</p> <h2>The almond one</h2> <p>The second recipe comes from another national treasure \u2013 <a href=\"https://lady.co.uk/mary-berry%E2%80%99s-carefree-christmas\" title=\"\">the turkey korma</a> in Mary Berry\u2019s [rival] Christmas Collection deploys a few more spices (cumin, coriander, garam masala and cardamom, as well as fresh ginger), and features a sauce thickened with coconut cream and ground almonds, rather than flour, but also, intriguingly, contains green grapes. Again, it\u2019s a crowdpleaser, yet not quite enough to rouse our tastebuds from their seasonal carb and cream coma. \u201cLike a nice warm bath,\u201d one tester says. Everyone (apart from the dog) likes warm baths, but personally I prefer them hot.</p> <h2>The coconutty one</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"79b616a5648ad1ac13397978b8627cf837a15a21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79b616a5648ad1ac13397978b8627cf837a15a21/0_420_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Packed full of aromatics and spice\u2019: Olivia Potts\u2019 turkey curry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Packed full of aromatics and spice\u2019: Olivia Potts\u2019 turkey curry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One Tweeter, Richard Doxon, tells me that he made an \u201camazing\u201d Anjum Anand turkey curry in 2010, but, tragically, the relevant copy of Sainsbury\u2019s magazine disappeared into the recycling bin along with the recipe. Thanks to the magic of social media, however, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SainsburysMag/status/1192036228180447232/photo/1\" title=\"\">he has now been reunited with it</a> \u2013 and I get to try it for the first time. Anand prefaces this \u201cflavourful but not spicy\u201d curry by noting that roughly a fifth of Kerala\u2019s population celebrates Christmas, though she admits turkey doesn\u2019t tend to feature on the menu there. It is indeed flavourful, featuring a masala made from fennel seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves, as well as mustard seeds, curry leaves, garlic, fresh ginger, turmeric and coriander, all in a coconut milk and tomato gravy, so it seems a shame to dilute these wonderfully aromatic ingredients with a pint of coconut milk at the end. Because the meat is necessarily just heated through, rather than cooked in the gravy as usual, this kind of curry does need a bit of extra help, whether by reducing the sauce or by adding extra seasoning or stock; a few chillies, as Anand suggests in her introduction, wouldn\u2019t be unwelcome, either, though, of course, this depends on who you\u2019re serving it to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ffa1485dbd2491599b45710a7336e40111777c14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa1485dbd2491599b45710a7336e40111777c14/0_783_2916_2987/976.jpg\" alt=\"Anjum Anand\u2019s turkey curry: \u2018flavourful but not spicy' and gloriously aromatic.\" width=\"976\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anjum Anand\u2019s take on the British Boxing Day favourite is \u2018flavourful but not spicy\u2019, and gloriously aromatic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The yoghurt one</h2> <p>Olivia Potts is a woman after my own heart, introducing <a href=\"https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/recipe-the-perfect-turkey-curry/\" title=\"\">her turkey curry recipe in the Spectator</a> with the observation that, on 27 December, \u201cthe last thing you really want is the same meal you\u2019ve been eating for the past two days, looking a little tired and fridge-worn, all the best bits gone\u201d. But, she says, \u201cforget insipid, tepid, old-fashioned turkey curries: this one is packed full of aromatics and spice; it\u2019s creamy and punchy and golden [with] \u2026 enough spinach to make you feel a little more human after your 25th Quality Street of the festive season.\u201d There\u2019s garam masala and cardamom and fresh ginger, yes, but the blessed warmth of Kashmiri chilli powder, too, plus turkey stock, yoghurt and a great handful of leaves. This one proves very popular with testers: it\u2019s thicker than some of the others, and richer, with a kick of heat and a touch of sweetness from a spoonful of honey \u2013 plus some bonus green stuff to balance out the past four days of reckless self-indulgence.</p> <h2>The stir-fry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"96caf735d38d8e7c02d75e0ed9d6e0c930b0d37a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96caf735d38d8e7c02d75e0ed9d6e0c930b0d37a/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meera Sodha\u2019s turkey curry is \u2018more interesting than your traditional bubble and squeak\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meera Sodha\u2019s spicy turkey curry is \u2018more interesting than your traditional bubble and squeak\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other standout winner of our taste test comes from my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha\" title=\"\">Meera Sodha</a>, who describes her <a href=\"http://meerasodha.com/turkey-curry-with-brussels-caramelised-onions-and-ginger/\" title=\"\">turkey curry with shredded brussels sprouts, caramelised onions and ginger</a> as \u201cmore interesting than your traditional bubble and squeak \u2026 warming, spicy, healthy and tasty\u201d. Leaving aside the vexed question of whether food has to be interesting to be enjoyable, she\u2019s right: the cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg taste pleasingly festive and work brilliantly with the sweetness of the slow-cooked onions. It\u2019s a wake-up for the tastebuds all right, but more like a stir-fry than the others: as one tester says: \u201cMaybe this is me being a bit basic, but it would be nice to have some gravy.\u201d Roast turkey breast can tend towards the dry, however skilfully it\u2019s been prepared, so unless you\u2019re lucky enough to have just dark meat left, a generous sauce is a good thing here.</p> <h2>The tomatoey one</h2> <p>It strikes me, looking at the five curries lined up on the table, that what\u2019s lacking is a tomato-based number of the kind we generally favour at home, albeit with the help of a jar of curry paste rather than Raymond Blanc (and before you carp, he\u2019s been in the UK far longer than I\u2019ve been alive, so if Mary Berry is allowed to make turkey curries, so is he).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.raymondblanc.com/recipes/leftover-turkey-curry-recipe/\" title=\"\">Blanc\u2019s recipe</a> starts with onion and garlic softened in large amounts of butter (so far, so French, I admit), but is then livened up with ginger, red chilli and more of the spices used by Anand and Sodha, as well as coriander and cumin. Most importantly, however, his tomato gravy is slow simmered before the meat is added, which means that it has an intense flavour all of its own; enough, along with Sodha\u2019s version, to convince us that tomato should play a large part in this particular recipe \u2013 if you\u2019ve done Christmas right, you should have already eaten enough beige sauce to last a lifetime, or perhaps just the next 11 months of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d94f2eee0eba4263c175e31fffefe24aaebc36d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d94f2eee0eba4263c175e31fffefe24aaebc36d/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Berry adds grapes to her turkey curry.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Berry adds grapes to her turkey curry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The conclusion</h2> <p>Though culinary traditions are among the most sacred and subjective of all festive matters, if you don\u2019t have a favourite recipe for turkey curry, then this one, richly tomatoey and aromatic, yet creamy enough to have wide appeal, may well be the thing to give your leftovers a new lease of life. The sweet spices used by so many of the recipes above feel apt for the time of year, while the mild chilli heat can be adjusted to taste, depending on your audience. You can even make the base up to the end of the third step in the method several days in advance, then add the turkey, vegetables and dairy when reheating. Not only does this use up roast meat, but any sprouts or other greens you may have hanging around, as well as that half-jug of cream that\u2019s been making eyes at you from the fridge for days. In fact, in the spirit of goodwill to all men, you could even add grapes from the cheeseboard. Just make sure you blame Mary Berry, not me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa59823396bb7c2883512c1329c6625fd8c28f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa59823396bb7c2883512c1329c6625fd8c28f83/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s turkey curry-thon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The results of Felicity Cloake\u2019s turkey curry-thon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Perfect turkey curry</h2> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>55 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4-6</strong></p> <p><strong>50g butter</strong><br><strong>2 tsp cumin seeds</strong><br><strong>1 cinnamon stick</strong><br><strong>2 onions</strong>, finely chopped <br><strong>6 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled <br><strong>40g ginger</strong>, peeled<br><strong>1-2 tsp mild/Kashmiri chilli powder</strong>, to taste<br><strong>\u00bd tsp ground turmeric</strong><br><strong>800g tinned chopped tomatoes</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp tomato puree</strong><br><strong>1 tsp sugar or honey</strong><br><strong>Salt</strong>, to taste<br><strong>1 tsp garam masala</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp double cream or whole-milk yoghurt</strong><br><strong>About 500g roast turkey meat</strong>, roughly chopped or torn<br><strong>10 brussels sprouts</strong>, shredded</p> <p>Over a medium heat, melt the butter in a wide frying pan for which you have a lid, then add a teaspoon of the cumin seeds and the cinnamon stick, and cook for a minute, until aromatic.

Not in a bad way, you understand; this is pure nostalgic pleasure, but we agree we\u2019d like something a little bit zingier to shake our palates out of their festive comfort blankets. The almond one The second recipe comes from another national treasure \u2013 the turkey korma in Mary Berry\u2019s [rival] Christmas Collection deploys a few more spices (cumin, coriander, garam masala and cardamom, as well as fresh ginger), and features a sauce thickened with coconut cream and ground almonds, rather than flour, but also, intriguingly, contains green grapes. Again, it\u2019s a crowdpleaser, yet not quite enough to rouse our tastebuds from their seasonal carb and cream coma. \u201cLike a nice warm bath,\u201d one tester says. Everyone (apart from the dog) likes warm baths, but personally I prefer them hot. The coconutty one One Tweeter, Richard Doxon, tells me that he made an \u201camazing\u201d Anjum Anand turkey curry in 2010, but, tragically, the relevant copy of Sainsbury\u2019s magazine disappeared into the recycling bin along with the recipe. Thanks to the magic of social media, however, he has now been reunited with it \u2013 and I get to try it for the first time. Anand prefaces this \u201cflavourful but not spicy\u201d curry by noting that roughly a fifth of Kerala\u2019s population celebrates Christmas, though she admits turkey doesn\u2019t tend to feature on the menu there. It is indeed flavourful, featuring a masala made from fennel seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves, as well as mustard seeds, curry leaves, garlic, fresh ginger, turmeric and coriander, all in a coconut milk and tomato gravy, so it seems a shame to dilute these wonderfully aromatic ingredients with a pint of coconut milk at the end. Because the meat is necessarily just heated through, rather than cooked in the gravy as usual, this kind of curry does need a bit of extra help, whether by reducing the sauce or by adding extra seasoning or stock; a few chillies, as Anand suggests in her introduction, wouldn\u2019t be unwelcome, either, though, of course, this depends on who you\u2019re serving it to. The yoghurt one Olivia Potts is a woman after my own heart, introducing her turkey curry recipe in the Spectator with the observation that, on 27 December, \u201cthe last thing you really want is the same meal you\u2019ve been eating for the past two days, looking a little tired and fridge-worn, all the best bits gone\u201d. But, she says, \u201cforget insipid, tepid, old-fashioned turkey curries: this one is packed full of aromatics and spice; it\u2019s creamy and punchy and golden [with] \u2026 enough spinach to make you feel a little more human after your 25th Quality Street of the festive season.\u201d There\u2019s garam masala and cardamom and fresh ginger, yes, but the blessed warmth of Kashmiri chilli powder, too, plus turkey stock, yoghurt and a great handful of leaves. This one proves very popular with testers: it\u2019s thicker than some of the others, and richer, with a kick of heat and a touch of sweetness from a spoonful of honey \u2013 plus some bonus green stuff to balance out the past four days of reckless self-indulgence. The stir-fry The other standout winner of our taste test comes from my colleague Meera Sodha, who describes her turkey curry with shredded brussels sprouts, caramelised onions and ginger as \u201cmore interesting than your traditional bubble and squeak \u2026 warming, spicy, healthy and tasty\u201d. Leaving aside the vexed question of whether food has to be interesting to be enjoyable, she\u2019s right: the cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg taste pleasingly festive and work brilliantly with the sweetness of the slow-cooked onions. It\u2019s a wake-up for the tastebuds all right, but more like a stir-fry than the others: as one tester says: \u201cMaybe this is me being a bit basic, but it would be nice to have some gravy.\u201d Roast turkey breast can tend towards the dry, however skilfully it\u2019s been prepared, so unless you\u2019re lucky enough to have just dark meat left, a generous sauce is a good thing here. The tomatoey one It strikes me, looking at the five curries lined up on the table, that what\u2019s lacking is a tomato-based number of the kind we generally favour at home, albeit with the help of a jar of curry paste rather than Raymond Blanc (and before you carp, he\u2019s been in the UK far longer than I\u2019ve been alive, so if Mary Berry is allowed to make turkey curries, so is he). Blanc\u2019s recipe starts with onion and garlic softened in large amounts of butter (so far, so French, I admit), but is then livened up with ginger, red chilli and more of the spices used by Anand and Sodha, as well as coriander and cumin. Most importantly, however, his tomato gravy is slow simmered before the meat is added, which means that it has an intense flavour all of its own; enough, along with Sodha\u2019s version, to convince us that tomato should play a large part in this particular recipe \u2013 if you\u2019ve done Christmas right, you should have already eaten enough beige sauce to last a lifetime, or perhaps just the next 11 months of it. The conclusion Though culinary traditions are among the most sacred and subjective of all festive matters, if you don\u2019t have a favourite recipe for turkey curry, then this one, richly tomatoey and aromatic, yet creamy enough to have wide appeal, may well be the thing to give your leftovers a new lease of life. The sweet spices used by so many of the recipes above feel apt for the time of year, while the mild chilli heat can be adjusted to taste, depending on your audience. You can even make the base up to the end of the third step in the method several days in advance, then add the turkey, vegetables and dairy when reheating. Not only does this use up roast meat, but any sprouts or other greens you may have hanging around, as well as that half-jug of cream that\u2019s been making eyes at you from the fridge for days. In fact, in the spirit of goodwill to all men, you could even add grapes from the cheeseboard. Just make sure you blame Mary Berry, not me. Perfect turkey curry Prep 15 min Cook 55 min Serves 4-6 50g butter 2 tsp cumin seeds 1 cinnamon stick 2 onions, finely chopped 6 garlic cloves, peeled 40g ginger, peeled 1-2 tsp mild/Kashmiri chilli powder, to taste \u00bd tsp ground turmeric 800g tinned chopped tomatoes 2 tbsp tomato puree 1 tsp sugar or honey Salt, to taste 1 tsp garam masala 3 tbsp double cream or whole-milk yoghurt About 500g roast turkey meat, roughly chopped or torn 10 brussels sprouts, shredded Over a medium heat, melt the butter in a wide frying pan for which you have a lid, then add a teaspoon of the cumin seeds and the cinnamon stick, and cook for a minute, until aromatic. Add the onions, turn down the heat and cook, stirring occasionally to make sure they don\u2019t catch and burn, until soft, golden and beginning to caramelise. Meanwhile, pound the remaining cumin seeds to a powder, then set aside. Pound the garlic and ginger to a rough paste and stir these into the pan once the onions are ready. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the ground cumin, chilli powder and turmeric. Fry, stirring, for another two minutes, then pour in the chopped tomatoes and tomato puree. Scrape any solids off the base of the pan, stir in the sugar and a good pinch of salt, bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat slightly and leave to bubble gently for about 20 minutes, until thickened. Stir in the garam masala and cream, then add the turkey, cover the pan and leave to cook for about 10 minutes, until it has heated through. Stir in the shredded sprouts, put the lid back on the pan and cook for about three minutes, until wilted. Taste for seasoning, then serve. \u2022 Curry or pie, salad or sandwich: what\u2019s your favourite recipe for Christmas leftovers, turkey or otherwise? And do you find yourself tending more towards nostalgic flavours such as old-fashioned \u201ccurry powder\u201d at Christmas, however maverick you might pride yourself on being for the rest of the year?",

      "body": "<p>There were regrets, maybes, could-have-beens but ultimately, neither camp could have much cause for complaint. Schalke and their supporters didn\u2019t get their ultimate Christmas present of finishing above Borussia Dortmund. \u201cIt\u2019s not Walt Disney,\u201d reflected David Wagner, \u201cand you don\u2019t always get what you deserve.\u201d Christian Streich, Wagner\u2019s opposite number at Freiburg, sat a couple of feet across from him at the post-match press conference reflecting on what could have been as well. \u201cSchalke could have won,\u201d he said, \u201cor we could have won 3-1.

The level of progression under Wagner who arrived as a realist, knowing the club with its expectations and recent troubles intimately, has been striking.</p> \n<p>The high point of the first half of 2019 had \u2013 naturally \u2013 been victory over BVB, a 4-2 win at Westfalen which just about read the last rites to their title bid. In that sense it was as enjoyable as a <em>Derby-Sieg</em> might ever be, but in another way it simply underlined how far <em>die K\u00f6nigsblauen\u2019s</em> hopes had fallen. Schalke had gone from pursuing ambition to searching for schadenfreude in less than a season, left to pick a few bones of comfort out of a shell of a campaign.</p> \n<p>Wagner has given the club and its supporters their pride back, just nine months on from the 7-0 annihilation at Manchester City that precipitated the exit of Domenico Tedesco. The former Huddersfield manager has been an arm around the shoulder to a squad coming off a traumatic season last time around, and has often found a way where there has seemed to be none, like here when he brought in Rabbi Matondo and Benito Raman to add speed to the attack. Wagner would love a new striker this winter and it would be hard to begrudge him his holiday gift, having already got so much more out of existing players such as Matondo and opening goalscorer Suat Serdar, who has begun to fulfil his promise after a painfully slow start.</p> \n<p>The heartbreaking end to Freiburg\u2019s midweek confrontation with Bayern, which they could have won but ended up losing after two late goals from the champions \u2013 and that, certainly, was a greater regret than any shortfall from their trip to Gelsenkirchen \u2013 still stuck in the craw. This, after coming from a goal down, helped them to get over it.

Leipzig were crowned <em>Herbstmeister</em> \u2013 autumn champions \u2013 for the first time and they had to work for it. They trailed in-form Augsburg at half-time via Florian Niederlechner but stuck to their guns, and goals from Konrad Lainer, Patrik Schick and Yussuf Poulsen did the job after the break. The versatility Julian Nagelsmann is giving them is clearer at every turn; here, they showed patience. \u201cI\u2019m glad the boys have kept pulling together and we\u2019ve done a good job in all three competitions,\u201d said the coach of his side, who also have a fascinating two-legged tie with Tottenham to look forward to.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u2022 There\u2019s no doubt about Bayern\u2019s man of the week in the closing days of the Hinrunde. Eighteen-year-old Joshua Zirkzee, three days after saving the <em>Rekordmeister\u2019s </em>bacon with his first touch at Freiburg to score and snatch a win, did the same again after coming on against an excellent Wolfsburg on Saturday at Allianz Arena, with an emphatic finish from Thomas M\u00fcller\u2019s pass. As in the Black Forest, Serge Gnabry then applied a bit of gloss to the score in stoppage time.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s sensational first half of the campaign ended in underwhelming fashion with a goalless draw at Hertha, despite a sizeable away following. \u201cIf someone had offered us this before the start of the season, we definitely would have taken it,\u201d said Matthias Ginter, with some understatement.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Dortmund remain perhaps the biggest conundrum of the<em> Hinrunde</em>. They dominated and looked comfortable in Friday\u2019s game at Hoffenheim after Mario G\u00f6tze gave them the lead. Then, after letting a series of chances come and go, they conceded two very avoidable goals to Sargis Adamyan and Andrej Kramari\u0107 in the last 12 minutes to leave plenty to reflect on. Lucien Favre, who might make up part of that reflection, bemoaned his side making things \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d Without change at some level, BVB\u2019s second half of the season promises to be a deflating one.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Hope springs eternal at the bottom, though. K\u00f6ln won a third straight game \u2013 albeit a little fortunately \u2013 against Werder Bremen to exit the relegation zone and leave Florian Kohfeldt\u2019s team in it. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf bought themselves some breathing space thanks to Erik Thommy\u2019s late rocket against Union, and bottom side Paderborn are back in touch after a deserved 2-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt, who are being dragged into a scrap themselves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "There were regrets, maybes, could-have-beens but ultimately, neither camp could have much cause for complaint. Schalke and their supporters didn\u2019t get their ultimate Christmas present of finishing above Borussia Dortmund. \u201cIt\u2019s not Walt Disney,\u201d reflected David Wagner, \u201cand you don\u2019t always get what you deserve.\u201d Christian Streich, Wagner\u2019s opposite number at Freiburg, sat a couple of feet across from him at the post-match press conference reflecting on what could have been as well. \u201cSchalke could have won,\u201d he said, \u201cor we could have won 3-1. It was a great game.\u201d So while there were minor grumbles \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t yearn for a bit of Disney at Christmas? \u2013 that from Freiburg\u2019s perspective mainly centred on not holding a 2-1 lead in the last 10 minutes, a point apiece seemed a decent reward for two teams who have enhanced the Bundesliga, and their own reputations, this season. Schalke might not have managed victory in their last home game before the Winterpause but they go into it level on points with their spluttering arch-rivals and kept from taking a place in the top four from them only by goal difference. The level of progression under Wagner who arrived as a realist, knowing the club with its expectations and recent troubles intimately, has been striking. The high point of the first half of 2019 had \u2013 naturally \u2013 been victory over BVB, a 4-2 win at Westfalen which just about read the last rites to their title bid. In that sense it was as enjoyable as a Derby-Sieg might ever be, but in another way it simply underlined how far die K\u00f6nigsblauen\u2019s hopes had fallen. Schalke had gone from pursuing ambition to searching for schadenfreude in less than a season, left to pick a few bones of comfort out of a shell of a campaign. Wagner has given the club and its supporters their pride back, just nine months on from the 7-0 annihilation at Manchester City that precipitated the exit of Domenico Tedesco. The former Huddersfield manager has been an arm around the shoulder to a squad coming off a traumatic season last time around, and has often found a way where there has seemed to be none, like here when he brought in Rabbi Matondo and Benito Raman to add speed to the attack. Wagner would love a new striker this winter and it would be hard to begrudge him his holiday gift, having already got so much more out of existing players such as Matondo and opening goalscorer Suat Serdar, who has begun to fulfil his promise after a painfully slow start. The heartbreaking end to Freiburg\u2019s midweek confrontation with Bayern, which they could have won but ended up losing after two late goals from the champions \u2013 and that, certainly, was a greater regret than any shortfall from their trip to Gelsenkirchen \u2013 still stuck in the craw. This, after coming from a goal down, helped them to get over it. Badische Zeitung wrote about the team\u2019s \u201cballs of steel\u201d and it felt like that as they held their nerve to come back from a half-time deficit to lead with a pair of penalties, one from Nils Petersen and the other from Vincenzo Grifo. The latter showed particular guts to Panenka his effort past goalkeeper Markus Schubert, standing in for the banned Alexander N\u00fcbel, in front of a whistling Nordkurve. Die Breisgauer still hold that underdog mentality, despite pushing towards Europe and getting ready to move to a new \u20ac80m, 35,000-capacity stadium next season. \u201cInternally, we\u2019re totally ambitious,\u201d sporting director Jochen Saier told Sky. \u201cWe want to get the most out of this season, but we are still looking down. You know how tight it is, but it is our DNA anyway.\u201d The sense of breaking new ground was reinforced by Petersen\u2019s goal, equalling Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s club record goalscoring mark. Schalke\u2019s position, enhanced by teenage substitute Ahmed Kutucu\u2019s well-struck late equaliser, should take the edge off other concerns, led by the club\u2019s confirmation that N\u00fcbel will leave when his contract expires at the end of the season, a familiar scenario that could become even more so if he took the well-trodden path to Bayern Munich. \u201cWe respect his decision,\u201d said sporting director Jochen Schneider on N\u00fcbel in a press release, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have to understand it.\u201d Their need to feel in the mix will be satisfied straight after the holidays, bringing up the curtain to the R\u00fcckrunde in style when the Bundesliga resumes, against high-flying Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.

      "bodyText": "In 2012, writer Thomas Chatterton Williams \u2013 a biracial African American expatriate living in Paris \u2013 took to the New York Times op-ed page to declare that not only do \u201cmixed-race blacks have an ethical obligation to identify as black\u201d, but that interracial couples \u201cshare a similar moral imperative to inculcate certain ideas of black heritage and racial identity in their mixed-race children, regardless of how they look\u201d. Williams argued that embracing a black identity served as a form of solidarity between biracial African Americans such as himself and those with darker skin. \u201cAnd so I will teach my children that they, too, are black \u2013 regardless of what anyone else may say \u2013 so long as they remember and wish to be,\u201d he concluded. Then everything changed: he and his wife, a white French woman, had their daughter Marlow. As Williams held Marlow, he took in her blonde hair and blue eyes and his conception of America\u2019s strict racial dichotomy between black and white started to collapse before him. He began to see racial categories as an obstacle to social progress. Eventually, he came to see himself as an \u201cex-black man\u201d. What\u2019s more, he suggests that the rest of us may be better off if we shed our racial labels as well. Williams chronicled this journey in his recent book Self-Portrait in Black and White: Unlearning Race, which challenges us to think beyond America\u2019s racial binaries. The reaction to the book from many of the author\u2019s critics has been unfortunate but predictable. While the left has in recent years sought to unsettle gender categories \u2013 noting that gender is a spectrum and that the binary does not fit all people \u2013 they have circled the wagons even tighter around the sanctity of exclusionary racial categories. While Williams believes it\u2019s a \u201cmistake for any of us to reify something that is as demonstrably harmful as it is fictitious,\u201d Ismail Muhammad, writing in The Nation, argues that \u201cno matter how socially constructed racial identities are, our lived experiences of those identities \u2013 the cultures, communities, values, prejudices, policies, and socioeconomic obstacles that follow from inhabiting social constructs \u2013 is anything but fictitious and cannot simply be willed out of existence.\u201d Furthermore, Muhammad argues, Chatterton Williams \u201cfails to see how racial identification \u2026 can also be an empowering act.\u201d But must our empowerment be tied to skin or blood? As Williams argued at an event I attended in October, when we Americans talk about race, we\u2019re often confusing it for another category, such as culture or social class. Discarding race doesn\u2019t mean discarding the rich cultural achievements or shared values of human beings we have spent centuries labeling \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d. Culture and values are things that humans create and celebrate together, and there is no reason for these qualities to be defined by the amount of melanin in our skin. In my college years I befriended a professor who was a tall white man with a thick beard who had converted to Islam years ago during a decade-long stay in South Asia.

Unlearning race doesn\u2019t mean ignoring racism. Too many Americans continue to discriminate against each other on the basis of skin color, and persistent inequality is a feature of American life. In response, we can and must adopt social policy approaches aimed at spreading opportunity far and wide to every corner of society, without adopting the fiction that people are defined by their race. Some would argue that while Chatterton Williams is right on the merits, his proposal to discard race is hopelessly naive.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThis is <em>the</em> game,\u201d Pablo Mach\u00edn said but things weren\u2019t going as planned, his weekend beginning badly and ending worse. Storm Fabien hit Spain, blowing through at 100km an hour, and east of Madrid an overhead cable came down, leaving him and his team trapped inside a train. Meanwhile, about the same time Espanyol were stuck in Guadalajara, pleading in vain for the league to delay the following morning\u2019s kick off, Mach\u00edn\u2019s opponent was sitting with his feet up in front of the telly at home, the day\u2019s problems slipping away. Which wasn\u2019t the way Legan\u00e9s manager Javier Aguirre planned it either but, like almost everything he\u2019s doing, it worked.</p> \n<p>\u201cChance,\u201d he called it, which it wasn\u2019t. Virtually none of it is, however much he likes to portray it that way. \u201cThe weather was worse yesterday, it was raining, horrible,\u201d Aguirre explained on Sunday as he looked back on the last session before the biggest match of the season \u2013 bottom against second-bottom. \u201cA final for the dethroned,\u201d AS called it, while Marca went for \u201cHunger Games\u201d and El Mundo Deportivo declared it \u201clife or death\u201d. \u201cWe trained awfully: awful, awful, awful,\u201d Aguirre continued, \u201cso I had two options: let it go, or really lay into them. I held off for a bit. I went home, watched Valladolid, made myself a gin and tonic, nice and cosy, and I completely forgot to lay into them. And look: it turned out nice.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/bayern-munich-appoint-hansi-flick-end-of-season-bundesliga\">Flick to stay as Bayern head coach until end of season, Real Madrid slip up</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Very nice. In a game that kicked off as planned in wind that turned plastic bags into kites and had balls deciding they didn\u2019t want to go that way after all, Legan\u00e9s had just beaten Espanyol 2-0 with two wonderful goals. Martin Braithwaite scored the first with a brilliant flick, turn and finish; Youssef En-Nesyri the second, finishing of a sharp move built by K\u00e9vin Rodrigues and Braithwaite. At the final whistle, Butarque rose to applaud before breaking into a chant: \u201cYes, we can!\u201d They can too. That at least is the belief now \u2013 and belief is the word.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still in the hole,\u201d Aguirre said afterwards, but it could be worse: they could be where they were the day he came. At his presentation as Legan\u00e9s manager, the club\u2019s technical secretary Txema Indias said they found themselves in a \u201cvery, very, very complicated situation\u201d and he could say that again. In fact, he did, about 30 seconds later. It was early November and Legan\u00e9s had won just once in 12, scored only six goals, kept a solitary clean sheet, sat bottom, and were six points from safety having picked up five points all season. Oh, and their next three games were Real Sociedad, Barcelona <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/11/julen-lopetegui-sevilla-real-betis-la-liga-seville-derby\">and Sevilla</a>. They\u2019d sacked Mauricio Pellegrino but coaches had turned them down, convinced they were relegated already. Hope had gone a third of the way through the season.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to clear the rubbish from the players\u2019 heads,\u201d Aguirre said that day. Six weeks on he has done, sweeping it away swiftly. It is startling how easily he has won them over, how little it takes for players to fall under his spell. For <em>people</em> to. Full disclosure here: journalists too find it hard not to be drawn towards him, a depth and directness to the way he talks, responding to everyone by name, an enthusiasm and a willingness to engage, to break from platitudes and cliche.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a59476aeab698297dc2cb24db01626cee59e70aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a59476aeab698297dc2cb24db01626cee59e70aa/0_149_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"K\u00e9vin Rodrigues challenges Espanyol\u2019s Esteban Granero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">K\u00e9vin Rodrigues challenges Espanyol\u2019s Esteban Granero.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A Perez Meca/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His press conferences are a show, but they do not feel like it is for show; rather, they feel more real, honest, a glimpse of the way he is with everyone. \u201cWhat you see is exactly what he is,\u201d one friend insists. If anyone proves that swearing <em>is</em> big and <em>is</em> clever, it is Aguirre: charismatic and entertainingly sweary, <em>cabrones</em>, <em>carambas</em> and <em>chinga madres</em> cluttering his speech. He\u2019s the coach who used a press conference to graphically <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pNRYWTTquA\">explain the difference between a Spanish up yours and Mexican one</a> and in another defended himself after being sent off for calling the referee a son of a bitch by protesting \u201cthat\u2019s the way I talk\u201d. He then proved it by rattling through the swearwords as if he was against the clock on some pottymouthed game show. He\u2019s also the coach who rescued Espanyol and Real Zaragoza, took Osasuna to a barely believable Champions League qualification and who, in Marca\u2019s words this morning, has now performed another \u201cmiracle\u201d south of Madrid.</p> \n<p>Aguirre has made Legan\u00e9s more aggressive, defensively strong, direct, the structure simpler. Training is more intense and he\u2019s always demanding more. It\u2019s not always the prettiest \u2013 \u201cIf only we could play better,\u201d he said \u2013 but he has trusted in Braithwaite, \u00d3scar, En-Nesyri, Roque Mesa, his ball players, and insists that his \u201cstyle\u201d is just to \u201cget points\u201d. Rodrigues came in on the left side of a back five while Jonathan Silva, who had played there before, moved inside. Rodrigues had started just once before Aguirre came; in the four starts since, he has scored one, provided two and been sent off. Meanwhile, Silva has been superb as a centre-back. Not that Aguirre claims credit: \u201c[Dimitris] Siovas got injured and we put him in\u201d, he laughed. \u201cHe\u2019d barely warmed up, he came on and he played spectacularly.\u201d En-Nesyri said he would not celebrate scoring any goals until there was a reason to celebrate, some hope. Scoring at all would be a start \u2013 he had just one beforehand \u2013 and he soon got that. Under Aguirre, he has scored three in five. Braithwaite has scored in the last two games. Mesa and \u00d3scar are performing either side of Rub\u00e9n P\u00e9rez.</p> \n<p>Mostly, it is in their minds. \u201cIf they don\u2019t believe, we\u2019re going nowhere,\u201d Aguirre said, while midfielder Jos\u00e9 Recio said some players had \u201cbirdies in the heads.\u201d That is where Aguirre is an expert. If the demands increased dramatically \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re working like animals\u201d \u2013 so did the attempts to build them up. One on one conversations began from the start; group therapy went with it. \u201cI see confidence that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re bottom, you\u2019ve only got five points, you lose faith in yourself. You start to think: \u2018I\u2019m worthless\u2019, \u2018<em>another</em> defeat\u2019. Players doubt themselves, teammates, everything. That\u2019s normal, understandable.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis is the game,\u201d Pablo Mach\u00edn said but things weren\u2019t going as planned, his weekend beginning badly and ending worse. Storm Fabien hit Spain, blowing through at 100km an hour, and east of Madrid an overhead cable came down, leaving him and his team trapped inside a train. Meanwhile, about the same time Espanyol were stuck in Guadalajara, pleading in vain for the league to delay the following morning\u2019s kick off, Mach\u00edn\u2019s opponent was sitting with his feet up in front of the telly at home, the day\u2019s problems slipping away. Which wasn\u2019t the way Legan\u00e9s manager Javier Aguirre planned it either but, like almost everything he\u2019s doing, it worked. \u201cChance,\u201d he called it, which it wasn\u2019t. Virtually none of it is, however much he likes to portray it that way. \u201cThe weather was worse yesterday, it was raining, horrible,\u201d Aguirre explained on Sunday as he looked back on the last session before the biggest match of the season \u2013 bottom against second-bottom. \u201cA final for the dethroned,\u201d AS called it, while Marca went for \u201cHunger Games\u201d and El Mundo Deportivo declared it \u201clife or death\u201d. \u201cWe trained awfully: awful, awful, awful,\u201d Aguirre continued, \u201cso I had two options: let it go, or really lay into them. I held off for a bit. I went home, watched Valladolid, made myself a gin and tonic, nice and cosy, and I completely forgot to lay into them. And look: it turned out nice.\u201d Very nice. In a game that kicked off as planned in wind that turned plastic bags into kites and had balls deciding they didn\u2019t want to go that way after all, Legan\u00e9s had just beaten Espanyol 2-0 with two wonderful goals. Martin Braithwaite scored the first with a brilliant flick, turn and finish; Youssef En-Nesyri the second, finishing of a sharp move built by K\u00e9vin Rodrigues and Braithwaite. At the final whistle, Butarque rose to applaud before breaking into a chant: \u201cYes, we can!\u201d They can too. That at least is the belief now \u2013 and belief is the word. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the hole,\u201d Aguirre said afterwards, but it could be worse: they could be where they were the day he came. At his presentation as Legan\u00e9s manager, the club\u2019s technical secretary Txema Indias said they found themselves in a \u201cvery, very, very complicated situation\u201d and he could say that again. In fact, he did, about 30 seconds later. It was early November and Legan\u00e9s had won just once in 12, scored only six goals, kept a solitary clean sheet, sat bottom, and were six points from safety having picked up five points all season. Oh, and their next three games were Real Sociedad, Barcelona and Sevilla. They\u2019d sacked Mauricio Pellegrino but coaches had turned them down, convinced they were relegated already. Hope had gone a third of the way through the season. \u201cI\u2019m here to clear the rubbish from the players\u2019 heads,\u201d Aguirre said that day. Six weeks on he has done, sweeping it away swiftly. It is startling how easily he has won them over, how little it takes for players to fall under his spell. For people to. Full disclosure here: journalists too find it hard not to be drawn towards him, a depth and directness to the way he talks, responding to everyone by name, an enthusiasm and a willingness to engage, to break from platitudes and cliche. His press conferences are a show, but they do not feel like it is for show; rather, they feel more real, honest, a glimpse of the way he is with everyone. \u201cWhat you see is exactly what he is,\u201d one friend insists. If anyone proves that swearing is big and is clever, it is Aguirre: charismatic and entertainingly sweary, cabrones, carambas and chinga madres cluttering his speech. He\u2019s the coach who used a press conference to graphically explain the difference between a Spanish up yours and Mexican one and in another defended himself after being sent off for calling the referee a son of a bitch by protesting \u201cthat\u2019s the way I talk\u201d. He then proved it by rattling through the swearwords as if he was against the clock on some pottymouthed game show. He\u2019s also the coach who rescued Espanyol and Real Zaragoza, took Osasuna to a barely believable Champions League qualification and who, in Marca\u2019s words this morning, has now performed another \u201cmiracle\u201d south of Madrid. Aguirre has made Legan\u00e9s more aggressive, defensively strong, direct, the structure simpler. Training is more intense and he\u2019s always demanding more. It\u2019s not always the prettiest \u2013 \u201cIf only we could play better,\u201d he said \u2013 but he has trusted in Braithwaite, \u00d3scar, En-Nesyri, Roque Mesa, his ball players, and insists that his \u201cstyle\u201d is just to \u201cget points\u201d. Rodrigues came in on the left side of a back five while Jonathan Silva, who had played there before, moved inside. Rodrigues had started just once before Aguirre came; in the four starts since, he has scored one, provided two and been sent off. Meanwhile, Silva has been superb as a centre-back. Not that Aguirre claims credit: \u201c[Dimitris] Siovas got injured and we put him in\u201d, he laughed. \u201cHe\u2019d barely warmed up, he came on and he played spectacularly.\u201d En-Nesyri said he would not celebrate scoring any goals until there was a reason to celebrate, some hope. Scoring at all would be a start \u2013 he had just one beforehand \u2013 and he soon got that. Under Aguirre, he has scored three in five. Braithwaite has scored in the last two games. Mesa and \u00d3scar are performing either side of Rub\u00e9n P\u00e9rez. Mostly, it is in their minds. \u201cIf they don\u2019t believe, we\u2019re going nowhere,\u201d Aguirre said, while midfielder Jos\u00e9 Recio said some players had \u201cbirdies in the heads.\u201d That is where Aguirre is an expert. If the demands increased dramatically \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re working like animals\u201d \u2013 so did the attempts to build them up. One on one conversations began from the start; group therapy went with it. \u201cI see confidence that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re bottom, you\u2019ve only got five points, you lose faith in yourself. You start to think: \u2018I\u2019m worthless\u2019, \u2018another defeat\u2019. Players doubt themselves, teammates, everything. That\u2019s normal, understandable. I haven\u2019t got a magic wand. All I did was try to make them see that they could compete. Look in the mirror, look at what you\u2019re doing in training, how can it be that you don\u2019t dare to try a 40m pass, or a dribble, or come for a cross? What I see now is a team that\u2019s strong, that dares.\u201d In his first game, that team drew 1-1 with Real Sociedad. Next, they were unlucky to lose 2-1 to Barcelona, having taken a 1-0 lead. And then a single goal beat them in Sevilla. That might have sunk them, but something had shifted. \u201cWe\u2019ve competed in every game, even when we lost,\u201d Aguirre insists. They went 3-0 up against Celta and although the Galicians came back to 3-2 - \u201cI was shitting myself,\u201d he said \u2013 they held on. At Alav\u00e9s, the plan was to go in 0-0 at half-time, \u201cbut those bastards didn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d and instead they led 1-0. It took an 81st-minute goal with more than a hint of handball to deny them victory. And now a 2-0 win that puts them three points ahead of Espanyol, whose manager probably won\u2019t make it through Christmas. Defeated in the game, Mach\u00edn could be gone within the week. Legan\u00e9s are still not out of the relegation zone, but safety is only two points off, while catching Eibar, Alav\u00e9s and Valladolid suddenly seems possible, hope appearing where there was none. Valladolid are up next after Christmas and Butarque felt different on Sunday, players departing on holiday happy. \u201cWe know that this won\u2019t happen straight away but the key is we feel capable of getting out now,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThe attitude has changed.

      "body": "<p>Richard Osman is the quiz master. The 49-year-old started his career behind the scenes, working on TV shows such as <em>Deal </em><em>Or No Deal</em> and <em>The Million Pound Drop</em>. He moved in front of the camera in 2009 as the co-host of <em>Pointless</em> and since 2017 he has racked up more than 100 episodes as presenter of <em>Richard Osman\u2019s House of Games</em> on BBC Two. <em>House of Games</em> pits four celebrities in a series of eclectic, ever-changing challenges over five weeknights. Many of the games involve wordplay and most are ingeniously silly (one has the contestants answer questions set by the children of the regular question writers: \u201cDoes Anthony like bananas?\u201d for example). The quiz has become a book of the same name and here Osman explains why no Christmas is complete without a quiz.</p> <p><strong>What is the role of games and quizzes around Christmas?</strong><br>Well, there are many ways to fall out over Christmas. Especially in the world as it is today, there are many things to argue about, so I think games and quizzes are sort of organised arguing. They are arguing that doesn\u2019t end with people throwing leftover Christmas dinner at each other.</p> <p><strong>Are games and quizzes a particularly British thing? It\u2019s hard to imagine French people doing it in the same way\u2026</strong><br>Oh, that\u2019s a very good question. My knowledge of French Christmas games, I\u2019m afraid, is lacking. We know that Americans love a quiz and Trivial Pursuit was Canadian, I think. But everyone loves a quiz, everyone loves a silly little game.

My thing always with a quiz is you want to play against somebody who is <em>almost</em> as clever as you. Someone who you win against about 52% of the time, so it\u2019s always going to be a good game but, if you play your best, you should win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/quiz-the-guardian-general-election-campaign-trivia-quiz\">Quiz: the ludicrous general election campaign trivia quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Do you have a favourite festive game?</strong><br>Oh, I do love a straight Trivial Pursuit.

      "bodyText": "Richard Osman is the quiz master. The 49-year-old started his career behind the scenes, working on TV shows such as Deal Or No Deal and The Million Pound Drop. He moved in front of the camera in 2009 as the co-host of Pointless and since 2017 he has racked up more than 100 episodes as presenter of Richard Osman\u2019s House of Games on BBC Two. House of Games pits four celebrities in a series of eclectic, ever-changing challenges over five weeknights. Many of the games involve wordplay and most are ingeniously silly (one has the contestants answer questions set by the children of the regular question writers: \u201cDoes Anthony like bananas?\u201d for example). The quiz has become a book of the same name and here Osman explains why no Christmas is complete without a quiz. What is the role of games and quizzes around Christmas? Well, there are many ways to fall out over Christmas. Especially in the world as it is today, there are many things to argue about, so I think games and quizzes are sort of organised arguing. They are arguing that doesn\u2019t end with people throwing leftover Christmas dinner at each other. Are games and quizzes a particularly British thing? It\u2019s hard to imagine French people doing it in the same way\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s a very good question. My knowledge of French Christmas games, I\u2019m afraid, is lacking. We know that Americans love a quiz and Trivial Pursuit was Canadian, I think. But everyone loves a quiz, everyone loves a silly little game. I couldn\u2019t speak for our European cousins, and I don\u2019t want something else that divides us from continental Europe, but you can imagine the Germans playing games. The Swedes surely play games. And I can\u2019t imagine a Norwegian Christmas goes by without a game of charades. But why do they particularly appeal to the British? Well, I think that British people are deeply competitive. Also I think British people have a really keen sense of the absurd. And games are the perfect combination of the two.

The video received over 120m views in only five days and redefined what \u201cvirality\u201d meant, with donations towards the cause quickly surging.</p> <p>However, members of Black Twitter were some of the first to criticize Invisible Children, the charity behind the film, for its sources of funding and misleading reporting. The critiques were surprisingly nuanced for a social media space, some citing the call for donations as another incident of \u201cslacktivism\u201d, a term used for low-scale, \u201cfeel-good\u201d displays of charity. Invisible Children\u2019s campaign quickly faded in popularity, and the charity later <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation\">struggled</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation\"> to survive after its viral moment</a>.</p> <p>This would be the power of Black Twitter over the course of the decade \u2013 a diligent, occasionally merciless watchdog for problematic behavior.</p> <p>Calling out cultural appropriation was a chief focus of the space in the early 2010s. Celebrities such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/02/taylor-swift-accused-racism-african-colonial-fantasy-video-wildest-dreams\">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autostraddle.com/katy-perry-continues-scaling-new-heights-of-cultural-appropriation-248415\">Katy Perry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/kendall-jenners-cornrows-stir-controversy-about-cultural-appropriation-on-twitter.676459/\">Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/26/miley-cyrus-twerking-not-working\">Miley Cyrus</a> were critiqued (and roasted) for adopting traditionally black hairstyles and/or dances. Its ability to prevent major business deals would also be flexed. In 2013, Black Twitter\u2019s outrage was largely responsible for corporations ending their affiliations with chef Paula Deen after she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/paula-deen-racist-comments-no-joke\">admitted to using the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/paula-deen-racist-comments-no-joke\">N-word</a>.

      "bodyText": "There is power in numbers. No internet subsection displayed this fact better than Black Twitter, which touched nearly every sphere of American culture and politics this decade. In the 2010s Black Twitter become a cultural force to be reckoned with. It promoted Black Lives Matter and raised awareness around the tragic deaths of Sandra Bland and Eric Garner through hashtags such as #SayHerName and #ICantBreathe. Its anger over Kevin Hart\u2019s homophobic tweets pressured him to drop out as a host for the 2018 Oscars ceremony. It pressured Pepsi to retract and apologize for a Kendall Jenner-fronted commercial accused of co-opting the Black Lives Matter movement. It created hundreds of delightfully viral moments such as \u201ceyebrows on fleek\u201d. And it helped a wild 180-tweet thread \u2013 in which a stripper recounts an adventure-filled road trip to Florida \u2013 become an A24-produced, feature-length film. \u201cI would absolutely say this decade wouldn\u2019t be the same without Black Twitter,\u201d says the UVA professor Meredith D Clark, who is currently writing a book on the internet subsection. \u201cBut I also think it was a continuation of our larger relationship with black American communities. Black culture has been actively mined for hundreds of years for influences on mainstream American culture.\u201d The thrill and intrigue of scrolling through Black Twitter often crossed cultural and racial lines. \u201cAt the risk of getting randomly harshed on by the Internet, I cannot keep quiet about my obsession with Late Night Black People Twitter, an obsession I know some of you other white people share, because it is awesome,\u201d Choire Sicha wrote for The Awl in 2010, before \u201cBlack Twitter\u201d had become the accepted moniker. Defining Black Twitter continues to be difficult. The meaning is slightly amorphous, but it refers to a particular collective of black identities and voices on Twitter taking part in collective, culturally specific jokes and dialogues that affect the community \u2013 from discussing colorism to dishing out jokes about common \u201cblack mom\u201d phrases. The Georgia Tech professor Andr\u00e9 Brock says Black Twitter allowed mainstream, white culture an unprecedented glimpse at how black people talk and joke among each other. \u201cIt was one of the first spaces that white people could see how creative black people are with our discourse, and how we used a technology that wasn\u2019t originally designed for us.\u201d One of the first viral Black Twitter moments of the decade came in response to the documentary Kony 2012, a 30-minute YouTube film that looked at the kidnappings of Ugandan children by a guerrilla group and efforts to find them. The video received over 120m views in only five days and redefined what \u201cvirality\u201d meant, with donations towards the cause quickly surging. However, members of Black Twitter were some of the first to criticize Invisible Children, the charity behind the film, for its sources of funding and misleading reporting. The critiques were surprisingly nuanced for a social media space, some citing the call for donations as another incident of \u201cslacktivism\u201d, a term used for low-scale, \u201cfeel-good\u201d displays of charity. Invisible Children\u2019s campaign quickly faded in popularity, and the charity later struggled to survive after its viral moment. This would be the power of Black Twitter over the course of the decade \u2013 a diligent, occasionally merciless watchdog for problematic behavior. Calling out cultural appropriation was a chief focus of the space in the early 2010s. Celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Kendall Jenner and Miley Cyrus were critiqued (and roasted) for adopting traditionally black hairstyles and/or dances. Its ability to prevent major business deals would also be flexed. In 2013, Black Twitter\u2019s outrage was largely responsible for corporations ending their affiliations with chef Paula Deen after she admitted to using the N-word. Later, a juror from the 2013 George Zimmerman trial lost out on a major book deal when Black Twitter voiced disapproval. Users were able to directly put pressure on the juror\u2019s literary agent, Sharlene Martin. \u201cYou know that the stains from blood money don\u2019t wash off, right?\u201d one user wrote at the time. Here are just some of the celebrities and companies Black Twitter \u201ccancelled\u201d this decade: Roseanne, Pepsi, Meghan McCain, Gucci, Don Lemon, Iggy Azalea, Karamo Brown, Jeffree Star, Jussie Smollett, Kevin Hart, Kanye West, TI, Jay-Z, the NFL, Gina Rodriguez, Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Brown, Matt Damon. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Brock says the litany of \u201ccancellations\u201d that occurred on Black Twitter this decade were not simply rooted in anger and outrage, as media outlets frequently depicted them. They were moments of catharsis. \u201cPeople who have been affronted or hurt or wounded finally had a voice to make gatekeepers take notice,\u201d he says. Clark says the subsection is not a monolith, but actually composed of numerous, small personal communities and networks, which then band together \u201cwhen an incendiary event or something that triggers discussion occurs\u201d. Clark argues the term Black Twitter often led to racial biases (ie, depictions of the group as an \u201cangry mob\u201d) during media coverage. \u201cWhenever you put \u2018black\u2019 in front of anything, people think it\u2019s deviant from what\u2019s mainstream. I think that led to a lot of confusion for folks who were outside of Black Twitter. The term doesn\u2019t necessarily signal the cultural richness we found within the space.\u201d Black Twitter has its roots in the low-tech forums and blogs of the early aughts. Brock says, before 2010, black-centric blogs would try to pressure mainstream media into covering underreported topics, like 2006\u2019s Jena Six case (which saw activists protesting against the excessive charges six black boys faced for beating a white classmate). Lipstick Alley, BlackPlanet, OkayPlayer, Crunk and Disorderly \u2013 these sites were digital watering holes for early black internet users. However, their presence was nowhere near the scale or visibility of Black Twitter. \u201cBlogs couldn\u2019t talk back to media in real time the same way Twitter can,\u201d Brock says. \u201cThat ability to talk back to corporations and media, and for the talk back to be visible is what distinguishes Black Twitter from previous incidents of black communities online.\u201d During the 2010s, Black Twitter would prevent the tragic deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and too many others from being glossed over by news outlets.

      "body": "<p>An extraordinary corporate espionage scandal has deepened at Credit Suisse after the Swiss bank admitted a second executive had been tracked by private detectives.</p> <p>The bank has confirmed that its former head of human resources Peter Goerke was followed for \u201cseveral days\u201d in February this year by private detectives hired on behalf of the bank. This follows the revelation that Iqbal Khan, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/01/credit-suisse-spying-scandal-investigation\">had been chased by investigators through the streets of Zurich</a> in September.</p> <p>Credit Suisse insisted at the time that the Khan incident was a one-off and that its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, had no knowledge of it. However, on Monday it confirmed the second case involving Goerke and once again cleared Thiam of any responsibility.</p> <p> It is understood that the surveillance of Goerke was conducted after he was told he was being <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-to-the-executive-board-201902.html\">bumped off the executive team</a> and demoted to a senior adviser role, which he still holds.</p> <p>The former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e has been blamed by the bank for both incidents. He resigned in October after the Khan incident was uncovered.</p> <p>Khan was trailed for several days in September, shortly after he left the bank for a rival position at UBS. Relations had reportedly soured with Thiam, culminating in a dispute over landscaping at their neighbouring properties on Lake Zurich.</p> <p>Private detectives followed Khan through the streets of Zurich, resulting in an erratic car chase and eventual confrontation.

      "bodyText": "An extraordinary corporate espionage scandal has deepened at Credit Suisse after the Swiss bank admitted a second executive had been tracked by private detectives. The bank has confirmed that its former head of human resources Peter Goerke was followed for \u201cseveral days\u201d in February this year by private detectives hired on behalf of the bank. This follows the revelation that Iqbal Khan, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division, had been chased by investigators through the streets of Zurich in September. Credit Suisse insisted at the time that the Khan incident was a one-off and that its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, had no knowledge of it. However, on Monday it confirmed the second case involving Goerke and once again cleared Thiam of any responsibility. It is understood that the surveillance of Goerke was conducted after he was told he was being bumped off the executive team and demoted to a senior adviser role, which he still holds. The former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e has been blamed by the bank for both incidents. He resigned in October after the Khan incident was uncovered. Khan was trailed for several days in September, shortly after he left the bank for a rival position at UBS. Relations had reportedly soured with Thiam, culminating in a dispute over landscaping at their neighbouring properties on Lake Zurich. Private detectives followed Khan through the streets of Zurich, resulting in an erratic car chase and eventual confrontation. A private security consultant who had helped Bou\u00e9e organise the spying reportedly took his own life after the incident. Bou\u00e9e is understood to have still been receiving some deferred salary payments from Credit Suisse. The bank has taken the additional step of terminating his contract, which will end any payments. The bank launched its own investigation into Goerke\u2019s case following media reports. It has concluded that there was no evidence that Thiam or other members of the board or executive team had any knowledge that Goerke was followed \u201cuntil media reported it\u201d. Urs Rohner, the chairman of the board of directors at Credit Suisse, said: \u201cThe observation of Peter Goerke, which has now been confirmed, is inexcusable. It is of grave concern that the responsible individuals failed to answer truthfully about this observation during the external investigation in September 2019. \u201cWe are aware that the observations of Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke have damaged the reputation of our bank. With the measures that we have put in place, we are sending a clear message that the board of directors firmly rejects a culture of observation.\u201d The lender claimed it was lied to during the investigation into Khan\u2019s case, saying the \u201cindividuals responsible did not respond truthfully\u201d when asked about any other spying cases. It said there were no traces of the case in the bank\u2019s internal systems. Credit Suisse has since apologised to Goerke and said it will continue to cooperate closely with Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator, Finma, which appointed an independent investigator last week to look into the spying cases. The lender insisted that safeguards were already in place to ensure no further spying would take place, including tougher internal policies. However, the bank has not been able to rule out the possibility of discovering other historical spying cases and said its investigation was continuing. Allegations of a third spying case emerged this month. Colleen Graham, another former Credit Suisse executive, has reportedly claimed she was put under surveillance in 2017 during a dispute with the bank. \u201cFurther investigations are being conducted and Credit Suisse will continue to look into any relevant indications,\u201d a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said.",

The prison also brings in cultural crafts to \u201cnurture the sentiments\u201d of inmates and \u201crectify behaviour\u201d. The report last year from ICS showed inmates taking Chinese lessons, playing basketball and calling family members, in a facility decorated with plants and flowers. One detainee from Ghana, sentenced to 14 years for robbery, said prison guards spoke to them \u201cin a civilised way\u201d. The facility\u2019s \u201clabour reform\u201d programme includes five days of work, one day of training or learning, and one day of rest, according to Qingpu\u2019s website. An account from Peter Humphrey, a former journalist and fraud investigator, who was detained at Qingpu for 23 months, contradicts that depiction. Humphrey said he and other foreign inmates were forced to make products for the fashion chains H&amp;M and C&amp;A, among other brands. He told the Guardian he was also denied essential medical treatment. Other well-known foreigners imprisoned there include the Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu and the American entrepreneur Jude Shaw. Li said China\u2019s slowing economy and the trade war with the US had put more pressure on Chinese companies to seek cheaper labour. \u201cWe received more information about prison labour making export products this year than previous years. This may be also due to the trade war where only prison labour can produce orders priced low enough,\u201d Li said. According to the International Labour Organization, prison labour must meet certain requirements including wages and conditions in order to not be classified as forced labour. \u201cCompanies have a responsibility to ensure that their supply chains are ethical and that they\u2019re not profiting for human rights abuse,\u201d said William Nee of Amnesty International. \u201cCompanies should be conducting human rights due diligence to ensure that their supply chains don\u2019t involve forced labour.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

      "body": "<p>It is said that Russia\u2019s imaginative writers are safe from the attentions of President Putin because he believes that literature (unlike TV or the internet) is entirely unimportant. Meanwhile, President Trump\u2019s vision of the US as the world\u2019s greatest nation clearly does not include its greatest writers: was there any presidential response to the deaths of either Philip Roth, last year, or Toni Morrison, more recently? \u2019Twas not ever thus. Duncan White\u2019s new history of writers\u2019 involvement in the cold war, a big book full of grim case studies, is also a weirdly encouraging reminder that literature can unsettle the powerful. In this account of the ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, covering the half-century from the late 1930s to the collapse of the Soviet Union, writers sometimes seem more influential than politicians, spies or generals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Greene ridiculed his country\u2019s intelligence agencies yet was continuing to pass information to them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By \u201cwriters\u201d, White means novelists, poets and playwrights. He shows how prominent authors were influenced by the cold war between west and east, but also, more interestingly, how literature was used in that conflict. His is a history of \u201ccultural warfare\u201d. We start in the crucible of the Spanish civil war, where George Orwell and Arthur Koestler first discover the murderous consequences of political ideals, but also the power of fiction to display these. Orwell\u2019s books, banned in Warsaw Pact states, became weapons in the war of ideologies. When he was trying unsuccessfully to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/legacy-george-orwell-nineteen-eighty-four\" title=\"\"><em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></a> published, the Ministry of Information official who advised Jonathan Cape to refuse Orwell\u2019s novel was in fact a long-standing NKVD agent. It would not be long before the CIA was printing copies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2019/aug/26/animal-farm-catch-22-most-regrettable-rejections-history-publishing\" title=\"\"><em>Animal Farm</em></a> that were light enough to be floated by balloons into eastern Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92bdf584b8d1f8b92701e528fbd47896f29268b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92bdf584b8d1f8b92701e528fbd47896f29268b7/0_0_1964_3000/655.jpg\" alt=\"ANNA AKHMATOVA (1889-1966) Russian poet about 1925.\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Anna Akhmatova was tormented into a show of compliance by the imprisonment of her son in a gulag.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile Koestler, eventually a zealous anti-communist preacher, berating western liberals and leftists for any ambivalence about the Soviet threat, naturally began as a Communist party activist, able to ignore the evidence of persecution and starvation that he saw on a journey through the Soviet Union in 1932. Posing as a pro-Franco journalist in Spain, he spied for the Soviet Union and narrowly escaped execution. When he renounced communism, he wrote his 1940 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/24/darkness-at-noon-original-text-gets-first-english-translation-arthur-koestler\" title=\"\"><em>Darkness at Noon</em></a>, a fictional treatment of Stalin\u2019s purges, which became a bestseller in France after the war.</p> <p>We shift from Spain to the Soviet Union itself, where the best writers were the most suspect. We follow short-story writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/01/odessa-book-lovers-babel-tourists-literary\" title=\"\">Isaac Babel</a>, trying to survive amid the purges and the show trials, \u201cthe compass needle dead on terror\u201d, as the poet Robert Lowell was to put it. It is now possible to reconstruct the narrative of his torture, confession (to \u201cspying\u201d), retraction and perfunctory trial. He was executed in the Lubyanka prison in 1940.</p> <p>White\u2019s narrative method is to base each chapter on the fortunes of one author or pair of authors, but also to switch, from chapter to chapter, between different countries, sometimes different continents. The contrasts are telling. In 1936, while self-consciously leftwing US writers discuss the finer points of ideological commitment at the Congress of American Writers in Manhattan, the Moscow show trials are in full swing. Later, we leave Koestler and Sartre arguing over cold war attitudes at Paris soirees to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/solzhenitsyn\" title=\"\">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a> entering a prison camp in the remote steppes of Kazakhstan, or the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/apr/24/poem-of-the-week-in-the-evening-by-anna-akhmatova\" title=\"\">Anna Akhmatova</a>, tormented into a show of compliance by the imprisonment of her son in a gulag, her best poetry remembered but not even written down.</p> <p>US government agencies also feared the subversive effects of fiction. The House Un-American Activities Committee notoriously targeted Hollywood writers. White devotes a chapter to the communist novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/14/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Howard Fast</a>, whose novel <em>Spartacus</em> was prevented from publication by the FBI on the grounds that it was veiled pro-communist propaganda.

      "bodyText": "It is said that Russia\u2019s imaginative writers are safe from the attentions of President Putin because he believes that literature (unlike TV or the internet) is entirely unimportant. Meanwhile, President Trump\u2019s vision of the US as the world\u2019s greatest nation clearly does not include its greatest writers: was there any presidential response to the deaths of either Philip Roth, last year, or Toni Morrison, more recently? \u2019Twas not ever thus. Duncan White\u2019s new history of writers\u2019 involvement in the cold war, a big book full of grim case studies, is also a weirdly encouraging reminder that literature can unsettle the powerful. In this account of the ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, covering the half-century from the late 1930s to the collapse of the Soviet Union, writers sometimes seem more influential than politicians, spies or generals. By \u201cwriters\u201d, White means novelists, poets and playwrights. He shows how prominent authors were influenced by the cold war between west and east, but also, more interestingly, how literature was used in that conflict. His is a history of \u201ccultural warfare\u201d. We start in the crucible of the Spanish civil war, where George Orwell and Arthur Koestler first discover the murderous consequences of political ideals, but also the power of fiction to display these. Orwell\u2019s books, banned in Warsaw Pact states, became weapons in the war of ideologies. When he was trying unsuccessfully to get Nineteen Eighty-Four published, the Ministry of Information official who advised Jonathan Cape to refuse Orwell\u2019s novel was in fact a long-standing NKVD agent. It would not be long before the CIA was printing copies of Animal Farm that were light enough to be floated by balloons into eastern Europe. Meanwhile Koestler, eventually a zealous anti-communist preacher, berating western liberals and leftists for any ambivalence about the Soviet threat, naturally began as a Communist party activist, able to ignore the evidence of persecution and starvation that he saw on a journey through the Soviet Union in 1932. Posing as a pro-Franco journalist in Spain, he spied for the Soviet Union and narrowly escaped execution. When he renounced communism, he wrote his 1940 novel Darkness at Noon, a fictional treatment of Stalin\u2019s purges, which became a bestseller in France after the war. We shift from Spain to the Soviet Union itself, where the best writers were the most suspect. We follow short-story writer Isaac Babel, trying to survive amid the purges and the show trials, \u201cthe compass needle dead on terror\u201d, as the poet Robert Lowell was to put it. It is now possible to reconstruct the narrative of his torture, confession (to \u201cspying\u201d), retraction and perfunctory trial. He was executed in the Lubyanka prison in 1940. White\u2019s narrative method is to base each chapter on the fortunes of one author or pair of authors, but also to switch, from chapter to chapter, between different countries, sometimes different continents. The contrasts are telling. In 1936, while self-consciously leftwing US writers discuss the finer points of ideological commitment at the Congress of American Writers in Manhattan, the Moscow show trials are in full swing. Later, we leave Koestler and Sartre arguing over cold war attitudes at Paris soirees to see Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn entering a prison camp in the remote steppes of Kazakhstan, or the poet Anna Akhmatova, tormented into a show of compliance by the imprisonment of her son in a gulag, her best poetry remembered but not even written down. US government agencies also feared the subversive effects of fiction. The House Un-American Activities Committee notoriously targeted Hollywood writers. White devotes a chapter to the communist novelist Howard Fast, whose novel Spartacus was prevented from publication by the FBI on the grounds that it was veiled pro-communist propaganda. Fast self-published his book and made it a bestseller. Another follows the African American novelist Richard Wright as he grapples with the growing realisation that communism will not offer the alternative to the violent racism that he has known in the US. White is allured by the ways in which British writers became entangled with spies. While working for SIS (now commonly known as MI6) in 1942, the top Soviet agent Kim Philby was reading reports written by one of his agents in Freetown, Sierra Leone \u2013 Graham Greene.

Initially, she was more successful as a writer of short stories, and produced little poetry. Thanks largely to the quick eye of Alida Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London, Mew was able to publish her first poetry collection, The Farmer\u2019s Bride, in 1916.

Even in Not for That City, she indents alternate pairs of lines in the original, a cautious hint of more radical structures to come. But, Copus reminds us, this is only the fourth of her poems to be published. What is most striking is the treatment of the ideal \u2013 the vision of heaven as a city of perpetual sunlight.

The climate researcher Rebecca Willis put the new standard succinctly earlier this month: \u201cTargets don\u2019t reduce carbon. Policies do.\u201d There has been some hope on that front. Parties in the UK and candidates in the US Democratic primaries took on comprehensive climate platforms for the first time. These either directly or indirectly reference the concept of a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d \u2013 pairing increased spending on climate with a larger social transformation, and breaking down the wall that separates climate policy from the rest of national politics. But crucially, nothing similar has been brought forward by a government actually in power. What hasn\u2019t changed is the intractable nature of international climate negotiations. The UN\u2019s climate change conference, COP, falls at the end of the calendar year, and, being the place where countries affirm their climate commitments under the UN framework convention on climate change, rarely produces a hopeful coda to the previous 12 months. \u201cGood\u201d COPs are rare. This year\u2019s iteration in Madrid wasn\u2019t the worst, but it seemed strangely removed from the rest of the year\u2019s events, as if the delegates had been bussed directly across space and time from last December\u2019s meeting in Katowice, bypassing entirely the wave of protest and the titanic shift in public opinion. And so, in the same week that Time honoured the climate movement, a loose coalition of rightwing governments \u2013 including administrations in Brazil and Australia \u2013 effectively stymied the conference\u2019s goal of strengthening the Paris agreement. Despite warnings that current plans are totally inadequate, and 11,000 researchers stating \u201cthe climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected\u201d, little was agreed, and hope for action was \u2013 again \u2013 punted to next year. It\u2019s a depressing story, and it isn\u2019t the biggest climate story of the year because it\u2019s effectively the same news we\u2019ve heard nearly every year since the conference began a quarter of a century ago. The rise of a broadly popular climate movement and the stirrings of national-level climate politics puts the continued failure of the negotiations into stark relief. The international effort was always meant to lead the way, but it feels increasingly remote from the rest of the climate struggle \u2013 as if it\u2019s taking place on a different planet. \u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment",

It has a bit of sentimentality, such as the line where he accepts that he is a drunk loser but that his son has a future.

Kind of like watching a movie of a family and its weird dynamics. It has that end-of-the-year vibe of reminiscence, longing, joy and a bit of regret.

They go out into a high field to spot it. Disappointed, they go back to the house. \u201cMama, we don\u2019t see no Christmas,\u201d one of them says, but the mother promises: \u201cWell, it\u2019s comin\u2019!\u201d The intro encapsulates the expectation and excitement of young children in the run-up to the special day. Then the song proper kicks in. It\u2019s a simple but catchy little melody repeated over and over again, with an insistent message: everybody gets happy on a Christmas Day. And by the end of the song, I, for one, am.<br><strong>Phil Town, Lisbon</strong></p> <h2>4.

The usual Christmas pop schmaltz, choir and allegory are eschewed in favour of \u201cclassic Bush\u201d high notes, gasps, mystique and beauty. But she still manages to squeeze plenty of jingling bells into the song. Nobody does narrative like Kate Bush. This song immediately transports me to childhood Christmas Eves, waiting for Santa to arrive, and looking forward to seeing the family. Do I sound like an overindulgent wanker? Probably. But if anything deserves overindulgence at Christmas it\u2019s this song.<br><strong>Neil Campbell, Stirling</strong></p> <h2>5.

Other than the short days, sleet and political lobbying, Christmas music is what keeps me well away from the high street. This song was written by Alan Hull, who embodied the social fabric of the north-east. The lyrics paint a Lowrian picture of society, weaving in a bleak grey image of winter. It is the perfect song of what Christmas is not supposed to be\u2026 but tragically is.<br><strong>Jim Bain, Creedmoor, NC, USA</strong></p> <h2>7.

As well as the humour and the reminder that Christmas is a time to spend with your loved ones, it also brings back memories of the year I went backpacking and spent Christmas 2012 in a hostel in Wellington. I was five months out from seeing my family again, and this song was the first real reminder that actually, I did miss home and my family, and that was OK, and it wouldn\u2019t be too long until I did get to see them. I remember listening to it on repeat in the hostel lobby (the only place we could get decent wifi) and just sobbing and letting it all out.<br><strong>Laura Cooney, London</strong></p> <h2>9.

I remember coming home drunk every Christmas Eve and seeing the village I\u2019d not seen since the previous December by streetlight. Gareth, the singer of Los Campesinos!, is from the next town along from where I grew up in Somerset and I could picture exactly the kind of cul-de-sacs he was singing about.<br><strong>Hamish Rankine, Madrid</strong></p> <h2>10.

It has a bit of sentimentality, such as the line where he accepts that he is a drunk loser but that his son has a future. And being a Shane MacGowan track, it is delivered in his usual droll, half-cut style. Rob McSporran, Bristol 2. Paul Kelly: How to Make Gravy (1996) I\u2019d never heard this until two or three years ago, but it\u2019s a great Christmas track [in the form of a letter home from a prisoner about his regret at missing the celebrations]. Kind of like watching a movie of a family and its weird dynamics. It has that end-of-the-year vibe of reminiscence, longing, joy and a bit of regret. [Also picked by Melbourne\u2019s David McGuinness: \u201cIt has the added bonus that you can make gravy by following the lyrics.\u201d] Chuck Archambeault, Cincinnati 3. Lead Belly: On a Christmas Day (1944) There\u2019s a slightly rambling, slightly mysterious (who\u2019s the \u201clittle boy\u201d?) but utterly charming intro in which a mother tells two young children that Christmas is coming. They go out into a high field to spot it. Disappointed, they go back to the house. \u201cMama, we don\u2019t see no Christmas,\u201d one of them says, but the mother promises: \u201cWell, it\u2019s comin\u2019!\u201d The intro encapsulates the expectation and excitement of young children in the run-up to the special day. Then the song proper kicks in. It\u2019s a simple but catchy little melody repeated over and over again, with an insistent message: everybody gets happy on a Christmas Day. And by the end of the song, I, for one, am. Phil Town, Lisbon 4. Kate Bush: December Will Be Magic Again (1980) I love this track because it\u2019s not a Christmas song per se; it\u2019s a Kate Bush song that happens to be about Christmas. The usual Christmas pop schmaltz, choir and allegory are eschewed in favour of \u201cclassic Bush\u201d high notes, gasps, mystique and beauty. But she still manages to squeeze plenty of jingling bells into the song. Nobody does narrative like Kate Bush. This song immediately transports me to childhood Christmas Eves, waiting for Santa to arrive, and looking forward to seeing the family. Do I sound like an overindulgent wanker? Probably. But if anything deserves overindulgence at Christmas it\u2019s this song. Neil Campbell, Stirling 5. James Brown: Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto (1968) A beautiful message from the funkiest, baddest\u2026 the godfather of soul! What\u2019s not to love? Went to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers in concert about 15 years ago and was surprised to see that the support was the inimitable James Brown. He stole the show. Huw Edwards, Haverfordwest 6. Lindisfarne: Winter Song (1972) What a fine surprise to read that you are compiling an alternative Christmas playlist. Other than the short days, sleet and political lobbying, Christmas music is what keeps me well away from the high street. This song was written by Alan Hull, who embodied the social fabric of the north-east. The lyrics paint a Lowrian picture of society, weaving in a bleak grey image of winter. It is the perfect song of what Christmas is not supposed to be\u2026 but tragically is. Jim Bain, Creedmoor, NC, USA 7. Sufjan Stevens: That Was the Worst Christmas Ever! (2006) On the surface it seems like a beautiful Christmas tune, but the lyrics tell of a really bad Christmas. I love that paradox. Every year, we (my husband, two daughters and I) choose two songs each we would like to hear while eating our Christmas dinner so that everyone gets a fair say. This song is usually the only one related to Christmas \u2013 it will be one of my choices again this year. Sam Field, Cheltenham 8. Tim Minchin: White Wine in the Sun (2012) I will always have a soft spot for this. As well as the humour and the reminder that Christmas is a time to spend with your loved ones, it also brings back memories of the year I went backpacking and spent Christmas 2012 in a hostel in Wellington. I was five months out from seeing my family again, and this song was the first real reminder that actually, I did miss home and my family, and that was OK, and it wouldn\u2019t be too long until I did get to see them. I remember listening to it on repeat in the hostel lobby (the only place we could get decent wifi) and just sobbing and letting it all out. Laura Cooney, London 9. Los Campesinos!: A Doe to a Deer (2012) It sounds like trying to recapture childhood Christmas magic in your late 20s, and going back to the small town where you grew up for the holidays. I remember coming home drunk every Christmas Eve and seeing the village I\u2019d not seen since the previous December by streetlight. Gareth, the singer of Los Campesinos!, is from the next town along from where I grew up in Somerset and I could picture exactly the kind of cul-de-sacs he was singing about. Hamish Rankine, Madrid 10. Big Cynthia: I Got Your Cookies and Milk (2014) Every Xmas playlist needs a bit of raunch and Big Cynthia delivers. This song has such an infectious energy to it. Santa might have a hard time finishing his rounds if he shows up at Cynthia\u2019s house! Much like Lizzo today, Big Cynthia was a body-positive artist. She was the daughter of Motown star Junior Walker, but chose not to cash in on her last name. Sadly, she died in 2017, aged 47. Michael Day, Portland, Oregon 11. Tom Waits: Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis (1978) A year of happier, improved times are described to an old friend who shared a darker past, but the truth then slowly unravels into a desperate resignation about the tragic situation. Understated, magical storytelling from the master. Gets me every time. Richard Hodgkins, Shropshire 12. The Attery Squash : Santa\u2019s Laughter Mocks the Poor (2010) I am very much on the side of \u201cbah humbug\u201d when it comes to Christmas and the sentiment of this song fits right in. My husband has played this to our kids since it was released. Despite the cynicism of her parents, our daughter loves Christmas and by November has already decorated her room. Jo Peattie, Durham 13. Half Man, Half Biscuit: It\u2019s Cliched to Be Cynical at Christmas (2000) Captures the sound and (lack of) spirit at Christmas. Christmas is an easy thing to whinge about and HMHB address the naysayers. Also, most \u201calternative\u201d Christmas songs are negative and this is positive, but firmly tongue-in-cheek. Neil Finegan, Chester 14. Miles Davis: Blue Xmas (To Whom It May Concern) (1962) A downbeat tune with Bob Dorough on vocals lambasting the cynicism of Christmas. Davis did the song because Columbia Records requested a tune from each of the artists in its jazz stable so it could issue a jazz Christmas album. Miles\u2019s response: \u201cWhat the fuck do they want me to play for them, White Christmas?\u201d Jude Fawley, Irvine, California 15. Simon and Garfunkel: Silent Night/Seven O\u2019Clock News (1966) Poignant and even profound at the time, but perhaps not much more than a historical curiosity now. I wonder how many of my generation remember it? Can we even imagine a record company issuing such a political piece today? Alan Moore, Suffolk 16. Bob Dylan: Must Be Santa (2009) Nothing says Christmas chez Plank like Bob Dylan\u2019s Christmas in the Heart album and particularly this track. Dylan\u2019s voice is completely gone and it sounds like a bunch of drunks in a pub. It\u2019s so bad, it\u2019s good. They must have had so much fun recording it. Harry Plank, Lichfield, Staffordshire 17. Foy Vance: Christmas Has Done Nothing Wrong (2009) That rare thing: an anti-Christmas Christmas song, beautifully expressing a nation\u2019s frustration at having to hear the same old songs year in, year out. Funny and yet also strangely poignant. Julian Dodds, Belfast 18. Marching Church: Christmas on Earth (2017) This track \u2013 from the side project of Iceage\u2019s frontman, Elias Bender R\u00f8nnenfelt \u2013 is about losing custody of one\u2019s children and then abducting them on Christmas Eve, all set to magnificent horns and first-grade, left-field crooning. An absolute gem. Joel Andersson, Tyfta, Sweden 19. Vince Guaraldi Trio : Christmas Time Is Here (1965) The children\u2019s choir on this track from A Charlie Brown Christmas [the soundtrack to a never-aired Peanuts TV special] has all the right qualities for the tail end of Christmas Day: sentimental, a bit mournful, nostalgic, and with oddly furry percussion that makes you wonder if it\u2019s your speakers or your eardrums that have blown up. DJs Clarker &amp; Legwax, Leigh-on-Sea 20. The Knife: Reindeer (2001) Over haunting, melodic, synth-led instrumentation, this tells of the reindeers\u2019 lot in transporting Santa. Just right for a snowy Christmas night. Kelvyn Gardner, Wicken, Northamptonshire 21. Yellowman: African Christmas (1998) A reggae reminder that Christmas is celebrated all across the world and a call for peace among nations. The song also lists 10 different African countries, which will come in useful for your annual Christmas game of Trivial Pursuit. Pete Southwood, Sheffield 22. Telekinesis: Christmas Time Is Here (Uh-Oh) (2019) I run a Christmas music blog, Christmas a Go-Go!, and I can report that there is a lot of good new Christmas music this year. One of the best is this track by Seattle indie rocker Telekinesis. It\u2019s a very catchy tune with a Cheap Trick vibe that makes you want to dance around dressed only in big red velvet underpants. Guuz Hoogaerts, Amsterdam 23. The Fall: Hark the Herald Angels Sing (1994) My kids\u2019 favourite. We enjoy snarling it loudly every year while making Christmas cake. In fact my youngest got into trouble at school once for singing it exactly in the manner of Mark E Smith. Annie Robinson, Edinburgh 24. Emmy the Great and Tim Wheeler: (Don\u2019t Call Me) Mrs Christmas (2011) Santa\u2019s wife sings that she\u2019s tired of being abandoned on Christmas Eve. Sad. Sassy. Beautiful. Scott Court, Bath 25. Type O Negative: Red Water (Christmas Mourning) (1996) An utterly beautiful song in the towering goth metal vein with a vaguely Christmassy feel, reminding everyone of the pointlessness of existence and the futility of hope. Merry Christmas everyone! Steve Cuddihey, Thompson, Norfolk * Listen to the playlist on Spotify",

Organizers of both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions are going after major corporate donors appealing for huge lump sums as they scramble to raise the money needed to bankroll the made-for-television events. Fundraising materials show that both parties are hoping to lure $1m donations from corporations and wealthy individuals in exchange for access and advertising opportunities.

Its host committee has also set itself a target of $70m, though that would be further supplemented by $20m from the Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC).

For that largesse they are promised select advertising opportunities, VIP access and hospitality and tickets to host committee parties. Unlike the Republicans, the DNC hosts are not dangling access to top presidential campaign figures in front of donors. However, the presence of so much corporate cash swilling around Milwaukee could yet be problematic, given the platforms of some of the party\u2019s primary contenders. That is especially the case for Sanders. In October his campaign told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that were he to become the nominee he would ban corporate donations to the convention in tune with his general desire to remove big money from US politics. Josh Orton, policy director in the Sanders campaign, told the newspaper: \u201cWhen Bernie is the nominee, everything will fundamentally change for corporate elites \u2026 A Bernie Sanders convention will be a people-powered convention.\u201d That would appear to conflict with the message being handed out by DNCC officials who have been telling potential donors and lobbyists that their money would be welcomed no matter who the eventual nominee is. As Politico has reported, the DNCC\u2019s chief executive, Joe Solmonese, has taken the view that the event needs to be funded well in advance, with the use of corporate dollars, no matter who is victorious in the Democratic primaries. \u201cWe can\u2019t know and try to, nor can I ever suggest that we ever try to, bend this towards any one candidate\u2019s philosophy,\u201d Solmonese told the news site. Though the Democrats have a more progressive stance on big money in politics than the modern Republican party, they are by no means immune to the stresses and contradictions that come from welcoming large amounts of corporate cash into their coffers. The Open Secrets database that tracks money in US politics calculated that almost three-quarters of the $70m raised for the Philadelphia Democratic National Convention that nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016 was raised from just 17 sources. Among those mega-donors were Facebook, the telecoms company AT&amp;T and health insurer Independence Blue Cross which all gave $1.5m each, and American Airlines and Bank of America donating $1m each. JB Pritzker, the current Democratic governor of Illinois whose fortune comes from the Pritzker family\u2019s ownership of the Hyatt hotel chain, gave a personal donation of $1.3m.",

      "bodyText": "A group of MPs and other Labour members intended to represent opinions from across all wings of the party have launched a formal inquiry into its 2019 general election defeat and the lessons that can be learned. The panel, including MPs Lucy Powell, Ed Miliband and Shabana Mahmood, as well as a former adviser to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and representatives from unions, local parties and community groups, hopes to report by the end of February, before a new leader is chosen. Organised by Labour Together, a network launched in 2015 to gather ideas from across the party, the inquiry aims to get beyond \u201csimplistic takes\u201d so far offered, for example blaming the loss entirely on Jeremy Corbyn or on Brexit. The news comes amid an apparent Christmas hiatus in leadership manoeuvrings, with only two candidates so far having formally declared their intention to stand, but up to half a dozen more mooting possible bids. Last week, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, set out her pitch for the leadership, saying she had warned that backing an election in which Brexit was a key issue would be \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. The next day, Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister, declared his candidacy with a pitch towards the left of the party, promising also to increase members\u2019 role in policy-making. Widely expected to stand but not yet formally declared are the two favourites: Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and the apparent official choice of the Corbyn/McDonnell wing of the party. She has so far remained silent since the election. Others who could stand include the Wigan MP Lisa Nandy, Tottenham MP David Lammy, and home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, had been tipped as a candidate but will reportedly stand instead for deputy leader, on an unofficial joint ticket with Long-Bailey. The inquiry, styled as \u201can independent commission to learn the lessons of the 2019 Labour general election campaign\u201d, is separate from any of the leadership campaigns, and hopes to involve groups within Labour such as the Corbyn-backing Momentum and the centre-right Progress faction. Panel members will take evidence from defeated candidates in seats lost by the party, and from those in target constituencies. The inquiry will also hold focus groups and \u201clistening events\u201d with the public in seats that were lost; speak to organisers, councillors and activists; carry out a survey of party members, and analyse election data. Organised jointly by LabourList, the independent news website focused on party issues, other panel members include LabourList editor Sienna Rodgers, James Meadway, a former adviser to McDonnell, Marcus Roberts from the polling organisation YouGov, representatives from Common Knowledge, a workers\u2019 co-operative, and others yet to be announced. The aim is to \u201ctake a balanced view of what happened in the campaign, aiming to bring the Labour movement together so that it can come to a collective view of what needs to change to make the party electable again\u201d, according to a statement announcing the plan. Powell, the Manchester Central MP, said: \u201cWe have lost the last four elections and we all have to accept that our offers to the country have been insufficient. \u201cWe should have taken the time to understand our losses previously. It\u2019s now profoundly important for the future of our party and country that we take a real and meaningful look at why we have fallen short. \u201cThis inquiry gives us the opportunity to listen to members, candidates and the public and I hope our whole movement takes it in the spirit it is offered and takes part.\u201d",

Huddled inside his makeshift kiln he watched as his pottery shed \u2013 the third he\u2019s had destroyed by fire since moving here \u2013 burned around him. He dared not look at his house until the fire had passed. When he did, he was shocked to see it still standing. \u201cIt was eerie. The light was this metallic, luminous glow. Burning leaves were falling around me. The smoke was so thick I could hardly breathe. I just watched it as it came over me. I was shit scared. I thought, \u2018This is how I die.\u2019\u201d And so this is Balmoral now. This tiny, usually picturesque village with a population of about 400 in the southern highlands just south of Sydney, where 18 homes were destroyed on Saturday, is now another pitstop in the travelling bushfire emergency that has claimed nine lives and more than 900 buildings since November. They had known it was coming, of course. Conditions in the lead-up to Saturday were forecast to be catastrophic, and they were. Most of the residents of this tiny village, built in 1867, left on Thursday, heeding the warnings. Then on Friday the village Rural Fire Service brigade captain, Brendon O\u2019Connor, held a community meeting at which, he told Guardian Australia, he was \u201cvery honest about what I thought was going to happen\u201d. Another resident, Simon Marlow, was one of the people at that meeting. \u201cHe basically told us to make sure we\u2019d prepared our will if we were going to stay,\u201d he says. \u201cI had bought a water pump and planned to stay but, when I saw it coming, honestly, it was terrifying, I got out of there.\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s brutal honesty may have saved lives. As temperatures climbed above 40C on Saturday, he described the same scenario to the Guardian that Helena and Justin had seen. Fire fronts came from the west, the east and the south, sending flames dozens of metres above the treetops. \u201cEverything that was already burning was burning even more, everywhere you looked was burning,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle. The firefighters that were here, they were \u2026 \u201d O\u2019Connor stops and takes a deep breath, apologising. \u201cNot only were they fighting for their own lives, they were fighting for this community.\u201d At one point, he says, they ran out of water. \u201cWe\u2019re on tank water here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were desperately trying to get more water into us, desperately calling for more to come in. A member from another brigade spoke to his boss about getting another truck into us really quick. \u201cThat company saved a lot of homes.\u201d For Helena and Justin, there was no such luck. They are not angry but they do feel the Rural Fire Service volunteers here were stretched too thin, asked to cover too much territory. The home they built together overlooking picturesque bushland 20 years ago \u2013 a home that survived fires in 2001 and 2013 \u2013 is rubble now. As they spoke to Guardian Australia on Monday, Gabriel found an intact mug among the ruins of their home and handed it to his mother. A jar of pork crackling sat unharmed. That was about it. They remain in remarkably good cheer, though. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d Helena asks. They will \u201cabsolutely\u201d rebuild here, Helena tells the Guardian. \u201cGabriel says he wants a massive games room,\u201d she says, laughing.",

      "body": "<h2>1) Ings makes case for England recall</h2> \n<p>At this rate there is every chance two of the Premier League\u2019s deadliest English strikers will not be part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad at Euro 2020. Jamie Vardy is unlikely to be tempted out of international retirement and then there is Danny Ings, the Southampton striker who took his tally to 13 goals for the season with a double. Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford, Tammy Abraham and Callum Wilson may be ahead of Ings in the pecking order but seven goals from his past seven games means it is impossible to ignore the 27-year-old\u2019s credentials for a recall. Ings\u2019s only cap came against Lithuania four years ago under Roy Hodgson, when the striker was at Liverpool. \u201cHe is a typical No 9 in the box,\u201d said the Saints manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cWith his technique, there are not a lot of strikers who are better than him.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<h2>2) McGinn injury adds to Smith\u2019s headaches</h2> \n<p>Aston Villa\u2019s misery over perhaps their most dispiriting defeat of the season was compounded on Sunday by the news that John McGinn suffered an ankle fracture during Saturday\u2019s loss at home to Southampton and could be out for some time. The Scotland midfielder was forced off after only eight minutes after appearing to get his studs caught in the turf, and Villa suffered in his absence as Saints romped to a 3-1 win. Along with Jack Grealish, McGinn is Villa\u2019s most reliable creative talent and it means the likes of Wesley, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet and Conor Hourihane need to step up for their upcoming festive fixtures against Norwich and Watford, both of which Dean Smith\u2019s side need to win and require dynamic attacking performances, not least because Villa\u2019s defence continues to look flaky. <strong>Tom Davies</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/aston-villa-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Aston Villa 1-3 Southampton</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/dec/22/the-dozen-de-geas-fumble-and-big-duncs-pride-the-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: De Gea's fumble and big Dunc's pride \u2013 the best Premier League photos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) Bournemouth short of attacking ideas</h2> \n<p>It was the match with the fewest shots in Premier League history, and it felt like it. That is not to say Bournemouth v Burnley did not have its plus points, such as the physical commitment of two well-drilled sides, but what there was only served to shut down goal opportunities further. For Bournemouth this was an immediate concern, with the home side taking more risks for no reward and ultimately another defeat, their sixth in seven matches. But it\u2019s also a longer-term worry. After Watford, Bournemouth have scored the fewest goals in the division. The underlying stats suggest that total is not unfair. Last season Eddie Howe\u2019s side made hay time and again through the combination of Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser but that spark has not come back. The team look short on ideas and attacking alternatives; they need to find some, and quickly. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/bournemouth-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 0-1 Burnley</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c06f8dac5950d3abfa5b601a6e5ee4975ff6092c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c06f8dac5950d3abfa5b601a6e5ee4975ff6092c/0_107_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bournemouth are looking to Ryan Fraser to provide a spark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bournemouth are looking to Ryan Fraser to provide a spark.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) McGoldrick offers everything but the goal</h2> \n<p>Not long before Roberto Firmino was scoring for Liverpool in the Club World Cup final, the closest thing Sheffield United have to the Brazilian was missing a sitter at Brighton. But, as ever, David McGoldrick made a big contribution to his team\u2019s victory. His intelligence, dynamism and finesse make him a key factor in their rise up the table. And one of these days he will score his first Premier League goal. \u201cThe roof will come off when he does,\u201d Chris Wilder said. \u201cHe makes us play, he makes us tick. Out of possession, in possession, he\u2019s a really good player. Another one we got who was going nowhere and he\u2019s absolutely fantastic for us. The majority of fans know what the game is about \u2026 and if he was a pretender our punters would have definitely found him out and isolated him. And he isn\u2019t. The roof will come off when he scores. It\u2019s coming.\u201d <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/brighton-hove-albion-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 0-1 Sheffield United</a></em></p> \n<h2>5) Where should Ancelotti start Everton rebuild?</h2> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point kidding ourselves,\u201d Duncan Ferguson said, \u201cwe are at the wrong end of the table.\u201d Carlo Ancelotti is known as a lover of the finer things in life, not just in football, and the immediate worry as a new era dawns is that despite fielding Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Cenk Tosun and Moise Kean in the same game Everton went 90 minutes without a shot on target. The new manager is likely to want to spend in January, so where should he start? Another striker would only add to an already long list, when a lack of creativity might be the real problem. Andr\u00e9 Gomes is injured and Alex Iwobi limped off early against Arsenal, while Gylfi Sigurdsson does not look fully recovered from his spell on the sidelines. Ferguson has shown there is spirit, it is now up to Ancelotti to try to introduce a little sophistication. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton 0-0 Arsenal</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec3df472-0ffb-4116-a17e-d726b32a766d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GHrYyfkcf7g?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Top four the new target after Foxes are found out</h2> \n<p>Leicester have played four away games against last season\u2019s top six and from them they have taken only one point. It\u2019s true that they might have got a draw at Liverpool but they were poor against an uninspiring Manchester United at Old Trafford and they were well-beaten by Manchester City. The positive is that they have got four of their toughest games out of the way in the first half of the season \u2013 and they did beat Tottenham and Arsenal (if they can really be classed as a \u2018big six\u2019 side any more) at home. But this result should perhaps serve as a check to expectations about them. They are not \u2013 yet \u2013 a side equipped for a serious title challenge and, just because their form through the autumn suggested something extraordinary might be possible, a top-four finish would still represent a remarkable achievement. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City 3-1 Leicester</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da238510908dcd2108935d8431974386b9341c17\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da238510908dcd2108935d8431974386b9341c17/0_37_3703_2222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brendan Rodgers and his players have their eyes on a top-four finish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendan Rodgers and his players have their eyes on a top-four finish.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>7) Team player Almir\u00f3n gets overdue reward</h2> \n<p>Cold statistics said Miguel Almir\u00f3n had failed to score and contributed one assist since his \u00a321m move from Atlanta last January but those numbers failed \u2013 spectacularly \u2013 to highlight how very good the Paraguay playmaker is. Against Palace, amid joyous scenes rarely witnessed at St James\u2019 Park in recent times, he finally broke his duck, volleying the winner against visitors let down by Wilfried Zaha\u2019s habit of sulking whenever colleagues failed to give him the ball. In contrast, Almir\u00f3n is an ultimate team player who blends high-calibre nutmegs and talent\u2011laden first touches with serious elbow grease. \u201cMiggy\u2019s bloody good,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager, Steve Bruce. \u201cHe\u2019s a great pro, popular. Physically he\u2019s huge in what he does for the team, his running, so you want him to succeed. He\u2019s a joy to work with.

This time it was Daniel Farke\u2019s turn to rue his team\u2019s missed opportunities. \u201cShould be three or four goals,\u201d he said, sighing. He was correct. Norwich dominated Wolves in the first half thanks in large part to the most astonishing first-half performance from Emi Buend\u00eda. But Wolves weathered the storm, taking advantage of rare poor finishing from Teemu Pukki to drag themselves back into the match. Adama Traor\u00e9 continues to be relentless and the goalkeeper Rui Patr\u00edcio kept them in it but their collective spirit was most impressive. Setbacks are inevitable in an exhausting season and it is how Wolves react that will decide how high they can finish. The fortitude Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s team have shown this season is encouraging. <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/norwich-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich 1-2 Wolves</a></em></p> \n<h2>9) Spurs attackers need more from midfield</h2> \n<p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho cannot do much about the individual mistakes that resulted in Chelsea\u2019s two goals \u2013 apart from replace those who committed them in January. What is more achievable in the short term is ensuring Tottenham are better in possession of the ball and can keep it. With Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko occupying the centre of the park, it is unlikely they are going to utilise the ball with requisite speed and incisiveness for Spurs to threaten top opposition such as Chelsea. With Harry Winks and Christian Eriksen settled on the bench, Spurs\u2019 midfield watched as Chelsea popped the ball around and through them to open up the lead, while the hosts mainly wasted what little of the ball they saw. Having forward players with the talent of Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli and Harry Kane is pointless if they are given so few sightings of the ball. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 2-0 Chelsea</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) Pogba shows what United may end up missing</h2> \n<p>Once Paul Pogba was introduced, Manchester United became a different proposition. Or at least in attack; their defence were still being pulled apart by opponents who had scored only nine previous goals this season. During the first half, United\u2019s forwards received little service from a midfield where Scott McTominay and Fred were being dominated. Jesse Lingard missed the sole chance, chipping over rather than placing or powering past Ben Foster. It was the latest demonstration of a player struggling badly since his heady World Cup summer of 2018. Pogba replaced Lingard with United two down and 34 minutes left to play, and soon created space, angles and danger. But can that really be seen as a positive for United when Pogba\u2019s future remains opaque? Without him, United are bereft of creativity unless the opposition allow them to counterattack. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

      "bodyText": "1) Ings makes case for England recall At this rate there is every chance two of the Premier League\u2019s deadliest English strikers will not be part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad at Euro 2020. Jamie Vardy is unlikely to be tempted out of international retirement and then there is Danny Ings, the Southampton striker who took his tally to 13 goals for the season with a double. Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford, Tammy Abraham and Callum Wilson may be ahead of Ings in the pecking order but seven goals from his past seven games means it is impossible to ignore the 27-year-old\u2019s credentials for a recall. Ings\u2019s only cap came against Lithuania four years ago under Roy Hodgson, when the striker was at Liverpool. \u201cHe is a typical No 9 in the box,\u201d said the Saints manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cWith his technique, there are not a lot of strikers who are better than him.\u201d Ben Fisher 2) McGinn injury adds to Smith\u2019s headaches Aston Villa\u2019s misery over perhaps their most dispiriting defeat of the season was compounded on Sunday by the news that John McGinn suffered an ankle fracture during Saturday\u2019s loss at home to Southampton and could be out for some time. The Scotland midfielder was forced off after only eight minutes after appearing to get his studs caught in the turf, and Villa suffered in his absence as Saints romped to a 3-1 win. Along with Jack Grealish, McGinn is Villa\u2019s most reliable creative talent and it means the likes of Wesley, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet and Conor Hourihane need to step up for their upcoming festive fixtures against Norwich and Watford, both of which Dean Smith\u2019s side need to win and require dynamic attacking performances, not least because Villa\u2019s defence continues to look flaky. Tom Davies \u2022 Match report: Aston Villa 1-3 Southampton 3) Bournemouth short of attacking ideas It was the match with the fewest shots in Premier League history, and it felt like it. That is not to say Bournemouth v Burnley did not have its plus points, such as the physical commitment of two well-drilled sides, but what there was only served to shut down goal opportunities further. For Bournemouth this was an immediate concern, with the home side taking more risks for no reward and ultimately another defeat, their sixth in seven matches. But it\u2019s also a longer-term worry. After Watford, Bournemouth have scored the fewest goals in the division. The underlying stats suggest that total is not unfair. Last season Eddie Howe\u2019s side made hay time and again through the combination of Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser but that spark has not come back. The team look short on ideas and attacking alternatives; they need to find some, and quickly. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 0-1 Burnley 4) McGoldrick offers everything but the goal Not long before Roberto Firmino was scoring for Liverpool in the Club World Cup final, the closest thing Sheffield United have to the Brazilian was missing a sitter at Brighton. But, as ever, David McGoldrick made a big contribution to his team\u2019s victory. His intelligence, dynamism and finesse make him a key factor in their rise up the table. And one of these days he will score his first Premier League goal. \u201cThe roof will come off when he does,\u201d Chris Wilder said. \u201cHe makes us play, he makes us tick. Out of possession, in possession, he\u2019s a really good player. Another one we got who was going nowhere and he\u2019s absolutely fantastic for us. The majority of fans know what the game is about \u2026 and if he was a pretender our punters would have definitely found him out and isolated him. And he isn\u2019t. The roof will come off when he scores. It\u2019s coming.\u201d Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Brighton 0-1 Sheffield United 5) Where should Ancelotti start Everton rebuild? \u201cThere\u2019s no point kidding ourselves,\u201d Duncan Ferguson said, \u201cwe are at the wrong end of the table.\u201d Carlo Ancelotti is known as a lover of the finer things in life, not just in football, and the immediate worry as a new era dawns is that despite fielding Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Cenk Tosun and Moise Kean in the same game Everton went 90 minutes without a shot on target. The new manager is likely to want to spend in January, so where should he start? Another striker would only add to an already long list, when a lack of creativity might be the real problem. Andr\u00e9 Gomes is injured and Alex Iwobi limped off early against Arsenal, while Gylfi Sigurdsson does not look fully recovered from his spell on the sidelines. Ferguson has shown there is spirit, it is now up to Ancelotti to try to introduce a little sophistication. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Everton 0-0 Arsenal 6) Top four the new target after Foxes are found out Leicester have played four away games against last season\u2019s top six and from them they have taken only one point. It\u2019s true that they might have got a draw at Liverpool but they were poor against an uninspiring Manchester United at Old Trafford and they were well-beaten by Manchester City. The positive is that they have got four of their toughest games out of the way in the first half of the season \u2013 and they did beat Tottenham and Arsenal (if they can really be classed as a \u2018big six\u2019 side any more) at home. But this result should perhaps serve as a check to expectations about them. They are not \u2013 yet \u2013 a side equipped for a serious title challenge and, just because their form through the autumn suggested something extraordinary might be possible, a top-four finish would still represent a remarkable achievement. Jonathan Wilson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 3-1 Leicester 7) Team player Almir\u00f3n gets overdue reward Cold statistics said Miguel Almir\u00f3n had failed to score and contributed one assist since his \u00a321m move from Atlanta last January but those numbers failed \u2013 spectacularly \u2013 to highlight how very good the Paraguay playmaker is. Against Palace, amid joyous scenes rarely witnessed at St James\u2019 Park in recent times, he finally broke his duck, volleying the winner against visitors let down by Wilfried Zaha\u2019s habit of sulking whenever colleagues failed to give him the ball. In contrast, Almir\u00f3n is an ultimate team player who blends high-calibre nutmegs and talent\u2011laden first touches with serious elbow grease. \u201cMiggy\u2019s bloody good,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager, Steve Bruce. \u201cHe\u2019s a great pro, popular. Physically he\u2019s huge in what he does for the team, his running, so you want him to succeed. He\u2019s a joy to work with. I\u2019d break down the door to get another player as good as him.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 1-0 Crystal Palace 8) Norwich denied by Wolves\u2019 collective will One week ago Wolves had Tottenham on the ropes but failed to land the finishing blow. This time it was Daniel Farke\u2019s turn to rue his team\u2019s missed opportunities. \u201cShould be three or four goals,\u201d he said, sighing. He was correct. Norwich dominated Wolves in the first half thanks in large part to the most astonishing first-half performance from Emi Buend\u00eda. But Wolves weathered the storm, taking advantage of rare poor finishing from Teemu Pukki to drag themselves back into the match. Adama Traor\u00e9 continues to be relentless and the goalkeeper Rui Patr\u00edcio kept them in it but their collective spirit was most impressive. Setbacks are inevitable in an exhausting season and it is how Wolves react that will decide how high they can finish. The fortitude Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s team have shown this season is encouraging. Tumaini Carayol \u2022 Match report: Norwich 1-2 Wolves 9) Spurs attackers need more from midfield Jos\u00e9 Mourinho cannot do much about the individual mistakes that resulted in Chelsea\u2019s two goals \u2013 apart from replace those who committed them in January. What is more achievable in the short term is ensuring Tottenham are better in possession of the ball and can keep it. With Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko occupying the centre of the park, it is unlikely they are going to utilise the ball with requisite speed and incisiveness for Spurs to threaten top opposition such as Chelsea. With Harry Winks and Christian Eriksen settled on the bench, Spurs\u2019 midfield watched as Chelsea popped the ball around and through them to open up the lead, while the hosts mainly wasted what little of the ball they saw. Having forward players with the talent of Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli and Harry Kane is pointless if they are given so few sightings of the ball. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 2-0 Chelsea 10) Pogba shows what United may end up missing Once Paul Pogba was introduced, Manchester United became a different proposition. Or at least in attack; their defence were still being pulled apart by opponents who had scored only nine previous goals this season. During the first half, United\u2019s forwards received little service from a midfield where Scott McTominay and Fred were being dominated. Jesse Lingard missed the sole chance, chipping over rather than placing or powering past Ben Foster. It was the latest demonstration of a player struggling badly since his heady World Cup summer of 2018. Pogba replaced Lingard with United two down and 34 minutes left to play, and soon created space, angles and danger. But can that really be seen as a positive for United when Pogba\u2019s future remains opaque? Without him, United are bereft of creativity unless the opposition allow them to counterattack.

      "body": "<p>The Cincinnati Bengals are officially on the clock. The Bengals wrapped up the No1 overall pick in next year\u2019s draft, after losing to the Miami Dolphins 38-35 in overtime on Sunday. With that, Heisman trophy winner Joe Burrow can start to look at Cincinnati area investment opportunities. The LSU quarterback is the overwhelming favorite to be selected by Cincy in May\u2019s draft, but the Bengals came to fluffing their lines.</p> <p>It is one of the league\u2019s most interesting annual dichotomies as the season draws to a close: what is in the best interest of the franchise long-term is not in the best interest of those wearing the uniform in the here and now. The best possible things for the Bengals franchise in 2020 and beyond is to clinch the first overall pick, the most valuable non-franchise quarterback asset in the sport. It is a chance for them to land their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2dnemsUZDA\">quarterback of the future</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2019/11/22/20977212/chase-young-ohio-state-nfl-draft\">franchise-changing pass-rusher</a>. But for the current players and coaches, winning every game remains vital. Their jobs, after all, are on the line.</p> <p>Everything a player puts on tape will be evaluated by every team in the offseason. Every snap is a job interview. Their performances will impact their wallets and, for some, whether or not they have a career in the NFL. Position coaches could save or lose their jobs, and help or hurt future employment prospects, even if the head coach is in on the long-term plan.</p> <p>Plus, these are intensely competitive athletes, who have climbed to the top of their professions thanks to that very trait. Winning matters; losing hurts. Individual players don\u2019t tank, organizations do: by the people they hire, players they sign (or don\u2019t) and the level of talent they stick on the field.</p> <p>Cincinnati decided pretty early in the season it was in their long-term interest to dump this season and target a quarterback in the upcoming draft class. They entered Sunday\u2019s tank-athon with a good lead in the draft sweepstakes over Washington, New York, Miami, and Detroit. It looked like they had wrapped it up within minutes. The Dolphins zoomed out to a commanding lead, with Ryan Fitzpatrick setting a Dolphins franchise record for first-half passing yards, throwing for 252 yards and three touchdowns.</p> <p>Then something switched. Improbably, and in spite of the wishes of the fanbase, who usually align with management when it comes to tanking (dreaming and drafting is fun!), the Bengals put together an incredible run:</p> <p>- A touchdown on fourth down.</p> <p>- A two-point conversion.</p> <p>- A successful onside kick.</p> <p>- A 29-yard touchdown with the game clock hitting zeros.</p> <p>- A two-point conversion.</p> <p>The Bengals rallied back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter to tie the game up and send it into overtime. The Dolphins scored in overtime to seal the game, sabotaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/09/miami-dolphins-nfl-tanking\">their own preseason plans</a> to prioritize the long-term over the short.</p> <p>Or did they? There will be those who argue that the draft is a crapshoot anyway. That instilling a culture \u2013 be tough, be competitive, win \u2013 outweighs the benefits of shifting a couple of draft spots. There is validity in this argument, great players can be found up and down the board (the Patriots, the best team this century are masters at it) and turning around a losing culture is <em>hard.</em> Maybe Miami, with what looks like a competent coach and a young core \u2013 not to mention nine picks in the first two rounds of the next two drafts \u2013 are in a better position to build a sustainable winner than the losers who have first dibs at drafting a rookie quarterback.</p> <p>But ask Bengals fans, ownership, and the coaches and players who line up at the start of next season whether the pain of today was worth Burrow and the hope of tomorrow and the answer will unreservedly be yes.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Saquon Barkley, New York Giants. </strong>The 22-year-old posted his best game of 2019 on Sunday, rushing for 189 yards and a touchdown while adding 90 yards in catches and a receiving touchdown. An early-season ankle injury and the Giants\u2019 porous offensive line have robbed us of Barkley\u2019s majesty for much of the season. Finally, he looks all the way back, and we were treated to that delightful blend of grace and power as he steamrolled a hapless Washington defense.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p>There have now been six touchdowns scored by players over 300lbs this season \u2013 the most in league history. Few things in football are more beloved than a Big Guy Touchdown. To quote John Madden: Fat guy touchdown, fat guy spoke, fat guy dance.</p> <p>This season\u2019s best, for his team\u2019s reaction alone, belongs to Buffalo offensive tackle Dion Dawkins, who caught a touchdown pass against the Patriots on Saturday:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1208523216274239488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8DION.

The Rams have been billed as a model franchise in recent years \u2013 not least by league owners, who have tried to hire anyone within touching distance of McVay. This Rams team was built to win now: they traded two first-round picks for Ramsey, handed out big contracts to Jared Goff, Brandin Cooks, Andrew Whitworth, and an arthritis-stricken Todd Gurley.

      "bodyText": "The Cincinnati Bengals are officially on the clock. The Bengals wrapped up the No1 overall pick in next year\u2019s draft, after losing to the Miami Dolphins 38-35 in overtime on Sunday. With that, Heisman trophy winner Joe Burrow can start to look at Cincinnati area investment opportunities. The LSU quarterback is the overwhelming favorite to be selected by Cincy in May\u2019s draft, but the Bengals came to fluffing their lines. It is one of the league\u2019s most interesting annual dichotomies as the season draws to a close: what is in the best interest of the franchise long-term is not in the best interest of those wearing the uniform in the here and now. The best possible things for the Bengals franchise in 2020 and beyond is to clinch the first overall pick, the most valuable non-franchise quarterback asset in the sport. It is a chance for them to land their quarterback of the future or a franchise-changing pass-rusher. But for the current players and coaches, winning every game remains vital. Their jobs, after all, are on the line. Everything a player puts on tape will be evaluated by every team in the offseason. Every snap is a job interview. Their performances will impact their wallets and, for some, whether or not they have a career in the NFL. Position coaches could save or lose their jobs, and help or hurt future employment prospects, even if the head coach is in on the long-term plan. Plus, these are intensely competitive athletes, who have climbed to the top of their professions thanks to that very trait. Winning matters; losing hurts. Individual players don\u2019t tank, organizations do: by the people they hire, players they sign (or don\u2019t) and the level of talent they stick on the field. Cincinnati decided pretty early in the season it was in their long-term interest to dump this season and target a quarterback in the upcoming draft class. They entered Sunday\u2019s tank-athon with a good lead in the draft sweepstakes over Washington, New York, Miami, and Detroit. It looked like they had wrapped it up within minutes. The Dolphins zoomed out to a commanding lead, with Ryan Fitzpatrick setting a Dolphins franchise record for first-half passing yards, throwing for 252 yards and three touchdowns. Then something switched. Improbably, and in spite of the wishes of the fanbase, who usually align with management when it comes to tanking (dreaming and drafting is fun!), the Bengals put together an incredible run: - A touchdown on fourth down. - A two-point conversion. - A successful onside kick. - A 29-yard touchdown with the game clock hitting zeros. - A two-point conversion. The Bengals rallied back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter to tie the game up and send it into overtime. The Dolphins scored in overtime to seal the game, sabotaging their own preseason plans to prioritize the long-term over the short. Or did they? There will be those who argue that the draft is a crapshoot anyway. That instilling a culture \u2013 be tough, be competitive, win \u2013 outweighs the benefits of shifting a couple of draft spots. There is validity in this argument, great players can be found up and down the board (the Patriots, the best team this century are masters at it) and turning around a losing culture is hard. Maybe Miami, with what looks like a competent coach and a young core \u2013 not to mention nine picks in the first two rounds of the next two drafts \u2013 are in a better position to build a sustainable winner than the losers who have first dibs at drafting a rookie quarterback. But ask Bengals fans, ownership, and the coaches and players who line up at the start of next season whether the pain of today was worth Burrow and the hope of tomorrow and the answer will unreservedly be yes. MVP of the week Saquon Barkley, New York Giants. The 22-year-old posted his best game of 2019 on Sunday, rushing for 189 yards and a touchdown while adding 90 yards in catches and a receiving touchdown. An early-season ankle injury and the Giants\u2019 porous offensive line have robbed us of Barkley\u2019s majesty for much of the season. Finally, he looks all the way back, and we were treated to that delightful blend of grace and power as he steamrolled a hapless Washington defense. Stat of the week There have now been six touchdowns scored by players over 300lbs this season \u2013 the most in league history. Few things in football are more beloved than a Big Guy Touchdown. To quote John Madden: Fat guy touchdown, fat guy spoke, fat guy dance. This season\u2019s best, for his team\u2019s reaction alone, belongs to Buffalo offensive tackle Dion Dawkins, who caught a touchdown pass against the Patriots on Saturday: Miami\u2019s Christian Wilkins broke the wonderful record with a catch-then-fumble recovered for a touchdown against the Bengals: Wilkins is worthy of being the cover star. He is a big-guy touchdown legend dating back to college, where he rushed for two touchdowns and caught two more while weighing it at a sprightly 315lbs. Quote of the week \u201cI played my technique, trusting that [Rapp] was going to be over the top. He wasn\u2019t\u201d \u2013 Jalen Ramsey on the play that effectively ended the Rams\u2019 season. The Rams\u2019 season all-but ended on the above play. Blame immediately hit Ramsey for the blown coverage. He was seen as the perfect metaphor for the Rams season: a player acquired in a win-now move blowing it in a crucial spot. Ramsey set the record straight \u2013 he said his teammate Taylor Rapp wasn\u2019t in the correct place to cover. Whether or not Ramsey\u2019s explanation should be viewed as throwing a teammate under a bus or correctly informing the misinformed is open for discussion. What\u2019s undeniable: The Rams missing the playoffs is a black mark for general manager Les Snead and head coach Sean McVay. The Rams have been billed as a model franchise in recent years \u2013 not least by league owners, who have tried to hire anyone within touching distance of McVay. This Rams team was built to win now: they traded two first-round picks for Ramsey, handed out big contracts to Jared Goff, Brandin Cooks, Andrew Whitworth, and an arthritis-stricken Todd Gurley. It hasn\u2019t worked, and now the Rams don\u2019t have much wiggle room to improve. Changes are coming. NFL.com reports offseason moves may include shipping out Todd Gurley (how, given his injury status and contract remains a mystery) and axing defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, despite the Rams defense ranking as a top-eight unit in DVOA. Video of the week Khalif Raymond was knocked out on the reception-then-fumble that ultimately decided the Saints-Titans game. There was no flag for a dangerous hit to the head or neck area nor a mention of it on the Fox broadcast, despite innumerable replays. So much for player safety first. The Saints recovered the fumble with the Titans driving down the field to take the lead and win the game. A 15-yard penalty would have moved the Titans into field-goal range \u2013 at worst. Instead, the Saints received the ball and put the game away. Officiating this year has shifted from a joke to a tragedy, a small but necessary distinction. Elsewhere around the league - Lamar Jackson joined elite company on Sunday with another dizzying display in Cleveland. Jackson has eight games this season with three or more touchdowns. The only players with more such games in a single season: Patrick Mahomes, 2018 (10); Dan Marino, 1984 (10); Kurt Warner, 1999 (9). - The Philadelphia Eagles now have their fate in their own hands after a 17-9 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles will qualify for the playoffs if they beat the Giants next week. The future of Jason Garrett, meanwhile, is in doubt. - Baltimore started slow on Sunday then, in the blink of an eye, they dropped 14 points on the Browns. The Ravens had two touchdown drives that totaled 138 yards and took a combined 78 seconds. The Ravens have proved they can beat you by grinding it out, airing out, winning a slugfest or track meet, no matter the weather conditions. They are comfortably the most complete team in the league. - You Cannot Guard Mike. Michael Thomas passed Marvin Harrison\u2019s record for receptions in a season, grabbing 12 passes against the Titans to take his season total to 145. An extra fun fact: Thomas has more receptions this season than he did during his three years in college at Ohio State. Few players are that much more impactful in the NFL than they were in college. - Christian McCaffrey became the first running back in NFL history to have two seasons with at least 100 catches. This is only McCaffrey\u2019s third season: he is a special player having a special season on a lousy Panthers team. - The Patriots offense delivered a reassuring performance of what they can be come playoff time. They will be a play-action team again, as they were on their way to last year\u2019s championship. This group is not great in either the run game or the dropback passing game. But if they can blend the two competently \u2013 and rely on play-action for their chunk plays \u2013 they still have a shot to compete in the AFC. - Has Ryan Fitzpatrick had the weirdest career arc of any quarterback in modern history? He shredded the Bengals on Sunday to the tune of 419 yards and four touchdowns. That\u2019s Fitzpatrick\u2019s 10th career game with four or more touchdowns, matching the career totals of Tony Romo, John Elway, Matt Ryan and Russell Wilson, and besting those of Joe Montana and Phillip Rivers.

Mercury being in retrograde is not why you were late to work this morning. You may have thought we were long past the days when magazines had \u201cresident astrologers\u201d but astrology has been growing in popularity over the last decade, hitting peak superstition in the last few years. People give varied explanations for their rise. Some say young people, bereft of hope, are turning to spirituality to feel good again. The result? People now post flatshare adverts excluding people based on their star-sign; we\u2019re not far from birth charts being used in interviews; and can we all please stop slut-shaming Sagittariuses? (I mean it! Zodiac-shaming is a thing!) In the next decade, let\u2019s put horoscope back in the dark ages where they belong. PN 2 Twitter pile-ons In Shirley Jackson\u2019s 1948 short story The Lottery, the inhabitants of a small town gather every year to randomly stone someone to death. If only Jackson had known about Twitter. It\u2019s much more efficient. One recent Twitter pile-on started when a woman in South Dakota questioned the literary merit of a young adult (YA) novel her alma mater had considered assigning as student reading. The book\u2019s outraged author \u2013 and her friends, successful writers who ought to know better \u2013 spurred her fans into a mob, which hounded her onetime critic into hiding. It seems fitting that the worst online witch-hunts often involve the YA literary community. After all, many YA novels are set in sinister, near-future dystopias, so readers feel naturally at home on Twitter. But today\u2019s stone-throwers are often tomorrow\u2019s targets. Does that never occur to them? Or, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, do they feed others to a crocodile, hoping it eats them last? JOC 3 At-home DNA tests Just did a DNA test \u2013 turns out I\u2019m 100% a moron who should have thought a little harder about the privacy implications of the at-home genetic testing boom. While sales are finally starting to slow, the last three years have been a bonanza for the genomics industry. More than 26 million people have shelled out for DNA kits from companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry. Some have discovered siblings they never knew they had; others that they are 0.5% Native American and promptly started referring to themselves as a \u201cwoman of colour\u201d. I discovered little of interest but now my intimate information is stuck on a database forever, governed by an ambiguous privacy policy and getting shared with all number of third parties. And I didn\u2019t just compromise my own privacy; if you do a DNA test your relatives become easily identifiable. Which means they\u2019ll have a much harder time forging a successful career as a serial killer. AM 4 Ugly shoes Style-wise, we made some weird calls in the 2010s. It was the decade of fast fashion, of festival wear, of the forehead donut (you didn\u2019t forget the forehead donut, did you?).

In 2013 there began a craze for fur-lined Birkenstock-style sandals, and after that, things pretty much became a collective fever dream of bejewelled Crocs, the Seinfeldian silhouette of the Balenciaga Triple S, Yeezys, orthopedic-looking Gucci sandals and the occasional Ugg Fluff Slide \u2013 a debauched, \u201coutdoor slipper\u201d fetish-object type thing. We may have been losing our minds, but at least we were supporting our arches. Oh yes, our feet were comfortable in the 2010s \u2013 but at what cost? Adrienne M 5 \u2018Smart\u2019 homes It is one of the bleaker ironies of the decade that even as trust in technology companies plummeted, tens of millions of Americans invited Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook to install always-on listening devices in their homes. A quarter of US adults now have a \u201csmart speaker\u201d in their homes, a truly astonishing example of our collective willingness to trade privacy for marginal convenience. (Is finding out the weather in the morning without picking up your phone really worth the risk that a contractor for Amazon is currently judging whether or not your girlfriend is faking her orgasm?) And that\u2019s just the surveillance that consumers are subjecting themselves, too. The other half of the equation is the vast network of smart doorbells and security cameras that homeowners are increasingly training on unsuspecting neighbors, pedestrians, delivery people, and trick-or-treaters. Thanks to Amazon\u2019s aggressive courting of law enforcement agencies, Ring users are being deputized into a deeply dystopian public-private spying partnership. The unexamined life may not be worth living, but the un-surveilled life certainly is. Do yourself a favor and start the 2020s by dumbing down your home. JCW 6 The Instant Pot The inventors of the Instant Pot are geniuses. They took ye olde pressure cooker, one of the least sexy kitchen appliances of all time, stuck the word instant on it, and presented it as some kind of revolutionary new product. There\u2019s now one in basically every millennial kitchen, including mine. Within about five minutes of buying it, I realised I\u2019d been had. There\u2019s nothing \u201cinstant\u201d or simple about it at all. The thing has about 90 buttons on it and is vastly more complicated that cooking food the old-fashioned way. \u201cBut you can make yoghurt in it!\u201d its acolytes roar. Yep, if you have 12 hours to spare you can. You can also just buy yoghurt from the shop. And don\u2019t even get me started on its \u201coatmeal\u201d setting. If you need a bulky and expensive gadget to make porridge, you and the Instant Pot deserve each other. AM 7 Athleisure Like a sweat-wicking, four-way-stretch plague, athleisure spread across the world in the 2010s. A style trend for people who want to suggest they are just about to do 90 minutes of hot yoga on a bike but are too lazy for buttons, no brunch is now complete without a posse of unathletic poseurs trussed up like gaudy sausages in eye-popping hi-tech fabrics. Where did it start? Some blame yoga \u2013 and why not? \u2013 but people have been doing yoga for 2,500 years without $138 Inner Expanse Lululemon leggings and a $52 Free to Be Serene bra. Will it ever end? No. Athleisure respects neither age, physique nor gender \u2013 Lululemon plans to double its mens sales by 2023 and Under Armour has firmly established itself as the premier fashion brand for men who prefer to look like giant toddlers. But athleisure does get one thing right. By sending confused signals \u2013 simultaneously screaming \u201cI am going to the gym\u201d and \u201cI have given up\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect uniform for our age of anxiety. DR 8 Clean eating This decade of self-optimization has terrorized us with a myriad of trends meant to bring us to the best version of ourselves. Perhaps none is more insidious than the trend of \u201cclean eating\u201d, whose amorphous contours leave adherents constantly in search of virtuous new super foods, usually hawked by some better version of ourselves vlogging their dinner to their followers. The truth is you will never eat \u201cclean\u201d enough. You will only be caught in a spiral of perpetually more extreme diets, eliminating more and more foods that don\u2019t make the cut, until you find yourself evangelizing the benefits of eating only raw beef or bananas. In 2020, unsubscribe from the madness, settle back with a glass of wine and allow yourself a few chips. It will induce more happiness than the most virtuous acai bowl. JG 9. Insta filters If you haven\u2019t cocked your head slightly to the left, wine glass in hand, clinking glasses in a cheers motion, back and forth on repeat, did you even drink said wine? Is your kid even cute without that cat filter on their face? If you have had to ask yourself these questions, you\u2019re not alone. Face filters weren\u2019t made in the last decade \u2013 people have been taking sepia-toned photos since the beginning of being alternative \u2013 but the 2010s was the decade in which face filters ruined everything, including your self-worth (some cameras automatically blur over your imperfections when you try to take a selfie). Mystery over the ageing process has also gone out the window \u2013 if you want to know whether bae is a keeper in 2019, just whack their photo into FaceApp. At least we have worked out some of life\u2019s most pressing questions, like: I wonder what I\u2019d look like as a man. PN 9 TV reboots No one asked for a Full House reboot starring suburban moms with first world problems like Aunt Becky. Not even the Olsen twins would touch that dumpster fire of a TV show with a 10ft pole. The idea of rebooting your favorite show or movie is nice in theory, but this decade we have seen the negative effects of clinging to nostalgia in flops like this year\u2019s Charlie\u2019s Angels and 2014\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (yikes). Live-action Disney movies could have been incredible had they not matched the animated films frame by frame. I felt like I paid $17.50 to watch the Animal Planet version of The Lion King in a theater. Likewise, 2019\u2019s Aladdin was a cringeworthy crossover of Bollywood and B-roll footage from Homeland (Arabs and Indians are not interchangeable, Hollywood). I still carry a torch for Ethan Craft, so I haven\u2019t quite ruled out Lizzie McGuire 2.0. Yet I fear if it\u2019s anything like the Gilmore Girls reboot, A Year in the Life, I will walk away confused, disappointed and questioning my taste in television. The wise baboon called Rafiki once said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s in the past.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly where these series and movies should stay. ES 10 Viral tourism Viral tourism is a great example of how Instagram has completely warped our collective sense of reality. Thanks to the rise of travel influencers, we now have too many people flocking to the same beauty spots in places such as Arizona, Iceland, Thailand and California \u2013 sometimes with disastrous and destructive consequences. Tourist hotspots have always been a thing \u2013 there are photos of the Victorians posing in front of the pyramids. But there\u2019s still something profoundly sad about how specific and repetitive holiday pictures have become, with many taken in the exact same place, at the same angle and with similar filters. And if you have ever been to any of these places where nature has gone viral, you\u2019ll notice that many visitors spend more time experiencing the place through their phones than not. What\u2019s the point? MB 11 Workout cults A brief glance through the decade\u2019s films show we have had more than a passing interest in cults. But joining an actual cult has downsides: alienation from loved ones, orgies, poverty, ingestion of strong hallucinogens and even mass murder (although, in fairnesss, some of those could be seen as upsides). So it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that many of us decided to join a more palatable form of cult, in the form of specialised exercise classes. CrossFit, SoulCycle and, most recently, Peloton offered the charismatic leaders, creepy evangelism and clean living of certain cults \u2013 and, if we\u2019re going deeper, a belief system in society\u2019s where religion is on the decline \u2013 without the bit where you have to kill people (having a heart attack on a stationary bike doesn\u2019t count). Instead, save your money and go for a run. Or join an actual cult \u2013 they\u2019re free! TL 12 Social media challenges This decade\u2019s social media challenges have always had strange, masochistic elements to them, whether it\u2019s the deceptively hard cinnamon challenge, the potentially fatal fainting challenge or the truly messed up Tide Pod challenge (and who can forget the Momo challenge?). There were altruistic offshoots like 2014\u2019s ALS ice bucket challenge, which was arguably the biggest of them all. It did a lot of good, but unfortunately it was something of a Pandora\u2019s box, as it was the first to get the attention so many celebrities \u2013 leading to some of the most painful name-dropping and showing off of the decade. Without the ice bucket challenge, there probably wouldn\u2019t have been this year\u2019s bottle-cap challenge, which wasn\u2019t raising awareness of anything \u2013 you just had to kick the cap off a bottle. It was entertaining the first couple of times, but it quickly became a highly competitive clout-off for celebs, reaching an obscenely luxe nadir when Kendall Jenner posted it while riding a jet ski against a soft pink sunset, captioned: \u201cyou asked for it @haileybieber\u2026\u201d\u201d MB 13 Seltzer water Here\u2019s a dumb thing to spend a lot of money on: water, but with bubbles. Seltzer water used to be a treat; now it feels like a human right \u2013 two of my former workplaces provided it free of charge in unlimited quantities. In the earlier part of the decade, sparkling water demand grew by 54% in four years. Then, there was a 210% growth in the hard seltzer market just between 2018 and this year, according to a Nielsen report (thank you, White Claw). The trend has also inspired YouTube hits such as LaCroix Boi, and an entire summer of drinking while feeling healthy. Why is this so bad, you ask? For one, seltzer captures a market somewhere between water and soda, which means new types of wasted cans and bottles hitting our landfills. There\u2019s the detriment to our bodies: seltzer is more acidic than regular water, which could wear down tooth enamel. And there\u2019s the issue of supply chain ethics; take, for example, the popular DIY seltzer brand SodaStream, which many pro-Palestine people boycotted because the factory was set up in West Bank. That leaves us with the most important flavor of seltzer there is: late capitalism. AR",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson must overhaul the system for deciding where flood-defence funding is spent and launch an emergency response unit to prevent a repeat of the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage caused by the November floods, leading politicians have said. Nearly 100 flood warnings were in place across much of England on Sunday, hampering the Christmas getaway, with towns and villages deluged in Kent and East Sussex. Dan Jarvis, the elected mayor of the Sheffield city region, called on the government to establish a \u201cCobra for the north\u201d that would be chaired by a cabinet minister and kick into action as soon as floods hit the region. He said the prime minister had privately agreed to help convene a dedicated emergency response group to react more quickly to widespread flooding after he was criticised for his slow response to the devastation. Jarvis said the emergency unit should be chaired by Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, and bring together local and national government agencies for a detailed postmortem of the floods that affected more than 4,200 homes across South Yorkshire and hundreds more in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. Simon Greaves, the Labour leader of Bassetlaw council, where nearly 200 homes were badly damaged, said: \u201cIt would be a scandal if the government response to this crisis is simply devoted to a mopping-up exercise and a grant here and a grant there when actually there are people\u2019s homes that need to be saved from flooding in the future. \u201cThere will be a need for multimillion-pound investment for flood defences without any doubt if we\u2019re going to avoid a catastrophe of the same scale.\u201d The Environment Agency put 88 flood warnings in place stretching from Middlesbrough down to the south coast on Sunday. There are a further 227 flooding alerts in place, meaning there is a risk of flash flooding and standing water. About 90 properties have been flooded: about 60 in the south-east and about 30 in Devon and Cornwall, the agency said. In interviews with the Guardian nearly two months on from the floods, political leaders and officials in many of the worst-affected areas said they were dismayed at the government\u2019s slow response to the crisis and that there had been no high-level discussion about how it could be prevented in future. Council officials are calculating the cost of the damage but the final bill is expected to run into millions of pounds, with vital infrastructure including roads, bridges and power plants affected when a month\u2019s worth of rain fell in 24 hours in large parts of northern England. Jarvis suggested there were problems with Flood Re, the government-backed scheme set up in the aftermath of 2015\u2019s Storm Desmond to provide insurance for domestic properties deemed at significant risk of flooding. \u201cI don\u2019t think this scheme has worked,\u201d he said, suggesting that central government had a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to help those unable to get insurance. Jarvis also said he wanted the Environment Agency to carry out a review of what happened in the Don valley, to work out \u201cwhether upgrades to flood defences in Sheffield had a knock-on effect downstream. People have suggested that was the case but no one knows for certain.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat I want to know is where do we need to strengthen these defences? Otherwise it will happen again. It will require significant investment, but it is a vital piece of work.\u201d The agency has said an average of \u00a31bn a year will need to be invested in flood defences as well as a wider programme making all infrastructure flood resilient by 2050. The Conservative party pledged in its manifesto to spend \u00a34bn over the next five years on a new flood defence programme, a commitment repeated in the Queen\u2019s speech on 19 December. Greaves called for an overhaul of the system for allocating taxpayers\u2019 money to flood defence schemes, which experts have said favour wealthier areas at the expense of the less well-off. To secure funding, a flood prevention scheme has to demonstrate that it delivers more in benefits than it costs to implement and maintain. It does this by calculating the economic losses that would be avoided by protecting property and infrastructure \u2013 tilting the system in favour of more expensive property and wealthier areas. Greaves said the system was \u201crigged against\u201d places such as Worksop in Nottinghamshire, whose entire high street and surrounding homes were deluged when the River Ryton burst its banks last month.

This is why we are investing record amounts to help protect communities across the nation from the threat of flooding, using both natural flood management techniques and traditional defences. \u201cWe spend money where it is needed most \u2013 with similar funding heading to high-risk areas across both the north and south of England.\u201d",

We have record investments in renewable energy and I look forward to welcoming more of that. Emissions on average under our government are 50 million tonnes lower than under the previous government, and power prices as the ACCC showed yesterday coming down by $65 a year as a direct result of our policies. But what I won\u2019t do Monique is I\u2019ll never panic. I don\u2019t think panic is a way to manage anything.

In South Australia there are two watch and act fires: the Cudlee Creek fire and the Duncan fire. In WA there is one emergency warning fire in the goldfields region, in parts of Cundeelee. In Victoria, two watch and act emergency warnings remain in place for Tamboo Crossing and Brookville. Firefighters are using the milder conditions to help build stronger control lines but, as we have been saying for the past two days, without meaningful rain the fires will continue. Stay safe, everyone. An emergency warning has been issued in WA\u2019s goldfields region. Here\u2019s the situation in Victoria, via AAP. It\u2019s all about preparing for what is to come, with milder weather over Christmas allowing firefighters time to strengthen containment lines: East Gippsland bushfires burning since 21 November have already burnt through 50,000 hectares. \u201cWe suspect these fires will burn for some weeks, if not months,\u201d CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said. \u201cWe have a few days of respite where we\u2019ll be putting in stronger control lines. \u201cWe will try to build this control line so that fire doesn\u2019t run out of there and we can fight it within these lines, but the reality is that these fires are active and very dangerous.\u201d Two watch and act emergency warnings remain in place for Tamboo Crossing and Brookville, with heavy smoke present throughout the Tambo Valley. Air quality around the area is expected to be very poor to hazardous over the next 24 hours. An air quality warning was issued on Monday in Melbourne and other parts of the state. Comberton has been downgraded from emergency warning to watch and act. There are now no emergency warning-level fires in NSW. Just two watch and act: the Comberton fire and the Grose Valley fire. We have updated the map again so you can see the sheer size of the amount of land in Australia ravaged by bushfires. We are now up to 3.6m hectares burned in NSW and Queensland since the start of the 2019 fire season. I spoke to Dale Adams, a lieutenant at the Eden Hills Country Fire Service, who took this photo of a koala meeting a firefighter as a fire rages in the background. He said the photo was taken at Lobethal on Friday while protecting homes. Two koalas wandered out of the bush seeking assistance. \u201cUp behind us there were a couple of houses under threat so we were working to protect them from ember attack and the firefront and they stepped out of the bush seeking help,\u201d he said. Adams said it was common for koalas to seek help from firefighters in these situations. The koalas were given water and moved to a safer location. Firefighters lost track of them and they were eventually forced to pull out of the property. Good evening everyone, Amy Corderoy handing over to Josh Taylor now. A \u201cwatch and act\u201d warning remained in place for the Adelaide Hills fire, with the CFS worried about increasing temperatures in the coming days. By the weekend, the mercury will again be nudging 40C, raising fire-risk fears. Fires are also still burning on Kangaroo Island, where one home has been confirmed lost. Assessment teams were still checking on other properties. So far about 40,000ha have been burnt across the state, including 25,000ha in the Adelaide Hills. One person, 69-year-old Ron Selth, died in that fire as he tried to defend his property at Charleston. Three more remain in hospital with burns, including noted horse trainer John Glatz, who is in a critical but stable condition. Country Fire Service crews have worked to contain flare-ups across the Adelaide Hills as the losses from the devastating bushfire mount and deteriorating weather conditions loom. Small areas still burning within the fire\u2019s 127km perimeter roared back into life on Monday but were dealt with quickly, the CFS still having about 200 firefighters on the ground, AAP reports. The incidents came as the losses from the blaze continued to rise, with 86 homes now confirmed destroyed, along with almost 500 other buildings. The number of vehicles lost had jumped to 278. Agricultural losses are also growing, with about 1100ha of vineyards thought destroyed or damaged, equal to about a third of the area\u2019s grape production, while cherry farmers were hard hit. Premier Steven Marshall visited the fireground on Monday and said there was still much work to be done to fully contain the fire and to help the victims and wider communities. Western Australia\u2019s firefighting aerial fleet has dropped 8.9m litres of water so far this bushfire season, which is more than half the water used for the entirety of 2018-19. The recent Yanchep bushfire alone accounted for about 4.7m litres of water, emergency services minister Francis Logan said. It is also the driest start to the southern season in more than 40 years, AAP reports. The Georgia Peach aircrane, which has been fighting fires in Greece, arrived in Perth on Monday. WA\u2019s aerial fleet now consists of 33 rotary and fixed-wing suppression and aerial intelligence aircraft. The federal government has announced it will underwrite two new gas-fired power stations, with Scott Morrison saying it may still greenlight coal-fired generation for Queensland and New South Wales. Even as Australia suffers through a record-breaking heatwave Morrison said the government would continue to explore all power options and would not be deterred by \u201clots of shouting noises\u201d and instead would listen to \u201cthose quiet still voices\u201d. While the number of active fires has declined, this map from My Fire Watch shows how many fires are still active across mainland Australia. The picture shows fire hotspots that are within 0-12 hours old in red, and those that are 12-24 hours old in orange. My Fire Watch is a project run by a collaboration between Landgate and Edith Cowan University. Scott Morrison\u2019s visit to bushfire ravaged NSW has divided locals who battled a \u201cfireball\u201d while the prime minister was on holiday in Hawaii. Morrison today took an aerial tour of the bushland where the Gospers Mountain megafire destroyed dozens of buildings over the weekend, before arriving in Mudgee to meet evacuated residents and NSW Rural Fire Service members. Morrison spoke with locals staying at the Mudgee Evacuation Centre who were nervously waiting to hear if their homes - saved once already on the weekend - were again about to be in the path of the megafire after it changed direction. Ilford family John and Nova Cunningham and their three children arrived at the Mudgee Evacuation Centre at 11pm on Saturday. \u201cThere was a fireball that came through, it was this huge roar and that\u2019s when it just hit everybody and we had to leave,\u201d Nova Cunningham told the pool reporters on tour with the PM. John Cunningham said he thought it was \u201cgood\u201d Morrison had visited but felt he shouldn\u2019t have gone on holiday last week. \u201cI believe everyone is entitled to a holiday, but I think as the voice of the people he probably should have stayed\u201d. Running Stream farmers Diana, 73, and Keith, 76, Rutter said Morrison shouldn\u2019t have had to cut his holiday short. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have come back from holiday early, because he\u2019s going to be needed so much more in the new year,\u201d Diana Rutter said. The bushfire zone covers about 30% of the 1100ha of vineyards that make up the premier Adelaide Hills wine region, the Advertiser reports. What a sad but iconically Australian moment this photograph, from the Eden Hills Country Fire Service\u2019s Facebook page, captures. Air quality across Adelaide has fallen to hazardous levels because of smoke from the bushfires in the Adelaide Hills, the Environment Protection Authority says. It says pollution levels in the city are two to seven times normal levels. Adelaide\u2019s central business district peaked at 200 micrograms of PM 10 particles (particles up to 10 micrograms across) early on Monday. The normal level is 50 micrograms. In suburban Kensington, levels rose to 350 micrograms. EPA boss Keith Baldry said the smoke haze was the result of evening gully winds pushing smoke from the fire ground, combined with calm conditions and an inversion layer that trapped the smoke overnight. Air quality in the Adelaide metropolitan area is likely to improve on Monday afternoon, before the haze returns overnight, AAP reports. SA Health said the smoke could pose a health risk, particularly for people with lung or heart conditions. \u201cHot weather and poor air quality are a dangerous combination and we are urging people to stay indoors, stay hydrated and reduce their exposure to smoky air,\u201d acting chief public health officer Chris Lease said. \u201cSmoke particles can aggravate existing health problems such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma and heart conditions.\u201d Some good news at last for the bushfire victims: ANZ has extended its bushfire relief package to take in customers across the country. The package, which allows customers hit by the fires to suspend loan repayments and avoid fees, was previously available to those in NSW and southern Queensland. ANZ\u2019s general managing director of retail banking, Kath Bray, said the bank had also given extra paid leave to employees who were volunteering fighting fires or performing other emergency services. Under the relief package, customers can suspend repayments on loans, including credit cards, for up to three months. The bank says it will also give interest rate cuts to customers who are \u201cexperiencing extreme financial distress in areas impacted by the fires\u201d. It will also waive fees to restructure business loans for customers hit by the fires and allow depositors to crack term deposits open early without penalty. CBA, NAB and Westpac also have disaster relief packages for customers in NSW and Queensland bushfire areas. Cricket Australia is preparing for smoke from bushfires to impact play during Sydney\u2019s New Year\u2019s Test match between Australia and New Zealand. On Saturday, a Big Bash League fixture in Canberra was abandoned because of poor air quality. Reduced visibility on the field, caused by smoke from the bushfires currently ravaging parts of NSW, is the primary issue that could put players and umpires at risk of injury at the 3-7 January fixture. Spectators could also face health risks. Young Australians on social media are mocking Scott Morrison and expressing their anger over his six-day holiday to Hawaii during Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis. The online parodies of Scott Morrison, including a video with Kourtney Kardashian saying \u201cWorking is not my top priority\u201d, are going viral, Naaman Zhou reports. Heatwave update: the extraordinary nationwide burst that gave Australia its hottest three days on record between Tuesday and Thursday continued into Friday before dipping slightly on the weekend, the Bureau of Meteorology says. The average maximum temperature across the country on Friday was 40.3C. Before last week, that would have made it the equal hottest day recorded, alongside 7 January 2013. But that mark had been broken on Tuesday (initially reported as 40.9C after a preliminary assessment by the bureau, now confirmed as 41.0C), then smashed on Wednesday (41.9C). Thursday fell back to 41C. It means the country endured four of its five hottest days in a row. The average maximum fell to 39.1C on Saturday before climbing back to 39.6C on Sunday. Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese says the federal government should be playing a bigger role coordinating the fire response. Albanese questioned PM Scott Morrison\u2019s leadership, saying a Coag meeting \u2013 to discuss the development of a new national strategy for disaster preparedness and the appropriate funding by governments for emergency services \u2013 must be brought forward. The prime minister \u201ccan do three things immediately, which is to bring forward the Coag meeting, meet the former fire chiefs and do something now to provide support for those volunteer firefighters who have been in the field for such a long time,\u201d AAP reports Albanese said. \u201cThis is a national issue that requires some form of national coordination and national leadership.\u201d But Morrison rejected this, saying he did not accept the proposition that Coag had to meet for things to get done, because options and proposals for improving fire management were already being worked on. \u201cOur fire services are responding to this fire better than last time, and the next time it will be better still with the resources and the technology and the other things that we can put in place,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s no need for knee-jerk responses.\u201d For many people with friends and family in the bushfire zones, the feeling of helplessness is overwhelming. Gavin Fenwick, son of Colin Todd, a Balmoral local who was featured in our story on Friday about the town, said he drew this cartoon to help cope with these feelings. Colin and his partner, Sandy Lockwood, who is a prominent Australian potter, are still waiting to establish if their Balmoral home and studio has survived the fires. There are fears the rare and ancient Wollemi pine has been caught up in the fires that are sweeping the Blue Mountains. The Wollemi pines are more than 200m years old and were thought completely extinct until they were discovered by bushwalkers in 1994 in a small grove in the Blue Mountains. The discovery makes the pines some of NSW\u2019s most precious flora. They are listed as critically endangered by the UN and their whereabouts have been kept secret from the public to keep them safe. But as the Gospers Mountain megafire burns through the area, Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph has reported that three of four of their locations may be in danger. The NSW Department of Environment is remaining tightlipped but said it was \u201cdoing everything we can to protect them\u201d. \u201cFire activity across the Blue Mountains and Wollemi National Park is ongoing,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to protect them. Their ongoing survival depends on their location remaining protected. \u201cThe Wollemi pines have survived for over 200 million years and are not found anywhere else in the world. They are an important part of our heritage.\u201d Many more homes could have been lost in the NSW town of Balmoral on Saturday when the RFS firefighting crew ran out of water. Guardian Australia\u2019s Helen Davidson reports flames began reaching 200m above the treetops and the town, which is on tank water, simply did not have enough to meet demand. As village Rural Fire Service brigade captain Brendon O\u2019Connor tells it: We were desperately trying to get more water into us, desperately calling for more to come in. A member from another brigade spoke to his boss about getting another truck into us really quick. That company saved a lot of homes. The NSW Rural Fire Service says the scale of the bushfires is \u201cunprecedented\u201d for this point in the season. The total area burned in NSW has reached 3.41m hectares, according to the RFS. \u201cTo put it in perspective, in the past few years we have had a total area burned for the whole season of about 280,000ha,\u201d RFS spokeswoman Angela Burford said. \u201cThis year we\u2019re at 3.41m and we are only halfway through the season.\u201d The total number of houses destroyed currently sits at 829, but damage assessments of areas affected by the catastrophic conditions on Saturday are still underway. Burford said that number could increase by \u201cup to 100\u201d. Morrison also responded to this tweet from Greta Thunberg: He said Australia would set policies based on Australia\u2019s national interests. He also strongly rejected rumours that had been floating around on Twitter that he went to New York around the time of the Hawaii holiday for the opening of the Hillsong church in New York City with Brian Houston. \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish ... If you\u2019re going to ask me a question about something as specific as that, you might actually tell me the source of what it is based on. So someone, somewhere, has started some rumour about apparently me being in New York and we\u2019re going to ask that in the middle of the bushfires? I mean, seriously!\u201d Morrison has been asked whether communities can wait until the Coag meeting in March for decisions on policies around the fires. Morrison says he doesn\u2019t accept the premise of the question, and argues decisions are being made now, for financial support and for help from defence. He says decisions around coordination will be made at Coag. That includes on whether volunteers should be given the resources they need. But he isn\u2019t keen to talk about paying the volunteers because he says it\u2019s a bit like meals on wheels. \u201cWe need to understand that if it is fighting fires or patrolling our beach or supporting Meals on Wheels or any volunteer SES arrangement which supports during floods or storms, Australia\u2019s system all around the country has always, and will always, depend on having a large volunteer force to deal with these issues.\u201d Morrison is claiming he and his deputy Michael McCormack are on the same page when it comes to climate change policy. McCormack said the other day that more needed to be done, but Morrison has ruled out changes to climate change policy. Morrison is arguing more is being done as part of the government\u2019s policy position. I guess it just depends on how you decide what the starting point for \u2018more\u2019 is? Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking at a media conference in Mudgee in New South Wales. He said he flew across the Bells Line out through Wollemi and saw the absolute incineration of land and homes. Morrison isn\u2019t saying anything particularly new at this stage, just a lot of platitudes. It\u2019s his third visit of the day to one of these places. Melissa O\u2019Dwyer, wife of Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, and Jess Hayes, the fianc\u00e9e of Geoff Keaton, had children born just four days apart. The Daily Telegraph has reported today how the women want their children to remember them as heroes. O\u2019Dwyer says she is taking comfort from her husband\u2019s fellow volunteers. Our kids have got all these aunties and uncles now [from the fire service] and that gives me a lot of comfort. They can hear stories about their dads and how mighty they have been.\u201d The Wingecarribee Shire Council has organised to take residents of fire-ravaged Balmoral and Buxton back to inspect their homes this afternoon. The council announced on Facebook that it will provide buses for people from directly affected residences, leaving from two local RSLs around 3pm today. Staff from local police, emergency services and support agencies will also be on board the buses. Public access to these villages remains restricted. RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers estimates more than 3m hectares of land has now been destroyed in the NSW bushfires. You will see bigger fire seasons in the 1970s, but that was when there was a lot of grassland out in the west of the state growing. It was mostly grassland, and at the moment, given the drought, there is no grass out there to burn. This being three million hectares of forested areas, we shouldn\u2019t underestimate how much of the natural environment has been burnt, and that has got serious ecological impacts, as well as the fire impact as well. That will be felt for years to come. NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers says it appears about 100 homes were lost to the weekend\u2019s ferocious bushfires. I think it will be another 24 hours before we get an accurate number but it is fair to say it is around 100. Backburning has been conducted around Warragamba, which remains under threat from the Green Wattle Creek fire. Kazan Brown, a Gundungurra traditional owner who spoke to Guardian Australia last week, said the fire was predicted to hit them on Saturday night but the wind didn\u2019t reach them. She took these photos from Silverdale Hill, which is behind the town at Warragamba. The fire is still a fair distance from them, Brown says, but they have been warned by the local RFS brigade that this coming Saturday will also be very bad. Premier Gladys Berejiklian says NSW communities including Dargon and Balmoral ravaged by bushfires could \u201ctake years to rebuild\u201d. But she denied there was any shortage of supplies to fight the fires, saying RFS volunteers had the resources they needed. We have made sure our emergency services personnel have all the resources they need, whether it is equipment, whether it is support, whether it is counselling services \u2013 whatever is required to support them. She told a press conference that local firefighters were unwilling to leave their posts to take breaks. They are fighting to save their properties, their neighbours\u2019 properties ... We need the combination of local expertise, but also giving relief to the locals who find it difficult to leave their posts, especially when they know their communities the best. We have always said to the commissioner and deputy commissioner if there is more we need to do, we will. NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers has warned against complacency in the cooler weather. He told a press briefing the RFS would attempt to take advantage of the cooler conditions over the coming days by undertaking hazard reduction burns, but \u201cthe threat is by no means passed for the Blue Mountains\u201d. There is a lot of fire in the area and there is a lot more work to do. Hopefully, if crews can get these backburns in place, we can start to reduce the threat to the Blue Mountains. But I think it is fair to say that the next few days will be very important to try and get those burns in place and then hopefully it won\u2019t be so much of a risk as we go into the next batch of warm weather. Morrison has also downplayed claims that his office lied about his overseas holiday. Paul Karp writes: Although several journalists reported that the prime minister\u2019s office had denied he was in Hawaii, Morrison deflected a question about the lack of transparency by claiming it was an \u201cissue the media\u2019s got very excited about and my political opponents are seeking to exploit\u201d. Scott Morrison has claimed climate change is \u201cas important now\u201d \u2013 amid an extended bushfire crisis and a record-breaking heatwave \u2013 as it was at the election and denied that the government was split over whether to improve Australia\u2019s policy response, writes Paul Karp. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay has released this video with the member for the Blue Mountains and spokeswoman on emergency services, Trish Doyle. McKay says: I\u2019ve been asking for 10 days now what defence force personnel is actually helping with the fire and where are they, how many? ... The defence personnel could actually be used to go door to door and help people prepare their properties. The Currowan fire has merged with the Tianjana fire. \u201cNo, Gladys, we haven\u2019t been destroyed,\u201d says the NSW town of Balmoral. In case you missed it, here are Helen Davidson and Jessica Hromas reporting from the fire ground in NSW yesterday: The air is eerily still. There is no wind. There are no birds. There is no natural noise, just the distant chatter of helicopters in the sky, flying between water source and flames. New South Wales 110 fires, of which almost 60 are uncontained. 2 volunteer firefighters, Geoff Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, killed as well as four others on the mid-north coast: Vivian Chaplain, 69, and George Nole, Julie Fletcher, 63, and an unnamed 58-year-old man. 100 buildings destroyed over weekend alone. Smoke continues to affect Sydney. Fires: Gospers Mountain blaze (areas hardest hit include Lithgow and along the Bells Line of Road in the upper Blue Mountains); Green Wattle Creek fire (devastating Wollondilly Shire villages of Buxton and Bargo, and wiping out small town of Balmoral); Currowan blaze (has hit communities near Nerriga, north of Batemans Bay). Victoria Two blazes still burning uncontrolled in Tambo Crossing in East Gippsland and Hotspur, Digby, in the western district. Bushfires in East Gippsland burning since Thursday Cooler conditions have given firefighters a reprieve but smoke from the fires and from NSW expected to make air quality hazardous. South Australia Huge fire burning in Adelaide Hills. One killed (Ron Selth, 69), three more in hospital with burns. 25,000 hectares burned within a 127km perimeter. 72 homes confirmed lost along with 404 other buildings and 227 vehicles over the weekend. Significant losses to crops, including vineyards and hundreds of sheep killed. Most concern centred on difficult terrain around the Kangaroo Creek Reservoir at Castambul. Queensland About 60 fires burning within containment lines across the state. Severe fire conditions in the central highlands and Coalfields and upper Flinders region in central Queensland. Cooler conditions, some rain expected around Christmas Eve. Smoke haze from NSW fires. Western Australia Lives and homes threatened by bushfires in Perth\u2019s Hills region around Roleystone. in the city\u2019s south-east and a massive blaze at Yanchep, north of Perth, last week before being downgraded. Firefighters battled heatwave conditions for much of the six-day fire, saving thousands of properties. One house and a Yanchep petrol station were destroyed; about 13,000 hectares were burned. Tasmania Two bushfires north of Launceston were brought under control at the end of November. Northern Territory NT last saw major fires in September when there were nine active fire grounds. (Thanks to AAP for the summary). I think everyone in the country is united in the hope that these easing conditions will help our firefighters get on top of the fires, and maybe get a little bit of a break over Christmas. A summary of the crisis so far, according to AAP. Almost 200 fires burning across the country. Seven people have been killed. More than 900 homes lost in this year\u2019s bushfire season: NSW \u2013 789; Queensland \u2013 40; South Australia \u2013 72; Western Australia \u2013 1. Thousands of outbuildings destroyed or damaged, stock and crops destroyed. 2,000 koalas feared killed Hi Amy Corderoy taking over the blog from Calla Wahlquist this morning. The prime minister Scott Morrison has characterised the push for him to do more on climate change in response to the fires crisis as a \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d panic that he will not be intimidated by. Here is is full response to journalist Monique Wright\u2019s question about whether community feeling has changed in regard to climate change given what has happened over the past week. I think the need to take action as we are on climate change and the science of that is as true as we went to the last election as it is to now. And the plans that we have are as important now as it is to then, we will beat our Kyoto targets, we will meet our Paris targets and I intend to beat those as well. We have record investments in renewable energy and I look forward to welcoming more of that. Emissions on average under our government are 50 million tonnes lower than under the previous government, and power prices as the ACCC showed yesterday coming down by $65 a year as a direct result of our policies. But what I won\u2019t do Monique is I\u2019ll never panic. I don\u2019t think panic is a way to manage anything. The urge for panic that has come from some, often politically motivated, to pursue a particular agenda, is not something I\u2019m ever intimidated by, or distracted by. The full interview has been posted by Sunrise on Twitter: Speaking of emissions, Guardian Australia\u2019s environment editor Adam Morton reports that Australia\u2019s actual emissions are \u201csignificantly higher than previously believed for the years when Labor was in power, and no longer rise each year since the Coalition repealed the carbon price\u201d. SA premier Steven Marshall said rapid damage assessment teams began working on Kangaroo Island on Sunday and are moving through fire-affected areas, which means that the number of homes and buildings confirmed destroyed or damaged is likely to increase. As of 8pm last night, Marshall told ABC 24, the number of homes destroyed were at 86, with 500 outbuildings and \u201chundreds of vehicles\u201d also destroyed. He said there was also \u201cextensive losses in terms of livestock animals, pets and massive crop damage, massive damage to vineyards. In total over 40,000 hectares completely destroyed here in SA in just three days. It is an extraordinary situation\u201d. Marshall was also asked about the climate emergency. He skirted a question about whether Scott Morrison\u2019s response had been adequate, but said that he was personally convinced of the link between a changing climate and worsening bushfires. Says Marshall: That is my opinion and that is the opinion of, I think, the the vast majority of scientists that exist. We have got to do everything we can to make ourselves more climate resilient and that is what we\u2019re doing in SA. SA has a strategy of net zero emissions by 2050. Victoria also has a strategy of net zero by 2050, and the ACT is aiming for net zero by 2045. We start the day\u2019s live coverage of the bushfire crisis with the news that the number of houses destroyed in the Cudlee Creek bushfire has been revised up to 86. South Australian premier Steven Marshall said on Monday that the full extent of the damage to the Adelaide Hills was still being assessed, but that a significant proportion of the 25,000ha burned included vineyards and apple and pear orchards. The man who died trying to defend his Charleston home in that fire has been identified as 69-year-old Ron Selth. Selth has been remembered by his family for his \u201cincredible, sometimes injury-causing hugs\u201d. Meanwhile, prime minister Scott Morrison says he will not be swayed by \u201cposturing\u201d on the climate emergency that is \u201ctaking advantage of natural disasters\u201d. Morrison said on Sunrise this morning: We won\u2019t engage in reckless and job-destroying and economy-crunching targets which have been seeking to be postured to us at the moment, taking advantage of natural disasters because no Australian would think that the direct policies of any single government in the world is directly linked to any fire event, that is not true. Morrison said the challenge of climate change had not changed since May, which is true. Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor had some thoughts on the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the government\u2019s response on climate change. You can read that here. Energy minister Angus Taylor repeated what appears to be the official government line that there is nothing unusual about the current bushfire crisis, saying in a Facebook post that there have \u201calways been\u201d bushfires. Here\u2019s part of that post: These fires have been a huge challenge and a disaster for so many, but it will rain again and the fires will go out. (And there\u2019ll be bushfires again, as there always have been.) We must pull together in times like these \u2013 not politicise or finger point \u2013 and that is my fundamental message as we go into Christmas. And finally, Greta Thunberg had this to say about Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis and lack of response to global heating.",

This tension lingers throughout as he tries to bury his instinctive reaction to his son\u2019s gentle insolence while trying, unsuccessfully, to seek some humanity or humour from the unknowable visitor Nancy Katz, played hysterically by the standup comic Martha Katz. I\u2019m not sure if another line has amused me this year quite as much as Charlie\u2019s son asking him to \u201cdo the thing with the knife\u201d over dinner in front of an understandably suspect Nancy and silently raging Charlie. Uncomfortably brushing it off, he eventually decides to explain his trick but it goes horribly, stomach-churningly wrong and he ends up bleeding profusely while trying, yet again, to pretend everything is fine.

Amy, out for two years but inexperienced, spends most of the film careening from confident and brash, in the presence of best friend Molly (Beanie Feldstein), to tongue-tied in front of Ryan (Victoria Ruesga), her crush of two years; when Ryan hands her the mic halfway through the song, the sound cuts out a fever pitch of nerves. But then Amy crushes it, nailing the song\u2019s ending and revealing to her classmates that, low-key, she can sing.</p> <p>This scene does an impressive amount in about a minute, namely: live out the fantasy that has occupied about 65% of my daydreams since age 13 (I can\u2019t sing), prove that Dever has ARRIVED, salute an ultimate banger of a song. But it also captures the warm invincibility at the bottom of your first drink, the high of leaning into someone else\u2019s confidence or of unlocking that fearlessness in yourself \u2013 the type of finely observed, wild yet grounded fun that made Booksmart one of the most resonant high school movies in a long time. <em>AH</em></p> <h2>The fuckbox - High Life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f841e2c70672811864c043daee521e0c156a129\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f841e2c70672811864c043daee521e0c156a129/0_3_4292_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Claire Denis\u2019s desolately beautiful science-fiction nightmare High Life premiered at the Toronto film festival, \u201cthe fuckbox scene\u201d became a brief but intense meme for the few on film Twitter who had seen it: in a film that was hard to describe and distil as a whole, it was the salacious detail singled out to pique others\u2019 interest. That\u2019s a reductive way to tease a film prickling with so many layers of philosophical and sensual detail, but once seen in context, it\u2019s also an entirely indelible image: Juliette Binoche, nude and scar-torn, entering a space-borne masturbation chamber, straddling a dildo seat and riding it until, as Lil Nas X might say, she can\u2019t no more. Performed with abandon by Binoche and shot with visceral candour by Denis \u2013 making a tensing, thrashing map of the actor\u2019s back alone \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most extraordinary sex scenes in modern cinema: an expression of female erotic autonomy that outlasts any early quips about it in the memory. <em>GL</em></p> <h2>The crying \u2013 Midsommar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14e6a5bbdb869ec303fb9962416c0851377c8d08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14e6a5bbdb869ec303fb9962416c0851377c8d08/353_0_3568_2141/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar is a portrait of how a toxic relationship quietly, but surely, unravels. At first it\u2019s subtle: Florence Pugh\u2019s Dani frets that she overburdens boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) with her own drama and mental health issues, and that her need for emotional support is unattractive. When her whole family dies suddenly, she\u2019s desperate to hold on to Christian. She appeases. She apologizes. She stifles her cries after Christian and his friends subtly pressure her into taking shrooms, as specters of her dead sister haunt her.</p> <p>The whole film is about Dani feeling silenced and invalidated by a man who views himself as the saddled victim. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so weirdly refreshing when, in Midsommar\u2019s terrifying climax, the H\u00e5rga women embrace Dani for who she is, cupping her face and encouraging her to sob as loudly as she wants. Crouched on the floor, they cry as one, and as their wails reach a communal crescendo, you see Dani finally finding some measure of healing. Sure, it\u2019s a crazy Swedish cult, but there Dani finally finds someone who actually acknowledges her agony. <em>GS</em></p> <h2>The tai chi - The Farewell</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8fd4f7c961e008c05667a32a7e4922ea296e367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8fd4f7c961e008c05667a32a7e4922ea296e367/167_0_2096_1258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The quiet sentimentality of Lulu Wang\u2019s charming sleeper hit shines brightest for me in a scene where twentysomething Billi (played by Oscar-buzzed Awkwafina) and her grandmother, Nai Nai, practice tai chi outside.</p> <p>Nai Nai coaches her granddaughter through some of the movements, lightly nagging Billi about practicing tai chi everyday in that cute, but kind of annoying, manner family members are known for. It\u2019s obvious Billi has no plans of practicing tai chi after this scene and doesn\u2019t deem it particularly useful. Then Nai Nai proudly and confidently credits the martial art for her continuing good health, a big smile on her face. Thing is: Billi\u2019s grandmother has terminal lung cancer but does not know it. So Billi performs the tai chi movements with a renewed energy, owed to the strange mixture of guilt, sadness and stress she feels over the secret illness. She pushes out bad energy and inhales good, yelling out an awkward, meek \u201cHai!\u201d</p> <p>An hour later, at the end of the film, we see Billi walking down the streets of south Williamsburg. She\u2019s still upset over her grandmother\u2019s cancer and visibly overwhelmed and stressed. Out of nowhere, she stops in the street, takes a deep breath and yells out a loud, reverberating \u201cHai!\u201d The circularity of the moment \u2013 Billi going from disinterest in tai chi to seeking relief through it \u2013 highlights how our families can arm us with specific tools to handle the stressors of life. It reminds me of the hours me and my late grandmother would spend putting together 1,000-piece puzzles. As a kid, I was confident I would <em>never</em> take part in such a boring, odious activity as an adult. Today, it\u2019s my favorite pastime. <em>AW</em></p> <h2>The confrontation \u2013 The Souvenir</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6a2b0af5261579eb8c0c79b1c2802ba732e67b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6a2b0af5261579eb8c0c79b1c2802ba732e67b7/0_116_2640_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Generally speaking, scenes in which lovers kiss and make up following an infraction are joyful affairs. They come at the close of a movie, following heart-rending misunderstandings that have left a happy ending in jeopardy. That\u2019s not the case in The Souvenir. After months of casual, incremental borrowing to fund his heroin habit, Anthony (Tom Burke) stages a robbery at the flat of young girlfriend Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne). This is purely to bankroll smack \u2013 not the luxe trip to Venice they embark on soon after, which she pays for, and during which she twigs what he\u2019s done.</p> <p>When they return to London, Julie asks and Anthony admits. But he\u2019s not sorry. He\u2019s wounded she has brought it up \u2013 his abhorrent behaviour compounded by this cavalier attitude. You\u2019re shocked, and relieved \u2013 surely she\u2019ll give him the boot?</p> <p>And she quietly forgives him. Anthony\u2019s arrogance and obfuscation, his hurt words about only doing what he needs to, in a world she wouldn\u2019t understand, which he\u2019s protecting her from, fall on appalling open ears. Blame is smoothly shifted. Repentant Julie strokes his foot and forgets her heirlooms.</p> <p>Joanna Hogg shoots the confrontation in one static shot; the couple sitting opposite in armchairs, until Julie bridges the gap. The viewer knew the truth would out \u2013 and assumed it would be a bigger scene. That it\u2019s not moves the relationship into new territory. You can no longer underestimate Anthony\u2019s actions \u2013 or his hold over Julie. The moment she reaches out in supplication is the chilling heart of a fairly scary film. <em>CS</em></p> <h2>The knife fight \u2013 John Wick 3</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v00zKyXbfD4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v00zKyXbfD4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ignore the whys (the film-makers did); basically, it\u2019s Keanu Reeves versus a bunch of faceless goons in a surprisingly tooled-up antiques shop, and for me, one of the most exhilaratingly gruesome action scenes in recent memory.</p> <p>It starts with a few gunmen, easily dispatched, but things really kick off when Reeves and an opponent realise they are in a corridor of glass cases packed with all manner of bladed weapons. So much glass-smashing, knife-throwing, shooting, stabbing, punching, kicking, grunting and limb-twisting ensues, you can barely keep track. It is brilliantly choreographed and executed, but what\u2019s so great is how messy it all looks. And painful. Nobody is neatly killed. Knives miss their targets. The deaths get ever-more cartoonishly horrendous. And the scene ends with a flourish: the last, wounded assailant sits groaning in the foreground; from way back down the corridor Reeves hurls a final axe, which, of course, hits its target \u2013 in the side of the head. The first time I watched this scene I laughed out loud in horror and admiration, which was kind of awkward as I was sitting on a crowded plane. <em>SR</em></p> <h2>The heroin \u2013 Pain and Glory</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d723c26e0253f856c235e24abee38f23f355982\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d723c26e0253f856c235e24abee38f23f355982/0_166_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Painfully clean-living as I am, I have never understood why so many films I like feature the consumption of heroin. Christiane F, Trainspotting, The Souvenir, Permanent Midnight \u2013 and of course, the champ: Requiem for a Dream. Now we can add another to the list: Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s autobiographical reverie Pain and Glory. Now, most films posit heroin as a one-way ticket to the morgue, or at least to total social dysfunction; for Almod\u00f3var, though, it seems to be the next best thing to an after-dinner mint. His alter ego Salvador (Antonio Banderas) appears to handle it all with remarkable ease, using it to soothe his emotional worries and act as a vehicle for remembrance. Experiencers of the real thing may have a different view, but I presume Almod\u00f3var knows what he\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s quite the eye-opener. <em>AP</em></p> <h2>The brow mop \u2013 Amazing Grace</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe2e15b151b41362a926b34adf32c359dffd68d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe2e15b151b41362a926b34adf32c359dffd68d4/0_0_3519_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sydney Pollack\u2019s \u201clost\u201d concert movie Amazing Grace was finally brought out this year \u2013 showing the live filming in 1972 of Aretha Franklin\u2019s gospel album of that name at New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Watts, Los Angeles. Franklin\u2019s calm and restraint at the centre of this boiling cauldron of musical energy is compelling. The most startling moment involves her father, the Rev CL Franklin, who addresses the congregation and then, while Aretha is actually singing, he rushes forward to mop her brow. Was this the sort of thing he used to do when she was a little girl? Is it touching that he does it now? Or weirdly dysfunctional and coercive? Either way, it is a compelling image in a remarkable film. <em>PB</em></p>",

But then Amy crushes it, nailing the song\u2019s ending and revealing to her classmates that, low-key, she can sing. This scene does an impressive amount in about a minute, namely: live out the fantasy that has occupied about 65% of my daydreams since age 13 (I can\u2019t sing), prove that Dever has ARRIVED, salute an ultimate banger of a song. But it also captures the warm invincibility at the bottom of your first drink, the high of leaning into someone else\u2019s confidence or of unlocking that fearlessness in yourself \u2013 the type of finely observed, wild yet grounded fun that made Booksmart one of the most resonant high school movies in a long time. AH The fuckbox - High Life When Claire Denis\u2019s desolately beautiful science-fiction nightmare High Life premiered at the Toronto film festival, \u201cthe fuckbox scene\u201d became a brief but intense meme for the few on film Twitter who had seen it: in a film that was hard to describe and distil as a whole, it was the salacious detail singled out to pique others\u2019 interest. That\u2019s a reductive way to tease a film prickling with so many layers of philosophical and sensual detail, but once seen in context, it\u2019s also an entirely indelible image: Juliette Binoche, nude and scar-torn, entering a space-borne masturbation chamber, straddling a dildo seat and riding it until, as Lil Nas X might say, she can\u2019t no more. Performed with abandon by Binoche and shot with visceral candour by Denis \u2013 making a tensing, thrashing map of the actor\u2019s back alone \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most extraordinary sex scenes in modern cinema: an expression of female erotic autonomy that outlasts any early quips about it in the memory. GL The crying \u2013 Midsommar Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar is a portrait of how a toxic relationship quietly, but surely, unravels. At first it\u2019s subtle: Florence Pugh\u2019s Dani frets that she overburdens boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) with her own drama and mental health issues, and that her need for emotional support is unattractive. When her whole family dies suddenly, she\u2019s desperate to hold on to Christian. She appeases. She apologizes. She stifles her cries after Christian and his friends subtly pressure her into taking shrooms, as specters of her dead sister haunt her. The whole film is about Dani feeling silenced and invalidated by a man who views himself as the saddled victim. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so weirdly refreshing when, in Midsommar\u2019s terrifying climax, the H\u00e5rga women embrace Dani for who she is, cupping her face and encouraging her to sob as loudly as she wants. Crouched on the floor, they cry as one, and as their wails reach a communal crescendo, you see Dani finally finding some measure of healing. Sure, it\u2019s a crazy Swedish cult, but there Dani finally finds someone who actually acknowledges her agony. GS The tai chi - The Farewell The quiet sentimentality of Lulu Wang\u2019s charming sleeper hit shines brightest for me in a scene where twentysomething Billi (played by Oscar-buzzed Awkwafina) and her grandmother, Nai Nai, practice tai chi outside. Nai Nai coaches her granddaughter through some of the movements, lightly nagging Billi about practicing tai chi everyday in that cute, but kind of annoying, manner family members are known for. It\u2019s obvious Billi has no plans of practicing tai chi after this scene and doesn\u2019t deem it particularly useful. Then Nai Nai proudly and confidently credits the martial art for her continuing good health, a big smile on her face. Thing is: Billi\u2019s grandmother has terminal lung cancer but does not know it. So Billi performs the tai chi movements with a renewed energy, owed to the strange mixture of guilt, sadness and stress she feels over the secret illness. She pushes out bad energy and inhales good, yelling out an awkward, meek \u201cHai!\u201d An hour later, at the end of the film, we see Billi walking down the streets of south Williamsburg. She\u2019s still upset over her grandmother\u2019s cancer and visibly overwhelmed and stressed. Out of nowhere, she stops in the street, takes a deep breath and yells out a loud, reverberating \u201cHai!\u201d The circularity of the moment \u2013 Billi going from disinterest in tai chi to seeking relief through it \u2013 highlights how our families can arm us with specific tools to handle the stressors of life. It reminds me of the hours me and my late grandmother would spend putting together 1,000-piece puzzles. As a kid, I was confident I would never take part in such a boring, odious activity as an adult. Today, it\u2019s my favorite pastime. AW The confrontation \u2013 The Souvenir Generally speaking, scenes in which lovers kiss and make up following an infraction are joyful affairs. They come at the close of a movie, following heart-rending misunderstandings that have left a happy ending in jeopardy. That\u2019s not the case in The Souvenir. After months of casual, incremental borrowing to fund his heroin habit, Anthony (Tom Burke) stages a robbery at the flat of young girlfriend Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne). This is purely to bankroll smack \u2013 not the luxe trip to Venice they embark on soon after, which she pays for, and during which she twigs what he\u2019s done. When they return to London, Julie asks and Anthony admits. But he\u2019s not sorry. He\u2019s wounded she has brought it up \u2013 his abhorrent behaviour compounded by this cavalier attitude. You\u2019re shocked, and relieved \u2013 surely she\u2019ll give him the boot? And she quietly forgives him. Anthony\u2019s arrogance and obfuscation, his hurt words about only doing what he needs to, in a world she wouldn\u2019t understand, which he\u2019s protecting her from, fall on appalling open ears. Blame is smoothly shifted. Repentant Julie strokes his foot and forgets her heirlooms. Joanna Hogg shoots the confrontation in one static shot; the couple sitting opposite in armchairs, until Julie bridges the gap. The viewer knew the truth would out \u2013 and assumed it would be a bigger scene. That it\u2019s not moves the relationship into new territory. You can no longer underestimate Anthony\u2019s actions \u2013 or his hold over Julie. The moment she reaches out in supplication is the chilling heart of a fairly scary film. CS The knife fight \u2013 John Wick 3 Ignore the whys (the film-makers did); basically, it\u2019s Keanu Reeves versus a bunch of faceless goons in a surprisingly tooled-up antiques shop, and for me, one of the most exhilaratingly gruesome action scenes in recent memory. It starts with a few gunmen, easily dispatched, but things really kick off when Reeves and an opponent realise they are in a corridor of glass cases packed with all manner of bladed weapons. So much glass-smashing, knife-throwing, shooting, stabbing, punching, kicking, grunting and limb-twisting ensues, you can barely keep track. It is brilliantly choreographed and executed, but what\u2019s so great is how messy it all looks. And painful. Nobody is neatly killed. Knives miss their targets. The deaths get ever-more cartoonishly horrendous. And the scene ends with a flourish: the last, wounded assailant sits groaning in the foreground; from way back down the corridor Reeves hurls a final axe, which, of course, hits its target \u2013 in the side of the head. The first time I watched this scene I laughed out loud in horror and admiration, which was kind of awkward as I was sitting on a crowded plane. SR The heroin \u2013 Pain and Glory Painfully clean-living as I am, I have never understood why so many films I like feature the consumption of heroin. Christiane F, Trainspotting, The Souvenir, Permanent Midnight \u2013 and of course, the champ: Requiem for a Dream. Now we can add another to the list: Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s autobiographical reverie Pain and Glory. Now, most films posit heroin as a one-way ticket to the morgue, or at least to total social dysfunction; for Almod\u00f3var, though, it seems to be the next best thing to an after-dinner mint. His alter ego Salvador (Antonio Banderas) appears to handle it all with remarkable ease, using it to soothe his emotional worries and act as a vehicle for remembrance. Experiencers of the real thing may have a different view, but I presume Almod\u00f3var knows what he\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s quite the eye-opener. AP The brow mop \u2013 Amazing Grace Sydney Pollack\u2019s \u201clost\u201d concert movie Amazing Grace was finally brought out this year \u2013 showing the live filming in 1972 of Aretha Franklin\u2019s gospel album of that name at New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Watts, Los Angeles. Franklin\u2019s calm and restraint at the centre of this boiling cauldron of musical energy is compelling. The most startling moment involves her father, the Rev CL Franklin, who addresses the congregation and then, while Aretha is actually singing, he rushes forward to mop her brow. Was this the sort of thing he used to do when she was a little girl? Is it touching that he does it now? Or weirdly dysfunctional and coercive? Either way, it is a compelling image in a remarkable film. PB",

      "bodyText": "In December 2018, weeks after the Democrats\u2019 conquest of the House, the soon-to-be speaker arrived for a White House meeting with Donald Trump. The subject was a government shutdown but the subtext was a showdown between the most powerful woman in American politics and the president of the United States. In the extraordinary, televised exchange that followed, Trump sought to undermine Nancy Pelosi, whom he repeatedly addressed as \u201cNancy\u201d, by reminding his audience in the Oval Office \u2013 and those watching at home \u2013 that she had yet to secure the 218 votes needed to reclaim the speakership and was \u201cin a situation where it\u2019s not easy for her to talk right now\u201d. Her response was sharp and sure. \u201cMr President, please don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting.\u201d It was the first test of a new power dynamic in Washington and when it ended, there was little disagreement over who had won. Pelosi emerged from the White House wearing a now-famous burnt-orange coat, sunglasses and the triumphant smile of a woman who has never forgotten the advice imparted to her by the late Louisiana congresswoman Lindy Boggs: \u201cDarlin\u2019, know thy power and use it.\u201d That 15-minute Oval Office meeting marked the beginning of a struggle between Pelosi and Trump that culminated last week in the president\u2019s impeachment by the House of Representatives for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. Pelosi, dressed in funeral black, banged down her speaker\u2019s gavel to finalize the vote, binding together their legacies for all time. It was not how Pelosi, who once said Trump was \u201cnot worth\u201d impeaching, had hoped to end a year that began with her historic, second ascension to the speakership. Pelosi, the first \u2013 and only \u2013 woman ever to serve as Speaker of the House, would rather be remembered for legislative accomplishments \u2013 the Affordable Care Act above all \u2013 than for impeachment. But Trump, Pelosi said, left her \u201cno choice\u201d. She quoted Thomas Paine: \u201cThe times have found us.\u201d In the wake of Trump\u2019s impeachment, however, Democrats believe there was perhaps no leader better suited to the times. \u201cShe is, thank God, the exact right person in the right place at the right time,\u201d said Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary and CIA director and a California native who\u2019s known Pelosi for decades. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else would have had the experience or capability to be able to do what she has done.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump really has met his match with Nancy,\u201d Panetta added. Her grace under fire as speaker has earned comparisons to Sam Rayburn, the country\u2019s longest-serving speaker, who died in 1961. One Democrat called her an \u201cas good or better\u201d legislative leader than Lyndon Johnson, who was a Senate majority leader before he was president. And when the question is asked whether a female presidential candidate can beat Trump in 2020, the Democrats point to Pelosi, who \u201cdoes it every single day\u201d. Even Senator Lindsey Graham, one ofTrump\u2019s fiercest defenders these days, is impressed. In an interview with CNN decrying the impeachment process, the South Carolina senator called it \u201cquite a feat\u201d that she was able to advance bipartisan legislation even as efforts to remove Trump cleaved the House \u2013 and the nation. *** In the last year, Pelosi has guided her factious congressional caucus through the choppy waters of Trump\u2019s presidency. Like a political grandmaster of three-dimensional chess she quelled an insurrection to reclaim the gavel, engineered the end of the longest government shutdown in US history, and impeached the president, all while averting another shutdown and negotiating with the White House on a trade deal with Canada and Mexico. \u201cWe got a lot done this year in spite of impeachment,\u201d said congressman Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for Democratic leader in 2016. He said it was a testament to the \u201cskillful way\u201d Pelosi has led the House. Pelosi learned her tactics from her father, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro, a Democratic mayor of Baltimore and former congressman. From her family home in Baltimore\u2019s Little Italy she learned the skills that make Pelosi, by her own account, a \u201cmaster legislator:\u201d how to count votes, dole out favors and strike \u201cback-room\u201d deals. But her leadership training came later, as the stay-at-home mother of five children. \u201cIf the five of us couldn\u2019t rattle her, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to,\u201d said Christine Pelosi, Pelosi\u2019s daughter and the author of The Nancy Pelosi Way: Advice on Success, Leadership, and Politics from America\u2019s Most Powerful Woman. The Democratic 2020 candidates could learn from watching her mother stand up to Trump, she said, because \u201cthe next president of the United States has to be at least as good and certainly as solid as Nancy Pelosi\u201d. Pelosi brought her life\u2019s lessons to bear during her legislative career, particularly during the early years of the Obama administration when she helped usher the Affordable Care Act, a landmark healthcare law, climate change legislation and a massive economic stimulus package to mitigate the fallout from the financial crisis. It\u2019s also how she returned to speaker in 2019. \u201cHer second time as speaker is the culmination of all of her strengths \u2013 mastering the legislative process, counting votes, uniting a caucus with many factions, looking two steps ahead,\u201d said Stacy Kerr, a former senior adviser to Pelosi.

But Pelosi has reemerged in the Trump era as a political and cultural icon of the left. An image of Pelosi, lips pursed in an arch smile, eyes locked on Trump, applauding during the 2019 State of the Union address ripped across social media as the ultimate \u201cclapback\u201d. In October, Trump tweeted a photo that was supposed to show Pelosi\u2019s \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d during a White House meeting \u2013 the speaker at a table of mostly men, literally standing up to Trump. But her supporters saw instead a symbol of female power and Pelosi made the picture the background photo on her Twitter page. There was another revealing moment this month, when a reporter for the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group, asked: \u201cDo you hate the president, Madam Speaker?\u201d She turned to face him directly, her voice quivering but forceful. \u201cI don\u2019t hate anyone,\u201d she said sharply, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me when it comes to words like that.\u201d These snapshots of Pelosi\u2019s power have drawn admirers from unexpected quarters. Lara Trump, who is married to Trump\u2019s son, Eric, recently praised Pelosi\u2019s \u201ctenacity\u201d and remarked on her ability to \u201cput down and throw down whenever she needs to\u201d. Her steeliness has enraged Trump, who has a long history of lashing out at powerful women. But his taunts became increasingly vindictive and personal in the months leading up to his impeachment. In October he assailed her \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d and pressed the ill-suited nickname, \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d. This month he claimed bizarrely that Pelosi\u2019s teeth were \u201cfalling out\u201d. And in a six-page letter to Pelosi he accused her of lying when she says she prays for him, unless her prayers are meant \u201cin the negative sense\u201d. \u201cIt is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!\u201d he wrote. The Louisiana congressman Steve Scalise, the House minority whip, said impeachment \u201cwill be a stain on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s legacy as speaker\u201d that overshadows her legislative record. \u201cIt\u2019s clear this is only about carrying out a personal vendetta against the president and that\u2019s not why you use the power of impeachment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an abuse of power.\u201d *** Pelosi\u2019s role in the third presidential impeachment trial is not quite finished. She must send the articles of impeachment to the Senate and appoint managers to present the House\u2019s case in a trial next year \u2013 though she has suggested she may delay doing so. A top priority next year will be protecting her House majority, especially vulnerable members who may have risked their re-election on supporting impeachment. \u201cWe fully intend to win,\u201d she said recently, of the November elections.",

There was the late-80s perm-pop era, post-Charlene from Neighbours; the dance-pop era; the hot pants-sporting disco era; a slightly less successful indie era; and last year\u2019s country era. This summer, however, saw her gloriously combine them all during an emotional Sunday afternoon \u201clegends\u201d slot at Glastonbury, 14 years after she was forced to cancel a headline performance following a breast cancer diagnosis.</p> <p>Woven throughout her career has been an old-school devotion to privacy: we know the Kylie she\u2019s keen to present, but perhaps not the real one. If anyone can get her to open up a bit, though, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/12/alan-carr-interview\" title=\"\">Alan Carr</a>, with the pair showcasing their decade-long friendship for Christmas Day\u2019s Channel 4 special. Titled Kylie\u2019s Secret Night, it sees the enduring pop icon surprise a handful of super-fans with performances, chat and even a comedy skit in which she at one point says: \u201cSpank me harder, harder!\u201d in the back of a taxi.</p> <p>This afternoon, ensconced in the corner of a fancy central London hotel and giddy on Christmas and high-grade tea, the pair muse on Glastonbury, passionate fans and, most crucially of all, the strength of sticky tape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a barbecue and a roast on Christmas Day</p> <footer> <cite>Kylie Minogue</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Alan Carr </strong>So Kylie, what are your Christmas plans?</p> <p><strong>Kylie Minogue</strong> Just having some family time. Usually I\u2019m in Australia.</p> <p><strong>AC</strong> Whenever I get asked this, people think I\u2019m being elusive, but I work hard all year and I just have a lock-in. I just wear a onesie for three days and drink red wine, and my lovely husband waits on me hand and foot. Do you know what I watched last year? I\u2019m so embarrassed ... <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/09/the-meg-review-jason-statham-versus-prehistoric-megashark\">The Meg</a>.</p> <p><strong>KM</strong> I\u2019ve never heard of it!

It doesn\u2019t stick any more!</p> <p><strong>KM</strong> Because it\u2019s Magic Tape, and that\u2019s not good for wrapping presents. You know, the one that\u2019s a bit opaque.</p> <p><strong>AC</strong> Well, there\u2019s your headline for this. \u201cI\u2019ve been using the wrong Sellotape for years\u201d: Kylie exclusive.

For New Year\u2019s Eve I don\u2019t mind working, because you don\u2019t have the pressure. One year, I was home alone. I just watched TV, and it was bliss.

I was having a hyperglycemic low, but I got through it. It was a celebration but also forward-looking. We are not just celebrating something that finished 20 years ago. This year, with Glastonbury, with this TV show, it\u2019s marking this point in time, but what\u2019s great is what\u2019s happening next. I\u2019m really jazzed about [the music] to come.

Shimmery.</p> <p><strong>AC</strong> In the final part of the show, we voted on the best Kylie single, and if you thought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> polarised Britain, you should ask people about their best Kylie song. We nearly had riot police. It was like: \u201cSPINNING AROUND!\u201d, \u201cBETTER THE DEVIL \u2026!\u201d, \u201cDANCING!\u201d There\u2019s a lot of love \u2013 and even some anger.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18441Eh_WE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c18441Eh_WE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>AC</strong> You\u2019re a gay icon, Kylie, but I feel you\u2019re more than that. You\u2019re an icon.</p> <p><strong>KM</strong> Thank you.

      "bodyText": "Fans of Kylie Minogue often talk about her 30-year career in terms of chapters. There was the late-80s perm-pop era, post-Charlene from Neighbours; the dance-pop era; the hot pants-sporting disco era; a slightly less successful indie era; and last year\u2019s country era. This summer, however, saw her gloriously combine them all during an emotional Sunday afternoon \u201clegends\u201d slot at Glastonbury, 14 years after she was forced to cancel a headline performance following a breast cancer diagnosis. Woven throughout her career has been an old-school devotion to privacy: we know the Kylie she\u2019s keen to present, but perhaps not the real one. If anyone can get her to open up a bit, though, it\u2019s Alan Carr, with the pair showcasing their decade-long friendship for Christmas Day\u2019s Channel 4 special. Titled Kylie\u2019s Secret Night, it sees the enduring pop icon surprise a handful of super-fans with performances, chat and even a comedy skit in which she at one point says: \u201cSpank me harder, harder!\u201d in the back of a taxi. This afternoon, ensconced in the corner of a fancy central London hotel and giddy on Christmas and high-grade tea, the pair muse on Glastonbury, passionate fans and, most crucially of all, the strength of sticky tape. Alan Carr So Kylie, what are your Christmas plans? Kylie Minogue Just having some family time. Usually I\u2019m in Australia. AC Whenever I get asked this, people think I\u2019m being elusive, but I work hard all year and I just have a lock-in. I just wear a onesie for three days and drink red wine, and my lovely husband waits on me hand and foot. Do you know what I watched last year? I\u2019m so embarrassed ... The Meg. KM I\u2019ve never heard of it! I go for Elf. Maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol. The Sound of Music. Love Actually. And \u2013 can I say? \u2013 I love wrapping presents. AC This isn\u2019t going to stay in the interview, obviously, but do you find the quality of sticky tape has gone down over the years? It doesn\u2019t stick any more! KM Because it\u2019s Magic Tape, and that\u2019s not good for wrapping presents. You know, the one that\u2019s a bit opaque. AC Well, there\u2019s your headline for this. \u201cI\u2019ve been using the wrong Sellotape for years\u201d: Kylie exclusive. Maybe we should all just use tit tape! It\u2019s never let me down. Do you eat turkey? Do you have a barbecue on Christmas Day? KM We have both. So you have the barbie going, because it\u2019s usually boiling, but we\u2019ll probably have an honorary roast, because you have to. But we don\u2019t do what we did when we were kids, where all the cards were snowy and you\u2019d put the snow on the windows and the tree had fake snow, but it\u2019s 35-40 degrees outside! For New Year\u2019s Eve I don\u2019t mind working, because you don\u2019t have the pressure. One year, I was home alone. I just watched TV, and it was bliss. Well, I mean, I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, I didn\u2019t have any family here, but I really enjoyed it. AC Oh, Kylie, I\u2019ve got a spare room! Ring me, we\u2019ll have a lock-in together. I want to ask you this: at parties, do you put Kylie songs on? KM No! I don\u2019t do that. Someone else might. If they do, I just have to roll with it, I suppose. Depends how many ros\u00e9s I\u2019ve had at that point. KM So have you been to Glastonbury, Alan? AC I have. I had a bit of a midlife crisis before I turned 40 and I thought: What haven\u2019t I done? Everyone said: \u201cGo to Glastonbury!\u201d So I went, and it was the muddiest it\u2019s ever been. KM I\u2019m never going with you! AC No, don\u2019t. You see those Instagram people and they\u2019ve got the wellies and the cut-off shorts. Well, I had a footprint on my hat and red wine down my top \u2026 It was only 9am. You didn\u2019t go out and about at Glastonbury, did you, Kylie? KM No, no. I\u2019d only been once before, which was a fly-in and fly-out situation with the Scissor Sisters. So just [playing] one number. Now I get it: you\u2019ve got to call up your friends when you do that kind of thing, which I ended up doing with Chris [Martin] and Nick [Cave]. In a way, I still haven\u2019t had the Glastonbury experience of being there overnight, roaming around, seeing everything. I still feel like I have to do it, as a rite of passage. I\u2019ll probably be more like your picture; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to manage it like the cool girls. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll retract my former statement: I should go with you and we can get real sloshy together. AC Next year, they\u2019ve got Diana Ross in the legends slot. But she\u2019s got such a hard act to follow. KM [Looks coy] Thank you. People ask me about [my 2019 performance] all the time, and I wish I had a neat little tagline, but a portion of it is a blur. I\u2019d have to watch it again to really go: \u201cOh yeah, we did that,\u201d or, \u201cWe stuffed that bit up,\u201d or, \u201cThat was good.\u201d It\u2019s sensory overload.

He\u2019d even changed his name by deed poll to Minogue. KM David Minogue. AC It would make a cracking episode of Who Do You Think You Are? This one branch of the family tree going all over the place. KM I think he might have been the \u2026 I don\u2019t want to say weirdest but the most confronting: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed your name!?\u201d Lots of really touching stories. AC When you came onstage, obviously it was a big surprise. There were people crying. The love for you in the room! KM Even after 17 hours of filming in 55 degrees. AC We did have a little break, which was nice. KM Two and half hours after it started! I was having a hyperglycemic low, but I got through it. It was a celebration but also forward-looking. We are not just celebrating something that finished 20 years ago. This year, with Glastonbury, with this TV show, it\u2019s marking this point in time, but what\u2019s great is what\u2019s happening next. I\u2019m really jazzed about [the music] to come. I think it\u2019s going to be getting back on the dancefloor, like grown-up disco; that\u2019s where I want it to be. Shimmery. AC In the final part of the show, we voted on the best Kylie single, and if you thought Brexit polarised Britain, you should ask people about their best Kylie song. We nearly had riot police. It was like: \u201cSPINNING AROUND!\u201d, \u201cBETTER THE DEVIL \u2026!\u201d, \u201cDANCING!\u201d There\u2019s a lot of love \u2013 and even some anger. AC You\u2019re a gay icon, Kylie, but I feel you\u2019re more than that. You\u2019re an icon. KM Thank you. That helps me, because when I\u2019m asked [what makes me a gay icon], I don\u2019t think I\u2019m meant to know the answer to that question. AC If you knew the answer, you\u2019d disappear up your very pert bottom. KM Being able to look out at my shows for years and years now, everyone\u2019s represented there. Long before our new inclusive society, which is fantastic, my shows have pretty much always been like that. AC Camp gets thrown around a lot, to me especially but, you know, it\u2019s said like it\u2019s a bad thing, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being camp. With you, the hits come every album, and you just give people what they want. Every time there\u2019s something different. KM People have also seen me not get it right. AC You\u2019re not talking about the Charlene perm, are you? KM It wasn\u2019t a perm! AC It was your real hair!? KM Yes, I\u2019d just use a diffuser and I\u2019d scrunch it up with mousse. [Laughs] And now I just flatten it out and clip it in. AC When did you get it wrong? KM Babe. Plenty of times. I just don\u2019t think you can get it right all the time, but you\u2019ve got to keep doing it to have a chance. Kylie\u2019s Secret Night, Christmas Day, 10.30pm, Channel 4",

      "bodyText": "Felipe Dana\u2019s work in 2019 has taken him all over the world, covering big news stories like the elections in Spain, conflict in Syria, the crisis in Hong Kong, and to Rwanda, Greenland and Algeria to focus on environmental stories. He has regularly featured in our 20 Photos of the Week series and in our daily highlights photography galleries. We asked Dana about his year as a news photographer, his favourite assignments and images. \u201c2019 was a busy and difficult year in many parts of the world, with political turmoil and massive protests in nearly every continent, never-ending conflicts in the Middle East, the plight of migrants and the climate crisis. With all this happening across the globe, it was an intense year to be a news photographer but that\u2019s also when our job becomes most important.\u201d Nationalists carry torches during a rally to mark the birthday of Stepan Bandera, the founder of a rebel army that fought against the Soviet regime in Kyiv, Ukraine. \u201cI covered a great variety of stories in 2019, starting with the ultra-right in Ukraine. I then went to Syria to cover war in the last territory held by Islamic State.\u201d Syria A woman and her baby, who were evacuated from the last territory held by Isis militants. In February the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured Isis\u2019s final stronghold. Hundreds of people were evacuated from Baghuz in eastern Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to pick one favourite, single image, but one that strikes me was taken in Syria when I was following the mass evacuations out of the last territory still held by Islamic State militants. There was a screening area in the middle of the desert and that night men, women and children were gathering there, all sitting on the ground. I spotted this woman holding her baby after she was screened by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, it was extremely dark but there was just enough light from a nearby military vehicle. The lighting reflected the dramatic moment she was in.\u201d Women and children leave the back of a truck, part of a convoy evacuating hundreds from the last territory held by Isis militants in Baghuz, eastern Syria, 22 February. A boy rides in the back of a truck, part of a convoy evacuating hundreds out of the last territory held by Isis militants in Baghuz, eastern Syria, 20 February. Iraq A year and a half after Isis was declared defeated in Iraq, a battle continues between surviving members of the group waging an insurgency and the security forces who are relying on intelligence operations, raids and searches for sleeper cells to stamp them out. Residents watch as local militia and Iraqi army soldiers walk past their home during a raid in Badoush, Iraq, April. Iraqi army 20th division soldiers play football in a military base in Badoush, Iraq. \u201cThen I went to Iraq, where the group was declared defeated, but sleeping cells still threatened peace. The war against IS [Isis] in Iraq no longer makes headlines but the country still suffers from terror and the consequences of the devastating conflict. I believe it is extremely important to continue revisiting places after a war is declared to be over because life rarely goes back to normal and there are always new issues arising that need just as much coverage.\u201d Champions Liverpool players celebrate after winning the Champions League, beating Tottenham Hotspur. Dana went to Madrid in June to cover the all-English Champions League final won by Liverpool. \u201cAlthough I work mostly shooting features and news stories, a big part of the life of an agency photographer is to shoot sports, so often I\u2019ll help in events like the Champions, World Cup and Olympics.\u201d Liverpool players celebrate after winning the Champions League final. Albania The sun sets behind the Vjosa River near Tepelene, Albania. Felipe visited Albania in June for a feature on the Vjosa River. Rivers are a crucial part of the global water cycle. They act like nature\u2019s arteries, carrying energy and nutrients across vast landscapes, providing water for drinking, food production and industry. \u201cI spent a few weeks traveling in Albania, documenting one of Europe\u2019s last wild rivers, the Vjosa, where the government has set in motion plans to dam the river and its tributaries to generate electricity for one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries and many locals are fighting that project. I was surprised to learn how few large rivers still run free and how much a dam can impact the local ecosystem.\u201d Jorgji Ilia, 71, stands on the shore of the Vjosa after collecting water from a small spring in the village of Kanikol, Albania. Residents sit on the shore of the Vjosa next to a spring in the Kelcyre Gorge, Albania, 24 June. Greenland A boat navigates icebergs at night in eastern Greenland, August. Dana travelled to Greenland in August and followed a NYU team of scientists who are tracking the climate emergency in Greenland. \u201cAfter Albania, I went to Greenland where I followed the work of scientists who are trying to understand the alarmingly rapid melting of the ice. I only had a few days there but the country is so beautiful I decided to make use of the very long days and photograph throughout the night in a unique and bright evening light. It only gets dark for a few hours at that time of the year. The size of the icebergs is really humbling. As amazing as some of them may look in the pictures, I still felt like the photos didn\u2019t do them justice.\u201d Pilot Martin N\u00f8rregaard, centre, helps NYU air and ocean scientist David Holland, left, and field safety officer Brian Rougeux, right, carry antennas out of a helicopter to be installed at the Helheim glacier in Greenland. A boat sails next to a large iceberg in eastern Greenland. Rwanda Children watch a drone flying near the Volcanoes national park in Kinigi, Rwanda. In September Dana went to Rwanda to investigate how revenue from tourism in Volcanoes national park was being used to fund improvements to local communities. In 2005, the government adopted a model to steer 5% of tourism revenue from Volcanoes to build infrastructure in surrounding villages, including schools and health clinics, and this share was raised to 10% in 2017. Gorilla trackers Emmanuel Bizagwira, right, and Safari Gabriel observe two gorillas from the Agasha group as they play in the Volcanoes national park, Rwanda, September. Right, a silverback mountain gorilla named Segasira. \u201cI went to Rwanda to the Volcanoes national park where the world\u2019s longest-running gorilla study takes place. It is a beautiful country. I felt extremely lucky to see the stunning mountain gorillas in person. After reaching the park\u2019s entrance in 4x4 cars, we followed local guides up the mountain, reaching an altitude as high as 4,000 metres. I was amazed how the guides and trackers could distinguish between each gorilla within the groups they followed. Their skill came in very handy when I had to identify the animals by name in my captions.\u201d Children attend class at the Nyabitsinde primary school near the Volcanoes national park in Kinigi, Rwanda. \u201cThe money that built this school comes from tourism,\u201d says Fabien Uwimana, a French and English teacher. \u201cMore children today can go to school.\u201d Hong Kong Protesters huddle together to block a road in Hong Kong, 4 October. Dana spent time in Hong Kong covering the pro-democracy protests. We published a gallery of Felipe\u2019s projected and layered portraits of the protesters in October. Protesters Morty and Kathy pose for portraits as photographs of unrest in Hong Kong are projected over them. \u201cI also joined the AP team in Hong Kong covering the non-stop protests that are packing the streets almost every day for months now. Although I\u2019m used to covering these kinds of protests, I was impressed by how determined and tireless they are. I was also surprised by how much they appreciated the work of the free press and were actually worried about our safety during the clashes.

Protesters take cover during a confrontation with police in Hong Kong, 20 October. Spain French police officers remove pro-Catalan independence demonstrators blocking a major highway border pass near La Jonquera between Spain and France, 12 November. \u201cIn between all these stories, I also helped cover two elections in Spain, and multiple protests in Catalonia throughout the year. In one of the most recent protests in Barcelona I got hit by police with a baton in the face and earned a few stitches on my nose. Luckily it wasn\u2019t too bad, I\u2019ve recovered and am back to work now.\u201d Police take position during clashes with protesters in Barcelona, 26 October.

And most importantly, it doesn\u2019t drop its needles,\u201d says Marianne Bols, a Danish tree grower.</p> <p>She is among a number of importers who come to the forest every year, to bring seeds back to Europe. The industry is big. About 150m Christmas trees are sold annually on the continent. A third of them, perhaps more, hail from Ambrolauri.</p> <p>But the Georgian cone pickers, who come from small towns and villages near the forest and risk their lives gathering the cones, see little of the final earnings.</p> <p>\u201cI was practically born in the forest, and have been climbing since I was a kid,\u201d says Lasha Sopromadze, from the village of Tlugi at the forest\u2019s edge.</p> <p>Each season, says Sopromadze \u2013 who wears a T-shirt despite the cold wind \u2013 he earns between 1,000 and 2,000 lari (\u00a3262 and \u00a3524). The price per kilo varies from year to year, from one to two lari \u2013 a fraction of the price for a full-grown tree in Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1893d12aab91ba2b6b53d9e55e1ace0e233ed24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1893d12aab91ba2b6b53d9e55e1ace0e233ed24/0_0_4800_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cone climbers in Georgia\u2019s Ratcha region\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roughly 50m of the Christmas trees sold in Europe each year hail from Ambrolauri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Pebrel/M.Y.O.P.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe foreign companies earn most from this.

The entire village went into the woods in autumn. We would cook together in the evenings, and the food tasted like the sap on our fingers,\u201d says Katsitadze-Jikhvashvili.</p> <p>\u201cClimbing is not difficult. We just grabbed the branches one by one. Once up, we would swing and jump from tree to tree.\u201d</p> <p>Going up like that, without safety gear, is less common today. Companies bring ropes and hooks to the forest, and say they don\u2019t allow people to climb without.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is supposed to swing from tree to tree. And if they did, the ropes would stop them from falling,\u201d says Borge Klemmensen, the now retired head of Levinsen &amp; Abies, the largest Danish company.</p> <p>Still, many cones are picked without equipment. Sopromadze, who sold his yield to Levinsen &amp; Abies\u2019 Georgian partner Jadvari this year, does not use it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s much faster to climb without, you can finish a tree in 20 minutes. Otherwise you need an hour,\u201d he says, standing in a small grove surrounded trees, deep inside the forest.</p> <p>He holds a knife in one hand, a long cone in the other. \u201cThis one is no good, I can see it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should have at least 70 seeds inside.\u201d</p> <p>Sopromadze cuts the cone in half, finding only a handful of seeds.

      "bodyText": "It takes Ramaz Chelishvili just a few seconds to reach the top. Soon, a fir cone falls to the ground. Then another. One by one, cones keep dropping, until none are left in the tree. Chelishvili, as fast as he climbed up, gets back down. \u201cI try to not think of anything up there, just focus. The problem is, if you lose concentration, then you might fall,\u201d he says. He lights a cigarette and sits down to rest against the tree. It is a climb he has done countless times before. Each year, at the same time, just before autumn turns into winter. This is when the Ambrolauri forest, high in Georgia\u2019s northern mountains, gets filled with people, all in search of the same thing: fir cones \u2013 or more specifically, the seeds hidden inside. These seeds, once shipped and planted in European soil, will produce Europe\u2019s favourite Christmas tree, the tall and gracious Nordmann fir. \u201cIt is thick and green with a beautiful shape. And most importantly, it doesn\u2019t drop its needles,\u201d says Marianne Bols, a Danish tree grower. She is among a number of importers who come to the forest every year, to bring seeds back to Europe. The industry is big. About 150m Christmas trees are sold annually on the continent. A third of them, perhaps more, hail from Ambrolauri. But the Georgian cone pickers, who come from small towns and villages near the forest and risk their lives gathering the cones, see little of the final earnings. \u201cI was practically born in the forest, and have been climbing since I was a kid,\u201d says Lasha Sopromadze, from the village of Tlugi at the forest\u2019s edge. Each season, says Sopromadze \u2013 who wears a T-shirt despite the cold wind \u2013 he earns between 1,000 and 2,000 lari (\u00a3262 and \u00a3524). The price per kilo varies from year to year, from one to two lari \u2013 a fraction of the price for a full-grown tree in Europe. \u201cThe foreign companies earn most from this. We just have the cones, no factories or plantations,\u201d says Violeta Katsitadze, also from Tlugi. She sits at the kitchen table in her house, next to her 77-year-old mother, Lamara Katsitadze-Jikhvashvili. Beans and peppers have been laid out to dry near the window. It is the end of harvest, and the entire village is preparing for winter. Katsitadze has never climbed for cones, but her mother once did. \u201cEveryone would do it. The entire village went into the woods in autumn. We would cook together in the evenings, and the food tasted like the sap on our fingers,\u201d says Katsitadze-Jikhvashvili. \u201cClimbing is not difficult. We just grabbed the branches one by one. Once up, we would swing and jump from tree to tree.\u201d Going up like that, without safety gear, is less common today. Companies bring ropes and hooks to the forest, and say they don\u2019t allow people to climb without. \u201cNo one is supposed to swing from tree to tree. And if they did, the ropes would stop them from falling,\u201d says Borge Klemmensen, the now retired head of Levinsen &amp; Abies, the largest Danish company. Still, many cones are picked without equipment. Sopromadze, who sold his yield to Levinsen &amp; Abies\u2019 Georgian partner Jadvari this year, does not use it. \u201cIt\u2019s much faster to climb without, you can finish a tree in 20 minutes. Otherwise you need an hour,\u201d he says, standing in a small grove surrounded trees, deep inside the forest. He holds a knife in one hand, a long cone in the other. \u201cThis one is no good, I can see it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should have at least 70 seeds inside.\u201d Sopromadze cuts the cone in half, finding only a handful of seeds. It has been a bad year in Ambrolauri, with hardly any seeds or cones. \u201cIt happens once in a while, but we never know why. A late frost night or unexpected rain, then the whole harvest can be gone,\u201d Sopromadze says. The forest around him is quiet, uncommon at this time of the year. Normally, someone from every household would be out climbing. \u201cIt is an important income for us, because there aren\u2019t any other jobs here,\u201d says Melania Darakhvelidze, one of the teachers in Tlugi\u2019s school. The school currently has only six children (and eight teachers). Most families have moved to Tbilisi or other cities, leaving empty houses behind. Climbing comes with risks. Several people have died, most recently in 2001 and 2011.

But now the boom in what is artfully called \u201cdigital-out-of-home advertising\u201d \u2013 eye-catching video screens dotted across urban areas, from train platforms to shopping centres \u2013 has sparked a new spate of French protests, civil disobedience and petitions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve never seen so many people annoyed about advertising</p> <footer> <cite>Thomas Bourgenot, campaigner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>High tech video billboards are multiplying in city spaces across the world, woven into the fabric of everyday life, from ribbon videos down escalators on the London underground, to French metro corridors, New York taxis, bus-shelters, newspaper kiosks, and \u2013 increasingly \u2013 broadcast from shop windows onto the street. They are becoming more sophisticated and interactive, with the potential to collect data from passersby; increasingly bright and inescapable \u2013 impossible to click off or block like you can online. But in France, there is fresh debate on how urban planners and local councils should limit them in the public space for the sake of our overloaded eyes and brains.</p> <p>The trend to squeeze every bit of city downtime into an opportunity to place people in front of screen has become a political battle on the left. Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin of the French left party, <em>La France Insoumise</em>, recently tabled a <a href=\"http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/propositions/pion2391.asp\">French parliamentary amendment</a> to ban video ads above urinals and toilets. It was dubbed the \u201cPee in Peace\u201d motion. Ruffin said he was horrified when standing at a Paris caf\u00e9 urinal to be visually \u201cassaulted\u201d by a video advertising Uber, a bank, and the book and tech store Fnac. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t enjoy that rare moment of calm: having a piss?\u201d he wrote in the amendment, warning that since 2015, over 2,000 of the screens had \u201ccolonised\u201d 1,200 urinals in 25 French towns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dff4537276c66367e901d4add9ca8d55addaa59a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dff4537276c66367e901d4add9ca8d55addaa59a/0_262_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists argue that advertising \u2018distracts people from real problems\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists argue that advertising \u2018distracts people from real problems\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quentin Saison/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lille, a former centre of northern French industry and now a hub for artists, designers and students, has become the focus of the latest battle over screens in the public space. Like many French cities, the Socialist city hall has sought limits on advertising video screens, meaning no street furniture on pavements carries commercial video ads. But in France those rules don\u2019t cover train stations or public transport, where video advertising is flourishing \u2013 particularly 10-second clips for Netflix, Amazon and film releases. When the local transport body for the greater Lille area recently fixed a new contract that could boost the number of video screens to around 160 \u2013 including in bus shelters \u2013 the city hall was furious, but largely powerless because the deal was legitimate.</p> <p>\u201cThis type of screen in the public space would be invasive and intrusive, consume too much energy, distract motorists and get children even more hooked on videos than they are already,\u201d said Jacques Richir, a Socialist deputy mayor. \u201cIt would mean advertising messages [infest] the urban landscape, when we want to limit them.\u201d</p> <p>Local representatives of the greater Lille area, the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9ene de Lille, met this month to debate new local advertising rules, which protesters hope will take a tougher line on screens. Lyon, France\u2019s third biggest city, also moved this month to fund a new electric bike-scheme itself rather than strike a deal with outdoor advertisers which might have led to introducing video-screen ads in the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47af2a11107eea149bf2213b0b067bffac8fae0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47af2a11107eea149bf2213b0b067bffac8fae0f/0_104_4272_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mediatransports runs 1,250 video screens in French rail stations, like these in Lille, as well as 700 screens in the Paris metro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Company Mediatransports runs 1,250 video screens in French rail stations, like these in Lille, as well as 700 screens in the Paris metro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quentin Saison/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are other loopholes on French pavements. In Lille, as in Paris, shops are considered private spaces, and not subject to local advertising rules. So all kinds of shopfronts \u2013 from chemists to hairdressers and tech shops to trainer emporiums \u2013 can put up screens just behind their windows, beaming digital video into the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Fabien Delecroix an IT teacher from the Lille branch of anti-ad campaigners <em><a href=\"https://antipub.org/\">R\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l\u2019Agression Publicitaire</a></em>. \u201cIf someone stood naked at their window right on the street deliberately showing their body, you wouldn\u2019t say: \u2018Oh that\u2019s fine, they\u2019re technically not exposing themselves because they\u2019re in their own home.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re told children shouldn\u2019t be exposed to screens before age three, but they\u2019re craning their necks at the screens all around them in public</p> <footer> <cite>Marion, protestor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the courts in Lille are cracking down on protesters. At a hearing last month, flanked by supporters, Alessandro di Giussepe, a 42-year-old actor, who once stood for local election dressed as a joke \u201cpope\u201d of consumerism, was fined \u20ac900 (\u00a3758) for defacing adverts in the city with black pen as an act of civil disobedience. A father in a passing car had called the police, compl defacing ads was setting a bad example to children. Di Giussepe said adverts destroyed \u201cpublic space, which is our shared space\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t stop us,\u201d said Marion, from the Lille anti-advertising protest collective <em><a href=\"https://www.deboulonneurs.org/\">Les D\u00e9boulonneurs</a></em>. \u201cWe\u2019re told children shouldn\u2019t be exposed to screens before age three, but in pushchairs they\u2019re craning their necks at the screens all around them in public.\u201d</p> <p>The French firm Mediatransports, which runs 1,250 video screens in French rail stations, as well as 700 on the Paris metro \u2013 including 150 in Paris\u2019s Gare du Nord alone \u2013 said digital screens were excellent at reaching commuters. \u201cThey generate more revenue than paper ads, because they can quickly adapt to advertisers\u2019 needs \u2013 changing a message for the exact time of day or even the weather.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11261f5e8530093df758ef27e13871aefb077424\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11261f5e8530093df758ef27e13871aefb077424/0_286_4293_2576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A \u2018free expression\u2019 sign posted in a Lille bus stop by protestors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018free expression\u2019 sign posted in a Lille bus stop by protestors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quentin Saison/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With French local elections in March, Grenoble\u2019s Green mayor, Eric Piolle, is running for re-election four years after styling his city at the foot of the French Alps as the first European urban centre to ban commercial street advertising. Piolle replaced more than 300 paper advertising signs with trees or community noticeboards, although bus and tram stops still carry adverts, which the city said it had limited. He said it was no surprise that ad screens and their mental and environmental impact was the next frontier in what politicians should ban. \u201cPublic space is a meeting space so lowering the aggression of advertising is positive for everyone,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a criticism that advertising was anti-democratic, and a very strong idea in France that public space belongs to everyone</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Caroline Marti</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paris is also soul-searching about advertising. Early last year, the capital\u2019s more than 1,600 advertising signs \u2013 large grey paper advertising panels on pavements \u2013 disappeared for around 18 months during a protracted process to find a new contract. No one noticed their absence, but when they were gradually put back this autumn \u2014 the same number in virtually the same spots \u2014 many residents complained of an advertising onslaught.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people annoyed about advertising. People are coming up to me saying this sign is taking up half the pavement,\u201d said the long-time anti-advertising campaigner Thomas Bourgenot, of <em>R\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l\u2019Agression Publicitaire</em> in Paris. A <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.fr/non-aux-ecrans-videos-publicitaires/\">petition</a> by Greenpeace Paris and other groups has called on the city to ensure there can be no future arrival of commercial video ad screens, which are currently banned on street furniture.</p> <p>The city hall said its policy was not to develop any more advertising in the city, and to fight the illegal ads so often plastered or beamed across buildings.

      "bodyText": "On a pavement in the northern French city of Lille, an advertising panel rotated pictures of bargain Aldi prawns and blended scotch whisky, competing for the average three-second attention span of pedestrians. Suddenly a 31-year-old hospital nurse darted across the street, unrolled a mass of white paper and began to cover the ads. \u201cI\u2019ve been treating sick people in emergency rooms for 11 years, but this is about treating a sick society,\u201d he said, as he reached up with other protesters to tape the paper in place. \u201cWhen you walk down the street, how can you feel happy if you\u2019re constantly being reminded of what you don\u2019t have? Advertising breaks your spirit, confuses you about what you really need and distracts you from real problems, like the climate emergency.\u201d Passersby began to gather, some baffled, some nodding. Police officers arrived to move the demonstrators on, but they were already on the move, hurrying down into the metro to cover their key target: digital video screens advertising trainers. For decades France has had one of the most well-organised anti-advertising movements in the world, ranging from guerrilla protests with spray-cans to high-profile court cases. But now the boom in what is artfully called \u201cdigital-out-of-home advertising\u201d \u2013 eye-catching video screens dotted across urban areas, from train platforms to shopping centres \u2013 has sparked a new spate of French protests, civil disobedience and petitions. High tech video billboards are multiplying in city spaces across the world, woven into the fabric of everyday life, from ribbon videos down escalators on the London underground, to French metro corridors, New York taxis, bus-shelters, newspaper kiosks, and \u2013 increasingly \u2013 broadcast from shop windows onto the street. They are becoming more sophisticated and interactive, with the potential to collect data from passersby; increasingly bright and inescapable \u2013 impossible to click off or block like you can online. But in France, there is fresh debate on how urban planners and local councils should limit them in the public space for the sake of our overloaded eyes and brains. The trend to squeeze every bit of city downtime into an opportunity to place people in front of screen has become a political battle on the left. Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin of the French left party, La France Insoumise, recently tabled a French parliamentary amendment to ban video ads above urinals and toilets. It was dubbed the \u201cPee in Peace\u201d motion. Ruffin said he was horrified when standing at a Paris caf\u00e9 urinal to be visually \u201cassaulted\u201d by a video advertising Uber, a bank, and the book and tech store Fnac. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t enjoy that rare moment of calm: having a piss?\u201d he wrote in the amendment, warning that since 2015, over 2,000 of the screens had \u201ccolonised\u201d 1,200 urinals in 25 French towns. Lille, a former centre of northern French industry and now a hub for artists, designers and students, has become the focus of the latest battle over screens in the public space. Like many French cities, the Socialist city hall has sought limits on advertising video screens, meaning no street furniture on pavements carries commercial video ads. But in France those rules don\u2019t cover train stations or public transport, where video advertising is flourishing \u2013 particularly 10-second clips for Netflix, Amazon and film releases. When the local transport body for the greater Lille area recently fixed a new contract that could boost the number of video screens to around 160 \u2013 including in bus shelters \u2013 the city hall was furious, but largely powerless because the deal was legitimate. \u201cThis type of screen in the public space would be invasive and intrusive, consume too much energy, distract motorists and get children even more hooked on videos than they are already,\u201d said Jacques Richir, a Socialist deputy mayor. \u201cIt would mean advertising messages [infest] the urban landscape, when we want to limit them.\u201d Local representatives of the greater Lille area, the M\u00e9tropole Europ\u00e9ene de Lille, met this month to debate new local advertising rules, which protesters hope will take a tougher line on screens. Lyon, France\u2019s third biggest city, also moved this month to fund a new electric bike-scheme itself rather than strike a deal with outdoor advertisers which might have led to introducing video-screen ads in the city. But there are other loopholes on French pavements. In Lille, as in Paris, shops are considered private spaces, and not subject to local advertising rules. So all kinds of shopfronts \u2013 from chemists to hairdressers and tech shops to trainer emporiums \u2013 can put up screens just behind their windows, beaming digital video into the street. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Fabien Delecroix an IT teacher from the Lille branch of anti-ad campaigners R\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l\u2019Agression Publicitaire. \u201cIf someone stood naked at their window right on the street deliberately showing their body, you wouldn\u2019t say: \u2018Oh that\u2019s fine, they\u2019re technically not exposing themselves because they\u2019re in their own home.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, the courts in Lille are cracking down on protesters. At a hearing last month, flanked by supporters, Alessandro di Giussepe, a 42-year-old actor, who once stood for local election dressed as a joke \u201cpope\u201d of consumerism, was fined \u20ac900 (\u00a3758) for defacing adverts in the city with black pen as an act of civil disobedience. A father in a passing car had called the police, compl defacing ads was setting a bad example to children. Di Giussepe said adverts destroyed \u201cpublic space, which is our shared space\u201d. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop us,\u201d said Marion, from the Lille anti-advertising protest collective Les D\u00e9boulonneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re told children shouldn\u2019t be exposed to screens before age three, but in pushchairs they\u2019re craning their necks at the screens all around them in public.\u201d The French firm Mediatransports, which runs 1,250 video screens in French rail stations, as well as 700 on the Paris metro \u2013 including 150 in Paris\u2019s Gare du Nord alone \u2013 said digital screens were excellent at reaching commuters. \u201cThey generate more revenue than paper ads, because they can quickly adapt to advertisers\u2019 needs \u2013 changing a message for the exact time of day or even the weather.\u201d With French local elections in March, Grenoble\u2019s Green mayor, Eric Piolle, is running for re-election four years after styling his city at the foot of the French Alps as the first European urban centre to ban commercial street advertising. Piolle replaced more than 300 paper advertising signs with trees or community noticeboards, although bus and tram stops still carry adverts, which the city said it had limited. He said it was no surprise that ad screens and their mental and environmental impact was the next frontier in what politicians should ban. \u201cPublic space is a meeting space so lowering the aggression of advertising is positive for everyone,\u201d he said. Paris is also soul-searching about advertising. Early last year, the capital\u2019s more than 1,600 advertising signs \u2013 large grey paper advertising panels on pavements \u2013 disappeared for around 18 months during a protracted process to find a new contract. No one noticed their absence, but when they were gradually put back this autumn \u2014 the same number in virtually the same spots \u2014 many residents complained of an advertising onslaught. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people annoyed about advertising. People are coming up to me saying this sign is taking up half the pavement,\u201d said the long-time anti-advertising campaigner Thomas Bourgenot, of R\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l\u2019Agression Publicitaire in Paris. A petition by Greenpeace Paris and other groups has called on the city to ensure there can be no future arrival of commercial video ad screens, which are currently banned on street furniture. The city hall said its policy was not to develop any more advertising in the city, and to fight the illegal ads so often plastered or beamed across buildings. A spokeswoman said the size of ads had been reduced and a portion of street furniture given over to city messaging. The row in French cities is likely to continue. Historically, advertising took off later in France than in the UK and US, with French newspapers in the 1930s calling it a \u201cschool of lies\u201d.

I didn\u2019t pay the bills and ended up homeless again. After this, I hit the road and lived a nomadic lifestyle. I befriended people in bands and travelled the country, then Europe, with them, sometimes working as a roadie, cash in hand. I would crash at friends\u2019 and girlfriends\u2019 houses on the floor or the sofa. Eventually, I managed to get work with a zoo in the Canary Islands. I earned more money than ever before and, fortunately, what I spent it on saved my life. For a long time, I was teetering on the edge. I never took drugs or abused alcohol, but that lifestyle was always close. I had no children, no wife and no responsibilities: I could easily have gone off the rails. Instead, I spent the money on a rusty old narrowboat, which has since been renovated into a nice home. Now, I earn a living as a freelance content developer. I have known for a long time that I wouldn\u2019t be able to hack the rat race, the nine to five, 2.4 children and a mortgage. The narrowboat suits me. I can live where I want and I finally feel settled. I live simply, with my partner and my dog. All I need is a bottle of gas and a few litres of diesel to run the engine; add in a bag of groceries and you could almost call me domesticated. If you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application. You can use the gov.uk website to find your local council For more stories of life after homelessness, read Guardian Cities\u2019 the empty doorway series Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "bodyText": "In the past year, tech worker mobilization has reached unprecedented levels. Kickstarter employees sought union recognition from their company. Amazon workers led a cross tech-industry walkout to support the global climate strike. Googlers grappled with unionization, fought against increasing corporate hostility, and challenged their company\u2019s unethical partnerships. Even Chinese tech workers have joined in, with the viral 996.icu campaign that demanded more reasonable working hours. We documented all the collective actions in the tech industry in a publicly accessible online database and analyzed the results. What we learned challenges many mainstream media narratives about the tech workers\u2019 movement. Here are our eight most important insights. 1. Tech worker actions are growing exponentially There were more than a hundred publicly reported actions in 2019, some involving thousands of people. This is almost triple the number of actions we saw in 2018 and nine times the number in 2017. 2. Precarious workers are leading the fight ... Mainstream media coverage of the tech workers\u2019 movement has often focused on white-collar professionals \u2013 software engineers, data scientists, designers, program managers and other workers with high-paying desk jobs \u2013 such as the \u201cThanksgiving Four\u201d, who were allegedly fired by Google as retaliation for their organizing efforts. In reality, however, the majority of tech worker actions \u2013 many only reported by local news outlets \u2013 are led by less privileged tech workers, such as warehouse pickers, rideshare drivers, and service employees. From 2006 to 2019, our database shows, 57% of actions reported in the press were led by this group. This year, Amazon warehouse workers in Sacramento circulated a petition to reinstate two fired workers \u2013 and succeeded. Whole Foods workers denounced their parent company\u2019s ties to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). A protest caravan of rideshare employees drove roughly 600 miles across California to drum up support for the AB5 bill, which entitles gig workers to greater employee benefits. Thousands of Instacart workers in the US went on strike to protest reduced earnings. Delivery workers across the Atlantic, including Deliveroo workers in the UK and Foodora workers in Norway, found creative ways to make their voices heard. Uber Eats delivery staff even managed to unionize in Japan. 3. \u2026 but full-time and white-collar tech workers are becoming more active Before 2019, our data shows, the number of actions led by either blue-collar or contract workers was 74%. The past year saw something new, however: the number of actions from full-time/white-collar workers overtook the number of actions from less privileged tech workers. 4. Full-time/white-collar workers and more precarious workers are fighting for different things ... It\u2019s been argued that the tech worker movement has been fueled by employee concern for moral or ethical issues as opposed to more \u201ctraditional\u201d organizing concerns, such as higher wages and improved working conditions. But this characterization of the movement is a result of focusing on only the most privileged group. The data for less privileged tech workers tells a different story. The largest number of actions organized by full-time/white-collar workers (36%) were related to what we call \u201cexternal concerns\u201d \u2013 in other words, issues not directly applicable to a worker\u2019s ability to earn a livelihood. This category includes actions against climate change, partnerships with Ice and other controversial government agencies, and policies towards political advertising. Working conditions (18%) and discrimination (16%) came in a distant second and third. Blue-collar and contract workers, on the other hand, overwhelmingly organized around issues related to pay and benefits (53%) and working conditions (35%). 5. \u2026 and are fighting in different ways \u2026 The methods of protest used by the two groups also differed. Full-time/white-collar workers sent open letters to management as their core strategy, while more precarious groups went on strike or walked off the job. 6. ... but their struggles are connected Ultimately, concerns about exploitation of vulnerable populations underlie actions by both groups. In the case of many less privileged tech workers, whether they are blue-collar or contract workers, they happen to be the subject of this exploitation. Movements such as the Fight for 15 have argued that the struggle for living wages, decent working conditions, and basic benefits such as health insurance is an ethical dilemma for our society. Contractors have faced similar challenges within companies. When Google contract workers in Pittsburgh voted to unionize this year, they drew attention to the inequalities that exist even within white-collar roles. Failing to include gig workers, such as rideshare workers, delivery workers, or contract workers, as part of the tech worker movement reinforces stereotypes of who counts as an employee and undermines the potential for worker solidarity across the industry. 7. Amazon and Google are the main targets of tech activism The companies with the greatest number of reported actions from 2006 to 2019 were Amazon and Google. When grouped together, the rideshare companies Uber, Lyft, and Bolt followed, with 20 actions total. Whereas Amazon and the rideshare companies were mainly targets of actions by less privileged workers, Google and Microsoft were targeted by full-time/white-collar employees. 8. Solidarity among different groups of tech workers is crucial for the movement It\u2019s a common tactic for bosses to pit workers against each other in order to maintain control. Privileged tech workers must help to dismantle such divisions. Tech workers across the industry must learn to recognize the precariousness of contractors compared with full-time company employees, blue-collar compared with white-collar workers, and undocumented workers and visa holders compared with citizens. We began to see solidarity among different types of tech workers this year. In July, engineers from Amazon HQ flew out to Shakopee, Minnesota, to support their warehouse co-workers on their Prime Day strike. Earlier in the year, nearly a thousand Google workers signed a letter objecting to the tech company\u2019s treatment of temporary contractors, in what organizers are calling a \u201chistorical coalition\u201d between the company\u2019s full-time employees and temps, vendors and contractors. Unions and activist networks such as Tech Workers Coalition and Silicon Valley Rising have helped lead the charge in bringing some of these groups together. Other actions have simply been the result of individuals looking critically at the working conditions of those employed in the same workspace. When we expand our definition of who counts as a tech worker, we get a true sense of the scale of this movement and its potential to incite real change \u2013 if tech workers can band together.

You\u2019ve got everything you want in a Lowry \u2026 lots of people doing lots of different things, terraced houses, factories in the background.

The scene is important because it was the same mill that first inspired Lowry as an artist. It was 1916 and after missing his train Lowry looked at the scene with new eyes.</p> <p>He later recalled the moment: \u201cThe mill was turning out hundreds of little, pinched figures, heads bent down \u2026 I watched this scene \u2013 which I\u2019d looked at many times without seeing \u2013 with rapture.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton emigrated to the US in 1949, becoming a medical researcher at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York.</p> <p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he developed techniques for extracting and purifying mammalian DNA which he supplied by air to Maurice Wilkins and other scientists who discovered the double helix structure of DNA.</p> <p>Wilkins, who won the Nobel prize with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/23/sexism-in-science-did-watson-and-crick-really-steal-rosalind-franklins-data\">James Watson and Francis Crick</a>, wrote in his autobiography: \u201cAnd just a few days later, my friend Leonard Hamilton (another art enthusiast) \u2026 sent us excellent quality human DNA from his lab. Leonard was to become our main supplier of DNA.\u201d</p> <p>Another of Hamilton\u2019s claims to fame was that he and his family were the sole holdout tenants in a block of brownstones that were being demolished in the late 1950s. The house became famous as<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photo-the-story-behind-the-loneliest-brownstone-ever\"> the \u201cloneliest brownstone\u201d in a Life magazine feature</a> on \u201cVanishing New York\u201d. Vincente Minnelli used it in his 1960 film, Bells Are Ringing.</p> <p>Hamilton would later live in a fabulous house outside New York designed by modernist architects Barbara and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/18/nyregion/julian-neski-76-who-brought-modernism-to-beach-houses.html\">Julian Neski</a>. The Lowry by now was part of an impressive personal art collection that included works by Picasso, Whistler, Matisse and Bonnard.</p> <p>Lowry\u2019s reputation has changed dramatically over the decades. He was always liked by the public, but the art establishment took some time to catch up. One of the first people to recognise his talents was his teacher at the Salford School of Art, who wrote an encouraging review for the Manchester Guardian in 1921.</p> <p>Orchard said many critics probably never rated Lowry precisely because he was popular.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past there was an element of people turning their noses up at his work. They didn\u2019t see him as being a serious artist because he didn\u2019t fit in to any art movement,\u201d said Orchard. \u201cHe is an amazing artist, he recorded life that you can\u2019t see any more in the UK. There is a huge amount of pathos and emotion in these paintings, he understands the lives of the people in the paintings.\u201d</p> <p>The auction record for a Lowry painting is \u00a35.6m. Two of his paintings reached that sum: <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/ls-lowry-painting-the-football-match-861687\">The Football Match</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-15769475\">Piccadilly Circus</a>. The Mill, Pendlebury has been estimated at \u00a3700,000 to \u00a31m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An important LS Lowry painting that has never been publicly exhibited or featured in any books on the artist has emerged 70 years after its young British owner set off for a new life in the US. Leonard D Hamilton was a Manchester grammar school boy who studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge, before moving to the US in 1949. He was a brilliant researcher who played an important role in the discovery of the structure of DNA. He was also the proud owner of a 1943 painting by Lowry, thought to be a gift from his parents, which hung in his rooms at Oxford. Hamilton died this year aged 98 and the painting, The Mill, Pendlebury, will be a star of Christie\u2019s modern British art auction on 21 January. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual about this is that it just doesn\u2019t feature anywhere in the literature at all,\u201d said Nick Orchard, the head of modern British art at the auction house. \u201cIt is a lovely painting and a great composition. You\u2019ve got everything you want in a Lowry \u2026 lots of people doing lots of different things, terraced houses, factories in the background. It ticks all the boxes for Lowry.\u201d The newly discovered painting is a working-class industrial scene dominated by the Acme Spinning Company Mill, the UK\u2019s first all-electric powered cotton spinning mill, which opened in 1905 and operated until 1959. It was demolished in 1984. Lowry shows families out for a walk on their day off and children playing cricket. The scene is important because it was the same mill that first inspired Lowry as an artist. It was 1916 and after missing his train Lowry looked at the scene with new eyes. He later recalled the moment: \u201cThe mill was turning out hundreds of little, pinched figures, heads bent down \u2026 I watched this scene \u2013 which I\u2019d looked at many times without seeing \u2013 with rapture.\u201d Hamilton emigrated to the US in 1949, becoming a medical researcher at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he developed techniques for extracting and purifying mammalian DNA which he supplied by air to Maurice Wilkins and other scientists who discovered the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins, who won the Nobel prize with James Watson and Francis Crick, wrote in his autobiography: \u201cAnd just a few days later, my friend Leonard Hamilton (another art enthusiast) \u2026 sent us excellent quality human DNA from his lab. Leonard was to become our main supplier of DNA.\u201d Another of Hamilton\u2019s claims to fame was that he and his family were the sole holdout tenants in a block of brownstones that were being demolished in the late 1950s. The house became famous as the \u201cloneliest brownstone\u201d in a Life magazine feature on \u201cVanishing New York\u201d. Vincente Minnelli used it in his 1960 film, Bells Are Ringing. Hamilton would later live in a fabulous house outside New York designed by modernist architects Barbara and Julian Neski. The Lowry by now was part of an impressive personal art collection that included works by Picasso, Whistler, Matisse and Bonnard. Lowry\u2019s reputation has changed dramatically over the decades. He was always liked by the public, but the art establishment took some time to catch up. One of the first people to recognise his talents was his teacher at the Salford School of Art, who wrote an encouraging review for the Manchester Guardian in 1921. Orchard said many critics probably never rated Lowry precisely because he was popular. \u201cIn the past there was an element of people turning their noses up at his work. They didn\u2019t see him as being a serious artist because he didn\u2019t fit in to any art movement,\u201d said Orchard. \u201cHe is an amazing artist, he recorded life that you can\u2019t see any more in the UK. There is a huge amount of pathos and emotion in these paintings, he understands the lives of the people in the paintings.\u201d The auction record for a Lowry painting is \u00a35.6m. Two of his paintings reached that sum: The Football Match and Piccadilly Circus. The Mill, Pendlebury has been estimated at \u00a3700,000 to \u00a31m.",

      "body": "<p>He didn\u2019t get to nationalise the railways or dish out free broadband, but right at the year\u2019s end Jeremy Corbyn made one undeniable contribution to politics, culture and human understanding. In the wee hours of 13 December, as the scale of Labour\u2019s drubbing became clear, he said he would be stepping down after the start of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastating-exit-poll-triggers-bitter-blame-game-within-labour\" title=\"\">process of reflection</a>\u201d. Online, this phrase was combined with another P-word Corbyn had used in the same speech, and yet another viral sensation was born: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmaleehutton/status/1207026203724570624\" title=\"\">#PeriodOfReflection</a> was rapidly everywhere, and its use became more and more ironic as the noise around the contest to be Labour leader increased. The apogee of absurdity probably arrived last Wednesday, in the mid-afternoon, when #CorbynwasRight was the number one hashtag on Twitter, and calm and introspection seemed very far away indeed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thumbs that endlessly jab at phones attest to the fact that for many of us, stepping back from the fray is unthinkable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Five days on, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/clive-lewis-joins-race-to-be-labour-leader-pledging-to-unleash-party\" title=\"\">hats flying into the ring</a> and cliches already extending into the distance (the need to \u201creconnect\u201d, the imperative to stay \u201cradical\u201d), the idea of a quiet interlude and the chance to think deep thoughts about the politics of the left does look like something of a joke. But the reasons run deeper than the loud speculation about whether it will be Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/labour-senior-advisers-should-pay-price-for-defeat-says-thornberry\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry</a>, Lisa Nandy or Jess Phillips, and into one of the most vexing questions of our time: whether our current means of communication and discourse allow us any space to reflect on anything at all.</p> <p>At which point, an unlikely segue, away from politics, into the creative arts. The 21st century\u2019s closing-down of spaces for thought and reflection hit me like a hammer back in February, with the untimely death of the English <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/25/mark-hollis-lead-singer-of-talk-talk-dies-at-age-64-reports-say\" title=\"\">musician Mark Hollis</a>: among the noted passings-on of this year, his gave me the most pause for thought, something in keeping with his art. The chief creative force behind the band-cum-project Talk Talk, Hollis had moved from making fast-paced, glossy music that sounded like the very embodiment of the early to mid-80s, into stuff that was built on space and quiet. \u201cBefore you play two notes,\u201d <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/26107-mark-hollis-talk-talk-obituary\" title=\"\">he once said</a>, \u201clearn how to play one note, and don\u2019t play one note unless you\u2019ve got a reason to play it.\u201d</p> <p>To my mind, his group\u2019s masterpiece is the 1988 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/28/from-rocks-backpages-talk-talk\" title=\"\">Spirit of Eden</a>, a recorded period of reflection that lasts just over 41 minutes. If I want to think, this is the record I put on. Its first piece, The Rainbow, begins with the faintest of chords, the merest hint of piano and a couple of other instruments that contribute the most sparse of sounds, punctuated by stretches of silence. There are no drums until nearly the third minute; Hollis\u2019s voice \u2013 his first line is, \u201cOh yeah, the world\u2019s turned upside down\u201d \u2013 arrives at 3:29. The fact that Hollis had effectively retired from music in 1998 was held to be of a piece with such creations: he had gradually filled his music so full of space that there was eventually nowhere to go but complete silence, and the longest period of reflection any celebrated musician has probably ever registered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19e4fa366f94c2826da59b3f0e4be9a5a04bd32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19e4fa366f94c2826da59b3f0e4be9a5a04bd32/0_753_4542_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The 21st century\u2019s closing-down of spaces for reflection hit me like a hammer in February, with the untimely death of musician Mark Hollis.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The 21st century\u2019s closing-down of spaces for reflection hit me like a hammer in February, with the untimely death of musician Mark Hollis.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even at the time, Spirit of Eden, its follow-up Laughing Stock, and Hollis\u2019s only solo album sat well apart from the rest of popular music. But now, they sound like creations from another universe. The most successful 21st-century music tends to be intentionally huge-sounding, and devoid of much light and shade: thanks to a ubiquitous production technique called <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35250557\" title=\"\">dynamic range compression</a> that has been the \u201cin\u201d thing for more than a decade, even the quiet bits are now loud. At the same time, the tyranny of streaming and the necessity of grabbing listeners\u2019 attention as quickly as possible mean that composers and musicians are now in a permanent hurry, and desperate to hit us with the catchiest, crassest aspects of their songs. In 2017, researchers at Ohio State University discovered that the length of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/oct/04/spotify-song-intro-streaming-arctic-monkeys-led-zeppelin\" title=\"\">the average song intro</a> had come down from 20 seconds in the 1980s to just five seconds. Among the other celebrated musicians who died this year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/10/roxette-singer-marie-fredriksen-dies-aged-61\" title=\"\">Marie Fredriksson</a>, of the Swedish duo Roxette. By way of pointing to the future, that band\u2019s 1995 greatest hits collection was titled <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Roxette-Dont-Bore-Us-Get-To-The-Chorus-Roxettes-Greatest-Hits/master/59445\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Bore Us \u2013 Get to the Chorus!</a></p> <p>Music only reflects the way we live. Thumbs that endlessly jab at smartphones attest to the fact that for millions \u2013 billions? \u2013 of us, stepping back from the endless fray is now unthinkable. Come off Twitter or Facebook for a few weeks, then tentatively go back on, and you may find yourself seemingly tweeting and posting into the void, as the algorithms at work put you in a kind of <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/5-proven-facts-why-you-should-tweet-more-often\" title=\"\">temporary exile</a>, proving that online silence is a punishable offence. We all know the questions we silently ask our friends and acquaintances if they go quiet: why haven\u2019t you replied to my direct message? Couldn\u2019t you even have liked my post? Why on earth did you unfollow me?</p> <p>In the offline world, conversation and exchange can be inherently reflective. Other people\u2019s perspectives are empathetically soaked up; time is allowed for thought, and hesitation. The use of social media, by contrast, is too often performative: because most of it takes place in public view, it\u2019s a ritualised and pretty stupid kind of interaction in which the biggest applause is reserved for the least reflective behaviour. A study by researchers at New York University found that each <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/28/7313\" title=\"\">moral or emotional word used in a tweet</a> \u2013 \u201cfurious\u201d, \u201cfuming\u201d, \u201cbastard\u201d, \u201cvile\u201d, \u201cgross\u201d \u2013 increased its virality by an average of 20%. Metaphorically speaking, the loudest online conversations are all choruses, and no verses. Worse still, what is presented to us as the norm is the discursive equivalent of the worst kind of punk rock: misanthropic, nasty, endlessly excitable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/20/labour-power-denouncing-coffee-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour\u2019s long route back to power appears to rely on denouncing coffee | Joel Golby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the risk of sounding hopelessly old, I would argue that changes in other human habits have pushed us in much the same direction. It was undoubtedly good for our health, but the transformation of smoking into the preserve of pariahs has taken away one of the last things that allowed people in industrial societies to be temporarily alone with their thoughts.

      "bodyText": "He didn\u2019t get to nationalise the railways or dish out free broadband, but right at the year\u2019s end Jeremy Corbyn made one undeniable contribution to politics, culture and human understanding. In the wee hours of 13 December, as the scale of Labour\u2019s drubbing became clear, he said he would be stepping down after the start of a \u201cprocess of reflection\u201d. Online, this phrase was combined with another P-word Corbyn had used in the same speech, and yet another viral sensation was born: #PeriodOfReflection was rapidly everywhere, and its use became more and more ironic as the noise around the contest to be Labour leader increased. The apogee of absurdity probably arrived last Wednesday, in the mid-afternoon, when #CorbynwasRight was the number one hashtag on Twitter, and calm and introspection seemed very far away indeed. Five days on, with hats flying into the ring and cliches already extending into the distance (the need to \u201creconnect\u201d, the imperative to stay \u201cradical\u201d), the idea of a quiet interlude and the chance to think deep thoughts about the politics of the left does look like something of a joke. But the reasons run deeper than the loud speculation about whether it will be Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry, Lisa Nandy or Jess Phillips, and into one of the most vexing questions of our time: whether our current means of communication and discourse allow us any space to reflect on anything at all. At which point, an unlikely segue, away from politics, into the creative arts. The 21st century\u2019s closing-down of spaces for thought and reflection hit me like a hammer back in February, with the untimely death of the English musician Mark Hollis: among the noted passings-on of this year, his gave me the most pause for thought, something in keeping with his art. The chief creative force behind the band-cum-project Talk Talk, Hollis had moved from making fast-paced, glossy music that sounded like the very embodiment of the early to mid-80s, into stuff that was built on space and quiet. \u201cBefore you play two notes,\u201d he once said, \u201clearn how to play one note, and don\u2019t play one note unless you\u2019ve got a reason to play it.\u201d To my mind, his group\u2019s masterpiece is the 1988 album Spirit of Eden, a recorded period of reflection that lasts just over 41 minutes. If I want to think, this is the record I put on. Its first piece, The Rainbow, begins with the faintest of chords, the merest hint of piano and a couple of other instruments that contribute the most sparse of sounds, punctuated by stretches of silence. There are no drums until nearly the third minute; Hollis\u2019s voice \u2013 his first line is, \u201cOh yeah, the world\u2019s turned upside down\u201d \u2013 arrives at 3:29. The fact that Hollis had effectively retired from music in 1998 was held to be of a piece with such creations: he had gradually filled his music so full of space that there was eventually nowhere to go but complete silence, and the longest period of reflection any celebrated musician has probably ever registered. Even at the time, Spirit of Eden, its follow-up Laughing Stock, and Hollis\u2019s only solo album sat well apart from the rest of popular music. But now, they sound like creations from another universe. The most successful 21st-century music tends to be intentionally huge-sounding, and devoid of much light and shade: thanks to a ubiquitous production technique called dynamic range compression that has been the \u201cin\u201d thing for more than a decade, even the quiet bits are now loud. At the same time, the tyranny of streaming and the necessity of grabbing listeners\u2019 attention as quickly as possible mean that composers and musicians are now in a permanent hurry, and desperate to hit us with the catchiest, crassest aspects of their songs. In 2017, researchers at Ohio State University discovered that the length of the average song intro had come down from 20 seconds in the 1980s to just five seconds. Among the other celebrated musicians who died this year was Marie Fredriksson, of the Swedish duo Roxette. By way of pointing to the future, that band\u2019s 1995 greatest hits collection was titled Don\u2019t Bore Us \u2013 Get to the Chorus! Music only reflects the way we live. Thumbs that endlessly jab at smartphones attest to the fact that for millions \u2013 billions? \u2013 of us, stepping back from the endless fray is now unthinkable. Come off Twitter or Facebook for a few weeks, then tentatively go back on, and you may find yourself seemingly tweeting and posting into the void, as the algorithms at work put you in a kind of temporary exile, proving that online silence is a punishable offence. We all know the questions we silently ask our friends and acquaintances if they go quiet: why haven\u2019t you replied to my direct message? Couldn\u2019t you even have liked my post? Why on earth did you unfollow me? In the offline world, conversation and exchange can be inherently reflective. Other people\u2019s perspectives are empathetically soaked up; time is allowed for thought, and hesitation. The use of social media, by contrast, is too often performative: because most of it takes place in public view, it\u2019s a ritualised and pretty stupid kind of interaction in which the biggest applause is reserved for the least reflective behaviour. A study by researchers at New York University found that each moral or emotional word used in a tweet \u2013 \u201cfurious\u201d, \u201cfuming\u201d, \u201cbastard\u201d, \u201cvile\u201d, \u201cgross\u201d \u2013 increased its virality by an average of 20%. Metaphorically speaking, the loudest online conversations are all choruses, and no verses. Worse still, what is presented to us as the norm is the discursive equivalent of the worst kind of punk rock: misanthropic, nasty, endlessly excitable. At the risk of sounding hopelessly old, I would argue that changes in other human habits have pushed us in much the same direction. It was undoubtedly good for our health, but the transformation of smoking into the preserve of pariahs has taken away one of the last things that allowed people in industrial societies to be temporarily alone with their thoughts. Whatever the downsides that have led increasing numbers of young people to leave booze alone, the moderate use of alcohol at least creates the opportunity for a slowing of our mental processes and exchange with others free of at least some inhibitions; the modern ubiquity of coffee, by contrast, highlights the fact that the most acceptable thing to be is uptight and hyperactive. More and more, a question hangs over the social, economic and cultural model we have created for ourselves: how are you meant to get a handle on a world of automation and online everything when their frantic rhythms so consume you, making any kind of critical distance impossible? An answer may lie in that divine calm that, if you are fortunate, begins to take hold some time on Christmas Eve, and can be extended for the best part of a week. If that is going to happen, you have to switch off your phone, perhaps put on some appropriate music \u2013 Spirit of Eden, Brian Eno\u2019s ambient triumph Music for Airports, or something more seasonal \u2013 and allow yourself to think. Otherwise what wins? Only unrestrained technocapitalism, whose cacophonous din gets louder every year. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Here, the team unleashes its planned chaos on a Christmas tale of a drunken Santa and his elves trying to restore some festive cheer to a girl beset by her arguing parents. Of course, disaster ensues. Saccharine family fun for the Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys fans. Ammar Kalia What We Were Watching: Christmas 1979 8pm, BBC Four Last December, Grace Dent, host of Christmas past, invited viewers through a nostalgic time tunnel to reassess the festive schedules of 1988. This year, she is heading even further back to see what the viewing options were like 40 years ago in the pre-Freeview dark ages of just three channels. Graeme Virtue Hugh Grant: A Life on Screen 9pm, BBC Two The bumbling romcom megastar Hugh Grant lives up to his wry, self-deprecating screen persona in this documentary taking us through his movie roles, from Sense and Sensibility to Four Weddings, Bridget Jones and Love Actually. A charming showcase ahead of his latest, The Gentlemen. AK Gordon, Gino and Fred: Christmas Road Trip \u2013 Three Unwise Men 9pm, ITV The two chefs and the ma\u00eetre\u2019d return for another dose of their Grand-Tour-meets-cookery series, this time travelling through Morocco in their search for unconventional Christmas fare. The trio go saffron picking, goat herding and fishing before cooking a Christmas feast. AK Sid &amp; Judy 9pm, Sky Arts Continuing the trend for big-screen musician biopics, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger played Judy Garland \u2013 whose life was blighted by addiction \u2013 on screen earlier this year. This new documentary seems a fitting companion piece, focusing the singer\u2019s life through the memories of her husband, Sid Luft. Hannah J Davies The Reluctant Landlord: Christmas Special 10pm, Sky One Romesh Ranganathan\u2019s constantly unimpressed landlord serves up some low-key festivities in the world\u2019s most terrible pub. Although Romesh is keen to have a day off at Christmas, the regulars are horrified at the prospect. Can he match up to his dad\u2019s legendary celebrations? Hannah Verdier Film choice Performance (Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg, 1970), 11.40pm, TCM A brilliant, kaleidoscopic mix of Krays villainy and acid-infused rock dreams from directors Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg. James Fox\u2019s gangster, Chas, hides out in the home of rock recluse Turner (Mick Jagger), who is living in a potty, sexy m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Anita Pallenberg and Mich\u00e8le Breton.

The swift recruitment of 20 students from Middlesex University solved that problem. There was also trouble over a scene from the book that shows the tiger picking up a teapot and pouring scalding hot tea straight into his mouth. \u201cWe had to add a line for Mummy that says, \u2018Be careful, it\u2019s a bit ... hot!\u2019\u201d says Fielding. \u201cIt makes for a comedic moment, but it was actually borne out of Channel 4 worrying that it could be classed as imitable behaviour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38857db4134e953709983885471ab0958c2ab398\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38857db4134e953709983885471ab0958c2ab398/0_158_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tea time \u2026 Tim Jonze and his daughter, Romy, visit the Lupus studios.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tea time \u2026 Tim Jonze and his daughter, Romy, visit the Lupus studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also, more sadly, the death of the story\u2019s creator, aged 95, in May. Kerr had been very involved: advising on the script, approving the cast, even chipping in on the precise shade of red used for Sophie\u2019s coat. And, before all this, Lupus first had to convince Kerr they were the right people to bring her story \u2013 which has sold more than 5m copies \u2013 to the screen. The hand-drawn aesthetic that made their version of We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt such a treat helped their case, while the fact that Kerr was allowed to weigh in on the film was doubtless another factor.</p> <p>\u201cInitially, there were a few more lines for the tiger,\u201d says Robin Shaw, the director. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t having any of it \u2013 and she was bang on. The Tiger only says two things in the book, but you don\u2019t ever feel he\u2019s lacking in presence or character. The minute you put words in his mouth, he becomes someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw hit it off with Kerr: they\u2019d talk endlessly about pencils, lines, the use of perspective. He remembers telling her how clever it was that the Tiger\u2019s eyes are always perfectly aligned with the vanishing points and the focus of the page.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she said, \u2018Oooh, really?

But, in a strange way, it was motivating\u2013 it made us want to do an even better job.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time to take a tour of the building. Romy has been temporarily distracted by a tea party the team have put on for her, so I sneak out with line producer Adam Jackson-Nocher. He shows me a vast storyboard pinned along the corridor, with each panel colour-coded to show where they\u2019re all at. It\u2019s head-spinning stuff. There are 20,000 individual drawings \u2013 all needing sketching, tidying, colouring and finessing \u2013 to make this 24-minute film. Technology plays a part \u2013 a nifty brush has been designed to paint instant furry tiger stripes \u2013 but for the most part it\u2019s drawn by hand.</p> <p>The team talk me through a scene where the \u201ccamera\u201d is looking down from the ceiling, spinning around as buns tumble towards the table. Computer-generated animation would speed things up here, but it would also give everything a consistent \u201ccorrect\u201d look \u2013 and that is not how Kerr drew the book. Entire kitchen units would change or even disappear with a turn of the page, depending on how Kerr wanted things to look.</p> <p>To make this charming inconsistency work, an 80-strong team had to draw under strict guidance, each fully understanding not just how the tiger should look but how he moved and what sort of character he was. \u201cHe\u2019s the Roger Moore of tigers,\u201d shouts Shaw from across the room. I laugh but it turns out he\u2019s serious: \u201cHe breezes in, affects everyone\u2019s life, manages to get exactly what he wants, then breezes out again leaving everyone feeling kind of used but happy with that. He\u2019s a seducer, a charmer. He\u2019ll only do something if he wants to, and will only give something if it looks like he might get something in return. Completely selfish, but in the nicest possible way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45db504014df1bc061f90a52b4bac13f72bf3dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45db504014df1bc061f90a52b4bac13f72bf3dd9/341_132_2856_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paws for thought \u2026 The Tiger Who Came to Tea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paws for thought \u2026 The Tiger Who Came to Tea</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lupus Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s time to test the magic, so we head back to the tea party room for a screening.

For many, it\u2019s the evening scene after Daddy comes home and, realising there\u2019s no food left in the house, takes Sophie and Mummy out to a cafe. Sophie is dressed in her nightie, coat and wellies, but just behind her sits a stripy, ginger cat in the glow of the street lights. For Fielding, one of the animation\u2019s key illustrations isn\u2019t actually part of the story \u2013 instead, it features on the inside sleeve of some versions of the book. It shows Sophie and the tiger drinking lemonade together through straws.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a bit of a eureka moment when we were writing the script because we realised that Sophie could <em>imagine</em> what it would be like if the tiger stayed for ever. So she recreates him going to school and sitting on her bed, then comes to the realisation that actually it would be ridiculous \u2013 you can\u2019t have a tiger at home. Judith responded really well to this idea, meaning we\u2019re not confined to the four walls of the house.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, if the book itself is about one thing then it\u2019s imagination. The huge amount of white space on almost every page invites readers to let their own minds run free. Perhaps this is why the story lends itself to so many different readings, from feminist ones (is the Tiger the male of the house who does no housework?) to Michael Rosen\u2019s notion that the stripy visitor is an intruding Gestapo officer. (Kerr grew up in Germany but the family fled to Switzerland and then Britain as the Nazis closed in.)</p> <p>When we first read the book to Romy, my wife was pregnant with our second child and it was hard to avoid the metaphor: here comes a new guest to upend the nice time you had planned with Mummy. But Kerr always insisted the story be taken at face value, that it\u2019s about a child\u2019s most wonderful fantasies. Romy\u2019s reaction is testament to that \u2013 and ever since she\u2019s seen the tiger slinking around the screen she hasn\u2019t stopped wanting him to come for tea.</p> <p>\u2022 The Tiger Who Came to Tea is on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve at 7.30pm.</p>",

So she recreates him going to school and sitting on her bed, then comes to the realisation that actually it would be ridiculous \u2013 you can\u2019t have a tiger at home. Judith responded really well to this idea, meaning we\u2019re not confined to the four walls of the house.\u201d Indeed, if the book itself is about one thing then it\u2019s imagination. The huge amount of white space on almost every page invites readers to let their own minds run free. Perhaps this is why the story lends itself to so many different readings, from feminist ones (is the Tiger the male of the house who does no housework?) to Michael Rosen\u2019s notion that the stripy visitor is an intruding Gestapo officer. (Kerr grew up in Germany but the family fled to Switzerland and then Britain as the Nazis closed in.) When we first read the book to Romy, my wife was pregnant with our second child and it was hard to avoid the metaphor: here comes a new guest to upend the nice time you had planned with Mummy. But Kerr always insisted the story be taken at face value, that it\u2019s about a child\u2019s most wonderful fantasies. Romy\u2019s reaction is testament to that \u2013 and ever since she\u2019s seen the tiger slinking around the screen she hasn\u2019t stopped wanting him to come for tea. \u2022 The Tiger Who Came to Tea is on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve at 7.30pm.",

      "bodyText": "Fields around Titchmarsh, usually green with sprouting cereals, lie naked under the weeping skies. Since the August deluge, rain has been frequent and heavy, and brief sunny interludes have not dried the sodden land. Farmers have struggled to get on to their fields; often the plough has done its work, but the planter has not yet followed. Working wet soils presents challenges for the machinery, and also damages and compacts the soil. The interminable rain has scoured rich topsoils from the bare fields into the rivers. Farmers now face having to plant spring crops with low profit margins, while a strengthening pound has been suppressing prices, despite concerns about domestic yields in 2020. Getting on to Titchmarsh nature reserve involves squeezing along the raised path edge, which is itself ankle deep in water, while being watched by a flock of greylag geese standing in shallow floods. The lake, a former gravel pit, is usually about 34 hectares, but has swollen to nearer 40, leaving a telltale line of emerging reeds that mark the usual bank. Traversing the western edge of the reserve along Harper\u2019s Brook, we encounter a flock of Hebridean sheep grazing nervously on a raised bank of tussocky grass. Black as night and lavishly coated, most sport a pair of thick curved horns but a few are endowed with four, the top pair spiking upwards. A great white egret lifts elegantly away from the water\u2019s edge, its body and gangly legs bouncing gracefully up and down, suspended between its awesomely long wings. This snow-white spirit of wetlands is perfectly in its element in these watery conditions. As part of the rapidly burgeoning European population, only colonising the UK in recent years, this bird is at home, but for me each sighting still carries the frisson of the new and rare. On the eastern side of the reserve, the River Nene is swollen and spills evenly over the bank and across the path, gathering and gushing in a torrent through the poplar trees and into the lake. Absorbing this surplus water on the reserve provides protection to fields and towns downstream.",

The quote was used in headlines and articles by outlets including ITV and several news websites to suggest that Stormzy had said the UK was 100% racist, rather than that he 100% believed there was racism in the country.

In addition to offering tourist visas, the government enacted policy changes to make the region more appealing to tourists, including allowing unmarried foreign couples<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49947515\"> to book hotel rooms together</a>, and allowing solo female travellers to rent hotel rooms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/12/the-instagram-influencers-hired-to-rehabilitate-saudi-arabias-image\">The Instagram influencers hired to rehabilitate Saudi Arabia's image</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following these changes a number of influencers, with follower numbers in the hundreds of thousands, accepted paid-for press trips to the kingdom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/12/the-instagram-influencers-hired-to-rehabilitate-saudi-arabias-image\">and posted fawning commentary on social media.</a></p> <p>The biggest-name attendees at MDLBeast have follower counts in the millions.

I saw Saudi men and women ecstatic about an event that they never thought they would ever see in their lifetimes... it felt like a cultural shift. A change. Like Woodstock in the 1960\u2019s. Social evolution is slow and takes time but what I was able to be a part of felt like one giant seed of growth. The people there throwing themselves into the experience will lead a cultural revolution that we all need to get behind and support. #mdlbeast</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/armiehammer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Armie Hammer</a> (@armiehammer) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-12-22T08:09:14+00:00\">Dec 22, 2019 at 12:09am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Journalist Yashar Ali responded by asking Hammer \u201cDid you find Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s body while you were there?\u201d Podcast host and writer Aminatou Sow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aminatou/status/1208732027190685696?s=20\">said on Twitter</a> that influencer culture was \u201cshameless\u201d.</p> <p>According to Instagram stories posted by model Theodora Quinlivan, Emily Ratajkowski \u2013 who has more than 24 million followers \u2013 turned down a paid invitation to attend the festival, because she was uncomfortable with Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record, particularly for LGBTIQ+ people.</p> <p>The actions of the influencers were called out by Diet Prada, an Instagram account that has garnered 1.6 million followers for criticising the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/22/diet-prada-the-instagram-account-that-airs-the-fashion-industrys-dirty-laundry\">fashion industry on issues of plagiarism and cultural appropriation</a>.

Cashing big fat checks in exchange for #content creation (aka propaganda) to rehabilitate the image of Saudi Arabia, a country said to be causing \u201cthe world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis\u201d, according to the United Nations. According to anonymous sources, six-figure sums were offered for attendance and geo-tagged posts. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 Following the government\u2019s pre-meditated murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi in October 2018 , the arrest of women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul in May 2018, the outing of a gay Saudi journalist and his partner who began receiving death threats from their families (homosexuality is a crime in Saudi Arabia and punishable by death), and countless other human rights abuses, a bevy of supermodels, influencers, celebrities, and musicians convened in Riyadh for the inaugural @mdlbeast . According to @hypebeast , the electronic music festival is \u201cone of the most significant musical events the region has ever seen\u201d. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 Saudi Arabia has been spending billions to change its image in the west, but this is sure to be the most expensive campaign yet. In a series of Instagram stories posted by transgender model @teddy_quinlivan , it was revealed that fellow model @emrata had turned down the trip, evidently aware of the country\u2019s human rights crisis. \u201cIt is very important to me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community, freedom of expression and the right to a free press. I hope coming forward on this brings more attention to the injustices happening there\u201d, said Ratajkowski in a statement to Diet Prada. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 Unfortunately, not all shared the same sentiments. There are simply too many attendees to name. Dieters, feel free to tag any attendees you know of... just in case they haven\u2019t been reading the news. \u2022 #propoganda #jamalkashoggi #humanrights #humanrightsabuse #lgbtq #lgbtqrights #freespeech #journalism #independent #womensrights #mdlbeast #edm #electronicmusic #supermodel #influencer #content #riyadh #emrata #emilyratajkowski #teddyquinlivan #model #celebrity #dj #electronicmusic #musicfestival #wtf #smh #government #corruption #dietprada</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diet_prada/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Diet Prada \u2122</a> (@diet_prada) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-12-21T22:04:41+00:00\">Dec 21, 2019 at 2:04pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Writer and editor Phillip Picardi, who has previously worked as digital editorial director of Conde Nast\u2019s Teen Vogue was also critical. On Instagram stories, he said he was \u201cextremely, profoundly disappointed to see people on my Instagram feed who traveled to Saudi Arabia as part of their government\u2019s image rehabilitation campaign\u201d. He later posted: \u201ca lot of the messaging of the captions is about portraying SA as changed and accepting, and the trips appear to be coordinated with the government or tourism board. You can\u2019t really \u2018buy\u2019 that kind of messaging, and how was your experience there tainted by who organized your trip and what you can or cannot say?\u201d</p> <p>Smalls, Hammer, Westwick, Amy Jackson and Ambrosio, amongst others, all posted content from the festival, as did Halima Aden, one of the first hijab-wearing models to sign with a major modelling agency. Ambrosio and Aden disclosed that they had been paid to post.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6YT7MhBT27/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "MDL Beast had all the markings of a big budget electronic music festival. The line-up included big name acts like David Guetta and Steve Aoki. The guest list featured supermodels (Joan Smalls and Alessandra Ambrosio) and actors (Armie Hammer and Ed Westwick), and there was plenty of fluorescent face paint and neon lights. But the event was not held in the California or the Nevada desert. Instead, MDL Beast was located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The festival, which took place over the weekend, billed itself as \u201cthe region\u2019s biggest music event\u201d. Now many of its high profile attendees are being accused of engaging in \u201cimage rehab\u201d for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is not the first time western celebrities and influencers have been criticised for promoting Saudi Arabia as a tourist destination. In September, the kingdom announced it would open itself to foreign tourism. In addition to offering tourist visas, the government enacted policy changes to make the region more appealing to tourists, including allowing unmarried foreign couples to book hotel rooms together, and allowing solo female travellers to rent hotel rooms. Following these changes a number of influencers, with follower numbers in the hundreds of thousands, accepted paid-for press trips to the kingdom, and posted fawning commentary on social media. The biggest-name attendees at MDLBeast have follower counts in the millions. While many documented their experience at the festival on social media, mentions of the kingdom\u2019s human rights record were noticeably absent. Actor Armie Hammer said on Instagram the festival was \u201cfelt like a cultural shift\u201d. Journalist Yashar Ali responded by asking Hammer \u201cDid you find Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s body while you were there?\u201d Podcast host and writer Aminatou Sow said on Twitter that influencer culture was \u201cshameless\u201d. According to Instagram stories posted by model Theodora Quinlivan, Emily Ratajkowski \u2013 who has more than 24 million followers \u2013 turned down a paid invitation to attend the festival, because she was uncomfortable with Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record, particularly for LGBTIQ+ people. The actions of the influencers were called out by Diet Prada, an Instagram account that has garnered 1.6 million followers for criticising the fashion industry on issues of plagiarism and cultural appropriation. Diet Prada received a statement from Ratajkowski detailing why she declined to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community, freedom of expression and the right to a free press. I hope coming forward on this brings more attention to the injustices happening there,\u201d the statement said. Writer and editor Phillip Picardi, who has previously worked as digital editorial director of Conde Nast\u2019s Teen Vogue was also critical. On Instagram stories, he said he was \u201cextremely, profoundly disappointed to see people on my Instagram feed who traveled to Saudi Arabia as part of their government\u2019s image rehabilitation campaign\u201d. He later posted: \u201ca lot of the messaging of the captions is about portraying SA as changed and accepting, and the trips appear to be coordinated with the government or tourism board. You can\u2019t really \u2018buy\u2019 that kind of messaging, and how was your experience there tainted by who organized your trip and what you can or cannot say?\u201d Smalls, Hammer, Westwick, Amy Jackson and Ambrosio, amongst others, all posted content from the festival, as did Halima Aden, one of the first hijab-wearing models to sign with a major modelling agency. Ambrosio and Aden disclosed that they had been paid to post. Conde Nast publication Glamour UK also included a sponsored campaign from the festival. The festival comes more than one year after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The killing was soon traced to the door of the Saudi royal court. The stain on the reputation of the royal family endures, despite Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s repeated denials that he had personally issued the \u201ckill order\u201d. The prince has presided over an opening up of the kingdom, allowing women to travel without the permission of a male guardian, register a marriage and be the legal guardian of children. Still in place, however, are rules that require male consent for a woman to leave prison, exit a domestic abuse shelter or marry. Women, unlike men, still cannot pass on citizenship to their children and cannot provide consent for their children to marry. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 December 2019 to correct the spelling of Alessandra Ambrosio\u2019s first name.",

      "bodyText": "Young Australians on social media are mocking Scott Morrison and expressing their anger over his six-day holiday to Hawaii during Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis. Morrison returned to work on Sunday, cutting his personal family holiday short by a day, after transferring responsibilities to the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, last Monday. On Friday, the prime minister announced he would return early after the deaths of two firefighters, and said he \u201cdeeply regrets any offence caused\u201d by the holiday. But his absence, and his lack of action on climate change, had already become a meme on Facebook, satirical news websites and TikTok, the video app popular among teenagers and younger users. TikToks are short videos, between 15 and 60 seconds, where users lipsync along to film dialogue or music. One, set to Billy Joel\u2019s We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire, has been viewed more than 120,000 times while Morrison was overseas. Another, set to Kourtney Kardashian saying \u201cWorking is not my top priority\u201d, has racked up more than 42,000 views. The #scomo hashtag, which collects many of the videos, had more than 1 million combined views by Monday. Another, set to the 2006 song Cry for You by Swedish singer September, received 217,100 views and 37,100 likes and prominently samples a segment where she sings: \u201cYou\u2019ll never see me again\u201d. Young Australians also protested against Morrison\u2019s absence, on Thursday and Saturday last week in marches outside Kirribilli House. Hundreds set up tents outside the prime minister\u2019s Sydney residence on Thursday, while 13-year-old Isolde Raj-Seppings was given a move-on direction by police. After launching in 2017, TikTok has grown to become one of the most downloaded apps of 2019. Owned by Chinese company ByteDance, it bought and adopted the popular lip-sync app Musical.ly, giving it an instant existing audience base of 60 million users. It has also recently come under fire for blocking posts critical of the Chinese government, including a viral make-up tutorial that drew attention to the government\u2019s mass detention of Muslims in Xinjiang. A spokesman for the company said it was a \u201chuman moderation error\u201d and reinstated the account of the user, 17-year-old Feroza Aziz. In September, the Guardian revealed TikTok\u2019s internal guidelines told moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square or Tibetan independence. TikTok operates as a separate but identical app called Douyin in China that complies with Chinese censorship laws.",

Working with Zahra Newman, one of Australia\u2019s most remarkable actors, Greene recreated Wake in Fright as a contemporary nightmare, channelling the gothic anxieties of settler Australia through the body of a woman of colour. Greene exploited the potencies of language and performance, creating a ritual in which the actor was a shaman who summoned the voices of the dead. Without doubt among the most astonishing performances of 2019, and unforgettable theatre. <em><strong>Alison Croggon</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Douglas, by Hannah Gadsby</strong></h2> <p><strong>Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and <a href=\"https://hannahgadsby.com.au/#shows\">more to come</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bffe423dde8647190d952cb4de4d5ce50eac4c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bffe423dde8647190d952cb4de4d5ce50eac4c8/0_65_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedian Hannah Gadsby poses for a photo in Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comedian Hannah Gadsby in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meredith O'Shea/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Few people thought Hannah Gadsby could do it again after the resounding success of her viral Netflix special, Nanette; Gadsby herself announced she was quitting comedy. But with Douglas, her new show, which had its world premiere in Melbourne in March, Gadsby exceeded expectations. The Tasmanian comic stuck to her winning \u2013 if controversial \u2013 formula of eschewing traditional stand-up in favour of searing social commentary and raw personal revelation. This time, she both took to task the prejudices encased in fine art, in one brilliant power-point presentation, and revealed her autism diagnosis, making a case for the celebration of neurodiversity. Sad, funny, clever, and most of all authentic, Gadsby continues to rewrite the comedy rules. <em><strong>Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Counting and Cracking, by S. </strong>Shakthidharan</h2> <p><strong>Belvoir and Co-Curious at Belvoir St theatre, Sydney, and Ridley Centre, Adelaide</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1847ebfd888a3ab1b76f840683c58e287ade86b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1847ebfd888a3ab1b76f840683c58e287ade86b3/0_53_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belvoir Street theatre\u2019s Counting And Cracking, which premiered at Sydney Town Hall in January 2019 as part of Sydney festivla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belvoir\u2019s production of Counting and Cracking, which premiered at Sydney Town Hall in January 2019 as part of Sydney festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belvoir and Co-Curious created Counting and Cracking, not only an epic drama of geopolitical trauma but a domestic tale of the human quest for belonging, with warm comic flourishes. I saw it twice and was captivated by the storytelling craft of 16 actors in some 50 roles across four eras. Combining incendiary politics, humans fleeing for their lives, and questions of identity for second- and third-generation Australians whose parents and grandparents felt the force of war in Sri Lanka, western Sydney writer S. Shakthidharan was inspired by the unanswered questions in his family diaspora. Director Eamon Flack took this show of ambitious scale to Sydney town hall and later Adelaide showgrounds, and then to seven Helpmann awards, including best new Australian work, best production and best direction. <em><strong>Steve Dow</strong></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/17/blanchett-on-toast-how-heather-mitchell-is-making-a-meal-of-her-co-stars\">Blanchett on toast: how Heather Mitchell is making a meal of her co-stars</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Anthem, by Andrew Bovell, Patricia Cornelius, Melissa Reeves, Christos Tsiolkas and Irine Vela</strong></h2> <p><strong>Melbourne International Arts festival at Arts Centre Melbourne, with Sydney festival and Perth festival (forthcoming)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66a2bb420093be35ca5172c068e8b685a155649a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a2bb420093be35ca5172c068e8b685a155649a/60_0_2440_1544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cast of Anthem, which premiered at Melbourne international arts festival in October 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cast of Anthem, which premiered at Melbourne international arts festival in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pia Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A particular joy of Anthem, set in Melbourne\u2019s trains and stations, is found in knowing the work of the writers: Christos Tsiolkas\u2019s families, Patricia Cornelius\u2019s violence, Andrew Bovell\u2019s choruses, Melissa Reeves\u2019s satire. Their voices are distinct, yet come together in rich concert. Anthem occasionally falters, but it is an ambitious portrait of working-class Australia too rarely staged.</p> <p>Tying it all together is Irine Vela\u2019s composition for strings. As I left, a busker played the cello outside. It was a beautiful clash between the stage and the street, following me to the platform and on to the train home, shifting the way I carried myself in the world \u2013 the way all good theatre does. <em><strong>Jane Howard</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Prima Facie, by Suzie Miller</strong></h2> <p><strong>Griffin Theatre Company, at SBW Stables theatre, Sydney, and Canberra theatre centre, Canberra</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5650800de0841ac306cc0b6720384f193a4f9e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5650800de0841ac306cc0b6720384f193a4f9e8a/0_313_4724_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheridan Harbridge performing as Tessa in Griffin Theatre Company\u2019s production of Prima Facie by Suzie Miller.

This new Australian work, presented as a one-woman show, felt intricate and informed \u2013 particularly due to ex-lawyer and playwright Suzie Miller\u2019s deeply rooted understanding of the system\u2019s pitfalls and the patriarchal pillars that still uphold the legal definition of \u201cjustice\u201d. Sheridan Harbridge delivered a hard-hitting performance as the snappy criminal defence attorney who knows the ins and outs of the system yet becomes entrapped, and eventually traumatised, within it. The play is both quick-fire entertaining and emotionally devastating, and altogether difficult to forget. <em><strong>Debbie Zhou</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Gender Euphoria, by Maude Davey and Mama Alto</strong></h2> <p><strong>Midsumma, Melbourne International Arts festival and Arts Centre Melbourne, at The Famous Spiegeltent, Melbourne</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91faadeff130cb82890a8224c0e215dad53f8f1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91faadeff130cb82890a8224c0e215dad53f8f1d/0_0_1800_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A production shot from Gender Euphoria, a one-night-only stage show at the Arts Centre, Melbourne, as part of Midsumma festival.

Under Mama Alto\u2019s gentle wing, an impressive cast of trans and gender-diverse performers alternatively sang like angels, danced like demons and told stories of their lives that brought the crowd to fits of laughter or audible tears; a joke about dildos in bumbags, memorably, to both. An authentic joy. <em><strong>Van Badham</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Fangirls, by Yve Blake</strong></h2> <p><strong>Brisbane festival, Queensland Theatre and Belvoir, at Bille Browne theatre, Brisbane, and Belvoir St theatre, Sydney</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d6b2901474be3b49219de2aee61396f4a13c34d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6b2901474be3b49219de2aee61396f4a13c34d/0_114_3915_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Millerchip, Ayesha Madon, James Majoos, Chika Ikogwe, Kimberley Hodgson in Fangirls, a new Australian musical that premiered at Brisbane festival 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Millerchip, Ayesha Madon, James Majoos, Chika Ikogwe, Kimberley Hodgson in Fangirls, a new Australian musical that premiered at Brisbane festival 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Henry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Remember your first crush?

Directed with cold precision by Matthew Lutton at Malthouse, Solaris spins Lem\u2019s crew of isolated cosmonauts into the dangerous orbit of a planet that resurrects from their memories the ghosts of their beloved dead. Sharp performances and clinical design evoked Grieg\u2019s sparse and clever metaphors; both imprinted in the mind a tangible visual of the mysterious planet, despite it never once appearing on stage. <em><strong>Van Badham</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Every Brilliant Thing, by </strong>Duncan Macmillan with Jonny Donahoe</h2> <p><strong>Belvoir, at Belvoir St theatre and Riverside theatre in Parramatta, and <a href=\"https://belvoir.com.au/productions/every-brilliant-thing-3/\">another season to come (with Steve Rodgers) in 2020 at Belvoir</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1809d1af0aa813ddfa27d6f7d4d5909c5f8bd8e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1809d1af0aa813ddfa27d6f7d4d5909c5f8bd8e0/0_36_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Mulvany in Every Brilliant Thing at Belvoir Theatre, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Mulvany in Every Brilliant Thing at Belvoir theatre, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A one-woman show is one thing.

I saw it twice and was captivated by the storytelling craft of 16 actors in some 50 roles across four eras. Combining incendiary politics, humans fleeing for their lives, and questions of identity for second- and third-generation Australians whose parents and grandparents felt the force of war in Sri Lanka, western Sydney writer S. Shakthidharan was inspired by the unanswered questions in his family diaspora. Director Eamon Flack took this show of ambitious scale to Sydney town hall and later Adelaide showgrounds, and then to seven Helpmann awards, including best new Australian work, best production and best direction. Steve Dow Anthem, by Andrew Bovell, Patricia Cornelius, Melissa Reeves, Christos Tsiolkas and Irine Vela Melbourne International Arts festival at Arts Centre Melbourne, with Sydney festival and Perth festival (forthcoming) A particular joy of Anthem, set in Melbourne\u2019s trains and stations, is found in knowing the work of the writers: Christos Tsiolkas\u2019s families, Patricia Cornelius\u2019s violence, Andrew Bovell\u2019s choruses, Melissa Reeves\u2019s satire. Their voices are distinct, yet come together in rich concert. Anthem occasionally falters, but it is an ambitious portrait of working-class Australia too rarely staged. Tying it all together is Irine Vela\u2019s composition for strings. As I left, a busker played the cello outside. It was a beautiful clash between the stage and the street, following me to the platform and on to the train home, shifting the way I carried myself in the world \u2013 the way all good theatre does. Jane Howard Prima Facie, by Suzie Miller Griffin Theatre Company, at SBW Stables theatre, Sydney, and Canberra theatre centre, Canberra A razor-sharp, urgent look at Australia\u2019s broken sexual assault laws, Suzie Miller\u2019s Prima Facie powerfully drove home the flaws of a legal process that often fails to treat victims with fairness or humanity. This new Australian work, presented as a one-woman show, felt intricate and informed \u2013 particularly due to ex-lawyer and playwright Suzie Miller\u2019s deeply rooted understanding of the system\u2019s pitfalls and the patriarchal pillars that still uphold the legal definition of \u201cjustice\u201d. Sheridan Harbridge delivered a hard-hitting performance as the snappy criminal defence attorney who knows the ins and outs of the system yet becomes entrapped, and eventually traumatised, within it. The play is both quick-fire entertaining and emotionally devastating, and altogether difficult to forget. Debbie Zhou Gender Euphoria, by Maude Davey and Mama Alto Midsumma, Melbourne International Arts festival and Arts Centre Melbourne, at The Famous Spiegeltent, Melbourne A project of love and an expression of community from performer and director Maude Davey and Melbourne singer and impresario, the legendary Mama Alto, the cabaret Gender Euphoria at the Spiegeltent for Melbourne festival (following a sold-out, one-night-only performance at Midsumma earlier this year) was less a mere show than a loud embrace of the messy instinct to love and be loved that makes us all so very human. Under Mama Alto\u2019s gentle wing, an impressive cast of trans and gender-diverse performers alternatively sang like angels, danced like demons and told stories of their lives that brought the crowd to fits of laughter or audible tears; a joke about dildos in bumbags, memorably, to both. An authentic joy. Van Badham Fangirls, by Yve Blake Brisbane festival, Queensland Theatre and Belvoir, at Bille Browne theatre, Brisbane, and Belvoir St theatre, Sydney Remember your first crush? Chances are, they were a pop star. Anyone that has ever been a teenager (particularly a teenage girl) will relate to this delightful and fun musical, produced this year as part of the Brisbane festival, before a later season at Belvoir in Sydney. The very rowdy and loud musical follows 14-year-old Edna who is in love with Harry, a singer in True Connection, the biggest boyband in the world. Will she get the money to go to the concert? And will her plan to meet Harry work? It\u2019s high stakes if you\u2019re a teenager in love. For the rest of us, it\u2019s a lot of fun. Brigid Delaney Solaris, by David Greig, adapted from Stanis\u0142aw Lem\u2019s novel Commissioned and staged by Malthouse Theatre, The Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, and the Lyric, Hammersmith David Greig\u2019s adaptation of Stanis\u0142aw Lem\u2019s infamously oblique sci-fi novel, Solaris, was a study in directorial restraint; appropriately for a story of the human disorientation that results from unexpressed pain. Directed with cold precision by Matthew Lutton at Malthouse, Solaris spins Lem\u2019s crew of isolated cosmonauts into the dangerous orbit of a planet that resurrects from their memories the ghosts of their beloved dead. Sharp performances and clinical design evoked Grieg\u2019s sparse and clever metaphors; both imprinted in the mind a tangible visual of the mysterious planet, despite it never once appearing on stage. Van Badham Every Brilliant Thing, by Duncan Macmillan with Jonny Donahoe Belvoir, at Belvoir St theatre and Riverside theatre in Parramatta, and another season to come (with Steve Rodgers) in 2020 at Belvoir A one-woman show is one thing. A one-woman show starring the lightning bolt of brilliance and braveness that is Kate Mulvany is another. Her mother doesn\u2019t want to live, so Mulvany\u2019s character, as a child, decides to solve the problem. She begins \u2013 and, as it turns out, never stops \u2013 making a list of every brilliant thing that makes life worth living. Ice cream. The colour yellow. Things with stripes. People falling over. Audience members are cast as characters and the lights stay up. Many are teary by the end; a few are sobbing. Because it is so sad and honest yet full of hope journeyed towards together, it feels more like group therapy than theatre. You leave changed. Kate Hennessy",

      "body": "<p>Business confidence in the British economy has leaped to its highest level for more than three years following the Conservatives\u2019 election win, according to a survey of company directors.</p> <p>For the first time since spring 2018, firms have become optimistic about the economic outlook, with a key confidence measure swinging into positive territory and hitting 21% in December, up from -18% in November.</p> <p>That is the highest figure since the 2016 EU referendum, according to the Institute of Directors (IoD), which polled members in the days following the election. It added that Boris Johnson\u2019s new majority government meant company directors, whatever their personal views, now had a framework around which they could put in place plans to invest, hire staff and expand.</p> <p>The IoD\u2019s main confidence measure \u2013 which is the net balance of those firms that are optimistic minus those that are pessimistic \u2013 had been negative for more than 18 months.</p> <p>But the organisation warned that the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s long-term relationship with Europe remained a cause for concern, adding: \u201cOur members\u2019 confidence has proven sensitive to Brexit developments over the past few years, and this is likely to continue during negotiations in the year ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Directors at larger businesses tended to be more optimistic about prospects for the economy over the next 12 months.

      "bodyText": "Business confidence in the British economy has leaped to its highest level for more than three years following the Conservatives\u2019 election win, according to a survey of company directors. For the first time since spring 2018, firms have become optimistic about the economic outlook, with a key confidence measure swinging into positive territory and hitting 21% in December, up from -18% in November. That is the highest figure since the 2016 EU referendum, according to the Institute of Directors (IoD), which polled members in the days following the election. It added that Boris Johnson\u2019s new majority government meant company directors, whatever their personal views, now had a framework around which they could put in place plans to invest, hire staff and expand. The IoD\u2019s main confidence measure \u2013 which is the net balance of those firms that are optimistic minus those that are pessimistic \u2013 had been negative for more than 18 months. But the organisation warned that the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s long-term relationship with Europe remained a cause for concern, adding: \u201cOur members\u2019 confidence has proven sensitive to Brexit developments over the past few years, and this is likely to continue during negotiations in the year ahead.\u201d Directors at larger businesses tended to be more optimistic about prospects for the economy over the next 12 months. The data showed that company directors have also become more upbeat about their own firm\u2019s prospects, with this figure increasing to 46% from 26% a month earlier. This pick-up in confidence was accompanied by a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in firms\u2019 investment intentions for 2020. A net balance of 18% expected their investment levels to increase, though the bulk of those quizzed also expected to be hit with higher costs over the next 12 months. The directors\u2019 body said this indicated that the new government \u201chas its work cut out\u201d to support the labour market and cut firms\u2019 mounting bills. The current state of the economy was named the top challenge, followed by continued uncertainty around the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the IoD, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s directors will be entering 2020 with a little more festive cheer than might have been expected only a few weeks ago.\u201d He added that the government\u2019s agenda as outlined so far included some welcome proposals, such as plans to increase and broaden research and development tax credits. He also highlighted proposals outlined in the Queen\u2019s speech on 19 December to reform business rates. Some firms should have their business rates halved with the government committing to increase the so-called business rate \u201cretail discount\u201d from one-third to 50%, extending it to cinemas and music venues, and introducing an additional discount for pubs. The government also claimed in the Queen\u2019s speech that the reforms and reliefs announced since 2016 would reduce the burden of business rates by more than \u00a313bn over the next five years. The IoD findings are based on a poll of 952 company directors carried out between 13 December and 20 December.",
