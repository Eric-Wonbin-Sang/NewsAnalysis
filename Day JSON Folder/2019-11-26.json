      "bodyText": "Mourinho on what this win means: \u201cWe have qualified for the next round, that is the important thing for all of us at the club and the fans,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was hard, they are a good team, very well organised and they attacked our self esteem and self confidence. It was a tough time, more than the changes or the tactical talk, I told them to keep calm, keep confident and believe in ourselves.\u201d He also goes on to praise the ballboy who played a decisive role in Harry Kane\u2019s first goal, saying that he loves ballboys who can read the game properly. \u201cI was a brilliant ballboy,\u201d he says. Never change, Jose. Jose Mourinho speaks: \u201cThe first thing I want to say is to do publicly say what I did in the dressing-room,\u201d he tells Des Kelly. \u201cI want to apologise to Eric Dier. I did it [substituted him for Christian Eriksen after 29 minutes] for the team ... it was not for Eric Dier playing badly. I did it for the team. I needed a second man with Dele Alli to come into the pockets and into the spaces.I have apologised to him and he understands that.\u201d He goes on to say that he could have taken Winks off instead and even thought about moving Dier back into the heart of defence and taken off Sanchez or Alderweireld. Harry Kane breaks a record: Harry Kane has beaten a record previously held by Alessandro del Piero to become the quickest player to score 20 Champions League goals. It seems quite a random milestone, but BT Sport are making a big deal out of it. \u201cNot a bad player to beat,\u201d says Harry to Des Kelly, before returning to his Big Book Of Banal Post Match Platitudes. \u201cIt was about qualifying, no matter how we did it but we had to win and we did that. We can enjoy it and try and deep the momentum for Saturday.\u201d David Hytner was at White Hart Lane to see Jose Mourinho\u2019s first home debut and here\u2019s how he saw an entertaining game unfold. Harry Kane speaks: \u201cIt was a disappointing start,\u201d says Harry Kane to BT Sport. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out with any energy , they scored twice and we were into an uphill battle. Dele done well to get that goal just before half-time and then we had the momentum.\u201d Asked about Jose Mourinho\u2019s half-time address, he says the dressing-room was calm. \u201cHe said we needed to be calm,\u201d he says. \u201cCalmer on the ball, we didn\u2019t have to rush it. We went out there with a bit more freedom and that helped.\u201d Asked about Jose\u2019s decision to replace Eric Dier so early in the game, Dele Alli looks a little uncomfortable. \u201cHe could have taken off any of us, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cI was sure it was going to be me because I thought I was dreadful in the first 20 minutes.\u201d Elsewhere in Group B: Bayern Munich have beaten Red Star 6-0 and remain top of Group B. And in the BT Sport studio: Peter Crouch has been put out of his misery and removed from the punditry panel, as he was too hoarse to speak in anything more coherent than a high-pitched croak. It\u2019s a shame really, as it was very entertaining watching him suffer. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! Tottenham advance to the knockout stages of the Champions League with a game to spare. They won quite comfortably in the end, but made life difficult for themselves in the first half. Two down moments before the half-time whistle, Dele Alli capitalised on a blunder by Yassine Meriah to pull a goal back, before Harry Kane scored either side of Serge Aurier\u2019s fine strike to earn Tottenham their spot in the last 16. 90+2 min: The players of Olympiakos have made a massive contribution to a very entertaining game tonight, but they have finally accepted their fate. They won\u2019t be going to the knockout stages, but can still qualify for the Europa League with a win over Red Star in their next game. 90 min: The game enters the final minute of normal time and the shock felt by Tottenham fans in the first half has been replaced by jubilation. Elsewhewre in Group B, Bayern lead Red Star 5-0 in the closing stages of their game. Robert Lewandowski has scored four of their goals and missed a penalty, I\u2019m told. 87 min: Valbuena gets in behind Aurier down the left flank and wins a corner. His ball into the penalty area is a little too high for Semedo to get his head on. 85 min: Olympiakos substitution: Miguel Guerrero on for Youssef El Arabi, who scored the first goal of the game. 82 min: Spurs substitution: Dele Alli goes off and enjoys a long walk around the pitch back to the bench with the crowd rising to applaud him. Tanguy Ndombele takes his place. 79 min: Some housekeeping as your humble reporter struggles to keep up: Daniel Podence was booked for that foul on Ali, who seems to have run off what looked a very painful injury. Podence has also been replaced by Lazar Randjelovic. Andreas Bouchalakis has also made way for Mathieu Valbuena. And finally, Bayern are hockeying Red Star 5-0 elsewhere in this group, which means both they and Tottenham are going through to the knockout stages. Now you know everything ... Harry Kane record-breaker! Spurs win a free-kick wide on the left for a Podence foul on Dele Alli that left the Spurs man in a lot of pain. Christian Eriksen sends in the cross and it\u2019s a beauty. Kane heads home to become the quickest player in history to score 20 Champions League goals. 75 min: That was a sweet, sweet strike by Aurier, which you should try to get a look at it if you can. Alli danced and jinked his way through a thicket of bodies on the left side of the Olympiakos penalty area, before picking out Aurier with a cross. A perfectly timed strike from the Frenchman left Jose Sa with no chance. That stayed hit! Tottenham lead! Serge Aurier scores with a wonderful strike on the half-volley from one corner of the six-yard box after excellent work by Dele Alli. 71 min: Spurs continue to turn the screw and Olympiakos left-back Kostas Tsimikas is booked as he mistimes a tackle on Serge Aurier, who is sent tumbling off the pitch. He lands just in front of the technical area occupied by Jose Mourinho. 70 min: Eriksen takes the free -kick, leathering the ball as hard as he can towards the top corner. His rasper fizzes wide, but not by much. 68 min: Straight in front of goal, inches outside the Olympiakos penalty area, Tottenham win a free-kick after Andreas Bouchalakis brings down Dele Alli and is booked for his cynicism. 67 min: Harry Kane picks up a pass from Dele Alli and pulls the trigger in the Olympiakos penalty area. Meriah blocks well. 67 min: First Son and then Sissoko send low crosses into the Olympiakos penalty area, trying to pick out Kane. Meriah intercepts the first cross, Semedo the second. Elsewhere in Group B: Bayern Munich are 3-0 up against Red Star. Barring a very unlikely comeback, a draw will see Spurs through to the knockout stages. 63 min: Harry Winks is penalised for climbing all over Mohamed Camara while leaping to contest a header. It seems another harsh decision - the Olympiakos midfielder was backing into him and Winks had eyes only for the ball. 62 min: Alderweireld is booked for a fairly innocuous \u201cchallenge\u201d on El Arabi, who made a great show of going to ground after being caught by the defender\u2019s arm. 60 min: Tottenham substitution: Moussa Sissoko on for Lucas Moura. He\u2019s been one of Tottenham\u2019s better players tonight, particularly in the last 15 minutes. 59 min: Masouras takes the corner, arrowing the ball towards the far post. Gazzaniga comes to claim, but doesn\u2019t catch it cleanly. It doesn\u2019t matter, he was impeded and is awarded a free-kick. 57 min: Having been so poor in the first half, Tottenham have the momentum now but Olympiakos heads don\u2019t seem to have dropped. Daniel Podence sends a cross into the penalty area from the right, but Alderweireld hacks clear. Olympiakos continue to apply the pressure, forcing Serge Aurier to concede a corner. 55 min: Ha-ha! Replays show that straight after Harry Kane scored that equaliser, Jose Mourinho celebrated by marching down the touchline to high five and hug the ball-boy who was so fast to get a ball into the hands of Serge Aurier for the throw-in that was instrumental in leading to the goal. 52 min: Kane spanked that equaliser in from the edge of the six-yard box, getting on the end of an inch-perfect cross from Lucas Moura. Olympiakos were caught napping as Serge Aurier took a quick throw-in and spotted Moura\u2019s run into space down the right. Moments before Tottenham scored, Olympiakos almost went 3-1 up, Masouras unable to get a toe to an excellent delivery into their penalty area. Tottenham equalise. Tottenham take a thrown in and Lucas Moura runs into space down the right flank after a quick-witted ball-boy ensures the ball goes back into play as quickly as possible. He sends in a cross for Harry Kane, who makes no mistake. 48 min: Kostas Tsimikas ploughs through Lucas Moura, giving Tottenham a free-kick in line with the left side of the penalty area. Eriksen whips the ball into the penalty area, where it\u2019s on a plate for Davinson Sanchez. He fails to get his head to the ball, shouldering it over the bar instead. That\u2019s a bad miss. 47 min: Jose Sa claims a Christian Eriksen cross towards the far post confidently, with Harry Kane and Dele Alli lurking with intent nearby. 46 min: Play resumes with Tottenham getting the ball rolling. Elsewhere in this group, Bayern Munich are beating Red Star 1-0 at half-time, so a draw will do Tottenham tonight as things stand. Some half-time reading: Club Brugge scored a 92nd minute equaliser but then had two men sent off for their celebrations against Galatasaray. Read on ... Peep! Tottenham go in for the break trailing by the odd goal of three. They\u2019ve been poor tonight, going two behind to goals from Youssef El Arabi and RUben Semedo. A giant stroke of luck just before half-time has enabled them to halve that deficit, however ... Del Alli taking advantage of a monumental howler from Meriah, who took his eye off the ball in a most literal sense. Olympiakos gift Spurs a goal. An Aurier cross comes into their penalty area from the right and Yassine Meriah takes a big swing at it and misses completely. Standing behind the defender, Dele Alli is in the right place at the right time and taps in from a couple of yards out. 42 min: Son tries an ambitious shot from distance, trying to curl the ball into the top bin from the inside left after Olympiakos goalkeeper Jose Sa had given the ball away with a wayward pass. It\u2019s high, it\u2019s wide and Spurs remain two goals behind. 40 min: Harry Kane takes the free-kick, whipping it up and down over the wall. He doesn\u2019t whip it quite hard enough, however, and it skims off the roof of the net. Considering Tottenham won the free-kick for a perfectly clean Semedo tackle on Son that earned the defender a booking, that seems fair enough. 40 min: A Free-kick for Spurs in a good position about 30 yards from the Olympiakos goal, almost dead centre. 39 min: Dele Alli sends a high, looping cross towards the far post from the left wing, which Olympiakos goalkeeper Jose Sa claims easily. That\u2019s a poor effort from Alli, who should have put some pace on the ball. 36 min: A case in point: Son tries to cut in from the left wing but is immediately crowded off the ball by two opponents. One of them is Guillherme, who clears the ball downfield. The same thing is happening on the other flank, whenever Lucas Moura gets on the ball. 35 min: Olympiakos look like they have 14 or 15 men on the pitch, so quick are they to crowd around any Tottenham player who receives a pass in or around their penalty area. They played well when the sides drew in Athens and they\u2019re even more impressive tonight. 32 min: Olympiakos centre-back Yassine Mehriah tries his luck with a low drive from a long way out and it\u2019s heart-sin-mouths time for Spurs fans as the ball fizzes narrowly wide of the left upright. Tottenham\u2019s are looking very shaky tonight, all over the pitch. Their defence is wobbly, their midfield can\u2019t keep possession, Dele Alli is being marked out of the game and the collective touch of the front three seems to have deserted them, although they haven\u2019t seen a great deal of the ball. 29 min: Tottenham substitution: Eriksen replaces Dier, who gets an embrace from Mourinho as he leaves the field. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fuming,\u201d says Jermaine Jenas on BT Sport co-comms duty. \u201cTaken off after 28 minutes? He\u2019ll be fuming.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look particularly upset. 28 min: Christian Eriksen is about to come on for Tottenham and I think it\u2019s Eric Dier who\u2019ll be coming off. He hasn\u2019t been significantly worse than any of his team-mates, but Tottenham are giving away a lot of possession in midfield. 26 min: Semedo limps off the pitch at the closest point of exit, near the Tottenham goal, helped on his way by a shove from Gazzaniga. His limp disappears as he jogs around the corner flag and down the touchline, waiting for the referee\u2019s permission to come back on. The crowd boo his return in the strongest possible terms. 24 min: Gazzaniga is caught in no-man\u2019s land as he comes to gather a free-kick in a crowded penalty area. Eric Dier is forced to boot the ball clear and play continues as Ruben Semedo, the goalscorer, is lying prone near the Spurs goal line after being clattered in mid-air by the Tottenham goalkeeper. 23 min: Harry Kane sends a shot fizzing wide of the Olympiakos goal after latching on to a through ball from Lucas Moura. The flag goes up - it wouldn\u2019t have counted even if he\u2019d had his cross-hairs aligned. 21 min: Tanguy Ndombele and Christian Eriksen are sent to warm up after 20 minutes, as Jose ponders his next move. The corner was sent towards the near post, where Winks somehow managed to scuff it across the face of his own goal. With Tottenham\u2019s players looking pretty helpless, Semedo was quickest to react and fired home from a yard or two out. Olympiakos double their lead. The Greek side score from a corner, taking advantage of more diabolical defending from Tottenham. Ruben Semedo pokes home from about two yards out, getting on the end of a near post flick-on from the dead ball. 18 min: With Olympiakos attacking on the break, Davinson Sanchez does brilliantly to get back and intercept a Daniel Podence shot on goal when the speedy winger looked like he\u2019d given the central defender the slip and had only Gazzaniga to beat. 16 min: Davinson Sanchez sends a cross into the Olympiakos penalty area, aiming for Harry Kane. The striker\u2019s first touch is a poor one and Ruben Semedo dispossesses him and clears. 13 min: A foul on Danny Rose means Spurs have a free-kick in the are between the left side of the Olympiakos penalty area and the touchline. The ball\u2019s whipped into the penalty area by Harry Winks, Son gets a flick and Jose Sa gets down well to tip the ball around his upright for a corner. Nothing comes of it, although Sa does have a bit of a flap while clearing a second ball into his area. 12 min: Son picks up the ball on the left touchline and cuts inside. He beats two players on a penetrating run into the penalty area, but a heavy touch lets him down before he can cross or shoot and the ball runs through to Olympiakos goalkeeper Jose Sa. 10 min: Serge Aurier wins a free-kick deep in Olympiakos territory and chucks the ball to Lucas Moura. He attempts to cut inside, but runs down a blind alley and is dispossessed. That\u2019s been the story of Tottenham\u2019s night thus far, but it\u2019s early days yet. 7 min: Olympiakos go ahead and it\u2019s no more than they deserve, but Jose Mourinho will be disappointed that none of his defenders saw fit to close down the goalscorer. El Arabi picked up the ball on the inside right, cut unopposed across the edge of the penalty area and unleashed a fierce left-footed shot. It was low and into the corner, dipping on its way past the outstretched arm of Gazzaniga. The visitors are ahead! Olympiakos take the lead courtesy of a dipping drive from Youssef El Arabi from the edge of the penalty area into the bottom left-hand corner. 4 min: Olympiakos have the first shot in anger, with Giorgos Masouras picking up a cross-field pass to the left, cutting inside and unleashing a shot from the edge of the penalty area. It stings the palms of Gazzaniga, but doesn\u2019t trouble the goalkeeper unduly. 3 min: For Olympiakos, Daniel Podense goes on a scuttling run towards the edge of the Spurs penalty area, before picking the wrong pass and letting the ball run through to Paulo Gazzaniga. The right winger was a real menace in the corresponding fixture in Athens and gave Ben Davies a very torrid time. 2 min: There appears to be a huge contingent of Olympiakos fans in the house, and they are making their presence felt from their place in one corner of the stadium. On the field, their team is dominating possession in these very early stages. 1 min: Olympiakos kick off, their players wearing blue shirts, blue shorts with white trim and blue socks. Tottenham\u2019s wear white shirts, shorts and socks. Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel and are led out by skippers Harry Kane and Omar Elabdellaoul respectively. It is a mild and dry night in north London, where a phalanx of photographers has congregated in front of the home dug-out to get pictures of Tottenham\u2019s manager as he takes his seat init for the first time. Elsewhere on BT Sport: Peter Crouch is a pundit on the studio panel, but barely able to speak as he is really, really hoarse. It is very funny. I suspect some runner will be given the task of funnelling honey and lemon down his throat for the first half, as he\u2019s seriously struggling. Jose Mourinho speaks: \u201cI expect an amazing reception for the team, which is the only thing that matters tonight,\u201d he says to BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly, upon being asked what kind of welcome he is expecting on his home debut. \u201cThe team, the performance and the result.\u201d On his team selection: \u201cWe thought that we should give that little bit of stability to the team,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that two days of recovery when you win is enough for you to be ready to play. On the inclusion of Danny Rose: \u201cRose is a different player to Davies, but he has been training with us from the first minute we came and knows his role.\u201d An email: \u201cNot sure if anyone\u2019s aware of this early 70s psych-folk classic by the Watersons,\u201d writes Matt Snow, introducing Danny Rose. Tottenham v Olympiakos line-ups Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Gazzaniga, Aurier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose, Dier, Winks, Lucas, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Austin, Vertonghen, Sessegnon, Sissoko, Ndombele, Eriksen, Lo Celso. Olympiakos (4-3-3): Sa, Elabdellaoui, Semedo, Meriah, Tsimikas, Camara, Guilherme, Bouchalakis, Podence, El Arabi, Masouras. Subs: Allain, Benzia, Guerrero, Valbuena, Papadopoulos, Torosidis, Randjelovic. Just the one change for Tottenham: Danny Rose comes in for the injured Ben Davies at left-back, Otherwise Jose Mourinho has picked the same team that started against West Ham on Saturday. There had been talk that Tanguy Ndombele might come in to midfield in place of Harry Winks, but the England international keeps his place. Tonight\u2019s referee Bulgarian match official Georgi Kabakov is on coin-toss duty tonight. From Plovdiv, he was also in charge of Jose Mourinho\u2019s most recent Champions League game, the aforementioned Manchester United defeat at the hands of Valencia. Fun fact: Jose Mourinho will be the fifth different manager that Olympiakos has gone up against in as many games in this season\u2019s Champions League matches. Changes in personnel at Bayern Munich and Tottenham mean Martins has already stood in the adjacent technical area to Mauricio Pochettino, Vladan Milojevic, Niko Kovac and Hansi Flick. Tonight, he gets to watch Jose gesticulating at close quarters. Jose Mourinho speaks \u201cI love the competition as much as everyone in football.,\u201d said Tottenham\u2019s new manager, before going on to demonstrate some of his new found humility. \u201cNot everyone has the privilege to be a Champions League winner but I have done it twice. I would love to win it for a third time but this is not the moment to speak about it \u2013 this is the moment to qualify.\u201d Asked about his team\u2019s chances of winning the tournament, he was typically bullish. \u201cWith these boys, I will never be afraid of any Champions League match,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to qualify, that\u2019s the focus. Only when my teams arrive in the quarter-finals, I start thinking we can win it. At this moment, we are far from it and have to qualify. Give me time to work, put my ideas to these boys and I\u2019ll go to any stadium to play against any big opponents in Europe or England and we won\u2019t be afraid of anyone.\u201d Pedro Martins speaks \u201cWe are here against a very good team but we have ambitions,\u201d said the Olympiakos manager, ahead of a game his team must win if they are to keep their faint hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages alive. \u201cWe have done it before. If four months ago someone had said to us we\u2019d be in the Champions League group stage and top of the Greek league, we\u2019d be happy.\u201d Early team news Ben Davies will be absent for Tottenham tonight after missing training yesterday with an ankle injury and could be replaced by Danny Rose. Erik Lamela remains sidelined with a thigh injury, while Jan Vertonghen is back in training but not expected to start. Davinson Sanchez and Toby Alderweireld should start in the heart of the defence, while Tanguy Ndombele is also back in training after recovering from injury and could start in midfield at the expense of Harry Winks or Eric Dier. For Olympiakos, midfielder Konstantinos Fortounis remains sidelined with an ACL injury he suffered back in July, while central defender Pape Abou Cisse is also a major doubt. Under new management, Spurs go into tonight\u2019s match against their Greek visitors knowing a win will guarantee their advancement to the knockout stages of the Champions League. A draw will be enough too, but only if Red Star fail to beat Bayern Munich in Belgrade. One game into his reign at Tottenham, Jose Mourinho\u2019s last involvement in the Champions League was as manager of a Manchester United side that lost 2-1 against Valencia last December. While United had already qualified for the knockout stages before kick-off in that particular defeat, he will certainly be hoping for a better performance from his new team on his first appearance in the home dug-out at White Hart Lane tonight. Kick-off is at 8pm, but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

We got there by the Fair Play competition. It was a very big achievement for us. I know where I was when our sporting director telephoned me. I was on holiday. He called me and he said: \u2018We play Europe.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt caused a lot of problems because it started so early. We had no pre-season and lost the first five Bundesliga games. It was like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/30/burnley-olympiakos-europa-league-play-off-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">the Burnley situation last year</a>. We suffered from it but we stayed in the league and all was good.</p> <p>\u201cIn Armenia we arrived there and it was really warm. It was 40 degrees. Then we went to Iceland to play Keflav\u00edk. We played in Reykjavik. In the summer, it was minus something because the wind was so strong. I remember Sevilla. It is the stadium I hate most to play at and it started there. We got a draw, we deserved the draw but the atmosphere was completely new. Everybody hated us and I was like: \u2018Why, what did we do?\u2019 That was very special.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have these experiences and you learn from them. It opens your mind. It was a very important part of development for me as a manager and for the specific teams always as well. It seems longer than 14 years ago. We have come a long way. It was just exciting \u2013 it still is exciting and I love it. It didn\u2019t change.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool are unbeaten in 24 European home games and have won their past 17 matches at Anfield in all competitions, if penalty shootouts are included. That is two games short of the club record set in 1972.

Napoli can also qualify with a win \u2013 both teams will go through if RB Salzburg fail to beat Genk \u2013 and given Liverpool\u2019s December schedule it would be a bonus for Klopp to get the job done before next month\u2019s trip to Austria.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately I\u2019m not too good at thinking about games we have next week or in two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe team selection is about winning this game and nothing else. What we have to be against Napoli for sure is as tuned as possible because they have such fixed patterns in their game that you need to have your own patterns as well.</p> <p>\u201cAgainst us they adapted really well always. We pressed them in a specific way and they reacted in the game and found another way to go through, especially in the home games. Our home game last year was an outstanding game. The pressure was massive and if Sadio [Man\u00e9] scored three or four that night nobody would have thought it was not possible. We had really big chances for that and played outstanding but in the end Ali [Alisson] had to save us. It is different if you play there or here but we have to make sure they feel the difference as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/21/liverpool-anfield-road-stand-open-meetings\">Liverpool to hold open meetings on new Anfield Road stand proposals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Napoli arrive under a cloud, with Ancelotti and the players banned from speaking to the media in Italy by the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, having rebelled against his idea of a training camp after their home draw against RB Salzburg.

We got there by the Fair Play competition. It was a very big achievement for us. I know where I was when our sporting director telephoned me. I was on holiday. He called me and he said: \u2018We play Europe.\u2019 \u201cIt caused a lot of problems because it started so early. We had no pre-season and lost the first five Bundesliga games. It was like the Burnley situation last year. We suffered from it but we stayed in the league and all was good. \u201cIn Armenia we arrived there and it was really warm. It was 40 degrees. Then we went to Iceland to play Keflav\u00edk. We played in Reykjavik. In the summer, it was minus something because the wind was so strong. I remember Sevilla. It is the stadium I hate most to play at and it started there. We got a draw, we deserved the draw but the atmosphere was completely new. Everybody hated us and I was like: \u2018Why, what did we do?\u2019 That was very special. \u201cSo you have these experiences and you learn from them. It opens your mind. It was a very important part of development for me as a manager and for the specific teams always as well. It seems longer than 14 years ago. We have come a long way. It was just exciting \u2013 it still is exciting and I love it. It didn\u2019t change.\u201d Liverpool are unbeaten in 24 European home games and have won their past 17 matches at Anfield in all competitions, if penalty shootouts are included. That is two games short of the club record set in 1972. Napoli are the only team to have prevented Klopp\u2019s side from scoring in the past 25 matches although the Italian club have not won in nine visits to England and carry painful memories of last year\u2019s elimination from the Champions League on Merseyside. Napoli can also qualify with a win \u2013 both teams will go through if RB Salzburg fail to beat Genk \u2013 and given Liverpool\u2019s December schedule it would be a bonus for Klopp to get the job done before next month\u2019s trip to Austria. \u201cUnfortunately I\u2019m not too good at thinking about games we have next week or in two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe team selection is about winning this game and nothing else. What we have to be against Napoli for sure is as tuned as possible because they have such fixed patterns in their game that you need to have your own patterns as well. \u201cAgainst us they adapted really well always. We pressed them in a specific way and they reacted in the game and found another way to go through, especially in the home games. Our home game last year was an outstanding game. The pressure was massive and if Sadio [Man\u00e9] scored three or four that night nobody would have thought it was not possible. We had really big chances for that and played outstanding but in the end Ali [Alisson] had to save us. It is different if you play there or here but we have to make sure they feel the difference as well.\u201d Napoli arrive under a cloud, with Ancelotti and the players banned from speaking to the media in Italy by the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, having rebelled against his idea of a training camp after their home draw against RB Salzburg. De Laurentiis has fined his players too, but Klopp believes Napoli will view Anfield as an escape from the controversy. \u201cI met Carlo in Geneva on the Monday after the Manchester City game and we had a little chat about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me a lot, I didn\u2019t ask a lot, but everybody can read what is in the newspaper. Carlo was in really good shape. They will try everything. It must feel like a relief for them to play a big game away and not be faced with all the other things. We expect them to be absolutely at their best.\u201d",

In 1975, Reg Livermore brought his one-man show, Betty Blokk-Buster Follies, to the stage, titillating audiences with his gender-flexing cabaret performance. The production - and its leading man - quickly became the stuff of legend.</p> <p>Livermore\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/events/betty-blokk-buster-reimagined\" rel=\"nofollow\">show will be rebooted for the 21st century at Sydney Festival</a>, this time starring the multi-talented Josh Quong Tart, at the <a href=\"https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/venues/magic-mirrors-spiegeltent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Mirrors Spiegeltent</a>. Enoch describes it as an \u201cextraordinary, out-there\u201d piece of theatre.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic story of Sydney and this iconic artist who had a massive impact on the cabaret scene,\u201d Enich says. \u201cEven now, in his 80s, Reg has this incredible energy and real grace. It\u2019s beautiful. You can see that he sparks people\u2019s imagination.\u201d</p> <h2>Romances Inciertos, un Autre Orlando</h2> <p>One of the exclusive international works showing at the festival blends dance, music and theatre. <a href=\"https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/events/romances-inciertos\" rel=\"nofollow\">Romances Inciertos, un Autre Orlando</a> is inspired by Virginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando, the story of a gender-fluid Elizabethan courtier who lives for more than 300 years. It\u2019s brought to life in a three-act opera-ballet by French artist Fran\u00e7ois Chaignaud, who plays three different 16th- and 17th-century women.</p> <p>\u201cChaignaud is extraordinary,\u201d Enoch says. \u201cIn many ways it\u2019s like baroque drag. We think of drag as being very modern but it goes way back into the Shakespearean era. [In the production] there\u2019s this notion of identity and its fluidity. It\u2019s beautifully done. His performances as a dancer and a performer \u2026 it\u2019s absolutely virtuosic. He\u2019s a gem.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7170039b7699bd501ca4dd968beb0a1576c0562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7170039b7699bd501ca4dd968beb0a1576c0562/0_0_8280_6208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Ties reimagines the popular wedding rom-com from a distinctively First Nations perspective.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Ties reimagines the popular wedding rom-com from a distinctively First Nations perspective.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sydney Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Black Ties reimagines the popular wedding rom-com from a distinctively First Nations perspective.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Black Ties</h2> <p>The jewel in the crown of this year\u2019s huge First Nations program is <a href=\"https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/events/black-ties\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLACK TIES</a>, a joint production between Australia\u2019s ILBIJERRI Theatre Company and New Zealand\u2019s Te R\u0113hia Theatre. With laugh-out-loud humour, the play follows the wedding of a Maori woman to an Aboriginal man - and the union of their unruly families. It\u2019s one of this year\u2019s many original commissions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious,\u201d says Enoch, a Noonuccal Nuugi man. \u201cIn many ways, because it\u2019s our lived experience as First Nations people, we have permission to say things that non-Indigenous people can\u2019t. In the mouths of black people it can go into that territory safely and take the mickey out of it, which I love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"bd7348a5328d3b40634b8b32fb9db9ba15a10696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd7348a5328d3b40634b8b32fb9db9ba15a10696/0_1000_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dodecalis Luminarium.

      "bodyText": "Sydney Festival has been part of the Harbour City\u2019s summers for more than four decades and is still finding new ways to innovate. Of the 75 cultural events in next year\u2019s line-up, 46 are original commissions co-created with the festival, and 16 are world premieres. International artists will bring a range of Australian exclusives to the festival, while 2020\u2019s Indigenous program is its strongest yet. At the helm of it all is festival director Wesley Enoch, who knows better than anyone how much there will be to seek out when Sydney Festival returns in January. So where do you start? If you only have time for five events, he recommends these standouts. Betty\u2019s coterie of reinvented has-beens, battlers, freaks and survivors are waiting to wow a new generation. Chaignaud gives life to three luminous, romantic characters from Spanish drama, poetry and folklore. Betty Blokk-Buster Reimagined Enoch\u2019s first pick is a nod to an Australian cult classic. In 1975, Reg Livermore brought his one-man show, Betty Blokk-Buster Follies, to the stage, titillating audiences with his gender-flexing cabaret performance. The production - and its leading man - quickly became the stuff of legend. Livermore\u2019s show will be rebooted for the 21st century at Sydney Festival, this time starring the multi-talented Josh Quong Tart, at the Magic Mirrors Spiegeltent. Enoch describes it as an \u201cextraordinary, out-there\u201d piece of theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic story of Sydney and this iconic artist who had a massive impact on the cabaret scene,\u201d Enich says. \u201cEven now, in his 80s, Reg has this incredible energy and real grace. It\u2019s beautiful. You can see that he sparks people\u2019s imagination.\u201d Romances Inciertos, un Autre Orlando One of the exclusive international works showing at the festival blends dance, music and theatre. Romances Inciertos, un Autre Orlando is inspired by Virginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando, the story of a gender-fluid Elizabethan courtier who lives for more than 300 years. It\u2019s brought to life in a three-act opera-ballet by French artist Fran\u00e7ois Chaignaud, who plays three different 16th- and 17th-century women. \u201cChaignaud is extraordinary,\u201d Enoch says. \u201cIn many ways it\u2019s like baroque drag. We think of drag as being very modern but it goes way back into the Shakespearean era. [In the production] there\u2019s this notion of identity and its fluidity. It\u2019s beautifully done. His performances as a dancer and a performer \u2026 it\u2019s absolutely virtuosic. He\u2019s a gem.\u201d Black Ties reimagines the popular wedding rom-com from a distinctively First Nations perspective. Black Ties The jewel in the crown of this year\u2019s huge First Nations program is BLACK TIES, a joint production between Australia\u2019s ILBIJERRI Theatre Company and New Zealand\u2019s Te R\u0113hia Theatre. With laugh-out-loud humour, the play follows the wedding of a Maori woman to an Aboriginal man - and the union of their unruly families. It\u2019s one of this year\u2019s many original commissions. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious,\u201d says Enoch, a Noonuccal Nuugi man. \u201cIn many ways, because it\u2019s our lived experience as First Nations people, we have permission to say things that non-Indigenous people can\u2019t. In the mouths of black people it can go into that territory safely and take the mickey out of it, which I love.\u201d Architects of Air and Insite Arts create enormous air-filled domes and mazes inspired by natural forms, geometric solids, and Islamic and Gothic architecture. Absurd, romantic, and provocative, Forget Me Not is a tender call-to-arms and a rich theatrical love letter to our better selves in these increasingly uncivilised times. Dodecalis Luminarium The best looking part of this year\u2019s program? It\u2019s got to be the inflated labyrinth of Dodecalis Luminarium, an art installation set in Darling Harbour\u2019s Tumbalong Park. The whole family can explore (and Instagram) the winding tunnels, mazes and inflated domes of this technicolour interior, created by the artists at Architects of Air. \u201cYou get to roam around in this beautiful inflatable world, where all the natural light from outside creates this beautiful saturation of colour,\u201d Enoch says. \u201cIt really calms you and gives you this sense of deep relaxation.\u201d And yes: it\u2019s air-conditioned. Forget Me Not One of the more moving experiences on this year\u2019s program is Forget Me Not, a work by puppeteer Ronnie Burkett. Audiences become part of the show in these intimate performances, which play to only 100 people at a time. \u201cIt\u2019s such a small show, but it\u2019s something that really grabs my heart,\u201d Enoch says. \u201cHe\u2019s built a puppet for each audience member that you wear for the entire show, to witness the story unfolding. \u201cRonnie takes you on this journey of a story of a carnival love affair that ends tragically. He\u2019s created a world that\u2019s almost a conversation about Trump\u2019s America, but it\u2019s also about the kind of right-wing nationalism that\u2019s sweeping the world. A world where the truth is contestable; where words are outlawed. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, extreme sense of what track we\u2019re on, [and] how we, as a society, have to deal with it. But it\u2019s done in such a beautiful, playful way with these wonderful puppets. And it\u2019s such an intimate show. It\u2019ll be one of those little jewels.\u201d Explore the 2020 line-up and plan your festival now.",

Manchester City and Shakhtar Donetsk meet today with both hoping to secure their place in the Champions League knockout phase - but one club\u2019s hopes are a lot more realistic than the other\u2019s. City, you see, only need to avoid losing at home to the Ukrainians, whom they squashed 3-0 away earlier in this group. Shakhtar\u2019s reconnaissance missions don\u2019t offer them any more cause for optimism: they have been to the Etihad twice in the last two years and lost by a combined score of 8-0. But let\u2019s not dismiss them completely: they are, after all, a side who are accustomed to beating everyone ... on the domestic front, where they are runaway league leaders and have not lost for 44 matches. Still, it is really only for the same of completeness that we mention that Shakhtar will qualify for the next round if they win today and the group\u2019s other game ends in a victory for Atalanta over Dinamo Zagreb \u2013 and even if that happened, City would still go through, but not necessarily as group winners.</p> <p>If those permutations don\u2019t grab you, then perhaps you\u2019ll find intrigue in the lineups. Which personnel will Pep Guardiola send out? City have three Premier League games in eight days coming up, concluding with the Manchester derby, and it looks like Sergio Aguero will not be able to play in them, which means the importance of Gabriel Jesus has increased. Will the Brazilian and other key players be left out today? Or will Guardiola insist on fielding a full-strength team make sure the job gets done today and, perhaps, to help his men get back into a dominant groove after being jolted out of their stride before beating Chelsea last weekend? </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T17:59:17.866Z\">at 5.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And catch up on the rest of tonight\u2019s Champions League games \u2026 Gundogan: \u201cWe knew this game would be tough. Shakhtar also did a great job but we let them play and didn\u2019t defend as well as we normally do. And our buildup was a bit slow today so we struggled to create. Unfortunately it was not our best performance but this is a competition where you have to struggle and deal with it.\u201d Angelino: \u201cTough night. We didn\u2019t get the result we wanted but we\u2019re top of the group so we have to take the positive things.\u201d Man City confirm their place in the knockout stages with one game to spare. Shakhtar will join them there if they get a draw, at least, in their last group game, which is at home to Atalanta. So it\u2019s mission kind of accomplished by City but they\u2019ll be slightly irked by this performance, in which they lacked pep and precision and always looked vulnerable to counter-attacks. Players who did well? Fernandinho and Bernardo Silva. Pretty much everyone else was significantly below par, with Jesus and Sterling finding it particularly hard to get involved. 90+2 min: Shakhtar are trying to keep it down in the City half to preserve their point. City are irritated but no more than that. 90 min: Fernandinho booked for clattering into Tete. That rules him out of City\u2019s pointless last group game. He\u2019ll be devastated about that. Shakhtar substitution: Sikan on, Moraes off. 88 min: Otamendi sends the ball towards the stars from 25 yards. 86 min: Angelino dabs a cross into the box from the left. A token gesture, really, and easy pickings for the keeper. City have been short of precision and speed today. 84 min: Shakhtar are happy with the point, which they are protecting with metaphorical barricades. 82 min: After prolonged probing by City, Foden arrows a pass from deep towards Bernardo Silva, but a defender does well to outjump the Portuguese and head into his keeper\u2019s arms. Shakhtar substitution: Antonio on, Kovalenko off. 78 min: In case you\u2019re thinking of abandoning this now, know that Shakhtar scored in stoppage time in their previous two away matches in this group... Man City substitution: Foden on, Rodri off. That should increase the inventiveness quotient. 75 min: Rodri to David Silva to Bernardo Silva - a fast and fluid City move the like of which they haven\u2019t produced very much today. The Portuguese Silva\u2019s cross is clasped by the keeper. 73 min: Rodri pows a low shot into the keeper\u2019s arm from 20 yards. Foden gets the signal to warm-up. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s introduced to Rodri. 71 min: Jesus bears the keeper to a dinked pass over the top. From a difficult angle the striker plays it back to the recently arrived David Silva, who spoons it goalward from eight yards. Kryvtsov nearly helps it over the line with his first touch but rescues himself by sliding it clear with his second! Man City substitution: D Silva on, De Bruyne off. Just when they seemed to be fading, Shakhtar hit back with a superb counter-attack! They played their way forward brilliantly before Tete slipped a pass to the overlapping Dodo, who cut it back from the byline for Solomon, who rammed a low shot into the net from 10 yards! 69 min: Another bad pass by Rodri, under no pressure. He\u2019s been slack today. 67 min: De Bruyne drops a corner into the six-yard box. Fernandinho nods wide. Shakhtar substitution: Solomon on, Konoplyanka off. 65 min: City have Shakhtar where they want them now. The visitors are scared to open up too much in search of the an equaliser because they know that\u2019s exactly what City want them to do. 63 min: Cancelo shapes to shoot with his right foot from 25 yards, then chops back on to his left and drills in a low one. Pyatov gets down to save. 61 min: Sterling cuts on to his right foot and tries to arc a curler into the top corner from the edge of the box. Cute idea, flawed execution. 60 min: Sterling gets back to deflect a cross by Tete out for a corner. Konoplyanka drives it too far over the other side of the box. De Bruyne receives the ball on the half-turn between Shakhtar\u2019s midfield and defence. He pings a low pass into Jesus near the penalty spot. The striker does well to roll his way between two defenders and then get a toe to the ball as the keeper tries to pounce, poking it to Gundgoan, who finishes smartly from 10 yards. City have the breakthrough at last. 56 min: Skakhtar dink a quick freekick towards Moraes, who\u2019s denied by a superb tackle by Fernandinho five yards from goal! 54 min: Fernandinho is stepping up more frequently. Good. He\u2019s a more creative passer than Rodri. Overall, though, there\u2019s still not enough zip in City\u2019s play. 52 min: Tete, only 19, looks like he could become another shrewd Brazilian signing by Shakhtar. He\u2019s fast and dangerous down the right, but still a little gauche in his finishing on this evidence. Obvious potential, though, and someone City need to keep an eye on here. 49 min: Atalanta have gone 2-0 up on Dinamo Zagreb in this group\u2019s other match, which is good news for both of these sides. It could mean that even if City lose here, they will qualify. 48 min: Sterling floats over a cross from the right. Jesus does well to get to it but can\u2019t get enough power into his header to trouble the keeper. 48 min: City pop the ball around in front of Skakhtar\u2019s massed defence. But as soon as they try to make an incursion into the box, they are foiled. 46 min: Here we go again, as Whitesnake nearly sang. No personnel changes during the interval. Why not amuse yourselves during the break by reading about the two Club Brugge players who got sent off for celebrating a last-ditch equaliser in Galatasaray earlier. This scoreline would be enough to book City\u2019s place in the next round but Guardiola will be frustrated, all the same, at how difficult his team have found the going so far. They\u2019ve looked too ponderous against well-organised opponents who have carried a threat on the counter-attack. If not for a super clearance by Fernandinho after goofing by Ederson, City would be behind. Silva has been City\u2019s most impressive player so far; De Bruyne has also been good by his final pass has been uncharacteristically imprecise; Rodri has seen plenty of the ball and used it tidily but he\u2019s no Fernandinho; Sterling and Jesus have struggled to get involved. 45 min: Silva cuts infield from the right and aims a delicious cross towards the back post. Two City players are waiting for it ... but Kyvtsov dives between the pair of them to head clear brilliantly! 43 min: De Bruyne is expected to swing in a corner from wide on the right but instead pulls it sideways to Cancelo, who tries to clip a dinky one to the back post from just outside the area. But he doesn\u2019t get enough air on it and it\u2019s cleared without hassle. 41 min: An excellent tackle by Matviyenko prevents De Bruyne from finding Jesus with a nice first-time pass. 39 min: Gundogan\u2019s shot from over 20 yards flies wide via a deflection off a defender. 37 min: Rodri sprays the ball wide to Silva. But when City work the ball back to him from the flank, Rodri plays a hasty pass straight to a defender. That\u2019s symptomatic of how City have become a little frazzled in the face of peskily decent opponents. Skhakhar are defending in numbers and then attacking with speed and flair. 35 min: Jesus has been working hard, as ever, but his teammates have not been able to ind him in the right place at the right time. 33 min: One cute ball from deep catches out City again! Fortunately for them, Moraes can\u2019t get a touch on it despite stretching out a leg in the hope of poking it past the advancing Ederson near the edge of the area. 32 min: De Bruyne pulls a corner back to Gundogan, who sends it back even farther, to Angelino. The left-back delivers a good cross from deep. Otamendi shows determination and timing to get to it first and butts a powerful header goalward from eight yards. Straight at the keeper, though. 30 min: This is turning into a decent game even if City aren\u2019t at their slick best. Two very tidy teams full of enterprise, albeit mostly on the counter-attack for the visitors. They\u2019re pretty well matched so far. 27 min: Silva finds De Bruyne in midfield as City gallop forward on the coutner. De Bruyne plays it to CAnelo, running in on the right-hand side of the box. The full-back wrongfoots the defender in his way by checking back instead of shooting. Then he clips a cross towards the back post. No one had anticipated that, so it drifts wide. 25 min: Jesus nips in to win possession for City and immediately feed Rodri, who has a quick look around and decides to go for goal himself from 25 yards. He tries the precise sidefooter but it\u2019s too close to Pyatov, who saves easily. 21 min: Rodri is the metronome in the centre of City\u2019s midfield. He\u2019s yet to produce a really incisive pass but has played dozens of small ones to set City\u2019s rhythm, which, truth be told, has not been fast enough. 19 min: Skakhtar are very tidy technicians. They have played their way back into this game after City dominated the first 10 minutes or so. City aren\u2019t dynamic enough out of possession. 17 min: Konoplyanka opens up City\u2019s high defence with a pass through to Tete .... but it\u2019s slightly overhit, allowing Ederson to sprint out again and make a clearance. Impressive from the goalkeeper, clearly undeterred by his blunder of a moment ago. Two big warnings for City, though. 15 min: Ederson rushes out to intercept a ball over the top of the City defence .... and he completely misses it! Suddenly Tete is running towards an empty goal from a difficult angle wide on the right. Otamendi and Fernandiho charge back as tete tries to manoeuvre himself into a better shooting position, which he does a little sluggishly. When he gets off his shot, Fernandinho slides in to deflect it wide! A monumental let-off for Ederson! 13 min: Rodri gets away with a shirt-tug on Alan near the centre circle. It was not enough to stop the Brazilian from spinning free and nudging a nice pass through to a teammate. That\u2019s as good as the move gets for Shakhtar, though. 11 min: Silva releases the underlapping Cancelo with a beautiful pass. The full-back then pulls it back from the byline towards the edge of the area, but no City player can get on the end of it. 9 min: Tete dashes down the right as Shakhtar launch their first counter-attack of the game. But it peters out before they even reach the box, as Tete mislays his pass. 8 min: Sterling roves in from the left, weighs up his options and slips a pass through to De Bruyne, who sidesteps Matviyenko just inside the box before his shot is blocked. 6 min: De Bruyne, as ever, is at the hub of nearly all City\u2019s attacks. After receiving a pass in the \u2018hole\u2019 twixt Shakhatr\u2019s midfield and defence, he slides a clever ball through for Jesus to get on the end of it. Ach, it\u2019s fractionally too long! The keeper collects. 4 min: Otamendi steps out of defence to lead an attack. He pops the ball wide to Silva, who helps it on to De Bruyne. The Belgian tries to deliver a cross on the run but it\u2019s deflected behind for a corner, which yields nothing. 2 min: Angelino collects the ball in an advanced position wide on the left and pows a low pass towards Sterling at the edge of the area. Sterling dummies it to Jesus ... who dummies it to De Bruyne ... who inadvertently dummies it to a defender. He meant to feint and collect the pass but got his timing wrong. 1 min: We have kickoff! Shakhtar do the necessary ... and within seven seconds, City have possession thanks to Gundogan. Here come the teams, entering the pitch to a polite round of applause. The stadium looks to be close to full. And, as per tradition, City fans greet the Champions League anthem with righteous boos. Here\u2019s what Guardiola says to expect from Shakhtar: \u201cWe know them quite well. They\u2019ve changed their manager [since last season] but the philosophy is nearly th same. They put a lot players in the middle to play short passes and they are are so fast up front. They have quality. We have to play with energy and move the ball quickly.\u201d BT\u2019s Paul Dempsey asks Pep Guardiola about Man City\u2019s craving for the Champions League validation.

The goal was a gift, courtesy of a terrible error from the defender Yassine Meriah. But the one that put Spurs in charge, lining them up for a result that ensured their qualification for the last 16, followed a piece of quick-thinking from a ballboy on the touchline close to Mourinho\u2019s dugout.

Rose could only half-clear a high ball over the top and Youssef El Arabi glided past Winks as though he were not there before curling a fine low shot past Paulo Gazzaniga from 25 yards.

Barack Obama used to embarrass his daughters with \u201cdad jokes\u201d and puns for the ages such as \u201cYes, we cran\u201d. Those were innocent times. Trump is under the cloud of an impeachment inquiry and, even as guests gathered in the White House Rose Garden on a beautifully crisp autumn day, the House of Representatives\u2019 judiciary committee announced a hearing for next week. So when the current president emerged from the Oval Office with the first lady, Melania Trump, but not his children, he faced a dilemma of tone and whether to make light of the looming charges of high crimes and misdemeanours as he talked about Bread and Butter, the names of this year\u2019s turkeys, from North Carolina. Trump being Trump, he dived in. \u201cThankfully, Bread and Butter have been specially raised \u2026 to remain calm under any condition, which will be very important because they\u2019ve already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff\u2019s basement on Thursday,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s true.

But he would not issue an apology.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I\u2019ll say is this: I am determined that our society will be safe for people of all faiths. I don\u2019t want anyone to be feeling insecure in our society and our government will protect every community against the abuse they receive on the streets, on the trains or in any or any other form of life.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He was also confronted with specific allegations of antisemitism that have been raised against Labour members who have not been suspended and into whom investigations have been running for lengthy periods of time.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn was unable to say who would campaign for the Brexit deal he has promised he would negotiate and then put to the country, alongside remain, in a referendum.</strong> Following a theme seen throughout the interview, Corbyn sought to explain his party\u2019s policy and the intentions behind it, while Neil tried to pin him down on specifics. Corbyn presented his plan to remain personally neutral as statesmanlike as Neil asked him why the UK would want a prime minister who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a view on what really is the greatest peacetime issue that\u2019s faced this country for 70 years\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would be the prime minister that would make sure that there was a fair debate and fair discussion, we\u2019d come to conclusion at the end of it and I would carry out the result of that referendum in whatever way it went.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Labour leader admitted his tax policies would, in fact, mean some people on less than \u00a380,000 per year would see effective increases.</strong> Pressed on his claims that only the richest would pay more, Corbyn acknowledged that his plan to scrap the marriage tax allowance, for example, would actually mean people on lower incomes losing a \u00a3250-a-year relief.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They will also be getting a pay rise when we bring in a living wage. They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four year olds.

However, he did point out that while Labour has launched<a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-launches-ambitious-race-and-faith-manifesto-rooted-in-social-justice-internationalism-and-human-rights/\"> its own race and faith manifesto</a>, the Conservative party said almost nothing on these issues in its own manifesto.

This an issue that is particularly acute in the Conservative party who have approached Islamophobia with denial, dismissal and deceit.</p> \n   <p>It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism.

But, when asked repeatedly whether he would have been willing to use the \u201cletter box\u201d language that Johnson used, Javid repeatedly refused to endorse what Johnson wrote. Javid said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All politicians will choose their own words and ways to explain whatever is the point they are trying to get across. We\u2019ve all got our own type of language.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Javid also said that Johnson had explained what he meant, and that Johnson was actually trying in that article to defend the rights of women to wear what they want.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid said the Conservatives should not be willing to accept Islamophobia in their ranks. </strong>Asked about this issue, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will never, ever as a party tolerate anyone among our ranks that has any kind of prejudice to any group of people, whether it\u2019s based on their race or their religion or the gender or anything else. We will never tolerate it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims that the proposed inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party had been watered down.</strong> During the Tory leadership contest, in one TV debate, Javid bounced Johnson and the other candidates into agreeing that there should be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. Johnson is going to set up an inquiry, but it will cover all forms of racism. Asked if he was disappointed about the inquiry being watered down in this way, Javid replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, I\u2019m not disappointed.

Banging his fist on the lectern in emphasis, the prime minister told activists: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Confirmed last night, as I understood it, to Andrew Neil \u2013 did I get this right? \u2013 confirmed to rejoin the EU, to join the euro, to put up a border at Berwick, hand back control, obey very jot and tittle of the panoply of EU legislation and hand back control of the fantastic marine wealth of Scotland to Brussels.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The SNP said this was \u201cutter fiction\u201d; the party wants to first use sterling after independence and then in time create a new Scottish currency. It explicitly rejects taking on the euro, although its critics insist that EU membership requires a commitment to eventually joining the currency union.</p> \n  <p>Johnson finally wrongly asserted there was a spaceport in Sutherland, in the far north of Scotland, being built \u2013 only to be corrected by an audience member that it was still only planned. Riffing on the wealth- and job-creating potential of artificial intelligence and advance technologies, Johnson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Not forgetting the spaceport that is under construction or is it under construction or almost complete \u2026 [an audience member corrects him] on its way. The spaceport that is on its way in Scotland \u2013 it certainly will be complete in 10 years time, which will send British satellites into the heavens and drive one of our most exciting new industries. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That Space Hub Sutherland project has significant official backing but it is not yet cleared for construction, and is months away from receiving planning permission. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-49905163\">It is expected to start that process next month.</a></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e20747f80325942f2a41ed6f527d13c01b6734f5\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e20747f80325942f2a41ed6f527d13c01b6734f5/0_118_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T17:20:15.782Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddd51b78f083aa6d578b84f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T16:25:32.290Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1199342574487474182\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A Labour candidate who apologised for sharing a post online about 'zionist masters' and another who defended Ken Livingstone when he was accused of antisemitism were on the platform behind Jeremy Corbyn today</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1199342574487474182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1199344762311987200\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is the kind of thing that makes some in Labour ask this question, is the leadership blind to impression that gives, or worse in some candidates' view, is perfectly aware but doesn't mind ?

And, given that both main parties are planning to spend more, why should people trust you more on spending then them?</em></p> \n  <p>Javid says Labour itself admits it would put tax up.</p> \n  <p>It is also proposing higher borrowing. But there remains a black hole, Javid claims.</p> \n  <p>Javid says Labour would not just borrow more because it has fiscal rules. He says he is taking them at their word, assuming they would meet their fiscal rules. And if Labour does borrow more, taxpayers will eventually have to pay for that anyway, he says.</p> \n  <p>He says the Conservatives have published their own costs. In most cases he used Treasury figures in that costings document, he says. He says Labour has not challenged the figures in that document.</p> \n  <p>And he says his fiscal rules are much stricter than Labour\u2019s.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"355aabb0644fc329b6a52ea02d52a1a37b6da72c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/355aabb0644fc329b6a52ea02d52a1a37b6da72c/0_53_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid speaking at Bolton Lads &amp; Girls club in Bolton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid speaking at Bolton Lads &amp; Girls club in Bolton<br></span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddd45758f087b800b621820\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T15:34:56.736Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Javid claims ordinary taxpayers would have to pay more under Labour</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Javid claims there are six tax rises in the Labour manifesto that would hit ordinary people.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There at least six confirmed tax rises they\u2019ve hidden away that will hit people hard:</p> \n   <p>The marriage tax \u2013 removing an allowance so families lose \u00a3250 a year.</p> \n   <p>A stealth tax on drivers \u2013 hiking the cost of petrol by 16p a litre.</p> \n   <p>A stealth tax on heating \u2013 increasing the energy bills of 24 million households heated by gas.</p> \n   <p>Higher inheritance tax \u2013 reversing our previous cut.</p> \n   <p>The pension tax \u2013 reducing pensions by \u00a311,000, hitting up to 10 million savers.</p> \n   <p>And the small business tax \u2013 adding a \u00a35,000 bill to 1 million small business owners.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T15:44:29.377Z\">at 3.44pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddd450d8f087b800b62181e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T15:31:52.854Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Javid says the Labour claim that 95% of taxpayers would not have to pay more under its plans is not plausible. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour\u2019s numbers only add up with significant tax rises for the 95%, not just the 5.</p> \n   <p>They say they want to raise \u00a383bn in new taxes every year.</p> \n   <p>As chancellor I can tell you, you can\u2019t simply raise that amount of money from such a small group of people.</p> \n   <p>But it\u2019s worse than that because there\u2019s currently an \u00a3385bn financial hole in Labour\u2019s plans.</p> \n   <p>And that means tax hikes on hard-working families on lower and middle incomes, like many of the proud people of Bolton.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddd43838f080fd59fb17a94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T15:28:47.598Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Javid says the Tories published a claim earlier in the campaign that a Corbyn government would spend \u00a31.2tn.

Jeremy Corbyn gets the Neil treatment tonight. Last night <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister, was put through the Neil wringer. I would not normally post on something that happened last night, but in the comments below the line some readers have been asking why we did not cover the interview in more detail, it came up briefly at the Scottish Tory launch earlier and I can\u2019t find a good summary elsewhere on the web, so here is a round-up of the main points. You can watch the half-hour programme<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000bqs0/the-andrew-neil-interviews-election-2019-nicola-sturgeon\"> here.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sturgeon said she did not think it was \u201ccredible\u201d to believe that Jeremy Corbyn would refuse to grant the SNP demand for a Scottish independence referendum if he needed the SNP to support a Labour minority government. </strong>But she admitted that the SNP would back the Labour proposal for a second Brexit referendum whatever, and Neil put it to her that her bargaining position would be weak if Corbyn refused her request, because the SNP would not support a Tory government. Sturgeon rejected this. Asked if she would really be willing to withhold support from a minority Labour government if it did not agree to an independence referendum, she replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A minority government will have to demonstrate that it\u2019s got the ability to govern, and yes, I\u2019m trying to be frank - and I think more politicians could benefit from being frank about this - I don\u2019t think it is reasonable for any Labour leader or any Westminster politician to say to the SNP, \u2018give us support\u2019 if they don\u2019t accept that fundamental principle of Scotland having the right to choose our own future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Sturgeon also said compromise would be necessary.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I also accept that in any discussion of this nature, if we\u2019re in this position after this election because no party\u2019s got an overall majority ... compromise will be required on all sides. I get all of that and I accept that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She claimed that, even if UK were to vote to remain in the EU in a second referendum, a second independence referendum would still be justified.</strong> Neil put it to her that in those circumstances Scotland would not have undergone the \u201cmaterial change\u201d that the SNP said would be needed for a re-run of the 2014 independence referendum to be justified. Sturgeon rejected this. She claimed that the experience of the last three years was enough to justify one because of \u201cthe way in which Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to [it] over the past three years that our views and our views doesn\u2019t matter\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She refused to say how long it would take Scotland to rejoin the EU if Scotland voted for independence after Brexit.</strong> Neil put it to her that it would be five to 10 years, because that is how long the SNP\u2019s growth commission report said it would take for Scotland to establish its own currency.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She rejected claims that Scotland would need its own independent currency before it would be allowed to join the EU.</strong> She said an independent Scotland would start off using the pound. Neil claimed the EU would not allow this. But Sturgeon did not accept that. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We would have a discussion with the European Union about the journey an independent Scotland goes on in terms of currency and the accession, if Scotland was already out of the European Union [at] the point where we rejoined the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She was unable to say how an independent Scotland would build up the currency reserves needed to support a new currency.</strong> Neil pointed out that Scotland was running a deficit. Sturgeon accepted this, but said the deficit was coming down. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She was unable to explain why the SNP says leaving the EU would lead to job losses in Scotland, but why leaving the United Kingdom would not lead to similar job losses.</strong> Neil said the Scottish government has accepted research showing that 80,000 jobs in Scotland could go after Brexit because of the impact of trade friction. Asked why the same thing would not happen after Scottish independence, if Scotland ended up in the EU and the rest of the UK was outside, Sturgeon just said we did not know yet what England\u2019s final relationship with the EU would be. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t yet know what the UK\u2019s final relationship with the EU will [be]. When we have clarity on that we have to understand those implications and we have to set out clearly how we deal with those implications in order to keep trade flowing between Scotland and England, which is in our interests and in the interests of the rest of the UK. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She claimed that a confirmatory referendum was necessary on Brexit because leavers did not give details of what they were planning in 2016, but she said that if Scotland had voted for independence in 2014, a second confirmatory referendum would not have been necessary because the SNP had been very clear about what it was planning. </strong>But Neil rejected this argument, saying that the SNP plan in 2014 assumed oil revenues of \u00a38bn by 2016, but that the actual figure was \u00a3300m in 2016.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She admitted that the NHS in Scotland was only meeting two of its eight key waiting time targets.</strong> Neil said: \u201cYou\u2019ve called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon?\u201d Sturgeon said obviously she did not accept that.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdf24e7d4274eeaa4d687d16a82e94486ee05e5f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdf24e7d4274eeaa4d687d16a82e94486ee05e5f/249_337_1592_955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Neil interviewing Nicola Sturgeon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Neil interviewing Nicola Sturgeon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddd40148f083aa6d578b776\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T15:10:27.497Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Lord Falconer</strong>, who was lord chancellor when Tony Blair was PM, told the World at One that he thought the chief rabbi\u2019s criticism of Labour over antisemitism was justified.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorldatOne/status/1199331161249591296\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"I will vote Labour - but on the basis that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKLabour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UKLabour</a> has got to deal with it's anti-Semitism problem...I hope that the Chief Rabbi's absolutely extraordinary, but justified, intervention will be listened to by my party\"<br><br>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordCFalconer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LordCFalconer</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcwato?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bbcwato</a><a href=\"https://t.co/76w0npP3Vv\">https://t.co/76w0npP3Vv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sNumXmdEGl\">pic.twitter.com/sNumXmdEGl</a></p>\u2014 The World at One (@BBCWorldatOne) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorldatOne/status/1199331161249591296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>Presumably Falconer was using the word \u201cvote\u201d in a loose, metaphorical sense when he really meant \u201csupport\u201d.

That leaves 56 Labour marginals that voted leave.</p> \n   <p>If we assume the Tories lose around 20 seats to the SNP and Liberal Democrats (without tactical voting, their losses may be fewer), and gains 56 seats from Labour, then Boris Johnson ends up with a majority of 65 (assuming Sinn F\u00e9in MPs stay away from parliament).</p> \n   <p>It would not take much for the Tories to do significantly better than that.

Dubs, who arrived in the UK in 1939 as a refugee from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, said he respected Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, but thought he was wrong on this. Dubs said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, I have a lot of respect for the chief rabbi, I\u2019ve co-operated with him on campaigns on behalf of child refugees, I\u2019ve spoken to him in many synagogues and I\u2019ve got a lot of positive feeling about the Jewish community, but I think today the chief rabbi has gone too far \u2026</p> \n   <p>I think the Labour party has been much too slow in getting to grips with this, and I\u2019ve been critical of the Labour party over the last two or three years, but I feel we are getting there, and I want to look at it from the point of view of where we are today and moving forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if he thought Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, Dubs replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think he is, yes, I think he is fit to be prime minister.

Labour sources are disputing this, but Kerslake said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Labour] would then need to have conversations with those [minority] parties to really establish on what basis they would give that support.</p> \n   <p>We don\u2019t yet know in truth how that would play out, although the Liberal Democrats have said they could not support a Jeremy-Corbyn-led Labour government and the SNP have said they would want a second referendum.</p> \n   <p>All of that, no doubt, would form part of the conversation that Labour would be having informally with those two parties.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his Today interview this morning <strong>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson</strong>, the DUP chief whip, also hinted that the DUP could rethink its opposition to Labour if Corbyn were to be replaced as leader. The DUP had a confidence and supply arrangement with Theresa May. But now it finds itself isolated because Boris Johnson is proposing a Brexit deal that would in effect create a customs border down the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable to unionists. Asked who the DUP wanted to win the election, Donaldson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, that\u2019s a matter for the electorate, but clearly we\u2019ve stated we believe a Corbyn-led Labour government would be disastrous for the UK. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that his use of the phrase \u201cCorbyn-led Labour government\u201d implied the DUP might take a different view of a Labour government led by someone else, and when he was asked if the DUP could \u201cdo business\u201d with such a government, Donaldson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, it would depend what their platform was. We would have to look at that very carefully.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the DUP could support Labour\u2019s plan for a second referendum featuring two options, remain and a leave option, Donaldson did not rule this out. \u201cWell, we\u2019d need to see what the deal was, of course,\u201d he replied. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not going to commit myself to something at this stage that is entirely hypothetical. But clearly there isn\u2019t a single major party in Northern Ireland that supports the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal and that\u2019s a major problem for us because, if this deal is imposed, I believe it will create further instability, and we certainly don\u2019t need that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Political parties tend to react very badly to other parties telling them who they should have as leader, and it is hard to imagine Labour ditching Corbyn just to win parliamentary support from the Lib Dems or the DUP.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. My colleague, Andrew Sparrow, has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s main events: Since he wrote that, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn faced a bruising encounter with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil; a summary of which you can read here. And the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator said it would not be possible to negotiate a trade deal in the 11 months available in the prime minister\u2019s timetable (see: 6.19pm). Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview this evening: The Labour leader declined repeated opportunities to apologise to the UK\u2019s Jewish community over his handling of antisemitism with his party. During sustained questioning on the damaging issue, which took up about a third of the interview, Corbyn sought to defend his record, claiming to have strengthened the party\u2019s processes for rooting out antisemitism. But he would not issue an apology. What I\u2019ll say is this: I am determined that our society will be safe for people of all faiths. I don\u2019t want anyone to be feeling insecure in our society and our government will protect every community against the abuse they receive on the streets, on the trains or in any or any other form of life. He was also confronted with specific allegations of antisemitism that have been raised against Labour members who have not been suspended and into whom investigations have been running for lengthy periods of time. Corbyn was unable to say who would campaign for the Brexit deal he has promised he would negotiate and then put to the country, alongside remain, in a referendum. Following a theme seen throughout the interview, Corbyn sought to explain his party\u2019s policy and the intentions behind it, while Neil tried to pin him down on specifics. Corbyn presented his plan to remain personally neutral as statesmanlike as Neil asked him why the UK would want a prime minister who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a view on what really is the greatest peacetime issue that\u2019s faced this country for 70 years\u201d. I would be the prime minister that would make sure that there was a fair debate and fair discussion, we\u2019d come to conclusion at the end of it and I would carry out the result of that referendum in whatever way it went. The Labour leader admitted his tax policies would, in fact, mean some people on less than \u00a380,000 per year would see effective increases. Pressed on his claims that only the richest would pay more, Corbyn acknowledged that his plan to scrap the marriage tax allowance, for example, would actually mean people on lower incomes losing a \u00a3250-a-year relief. They will also be getting a pay rise when we bring in a living wage. They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four year olds. They\u2019ll also get properly funded schools. Some of Labour\u2019s plans will require borrowing, Corbyn acknowledged. But he presented some elements as investments and others as moral obligations. Referring to his pledge to compensate the Waspi women, Corbyn said: It\u2019s a moral case. Those women were short-changed by government. Short changed in 2011 by the change in the pension rate. My colleague, Rowena Mason, is putting together a comprehensive story on Corbyn\u2019s interview with the BBC, which you can read here: And that\u2019s that, Neil calls the interview to a close. Neil accuses the Labour leader of tending to side with the UK\u2019s enemies. Corbyn says he wants to keep Britain safe. He also declines to say for certain whether or not he would give the orders to kill any new leader of so-called Islamic State if it was not possible to arrest them. He says the UK must abide by international law and attempt to arrest someone \u201cif it is possible\u201d. I will take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time with all the information, you asked me a hypothetical question in a hypothetical scenario. And the Labour leader stressed that it was essential to look \u201cto the future\u201d and at how the terror group formed and spread, adding: \u201cWe also have to look at how we created these dangers as well.\u201d Asking how he will pay for his policy to compensate the Waspi women, Corbyn says it must be paid for because it\u2019s a moral question. Corbyn says the UK will pay for it over \u201csome years\u201d and the money will come either from government reserves or, if necessary, the government will borrow for it. Neil asks Corbyn about his borrowing plans. The Labour leader acknowledges taking institutions into public ownership would require him to issue debt but says there will be a return as well. He added: We are not going to willy-nilly borrow, what we are going to do is deal with the worst aspects of what\u2019s happened in austerity, the worst aspects of poverty in Britain. Corbyn defended his policy to scrap the marriage tax allowance, which Neil suggests undermines his promise that only those earning more than \u00a380,000 per year would see tax increases. The Labour leader says measures such as the introduction of a living wage would mitigate. On his taxation plans, Corbyn denied that a significant part his income tax base would leave the country if he took power. No, it doesn\u2019t crumble at all ... I think they would also recognise that tax rates in general have gone down, that inequality has gone up ... They can see all around them the crumbling of public services and the terrible levels of child poverty that exist across Britain ... There is no reason why they would have to leave the country and they shouldn\u2019t. Neil moves on to Brexit, asking Corbyn why people would want a prime minister who would call a referendum and then decline to say which path he supports. I will be the honest broker that will make sure the referendum is fair and make sure that the leave deal is a credible one and the remain option is alongside it. Corbyn added: \u201cThat seems to me actually an adult and sensible way to go forward.\u201d But he was unable to say who would lead the campaign for his Brexit deal. Corbyn says he has spent his life \u201copposing racism of any form\u201d, adding: \u201cThat is what my life is about.\u201d The Labour leader then declined to apologise four times to the Jewish community, saying instead that he wanted to protect all communities and work with them to ensure racism is \u201celiminated\u201d. Neil presents Corbyn with a specific example of comments the Labour leader agrees are antisemitic and asks why the person accused of making them has not been suspended \u2013 as well as why the party\u2019s investigation into them has taken a year. Corbyn responds that the process is independent of him and says he believes legal representations may have been made, causing delays. Corbyn was challenged over Rabbi Mirvis\u2019s allegation that Labour\u2019s claims it is doing everything to tackle anti-Jewish racism was a \u201cmendacious fiction\u201d. He replied: No, he\u2019s not right. Because he would have to produce the evidence to say that\u2019s mendacious. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with the BBC is starting now. The interviewer, Andrew Neil, opens with a question on the chief rabbi\u2019s claims on antisemitism within the Labour party. Corbyn says antisemitism is not acceptable within society or his party and says he has amended the party\u2019s processes to have people guilty of antisemitism from the party. He also denies the accusation that instances of antisemitism have risen during his tenure as leader. It didn\u2019t rise after I became leader. Antisemitism is there in society, there are a very, very small number of people in the Labour party that have been sanctioned as a result about their antisemitic behaviour. The BBC has posted a clip from its interview with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, which is due to air in a few minutes: We reported earlier that the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, believes it will not be possible to agree a comprehensive trade deal in the 11-month window that would be available if the UK left on 31 January (see: 6.19pm). Now, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, has said: These comments show Boris Johnson is lying to the country. It\u2019s clearly not possible to do a trade deal with the EU in 11 months and now those on the other side of the negotiating table agree. Johnson\u2019s December 2020 deadline would mean yet another year of damaging uncertainty for businesses and families, with the threat of no deal continuing to loom over the country. There is no deal with the EU that is better than the one we enjoy now as full members. Liberal Democrats will keep fighting to stop Brexit, deny Boris Johnson a majority and build a brighter future for the country. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to apologise to the British Jewish community following a remarkable election intervention from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who used an article in the Times to suggest that the \u201cmoral compass\u201d of Britain would be awry if Labour won the election because of Corbyn\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in his party. In his article Mirvis did not raise any new allegations about Corbyn or his party, but he said the Labour claim that it was doing everything it could to tackle antisemitism in the party was \u201ca mendacious fiction\u201d. He also claimed that Corbyn did not even understand the problem properly. Mirvis wrote: The party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party. Many members of the Jewish community can hardly believe that this is the same party that they called their political home for more than a century. It can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism. And he concluded his article: It is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake. This morning, at the launch of Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto, Corbyn said antisemitism was \u201cvile and wrong\u201d and \u201cwould not be tolerated in any form whatsoever\u201d by him. He also offered to meet Mirvis to discuss this further. Many Corbyn supporters are exasperated by this line of attack, which they believe is being amplified by rightwing newspapers with no genuine anti-racist credentials, but Corbyn himself was careful to avoid criticising Mirvis personally or denying the existence of a problem. However, he did point out that while Labour has launched its own race and faith manifesto, the Conservative party said almost nothing on these issues in its own manifesto. Inspired by the chief rabbi, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was important to speak up for the experience of Mulsims in the Tory party too. In a statement the MCB said: The way that the chief rabbi had shared his experiences and insights, has highlighted the importance of speaking out on the racism we face, whilst maintaining our non-partisan stance. As a faith community, we commonly are threatened by Islamophobia. This an issue that is particularly acute in the Conservative party who have approached Islamophobia with denial, dismissal and deceit. It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism. It is as if the Conservative party has a blind spot for this type of racism. Boris Johnson said the chief rabbi\u2019s comments showed Corbyn had been guility of a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d on the issue of antisemitism. However, mindful no doubt of complaints about racist language he has used himself in the past, when Johnson was asked about this in Scotland, he seemed keen to move the subject on and he quickly made a wider point about Corbyn\u2019s supposed lack of leadership on Brexit. The Conservative vulnerability on this issue was on display later in the day when Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to endorse Johnson\u2019s \u201cletter box\u201d article about Muslim women wearing burqas that was deemed responsible for a sharp rise in incidents of Islamophobia. Javid also claimed he was not disappointed that the inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party he proposed has been converted by Johnson into an inquiry into racism in general in the party. Javid published a Tory analysis of the Labour manifesto that he claimed proved that ordinary people would pay more in tax under Corbyn\u2019s plans. Labour claims only the richest 5% will pay more in tax. But the Tory document identified six \u201ctax rises\u201d (some of them were just financial penalties, not proper tax rises) that might effect non-wealthy taxpayers under Labour. Javid also said that, following the publication of the Labour manifesto, the Conservatives have revised their calculations about how much extra spending they will entail, and what this will mean for taxpayers. By happy coincidence, the Tories have concluded that the overall cost, \u00a31.2tr, and the cost to taxpayers, \u00a32,400 per year, are the same as they were when the party calculated them before the Labour manifesto was published. Both those figures were widely seen as bogus because they were based on too many false or questionable assumptions. Johnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament. The Liberal Democrats have been accused of peddling misinformation after distributing fake newspapers with names similar to be independent publications, prompting one local newspaper group to threaten to stop all coverage of the party. A sharp rise in voter registration, predominantly among young people, has boosted Labour\u2019s hopes in the general election. Michael Gove has mocked Stormzy for expressing his support for Labour and Corbyn in the forthcoming election. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is in charge now. The chief rabbi\u2019s remarks about Labour and antisemitism should concern \u201cevery right-thinking person\u201d, Nicola Sturgeon has told reporters at a campaign visit to Uddingston. I very much hope that the Labour party listen seriously and carefully to the chief rabbi\u2019s comments today and act on these concerns about anti-semitism. But I would say to people who have concerns about Jeremy Corbyn, if he gets himself into a position of being able to form a government with the help of others then better to have the SNP as a force in there making the right values, policies and priorities are pursued rather than having Labour without that influence. Sturgeon was visiting a nursery to announce a proposal to \u201ctransform\u201d parental leave, by extending shared leave to 64 weeks at an increased rate, including 12 weeks ring-fenced \u201cdaddy leave\u201d. The proposal was welcomed by campaigners \u2013 the work-life balance charity Working Families has been calling for a similar scheme aimed at fathers for a long time, given the uptake of shared parental leave remains low and the evidence suggests that fathers who do have some leave from work with young children are more involved as their families grow up. The Westminster government is currently consulting on parental leave, although neither Tories nor Labour have proposed anything aimed directly at fathers in their manifestos. It will not be possible to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal in the 11-month transition period that would follow an exit from the bloc on 31 January, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told a private meeting of senior MEPs in Strasbourg. The UK is due to leave the single market and customs union at the end of December 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. At that point, new arrangements \u2013 or none \u2013 will come into force. Any extension to the UK\u2019s membership of the single market and customs union would need to be agreed before 1 July. Barnier said that, if such an extension was not sought by the UK, negotiators would \u201cneed to focus on specific subjects\u201d and that agreement on various issues, including the rights of British air carriers to operate as they do today, would have to wait until after 2020. Barnier said the key areas on which the negotiators would work in the coming year would be trade in goods, data, fisheries, aviation, police and judicial cooperation. The goal for the EU is to agree on \u201czero quotas, zero tariffs and zero dumping\u201d, he said in a reference to the bloc\u2019s determination to ensure that the UK signs up to a high degree of regulatory alignment to ensure British companies do not have a competitive advantage post-Brexit. Barnier also told MEPs that the \u201ctoughest question\u201d would be the EU\u2019s insistence that free movement in goods comes as a package with the free movement of people. He added that the most \u201cdifficult outcome\u201d for the EU would be a hung parliament as it would imperil ratification of the deal in Westminster. The prime minister has claimed the UK can conclude a trade deal in time, though experts had already pointed out that such deal typically take years to negotiate and ratify. Boris Johnson has claimed the Tory party takes anti-Islamic abuse seriously after criticism of his party\u2019s handling of the issue from the Muslim Council of Britain. The prime minister told reporters on a visit to the International Aviation Academy in Norwich that he did not agree with the claim that his party has approached Islamophobia with \u201cdenial, dismissal and deceit\u201d. He said: What we do in the Tory party is, when anybody is guilty of any kind of prejudice or discrimination against another group, then they\u2019re out first bounce. Johnson has himself been accused of Islamophobia over his own past comments about Muslims. Earlier this month, the Guardian reported on a dossier of detailing Islamophobic and racist material posted by 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors: This is from Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer. Here are the main points from Sajid Javid\u2019s Q&amp;A. Javid, the chancellor, refused to endorse the language that Boris Johnson used in a Telegraph column when he described Muslim women in burqas as looking like letter boxes. Javid claimed that the Conservative problem with Islamophobia was not the same as Labour\u2019s problem with antisemitism partly because \u201cno one has every credibly suggested that it\u2019s an issue with the leadership of the party\u201d. But, when asked repeatedly whether he would have been willing to use the \u201cletter box\u201d language that Johnson used, Javid repeatedly refused to endorse what Johnson wrote. Javid said: All politicians will choose their own words and ways to explain whatever is the point they are trying to get across. We\u2019ve all got our own type of language. Javid also said that Johnson had explained what he meant, and that Johnson was actually trying in that article to defend the rights of women to wear what they want. Javid said the Conservatives should not be willing to accept Islamophobia in their ranks. Asked about this issue, he said: We will never, ever as a party tolerate anyone among our ranks that has any kind of prejudice to any group of people, whether it\u2019s based on their race or their religion or the gender or anything else. We will never tolerate it. He rejected claims that the proposed inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party had been watered down. During the Tory leadership contest, in one TV debate, Javid bounced Johnson and the other candidates into agreeing that there should be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. Johnson is going to set up an inquiry, but it will cover all forms of racism. Asked if he was disappointed about the inquiry being watered down in this way, Javid replied: No, I\u2019m not disappointed. Nothing is going to be watered down. We are absolutely committed to doing everything we can, doing more, to root any kind of prejudice amongst anyone who has got any association with the Conservative party. There is no excuse for it. Javid said the inquiry would start before Christmas. And he said people would be impressed by how serious it was. He said: Once that\u2019s published, the terms, people will see just how serious we are. We will never, ever tolerate any kind of prejudice of any kind. Boris Johnson again made a series of unforced errors when he launched the Scottish Conservative election manifesto, wrongly claiming a spaceport was being built in Scotland; that the SNP wanted to use the euro and that Jeremy Corbyn wanted to scrap the armed forces. Giving the carefully improvised stump speech he has made his trademark, Johnson accused the Labour leader of plotting to demilitarise the UK, staying: \u201cCorbyn has said he wants to scrap our armed services, and can\u2019t think of circumstances in which he would use them.\u201d While Corbyn has in the past suggested global demilitarisation and is a CND member, the Labour manifesto commits a Corbyn-led government to spending at least 2% of UK GDP on the armed forces, remain in Nato, replacing the Trident nuclear missile fleet and increasing UK funding for UN peacekeeping by \u00a3100m. Johnson then referred to a prickly BBC interview between Andrew Neil and Nicola Sturgeon broadcast on Monday night, where Neil pressed the first minister on her plans for an independent Scotland rejoining the EU. Banging his fist on the lectern in emphasis, the prime minister told activists: Confirmed last night, as I understood it, to Andrew Neil \u2013 did I get this right? \u2013 confirmed to rejoin the EU, to join the euro, to put up a border at Berwick, hand back control, obey very jot and tittle of the panoply of EU legislation and hand back control of the fantastic marine wealth of Scotland to Brussels. The SNP said this was \u201cutter fiction\u201d; the party wants to first use sterling after independence and then in time create a new Scottish currency. It explicitly rejects taking on the euro, although its critics insist that EU membership requires a commitment to eventually joining the currency union. Johnson finally wrongly asserted there was a spaceport in Sutherland, in the far north of Scotland, being built \u2013 only to be corrected by an audience member that it was still only planned. Riffing on the wealth- and job-creating potential of artificial intelligence and advance technologies, Johnson said: Not forgetting the spaceport that is under construction or is it under construction or almost complete \u2026 [an audience member corrects him] on its way. The spaceport that is on its way in Scotland \u2013 it certainly will be complete in 10 years time, which will send British satellites into the heavens and drive one of our most exciting new industries. That Space Hub Sutherland project has significant official backing but it is not yet cleared for construction, and is months away from receiving planning permission. It is expected to start that process next month. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From my colleague Peter Walker Q: [From my colleague John Crace] In the Tory leadership contest you managed to get all candidates to agree to an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Are you disappointed it has been watered down into a general inquiry? No, says Javid. He says \u201cnothing has been watered down\u201d. He says when people see the terms of inquiry, they will see how serious it is. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: Why have you not committed to the whole of Northern Powerhouse Rail if you can afford it under your borrowing rules? Javid says the party has not set out all its borrowing under the new borrowing rules. If they win the election, the Conservatives will say more in their first budget. But he says he is \u201cvery keen\u201d on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Q: Boris Johnson says he wants to raise the national insurance threshold eventually to \u00a312,500. But that is not in the manifesto. Will it happen in the next parliament? Javid says the Tories are a tax-cutting party. The national insurance threshold will go up to \u00a39,500, saving people around \u00a3100. But he says he cannot say when the national insurance threshold will rise further. Q: What extra spending would come to Bolton under a Tory government? Javid says people think the north does not get enough infrastructure spending. He says he wants to address that. Q: What about Boris Johnson\u2019s use of Islamophobic language? Javid says Johnson has defended the language he used in his Telegraph article that compared Muslim women to letterboxes. He says Johnson has given an explanation for this. Johnson was making a point about how women should be free to wear what they want. He says the Labour situation is different. The Conservative party has not had MPs leaving because of the views of the party leader. Q: Would you use that language? Incidents of Islamophobia went up 375% after that article. Javid says Johnson has defended his language. Q: Would you use that language? Javid says politicians decide what language they want to use. Q: So you are not saying you would not say that? Javid says he wants to bring people together. Javid is now taking questions. Q: Why do you think Labour would not be able to borrow to spend more? And, given that both main parties are planning to spend more, why should people trust you more on spending then them? Javid says Labour itself admits it would put tax up. It is also proposing higher borrowing. But there remains a black hole, Javid claims. Javid says Labour would not just borrow more because it has fiscal rules. He says he is taking them at their word, assuming they would meet their fiscal rules. And if Labour does borrow more, taxpayers will eventually have to pay for that anyway, he says. He says the Conservatives have published their own costs. In most cases he used Treasury figures in that costings document, he says. He says Labour has not challenged the figures in that document. And he says his fiscal rules are much stricter than Labour\u2019s. Javid claims there are six tax rises in the Labour manifesto that would hit ordinary people. There at least six confirmed tax rises they\u2019ve hidden away that will hit people hard: The marriage tax \u2013 removing an allowance so families lose \u00a3250 a year. A stealth tax on drivers \u2013 hiking the cost of petrol by 16p a litre. A stealth tax on heating \u2013 increasing the energy bills of 24 million households heated by gas. Higher inheritance tax \u2013 reversing our previous cut. The pension tax \u2013 reducing pensions by \u00a311,000, hitting up to 10 million savers. And the small business tax \u2013 adding a \u00a35,000 bill to 1 million small business owners. Javid says the Labour claim that 95% of taxpayers would not have to pay more under its plans is not plausible. Labour\u2019s numbers only add up with significant tax rises for the 95%, not just the 5. They say they want to raise \u00a383bn in new taxes every year. As chancellor I can tell you, you can\u2019t simply raise that amount of money from such a small group of people. But it\u2019s worse than that because there\u2019s currently an \u00a3385bn financial hole in Labour\u2019s plans. And that means tax hikes on hard-working families on lower and middle incomes, like many of the proud people of Bolton. Javid says the Tories published a claim earlier in the campaign that a Corbyn government would spend \u00a31.2tn. He claims that, now the Labour manifesto has been published, the Tories have been able to review the figure. It could be an underestimate, he claims. Well now they\u2019ve released their final plans, and the direct cost of Corbyn is confirmed. And it could actually be worse than we feared. If anything it\u2019s an underestimate. Labour\u2019s costings document shamelessly overlooked many of the commitments in their manifesto \u2013 59 of which don\u2019t have enough detail for us to cost fairly, so we have left those out. Here is an article by my colleague Richard Partington explaining why the original \u00a31.2tn figure was flawed. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is giving a speech in Bolton on the cost of Labour\u2019s plans. We will have a live feed at the top of the blog soon. The most aggressive and forensic interviewer on TV at the moment is the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil and he is interviewing the party leaders during the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn gets the Neil treatment tonight. Last night Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, was put through the Neil wringer. I would not normally post on something that happened last night, but in the comments below the line some readers have been asking why we did not cover the interview in more detail, it came up briefly at the Scottish Tory launch earlier and I can\u2019t find a good summary elsewhere on the web, so here is a round-up of the main points. You can watch the half-hour programme here. Sturgeon said she did not think it was \u201ccredible\u201d to believe that Jeremy Corbyn would refuse to grant the SNP demand for a Scottish independence referendum if he needed the SNP to support a Labour minority government. But she admitted that the SNP would back the Labour proposal for a second Brexit referendum whatever, and Neil put it to her that her bargaining position would be weak if Corbyn refused her request, because the SNP would not support a Tory government. Sturgeon rejected this. Asked if she would really be willing to withhold support from a minority Labour government if it did not agree to an independence referendum, she replied: A minority government will have to demonstrate that it\u2019s got the ability to govern, and yes, I\u2019m trying to be frank - and I think more politicians could benefit from being frank about this - I don\u2019t think it is reasonable for any Labour leader or any Westminster politician to say to the SNP, \u2018give us support\u2019 if they don\u2019t accept that fundamental principle of Scotland having the right to choose our own future. But Sturgeon also said compromise would be necessary. I also accept that in any discussion of this nature, if we\u2019re in this position after this election because no party\u2019s got an overall majority ... compromise will be required on all sides. I get all of that and I accept that. She claimed that, even if UK were to vote to remain in the EU in a second referendum, a second independence referendum would still be justified. Neil put it to her that in those circumstances Scotland would not have undergone the \u201cmaterial change\u201d that the SNP said would be needed for a re-run of the 2014 independence referendum to be justified. Sturgeon rejected this. She claimed that the experience of the last three years was enough to justify one because of \u201cthe way in which Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to [it] over the past three years that our views and our views doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. She refused to say how long it would take Scotland to rejoin the EU if Scotland voted for independence after Brexit. Neil put it to her that it would be five to 10 years, because that is how long the SNP\u2019s growth commission report said it would take for Scotland to establish its own currency. She rejected claims that Scotland would need its own independent currency before it would be allowed to join the EU. She said an independent Scotland would start off using the pound. Neil claimed the EU would not allow this. But Sturgeon did not accept that. She said: We would have a discussion with the European Union about the journey an independent Scotland goes on in terms of currency and the accession, if Scotland was already out of the European Union [at] the point where we rejoined the European Union. She was unable to say how an independent Scotland would build up the currency reserves needed to support a new currency. Neil pointed out that Scotland was running a deficit. Sturgeon accepted this, but said the deficit was coming down. She was unable to explain why the SNP says leaving the EU would lead to job losses in Scotland, but why leaving the United Kingdom would not lead to similar job losses. Neil said the Scottish government has accepted research showing that 80,000 jobs in Scotland could go after Brexit because of the impact of trade friction. Asked why the same thing would not happen after Scottish independence, if Scotland ended up in the EU and the rest of the UK was outside, Sturgeon just said we did not know yet what England\u2019s final relationship with the EU would be. She said: We don\u2019t yet know what the UK\u2019s final relationship with the EU will [be]. When we have clarity on that we have to understand those implications and we have to set out clearly how we deal with those implications in order to keep trade flowing between Scotland and England, which is in our interests and in the interests of the rest of the UK. She claimed that a confirmatory referendum was necessary on Brexit because leavers did not give details of what they were planning in 2016, but she said that if Scotland had voted for independence in 2014, a second confirmatory referendum would not have been necessary because the SNP had been very clear about what it was planning. But Neil rejected this argument, saying that the SNP plan in 2014 assumed oil revenues of \u00a38bn by 2016, but that the actual figure was \u00a3300m in 2016. She admitted that the NHS in Scotland was only meeting two of its eight key waiting time targets. Neil said: \u201cYou\u2019ve called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon?\u201d Sturgeon said obviously she did not accept that. Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor when Tony Blair was PM, told the World at One that he thought the chief rabbi\u2019s criticism of Labour over antisemitism was justified. UPDATE: Presumably Falconer was using the word \u201cvote\u201d in a loose, metaphorical sense when he really meant \u201csupport\u201d. As Phil Gibson points out BTL, members of the House of Lords do not get a vote in general elections. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Fife. Johnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament. Asked what would happen if the Tories were the largest party in a hung parliament, and another party demanded a second referendum on Scottish independence or on Brexit as the price for putting Johnson in power, he replied: I don\u2019t normally answer that kind of hypothetical question but I think in your case I\u2019m going to make an exception; I certainly can rule out any such referendums. I genuinely think they would be bad for our country. It\u2019s not the way forward now. We need to honour democracy, we need to get the economy moving. Johnson said the chief rabbi\u2019s comments about Labour and antisemitism were \u201cvery serious\u201d and showed that Jeremy Corbyn was guilty of \u201ca failure of leadership\u201d. Asked about the comments, he said: I do think it\u2019s a very serious business when the chief rabbi speaks as he does. I have never known anything like it, and clearly it\u2019s a failure of leadership on the part of the Labour leader that he has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour party. But Johnson said Corbyn was also showing a \u201cgeneral failure of leadership\u201d, particularly by refusing to take a position on Brexit. Johnson laughed off a question about his unpopularity in Scotland. (See 12.35pm.) Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tories\u2019 interim leader, said his party would block requests from Holyrood for the powers to hold a second independence referendum \u201cfor a generation\u201d, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of supporting \u201cdisposable democracy\u201d by insisting on one. Speaking to reporters after Boris Johnson launched the Scottish Tory election manifesto at a hotel only a mile or so from Gordon Brown\u2019s home in North Queensferry, Carlaw said there were no circumstances in which a Conservative government at Westminster would transfer those powers to Holyrood. Citing the Scottish government\u2019s white paper on independence in 2013, Scotland\u2019s Future, Carlaw said: I have been very clear about this. You have a referendum because it\u2019s a binary question; a question you\u2019re unable to resolve through the normal political process and in 2014 we had a once-in-a-generation referendum. It actually said in the Scotland\u2019s Future document that it would be once-in-a-generation, and it actually also said on page 60 of that document \u2013 that the Scottish government spent a lot of money sending to every household \u2013 that if the Conservatives were elected in 2015 there was the prospect of a referendum on Europe, and we might then leave the European Union. So I argued that in 2014 when people made that decision to stay in the United Kingdom, they understood what staying in the UK might in future represent. And 2 million people, the biggest number of people we\u2019ve seen for anything in Scotland\u2019s history, voted to remain in the UK. [We] had that referendum in 2014 and I don\u2019t believe in a culture of disposable democracy, which the SNP now subscribe to, where you can say that you\u2019re going to have a once-in-a-generation referendum and then within a matter of a few years, say that you need to have that whole process again. We are not going to betray the record number of Scots who participated in 2014 on that basis. In a combative BBC interview on Monday night with Andrew Neil, Sturgeon was pressed on how she would defend staging a second vote if Labour succeeded next year in holding a fresh EU referendum in which the UK voted to stay in the EU. Neil said that staying in the EU would neutralise Sturgeon\u2019s argument for justifying a second independence vote so soon after 2014 \u2013 that Brexit was a substantial change to Scotland\u2019s constitutional position. Sturgeon, who supports a second EU referendum, said the chaos of the last three years was argument enough. She said: This is going to dominate Westminster politics for many years to come, and Scotland has had it demonstrated to it beyond any doubt over the past three years that right now, our future path as a country is not in our own hands. It\u2019s in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with the strings being pulled by Nigel Farage. I think it is time for people in Scotland to have a choice. Ahead of the SNP\u2019s manifesto launch tomorrow, Nicola Sturgeon is visiting a nursery this afternoon to announce a proposal to \u201ctransform\u201d parental leave, by extending shared leave to 64 weeks at an increased rate, including 12 weeks\u2019 ringfenced \u201cdaddy leave\u201d. The proposal was welcomed by campaigners; Working Families has been calling for a similar scheme aimed at fathers for a long time, given the uptake of shared parental leave remains low and the evidence suggests that fathers who do have some leave from work with young children are more involved as their families grow up. The Westminster government is currently consulting on parental leave, although neither Tories nor Labour have proposed anything aimed directly at fathers in their manifestos. This follows a difficult interview for Sturgeon with Andrew Neil on the BBC last night, in which she was pressed hard on her economic plans for independence and the state of the Scottish NHS. Meanwhile Boris Johnson \u2013 writing in this morning\u2019s Scottish Daily Mail ahead of his visit to Fife \u2013 has pledged that he would never allow another \u201cchaotic and divisive\u201d independence referendum, his strongest statement yet. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in the Q&amp;A (see 1.42pm) about antisemitism, and about what Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, said about Labour\u2019s record. I made it very clear in my speech, and I make it very clear again now, there is no place whatsoever for antisemitism in our society, our country or in my party and there never will be so long as I\u2019m leader of the party. And, since I become leader of the party, the party has adopted processes that didn\u2019t exit before, has had a disciplinary process that didn\u2019t exist before. And when people commit antisemitic acts, they are brought to book, and if necessary expelled from the party or suspended or asked to be educated better about it. I\u2019ve also introduced an education system within the party. I want to live in a country where people respect each other\u2019s faith. I want to live in a country where people feel secure to be Jewish, to be Muslim, to be Hindu, to be Christian, and I want to lead a government that has an open door to all of the faith leaders. So I invite the chief rabbi, I invite the archbishop of Canterbury, I invite all the other faith leaders to come talk to us about what their concerns are. But be absolutely sure of this assurance from me: no community will be at risk because of their identity, their faith, their ethnicity, or their language. I am proud to represent a diverse community in parliament. I\u2019ve spent my life fighting racism in any form, right outside here on Tottenham High Road in the 1970s. And so there is no place for it, and I ask those that think have not been done correctly to tell me about it, talk to me about it, but above all engage. I\u2019m very happy to engage with anybody. My whole life has been engagement with people. Sometimes you agree with them, sometimes you don\u2019t, but you only learn by that process of engagement. So I say to all communities, let\u2019s make our country safe for all of us. That is what our manifesto is all about and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud of our race and faith manifesto today. Q: How would you combat Islamophobia? Q: Can you assure Muslim communities they would be safe? Corbyn says this arts centre is not far from Finsbury Park, where a far-right killer murdered a Muslim just near where Corbyn lives. After the attack happened, the imam from the mosque intervened to protect the attacker. He says he would not tolerate attacks on mosques any more than attacks on any other places of worship. He says the Conservative party should address the Islamophobia problems they have in their own party. Islamophobia will always be challenged in any form in which it raises itself, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. (There was a suggestion earlier that there would not be a Q&amp;A.) Q: If the chief rabbi thinks most Jews are worried about a Labour government, how can the wider public vote Labour? Q: There have been complaints about antisemitism during the whole of your time as Labour leader. You say you are addressing this. But you have not persuaded the chief rabbi. Why? Q: Do you accept you have failed personally on this? Corbyn repeats the point he made in his speech: there is no place for antisemitism in society, or in Labour, and there never will be. He says he has introduced processes in Labour to deal with this that were not there before. He wants to live in a country where people respect each other\u2019s faiths. He wil have an open door as PM. So he invites the chief rabbi, and other faith leaders, to come and talk to him. He says no faith community will be at risk under his government. He has spent his life fighting racism \u2013 including right out here, on Tottenham High Road. He says people with concerns should tell him about them, and engage. You only learn by engagement, he says. Butler says we need to be honest about what Britain did wrong in the past. When people ask why people can\u2019t get over this, they don\u2019t realise how offensive that is. Turning to the Windrush scandal, she refers to the case of Hubert Howard, a Windrush victim who died recently without having had compensation or an apology. Butler says the system that created that injustice is still in place. Butler is now talking about the value of diversity. She says Norman Tebbit used to talk about the cricket test as a way of evaluating if people were loyal to the country. But this year England won the cricket World Cup with a team that included a West Indian, a Pakistani, a South African, a New Zealander and an Irishman. She says Labour will establish an independent review into the rise of the far right. And it will ensure more black history is taught in schools. Because black history is British history, she says. She says, within a month of taking power, Labour would launch a review into the shortage of BAME teachers in schools. Jeremy Corbyn says he is just the warm-up act for Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities. Butler takes to the stage. She says there are people trying to divide the country. She says a video has gone viral of a man and his children receiving antisemitic abuse on a train. It is unsettling to watch, she says. She says some of the people on the train did not intervene. But it was a woman in a hijab who intervened, she says. She says the woman said she knew what it was like to be abused like this. Butler says all forms of racism are wrong. She says after Boris Johnson compared Muslim women to letterboxes the number of incidents of Islamophobia went up by 375%. Corbyn says running through the Labour manifesto is the \u201cgolden thread\u201d of a society that works for all and respects all. He is very proud to lead a party of diversity. And he would be proud to speak on the world stage on behalf of a country proud of its diversity, he says. His manifesto can change lives for millions of people, he says. Corbyn says sometimes when people are challenged they are asked if they are \u201ctolerant\u201d of others. He does not like the word, he says. He prefers the idea of being respectful, he says. He says abuse has no place in our society. Attacks on people, and attacks on churches or synagogues or mosques, are attacks on all of us, he says. He says Labour would ensure there was full protection for places of worship. And attacks on places of worship would count as aggravated crimes, he says. He says: Antisemitism in any form is vile and wrong. It is an evil in our society \u2026 It grew in Europe \u2026 and ultimately led to the Holocaust \u2026 Under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever. He says Labour has a rapid process for dealing with these complaints. That process is constantly being reviewed. And Labour supports educating people about the problem, he says. Corbyn says he wants to work with people of all faiths and none. It has always been his pride and his pleasure to do this, he says. In government, his door will be open to all faith leaders, he says. He says the chief rabbi will be very welcome, as will be the archbishop of Canterbury, and leaders from other faiths. Corbyn says he thinks history may be the most important thing children learn at school. Labour would promote the emancipation education trust, to ensure that children learn more about slavery. It should not just be taught during black history month. It should be taught all year round, he says. Corbyn says there is not proper BAME representations at the top of public life. There are only 25 black female professors in British universities. He says a Labour government would carry out a review to ensure BAME people are properly represented at the top of the education system. Corbyn says Labour wants to push ahead with anonymised job applications, so people do not face discrimination because of their name. Corbyn says the Tory manifesto does not mention race and equality issues. Labour is the party of equality and human rights, he says. He says he wants to lead a government where this is central to everything it does. He says people have until tonight to register to vote. He urges people to register. And he says Labour will not pursue the voter ID plans in the Tory manifesto. These would suppress voting, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking at the Labour race and faith manifesto launch. He starts by thanking Alf Dubs for what he said, and for all his campaigning on behalf of immigrants. He is speaking at the Bernie Grant arts centre in Tottenham. Corbyn says he knew Grant very well, and is proud to be speaking at an arts centre named after him. He says Grant taught people a lot about the impact of Britain\u2019s colonial past. He says N15, the postcode area where he is speaking, is the most diverse in Britain. He says 150 languages are spoken here. Lord Dubs is speaking now at the Labour event. He says he is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d at what the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, said about Jeremy Corbyn and antisemitism. He does not accept a lot of what Mirvis said, although Dubs says he thinks Labour should have addressed the problem more quickly. But the chief rabbi\u2019s comments were \u201cunjustified and unfair\u201d, he says. Q: Why won\u2019t you take part in the Channel 4 News debate on the environment on Thursday? Johnson says he is taking part in other debates. He says as mayor of London he showed how emissions could be cut without the economy being harmed. But Labour would take a sledgehammer to the economy, he says. And that\u2019s it. The event is over. Q: Do you think Nicola Sturgeon should consider the chief rabbi\u2019s comments before propping up a Labour government? Johnson says Corbyn has not been able to stamp out antisemitism in his party. That is part of a wider failure of leadership, he says. He says you cannot be PM and refuse to take a position on Brexit. He says you cannot be neutral on that any more than you can be neutral on antisemitism. Q: If you are the largest party after the election, but don\u2019t have a majority, will you rule out holding a second referendum on independence or on Brexit. Johnson says he normally does not answer hypothetical questions like that. But he will answer this. Yes, he says. He says he genuinely thinks they would be bad for the country. Q: Polling shows your personal popularity in Scotland is only slightly better than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. You\u2019re on minus 34. Johnson interrupts. Minus 34 \u2013 we can build on that, he says, to audience laughter. Q: Would you have any more city deals for Scotland? Johnson says he will have a sectoral deal for the oil industry. And he will put \u00a33.1bn more into Scotland as a result of his manifesto plans, as a result of the Barnett formula. On city deals, Johnson says the whole of Scotland is covered. Q: How much of Brexit will be done by 31 January? Johnson says the UK will be out of the EU. It will be in control of its laws and money. Getting a trade deal by the end of the year will be tight. But people said he would not be able to get a Brexit deal, and he did get one, he says. Q: You have been talking about the cost of two referendums next year. How does that compare with how much you have spend on no-deal planning, and now much Brexit will cost Scotland? Johnson sidesteps the question, and says what is harming the economy is the delay. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: Scotland voted remain. Nicola Sturgeon thinks your policies are catastrophic for Scotland. She does not like Jeremy Corbyn, but she seems to have a loathing for you. Is that mutual? Johnson says he does not nurture grudges like this. He says our politics needs less of that. All that Sturgeon and Corbyn would do together would be waste 2020 on another Brexit referendum. Sturgeon said the 2014 independence referendum was a once in a generation one. She should stick to that, he says. Johnson ends with his joke about wanting to go carbon-neutral by 2050 and Corbyn neutral by Christmas. He urges people to support sensible, moderate, one-nation Scottish Conservatism. Johnson says in 10 years\u2019 time people in Scotland will be passionately proud of their Scottish identity, but also citizens of a proud United Kingdom. Johnson says a space port in Scotland is under construction or almost complete. He asks someone in the audience to clarify. It is \u201con its way\u201d, he says subsequently. Johnson says Nicola Sturgeon confirmed her plan for Scottish independence in her interview with Andrew Neil last night. This would involve borders at Berwick, and handing back control of Scottish fishing waters to the EU, he claims. Johnson is now speaking French, imagining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s first meeting with Michel Barnier. \u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t really want it, Mr Corbyn?\u201d Johnson speculates about whether \u201cMonsieur Starmer\u201d or \u201cMonsieur McDonnell\u201d or \u201cMadame Abbott\u201d might back it. In Fife, Boris Johnson is still speaking. It\u2019s a rehash of his standard stump speech. He has just used the line about how Jeremy Corbyn supposedly sided with Russia at the time of the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Here is a live feed of the Labour event. More from the Labour race and faith manifesto launch in London. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has posted these in the last few minutes. Johnson says the climate change conference is coming to Glasgow next week. That is happening because Scotland is in the United Kingdom, he says. Boris Johnson is speaking at the Scottish launch now. He says he did not want a general election, but parliament was blocking Brexit. He has a deal ready to go, he says. But he says Jeremy Corbyn would hold a second referendum. And Corbyn won\u2019t say how he would vote in a second referendum. It is the only time in history someone has stood for PM without saying how they would vote on the most important issue of the day, he claims. This is from ITV\u2019s Peter MacMahon. Boris Johnson has repeated the same mixed metaphors and rhetorical flourishes in his preface to the Scottish Tories election manifesto that he used in the UK manifesto on Sunday, somewhat tweaked for Scottish voters. Alluding to more than 12 years of Scottish National party rule at Holyrood, Johnson asserts: For the last decade Scotland has been trapped, like a lion in a cage. You have been like some super-green supercar blocked in the traffic. You can see the way ahead. You know where you want to go \u2013 and you know why you are stuck. You have been paralysed by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, who simply refuse to accept your decision to keep our United Kingdom together. And that is why this election is so essential. The Scottish Tory manifesto puts blocking a second independence referendum in the foreground. Johnson repeats his usual tropes, insisting a Tory government would defend and protect the \u201cawesome foursome\u201d of nations which make up the UK. Unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson writes, who is plotting to stage a second referendum with Sturgeon, \u201cI can guarantee that we will reject any request from the SNP government to hold an independence referendum. There will be no negotiation \u2013 we will mark that letter return to sender and be done with it.\u201d Jackson Carlaw, the acting leader of the Scottish Conservatives, is speaking at the launch now. He urges Labour unionists to back the Tories at this election, saying the Conservatives are best placed to oppose the SNP plans for independence. Boris Johnson is about to speak at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Fife. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog shortly. From the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield says it seems that journalists won\u2019t be able to ask any questions at the launch of the Labour race and faith manifesto this morning. Boris Johnson is launching the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 manifesto in Fife this morning. This is from the Herald\u2019s Tom Gordon. From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, has written an interesting article on current polling for the Article. He has been using YouGov data to look at how opinion has shifted since 2015 and he says \u201cBrexit has completely transformed Britain\u2019s political landscape, by prompting millions of voters to rethink their politics and their party loyalties\u201d. His main point is that, although there has been a 9.5 swing from Tories to Labour among remain voters since 2015, the Labour to Tory swing among leave voters over the same period is double that. Kellner thinks \u201ca Conservative landslide is not inevitable; but it is certainly possible\u201d. He explains: Taking account of the figures in the table above, I reckon that current voting intentions could result in swings of around 8% to the Conservatives in leave seats defended by Labour. Overall the Tories would capture 71 Labour seats if they achieved such a swing everywhere. However, 15 of these seats voted remain. That leaves 56 Labour marginals that voted leave. If we assume the Tories lose around 20 seats to the SNP and Liberal Democrats (without tactical voting, their losses may be fewer), and gains 56 seats from Labour, then Boris Johnson ends up with a majority of 65 (assuming Sinn F\u00e9in MPs stay away from parliament). It would not take much for the Tories to do significantly better than that. Labour has 90 seats vulnerable to a 10% swing. Of these, 70 voted leave. If the Conservatives gain all these, their majority approaches 100. The Electoral Commission has published information about donations to political parties in the third quarter of 2019. This is not the same as the information about donations received during the election campaign period. That data is published weekly, and the first of those reports came out last week. In total more than \u00a319m was donated to political parties in July, August and September (the third quarter). The Conservatives received the most, \u00a35.8m in total, followed by Labour (\u00a35.5m), the Brexit party (\u00a33.4m) and the Liberal Democrats (\u00a33.3m). The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has described the chief rabbi\u2019s intervention (see 6.15am, 7.50am, 9.41am and 10.20am) as \u201chugely worrying\u201d. She said: I think it is hugely worrying that the chief rabbi has felt compelled to make such an intervention in an election. It speaks volumes about the genuine fear that people in the Jewish community feel about Jeremy Corbyn and his inability to tackle antisemitism in the Labour party. I think all of us whatever our religion, or none, whatever our race, we should take very seriously the concerns of a community within our country that is genuinely feeling unsafe. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, has told Sky News that he thinks Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, was wrong in what he said in a Times article about antisemitism being entrenched in Labour. McDonald said: It is a serious intervention. It is a reminder of the hurt that has been caused to the Jewish community by the instances of antisemitism within the party and broader than that. I really do take issue with the conclusions the chief rabbi has raised about the character and nature of the party and indeed Jeremy Corbyn, who has devoted his life to fight racism of all kinds. People come into the Labour party to fight racism in all its manifestations and it is upsetting, to say the least, to find ourselves trying to deal with these small number of incidents. We are a huge movement and this represents a tiny fraction of our membership. Nevertheless it is serious and it has to be dealt with head on. The Mirvis Times article is here (paywall). And here is an extract. The Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism. Even as they received threats, the response of the Labour leadership was utterly inadequate. We have endured quibbling and prevarication over whether the party should adopt the most widely accepted definition of antisemitism. Now we await the outcome of a formal investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into whether discrimination by the party against Jews has become an institutional problem. And all of this while in opposition. What should we expect of them in government? The Labour peer Lord Dubs was on the Today programme this morning responding to the claims from the chief rabbi that Jeremy Corbyn has allowed antisemitism to take root in his party. Dubs, who arrived in the UK in 1939 as a refugee from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, said he respected Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, but thought he was wrong on this. Dubs said: I think, I have a lot of respect for the chief rabbi, I\u2019ve co-operated with him on campaigns on behalf of child refugees, I\u2019ve spoken to him in many synagogues and I\u2019ve got a lot of positive feeling about the Jewish community, but I think today the chief rabbi has gone too far \u2026 I think the Labour party has been much too slow in getting to grips with this, and I\u2019ve been critical of the Labour party over the last two or three years, but I feel we are getting there, and I want to look at it from the point of view of where we are today and moving forward. Asked if he thought Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, Dubs replied: I think he is, yes, I think he is fit to be prime minister. I do not believe he is antisemitic. I believe things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back. I don\u2019t believe he is personally antisemitic and I believe he will find it very, very hurtful that people accuse him of being antisemitic or racist or Islamophobic. He is none of those things. Asked whether Jewish people should fear a Labour government, Dubs said: I would say you do not have to fear. There are many of us in the Labour party who will ensure that there is no fear for you, and we respect your concerns but let\u2019s move forwards. Here are some of the campaign events in the diary for today. 11.30am: Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto with Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, at an event in Tottenham in London. 12pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, speaks at an event in Barnsley. 3pm: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, gives a speech in Manchester. 7pm: Corbyn is interviewed by Andrew Neil on BBC One. Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, are also doing campaign events, but the timings have not been confirmed yet. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. In an interview with Sky News last night Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service who has been advising the Labour party, suggested that, if Labour needed SNP and Lib Dem support to form a minority government, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s role as party leader could be part of the negotiation. Labour sources are disputing this, but Kerslake said: [Labour] would then need to have conversations with those [minority] parties to really establish on what basis they would give that support. We don\u2019t yet know in truth how that would play out, although the Liberal Democrats have said they could not support a Jeremy-Corbyn-led Labour government and the SNP have said they would want a second referendum. All of that, no doubt, would form part of the conversation that Labour would be having informally with those two parties. In his Today interview this morning Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, also hinted that the DUP could rethink its opposition to Labour if Corbyn were to be replaced as leader. The DUP had a confidence and supply arrangement with Theresa May. But now it finds itself isolated because Boris Johnson is proposing a Brexit deal that would in effect create a customs border down the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable to unionists. Asked who the DUP wanted to win the election, Donaldson replied: Well, that\u2019s a matter for the electorate, but clearly we\u2019ve stated we believe a Corbyn-led Labour government would be disastrous for the UK. When it was put to him that his use of the phrase \u201cCorbyn-led Labour government\u201d implied the DUP might take a different view of a Labour government led by someone else, and when he was asked if the DUP could \u201cdo business\u201d with such a government, Donaldson replied: Of course, it would depend what their platform was. We would have to look at that very carefully. Asked if the DUP could support Labour\u2019s plan for a second referendum featuring two options, remain and a leave option, Donaldson did not rule this out. \u201cWell, we\u2019d need to see what the deal was, of course,\u201d he replied. I\u2019m not going to commit myself to something at this stage that is entirely hypothetical. But clearly there isn\u2019t a single major party in Northern Ireland that supports the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal and that\u2019s a major problem for us because, if this deal is imposed, I believe it will create further instability, and we certainly don\u2019t need that. Political parties tend to react very badly to other parties telling them who they should have as leader, and it is hard to imagine Labour ditching Corbyn just to win parliamentary support from the Lib Dems or the DUP. But there is some sort of precedent for gestures of this kind. After the 2010 general election Gordon Brown announced that he would quit before the end of the year in the hope that this might make the Lib Dems more willing to form a pact with Labour. (Of course, it didn\u2019t.) Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips has appeared to advise the party\u2019s leadership on how to respond to the chief rabbi Ephraim Mervis\u2019 intervention. Michael Gove has said he feels a \u201ccertain sense of sadness\u201d about Michael Heseltine\u2019s views on the Conservative party. However, he said he \u201crespectfully disagreed\u201d with the peer on Europe and described him as a \u201clongtime advocate\u201d of further integration with the EU. Gove then said Heseltine was wrong to advise people to vote Liberal Democrat. I think that the most important thing at this general election is the choice between the two alternative prime ministers \u2013 Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 and I think that Boris would undoubtedly ensure that we got Brexit done and avoid the dangers of two referendums, whereas Jeremy Corbyn, as we know by the words of the chief rabbi today, poses a threat to more than just our economy. On the chance of securing a trade deal, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster said: First of all, we\u2019ve heard this scepticism before. It\u2019s the sort of default position of many commentators. It\u2019s also the case that we have a political declaration which accompanies the withdrawal agreement that sets out the broad structure of the agreement that we\u2019d want, and it\u2019s pretty clear the sort of agreement that would work in the EU\u2019s interests and the UK\u2019s interests. It would be a free trade agreement with friendly co-operation \u2013 co-operation on security, on science and on education. Pressed on whether services would have access to the EU freely, Gove said: Well, at the moment we do not have a single market in services even within the European Union. Asked whether services would be better or worse than at present, he added: It would depend on the individual sector. But I think what we are likely to get, and I think this is certainly what Europe wants as well, is a no tariffs, no quotas, no quantitative restrictions as part of that free trade agreement. The DUP parliamentary candidate Jeffrey Donaldson has warned that the Tory Brexit deal would \u201cdestabilise Northern Ireland\u2019s relationship with the rest of the UK\u201d and be \u201cdisadvantageous\u201d to the Northern Ireland economy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: Clearly there isn\u2019t a single major party in Northern Ireland that supports the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal, and that\u2019s a major problem for us because if this deal is imposed, I believe it will create further instability and we certainly don\u2019t need that. We believe the prime minister needs to look again at this idea of creating a border in the Irish Sea. He reiterated that a Corbyn-led Labour government would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the UK and said the party would look \u201cvery carefully\u201d at joining forces with a Labour government that its current leader was not involved in. Conservative party grandee Michael Heseltine has urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats to stop Brexit being delivered by Boris Johnson. Speaking last night alongside former Tory MPs David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, Heseltine was reported to have said: I\u2019m telling them to vote for what they believe and what the Conservative party has stood for all my life and certainly all of theirs \u2013 and to put country first. And what I think that means in practical terms is they either vote for the defrocked Conservative candidates, of which we have three excellent examples here, or they vote Lib Dem. On BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, the former deputy prime minster asserted that Jeremy Corbyn had no chance of becoming prime minister and that \u201ctraditional reds under the beds\u201d scares came about in every election. The 86-year-old former deputy prime minster said a more pressing question was whether Corbyn would be leader of the Labour party by Christmas, though he appeared to urge people against voting for the Tories. Anyone who might form a temporary coalition will insist that it\u2019s not Jeremy Corbyn. The real issue is what is at stake. It is the prosperity and world influence of this country. Our relationships with our neighbours in Europe. This is transcendently the overarching issue at stake in this election and I cannot vote or support people who are going to make this country poorer and less influential. The peer has long supported a second referendum, due to the lies made during the 2016 vote by influential Brexit supporters. He recognised that the Liberal Democrats \u2013 with their \u201dStop Brexit\u201d pledge \u2013 are not going to win the election, although he is voting for the party, and warned of the consequences of Johnson winning a majority. It\u2019s complete nonsense to suggest that [Brexit] can be done by Christmas. All you can do by Christmas is to pass legislation to enter into negotiations. It\u2019s preposterous. We are in for another year of uncertainty and a possibility of a no-deal exit at the end of it. That\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re facing if Mr Johnson gets an overall majority. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said nobody can afford to be \u201ccomplacent\u201d about antisemitism, reiterating that political parties must avoid worsening a \u201cperception of fear\u201d and calling on them to offer reassurances. The cross-bench peer Rabbi Julia Neuberger has said the UK could become a less comfortable place for Jews to live if Jeremy Corbyn came to power. She said she agreed with the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, that the Jewish community is gripped by anxiety ahead of the general election due to an \u201cunwillingness\u201d of the Labour leadership to tackle a creeping \u201cinsidious antisemitic tone\u201d. \u201cPeople in the Jewish community have seen that unwillingness and asked what is going on, why are they not gripping it?\u201d she asked. The interviewer cited recent polls suggesting 87% of Jews believe Corbyn is antisemitic and almost half would consider emigrating from the UK if he became prime minister, to which Neuberger replied: I think the anxiety is that if in opposition Jeremy Corbyn and his top team do not tackle the antisemitism which has for instance been shown against Labour MPs. If they\u2019re not willing to tackle that, apologise for it and sympathise then something is going very wrong. A political party where some of its MPs leave because of antisemitic taunting, and still cannot deal with it, makes people feel very uncomfortable. The other part of it is what you see on social media, people who claim to be Corbyn supporters saying the most appalling things about Jews. The author said that although UK remains a good place to live as a Jew, that is shifting and if Labour under Corbyn comes to power then \u201cthis comfortable place to live may become less comfortable\u201d. People will look for ways of moving or having a place somewhere else, or whatever they can possibly do to mitigate what feels oppressive, uncomfortable, dangerous. Asked why non-Jews potentially more concerned with austerity and benefit cuts should care enough to not vote Labour, Neuberger said: \u201cIf a section of the population is feeling uncomfortable because of racism, that is serious.\u201d The former Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Ian Austin have spoken out in support of the condemnation of Jeremy Corbyn from the UK\u2019s chief rabbi of the UK. The papers Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s former envoy to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has issued a scathing verdict of the government\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic amateurism\u201d, saying Boris Johnson is sowing the seeds of \u201cthe biggest crisis of Brexit to date\u201d. In a lecture in Glasgow, Rogers said Johnson was repeating Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrategy errors\u201d and would soon find himself \u201cunwisely\u201d boxed in by his campaign promises. Labour accused of \u2018poison sanctioned from the top\u2019 by chief rabbi The chief rabbi has accused Jeremy Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d to take root in Labour, saying Jews are justifiably anxious about the prospect of the party forming the next government. Ephraim Mirvis, the spiritual leader of the UK\u2019s 62 orthodox synagogues, made the rare political intervention on the day that the Labour party is planning to unveil its race and faith manifesto in Tottenham this morning. Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler will attend. Writing for the Times, Mirvis said it was not his place to tell people how to vote but argued that the way in which the Labour leadership had dealt with anti-Jewish racism was \u201cincompatible with the British values of which we are so proud \u2013 of dignity and respect for all people\u201d and that in this election the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d was at stake. Labour has always strongly denied any suggestion that Corbyn has failed to get to grips with allegations of antisemitism in Labour, pointing to his record as an anti-racist campaigner and moves to overhaul the party\u2019s complaints process. The rabbi wrote: \u201cThe party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party.\u201d Good morning politics early birds, welcome to our rolling coverage of the day\u2019s news and today, we\u2019re talking about money. The huge gap in the spending promises of the two major parties is the main topic of debate today, after it emerged that Labour was committing 28 times as much in public spending as the Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn defended his multibillion pound general election spending pledge on public services, saying that even with the increased spending of \u00a383bn a year that he has promised, the UK would still spend less on public services than France or Germany. Zoe Williams writes that Labour has outlined its promises, now its job is to make those promises seem real. Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has released analysis showing that child poverty is at risk of rising to a record 60-year high under a Conservative government because its manifesto retains the coalition\u2019s benefit cuts. The analysis says the number of British children living in relative poverty would increase from 29.6% in 2017-18 to 34.5% in 2023-24 under a Boris Johnson-led government. Though it adds that Labour\u2019s \u00a39bn of extra spending on social security would mean 550,000 fewer children in poverty but would not lead to current poverty rates falling.

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

Shortly after, a tribal citizen was assaulted and raped by the non-Native father of her children. Tribal police responded. It was the 20th time they had interacted with the perpetrator, but the first time they had the power to arrest him.</p> <p>According to a report from the National Congress of American Indians, in the five years after the restoration of tribal jurisdiction, 18 tribes had made 143 arrests. 85 of those non-Native defendants accounted for 378 prior contacts with tribal police \u2013 378 calls to tribal police who, at the time, couldn\u2019t do anything in response.</p> <p>But last week, Iowa senator Joni Ernst introduced Senate Republicans\u2019 version of the Violence Against Women Act (Vawa) reauthorization bill. While the legislation includes provisions to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/02/missing-murdered-indigenous-women-deb-haaland\">crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW)</a>, advocates say it rolls back gains made in 2013.</p> <p>Ernst\u2019s proposal, if adopted, would give non-Native abusers who don\u2019t want to comply with tribal laws a way out. The law makes it easier for abusers facing prosecution in tribal court to skip the process and appeal to federal court. The bill also weakens sovereign immunity for tribes by allowing convicted abusers to sue if they feel their civil rights have been violated.</p> <p>According to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, the legislation destabilizes tribal justice systems by imposing \u201cundue burdens and restrictions on tribal courts far beyond those imposed on federal and state courts\u201d including audits by the US attorney general.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s supporting perpetrators more that the victim. It\u2019s allowing perpetrators more ways to get out of their crime,\u201d Parker says.</p> <p>Native women face higher rates of violence than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. A DoJ study found that <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249822.pdf\">97% of Native victims have been abused by somebody who is non-Native</a>. Since the late 1970s, tribes have been prohibited from prosecuting Non-natives for most crimes committed on tribal land. While violent crime trended down nationally in recent decades, in Indian country it has skyrocketed.</p> <p>\u201cWe know where the sexual predators go. They are preying on Native women in numbers that are just offensive because they know that they can commit offenses with impunity,\u201d said Lisa Murkowski, the Republican senator for Alaska, <a href=\"https://www.indianz.com/News/2019/11/21/native-women-political-football-vawa-mmiw.asp\"> at a Senate Indian Affairs committee hearing last Thursday</a>.</p> <p>On the same day Ernst introduced her controversial legislation, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee passed two bills to improve data collection, reporting and police response to missing and murdered Indigenous women. While the legislation had faced political holds up \u2013 Savanna\u2019s Act <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/representative-bob-goodlatte-stalls-on-savannas-act.html\">was blocked from going to a House vote</a> by one lame-duck Republican in 2017 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/01/essential-first-step-congress-moves-to-act-on-crisis-of-violence-against-native-women\">both bills</a> unanimously passed committee with equal support from Republicans and Democrats Thursday.</p> <p>Ernst\u2019s bill is unlikely to pass (Murkowski, notably, has not signed on to it). It has no support from Democrats and only 10 Republican co-sponsors. But advocates worry that the Senate Republican version of Vawa signals the safety of Native women could become a partisan battle. Meanwhile, the landmark 1994 Vawa law <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-life-violence-against-women-act-expired-20190220-story.html\">has been lapsed for nearly a year</a>, affecting funding for domestic abuse programs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is predominantly Republicans who are telling tribal Nations that we are incapable of protecting our people,\u201d says Parker. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with folks from both sides of the aisle but at this time to make it a political game is incredibly harmful.\u201d</p> <p>In April, 33 House Republicans joined Democrats <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/04/politics/house-passes-violence-against-women-act-reauthorization/index.html\">to pass a comprehensive Vawa reauthorization</a>. The house reauthorization bill expands on gains made in 2013 and restores tribal jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators for the crimes of sexual assault, rape, sex trafficking and some instances of child abuse. The bill was introduced with 47 Democrat co-sponsors, but no Republican support.</p> <p>\u201cI am a mom. I want to make sure my daughter isn\u2019t abused,\u201d says Parker. \u201cAnd if we have well supported court systems criminals will know. They will know not to come on our reservations and harm our women.\u201d</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has signed an executive order creating a White House taskforce on missing and murdered indigenous women. The task force will be overseen by William Barr, the attorney general, and interior secretary David Bernhardt. It is tasked with developing protocols to apply to new and unsolved cases and creating a multi-jurisdictional team to review cold cases. Trump on Tuesday called the scourge of violence facing Native American women and girls \u201csobering and heartbreaking\u201d. However, the move comes as Republicans in the Senate want to make it harder for tribes to put non-Native abusers behind bars. The National Institute of Justice estimates that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lifetime, including many who are victims of sexual violence. On some reservations, federal studies have shown women are killed at a rate over 10 times the national average. For years, when Native women were abused on reservations by non-Indians, no legal action would be taken. Deborah Parker\u2019s nation, Tulalip Tribes, was prohibited under federal law from prosecuting or even arresting non-Native perpetrators and the US attorneys who had jurisdiction declined the majority of cases. So in 2013, Parker, a board member of the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center went to Washington DC, spoke with lawmakers, and helped pass legislation that finally meant non-Native abusers would face consequences on her reservation and across the US. After the law changed, Parker\u2019s tribe became one of the first to implement it. Shortly after, a tribal citizen was assaulted and raped by the non-Native father of her children. Tribal police responded. It was the 20th time they had interacted with the perpetrator, but the first time they had the power to arrest him. According to a report from the National Congress of American Indians, in the five years after the restoration of tribal jurisdiction, 18 tribes had made 143 arrests. 85 of those non-Native defendants accounted for 378 prior contacts with tribal police \u2013 378 calls to tribal police who, at the time, couldn\u2019t do anything in response. But last week, Iowa senator Joni Ernst introduced Senate Republicans\u2019 version of the Violence Against Women Act (Vawa) reauthorization bill. While the legislation includes provisions to address the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW), advocates say it rolls back gains made in 2013. Ernst\u2019s proposal, if adopted, would give non-Native abusers who don\u2019t want to comply with tribal laws a way out. The law makes it easier for abusers facing prosecution in tribal court to skip the process and appeal to federal court. The bill also weakens sovereign immunity for tribes by allowing convicted abusers to sue if they feel their civil rights have been violated. According to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, the legislation destabilizes tribal justice systems by imposing \u201cundue burdens and restrictions on tribal courts far beyond those imposed on federal and state courts\u201d including audits by the US attorney general. \u201cIt\u2019s supporting perpetrators more that the victim. It\u2019s allowing perpetrators more ways to get out of their crime,\u201d Parker says. Native women face higher rates of violence than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. A DoJ study found that 97% of Native victims have been abused by somebody who is non-Native. Since the late 1970s, tribes have been prohibited from prosecuting Non-natives for most crimes committed on tribal land. While violent crime trended down nationally in recent decades, in Indian country it has skyrocketed. \u201cWe know where the sexual predators go. They are preying on Native women in numbers that are just offensive because they know that they can commit offenses with impunity,\u201d said Lisa Murkowski, the Republican senator for Alaska, at a Senate Indian Affairs committee hearing last Thursday. On the same day Ernst introduced her controversial legislation, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee passed two bills to improve data collection, reporting and police response to missing and murdered Indigenous women. While the legislation had faced political holds up \u2013 Savanna\u2019s Act was blocked from going to a House vote by one lame-duck Republican in 2017 \u2013 both bills unanimously passed committee with equal support from Republicans and Democrats Thursday. Ernst\u2019s bill is unlikely to pass (Murkowski, notably, has not signed on to it). It has no support from Democrats and only 10 Republican co-sponsors. But advocates worry that the Senate Republican version of Vawa signals the safety of Native women could become a partisan battle. Meanwhile, the landmark 1994 Vawa law has been lapsed for nearly a year, affecting funding for domestic abuse programs. \u201cIt is predominantly Republicans who are telling tribal Nations that we are incapable of protecting our people,\u201d says Parker. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with folks from both sides of the aisle but at this time to make it a political game is incredibly harmful.\u201d In April, 33 House Republicans joined Democrats to pass a comprehensive Vawa reauthorization. The house reauthorization bill expands on gains made in 2013 and restores tribal jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators for the crimes of sexual assault, rape, sex trafficking and some instances of child abuse. The bill was introduced with 47 Democrat co-sponsors, but no Republican support. \u201cI am a mom. I want to make sure my daughter isn\u2019t abused,\u201d says Parker. \u201cAnd if we have well supported court systems criminals will know. They will know not to come on our reservations and harm our women.\u201d Associated Press contributed to this report",

It was the tale of two families\u2019 attempts to raise money for operations and therapies abroad for their children that the NHS does not fund.</p> <p>Teenager Mia has scoliosis and wears a painful, restrictive back brace 23 hours a day. She has a year to wait before she qualifies for the operation to realign and fuse her spine that is the standard NHS treatment for her condition. She and her mother Jo want her to have a new procedure (known as VBT) sooner, in Turkey. It will cost \u00a332,000 and, having reined in the family spending long ago, they now set up a JustGiving page and embark on a fundraising programme full of coffee mornings, sponsored runs and other activities to amass the rest of the sum before Mia\u2019s curvature becomes too pronounced for this operation to help.</p> <p>Six-year-old Pranav has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Last year, the NHS started offering pioneering treatment for some CP patients, with a view to enabling them to walk, but Pranav was considered too severe to benefit.

      "bodyText": "What an extremely odd experience watching Channel 4\u2019s Save My Child was. It was the tale of two families\u2019 attempts to raise money for operations and therapies abroad for their children that the NHS does not fund. Teenager Mia has scoliosis and wears a painful, restrictive back brace 23 hours a day. She has a year to wait before she qualifies for the operation to realign and fuse her spine that is the standard NHS treatment for her condition. She and her mother Jo want her to have a new procedure (known as VBT) sooner, in Turkey. It will cost \u00a332,000 and, having reined in the family spending long ago, they now set up a JustGiving page and embark on a fundraising programme full of coffee mornings, sponsored runs and other activities to amass the rest of the sum before Mia\u2019s curvature becomes too pronounced for this operation to help. Six-year-old Pranav has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Last year, the NHS started offering pioneering treatment for some CP patients, with a view to enabling them to walk, but Pranav was considered too severe to benefit. His parents Usha and Ravi could have the surgery performed privately in the UK, but have decided they want to take him to America, where it can be done by the man who developed the procedure. The operation and the ongoing therapy afterwards will cost \u00a3100,000. So, that\u2019s the set-up. The oddness sets in now, as nothing else happens. The set-up simply plays out. The growing feeling of pointlessness and suspicion of exploitation is the only real difference as the hour wears on. There is no tension or jeopardy. Jo books Mia\u2019s operation before they raise the full \u00a332,000 but will sell her business to meet the target if needs be \u2013 a huge thing for them, of course, but in televisual terms it is useless \u2013 because we will be long gone by the time the fallout from that would be felt. And Usha is not very good at fundraising (people do not appreciate that you need balls of steel to raise money even for the very best cause) and fails to sell enough advance tickets to a Bollywood ball. They change the model to pay-what-you-think-it\u2019s-been-worth-on-the-night and do fine. They are also able to front the bulk of the \u00a3100,000 themselves, which suggests that if push comes to shove they could find the \u00a310,000 still needed with eight weeks to go before Pranav\u2019s operation. There are any number of questions that could have been raised \u2013 and some you could argue absolutely should have been raised, if the show hoped to avoid the queasily manipulative air that hung over the entire hour, refusing to disperse. Such as: how justified are the families in seeking their alternatives?

The last thing I need to do is be a presenter, or have a TV show where I\u2019m playing myself.\u201d His character in Upright does have hints of him: Lucky has the hair, he\u2019s from Perth, and in some of the show\u2019s most moving moments he sings and plays piano too. But while Meg has been forced to speed through adolescence, Lucky is in a state of arrested development: a man-child who has run away from his family and his mistakes and who struggles to work out what exactly to do with this fiercely independent child he\u2019s been thrown in with. Four thousand kilometres is a long time for two people to spend in a car: they banter and scream and swear at each other, toggle with the music, steal wallets, cars, horses. Their relationship evolves as they cross outback landscapes and get into scrapes with locals, always with the whimsical MacGuffin of an old piano trailing behind the ute. And through slowly dropped breadcrumbs, the audience learns more about the Perth Lucky is heading home to, and the home life from which Meg has fled. It\u2019s no surprise the script, which pulls you from laughter to tears in a flash, won at the prestigious Australian Writers\u2019 Guild awards before the show had even screened publicly. This, of course, is Minchin\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d as a songwriter too: lulling you in with funny lyrics before punching you in the gut. \u201cThe idea is for people to laugh and then feel like crying within the shortest possible space of time,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like that about this show. That\u2019s why when people ask \u2018is this a comedy or a drama?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018fuck off, it\u2019s a story!\u2019\u201d The balance is handled deftly by director Matthew Saville, who toed the same \u201cknife\u2019s edge\u201d with Josh Thomas\u2019s quietly devastating dramedy Please Like Me. But they needed a young actor who could pull it off, too. \u201cAround three months into preproduction I remember saying, \u2018This show lives or dies on how good this kid is. We have to find a fucking miracle,\u2019\u201d Minchin says. \u201cAnd in walks Milly.\u201d Alcock, now 19, acted in Pine Gap and Fighting Season, and has a lead role in the upcoming series The Reckoning. Days after she came off that shoot, she got offered the role in Upright; she dropped out of her performing arts school to accept it a week before her HSC trials began. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out on anything,\u201d she says, laughing, as we wait out the weather in Kalgoorlie. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m missing out on a closing chapter \u2026 but I got over that pretty quickly when I started work.\u201d She\u2019d seen Matilda and \u201ckind of\u201d knew Minchin\u2019s name, but avoided Googling him before the chemistry screen test. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to psyche myself out,\u201d she says. Working with Minchin has been \u201cincredible\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s his baby, he wants to make sure that it\u2019s really good, and I really trust he will.\u201d The control-freak side of him made itself felt on set, too. \u201cMatt Saville will give me one note, and Tim will come in and give me the opposite. I kid you not, this happens at least once a day \u2026 [but] I kind of just did what I wanted.\u201d As Meg, Alcock is playing a girl much younger \u2013 but stronger, sassier and wiser than most kids. She can drive a ute, beats bikers at pool; even with unknowable trauma in her past she has a comeback for everything. As well as leaning into the direction, Minchin ended up co-writing on each episode \u2013 along with Taylor, Kate Mulvany and Leon Ford. \u201cI love writing young girls \u2013 and for the record, I thoroughly reject the idea that you can\u2019t write other people\u2019s experiences,\u201d Minchin says. And if Meg\u2019s maturity is a little unbelievable \u2013 if a real kid who survived that much trauma would be \u201cmore vulnerable and more scared\u201d \u2013 he says that\u2019s the point. \u201cThe reason Meg\u2019s worth watching is because she\u2019s a superhero. I haven\u2019t met any five-year-old girls like Matilda, either \u2013 but you bloody well want to watch her.\u201d \u2022 Upright airs in the UK on Sky Atlantic on 28 November, with all episodes available on NOW TV. In Australia, the first two episodes will be broadcast on Fox Showcase on 1 December, when all episodes will be streaming on Foxtel \u2022 Guardian Australia travelled to Kalgoorlie as a guest of Foxtel",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 27 November. Top stories A government push to expand the cashless welfare card faces a Senate roadblock, with key crossbenchers saying they will not consider supporting the legislation until they have completed a \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d over summer. Labor has said it will oppose the card without amendments to make the scheme voluntary, meaning that the government will be forced to rely on crossbench support for the expansion to come into effect. There is no written record of the advice that led to the Biloela family\u2019s detention on Christmas Island. The family haved been held their on their own since the end of August after a court ordered an injunction against the government removing them from Australia back to Sri Lanka. The court will decide if the government has properly considered whether the youngest child, Tharunicaa, is owed protection. The rest of the family have had their claims rejected. China has ambitions to rival the US as the world\u2019s diplomatic superpower with Beijing\u2019s foreign affairs ministry running more embassies and consulates around the world than Washington\u2019s State Department, which still has a quarter of its key positions unfilled. The 2019 Lowy global diplomatic index maps the size and reach of 61 diplomatic networks around the world by embassies, consulates, permanent missions and other diplomatic posts. Tracking all G20 and OECD countries, and most Asian nations, it showed an emerging China rivalling and, numerically at least, surpassing the US, caught \u201cin a period of limbo\u201d. Australia Nineteen South Australian prison guards are attempting to have a coroner removed from investigating the death in custody of an Indigenous man after seven guards lost a bid to avoid giving evidence at the inquest. A controversial Chinese-backed multimillion-dollar tourist development in Tasmania has been blocked by the state\u2019s planning commission, which found the application to rezone 3,000 hectares of agricultural land was not supported by the necessary paperwork. Angus Taylor should stand aside as minister because it\u2019s the right thing to do, writes Katharine Murphy. Taylor, whether innocent or guilty, should have stepped aside from his portfolio, temporarily, as soon as it was confirmed he was facing a police inquiry. Westpac\u2019s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, has rejected the idea more heads need to be lopped from the bank\u2019s board after he, the chief executive Brian Hartzer and a senior non-executive director announced their resignations in the wake of a money laundering and child exploitation scandal. The world Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his belief that there is no place in Labour for antisemitism and vowed it would not be tolerated after claims from the UK chief rabbi that the UK opposition leader has allowed his party to become poisoned with antisemitism. An influential US senator has told the Guardian he is examining the possible hacking of US citizens with technology sold by the NSO Group and other foreign surveillance companies, an issue he said raised \u201cserious national security issues\u201d. The Maltese prime minister\u2019s chief of staff and the country\u2019s tourism minister have resigned in an escalation of the political turmoil surrounding the investigation into the murder of the prominent anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017. Police in Germany have released dramatic CCTV footage of one of two suspects in the Dresden jewellery heist, seen using an axe to smash a display case in the state museum\u2019s Green Vault. Recommended reads Tim Minchin has a lot of emotional investment in Upright, and that\u2019s understandable, writes Steph Harmon. \u201cThe eight-episode TV series, which launches in the UK and Australia this month, is the first project he has led after two major professional heartbreaks (the collapse of a $100m film, and the early closure of a Broadway show) brought him back home from the US, tail between his legs.\u201d Many of us want to refuse urgent medical care for traumatised refugees because we think they might be laughing at us, writes Barri Phatarfod: \u201cWe turn on our televisions at night and see wretched images of grown men crying in a rubble that was once their home, having watched their wives brutalised by soldiers and their infant child smashed beyond recognition. The same empathetic part in all of us that quickly rallies to help bushfire victims cries for the anguish these men must feel and the terror of the women and children. Until they dare to turn up on Australian shores and miraculously become conniving gamers.\u201d Listen How did Westpac wind up in a child exploitation scandal? Last week the financial intelligence agency revealed Westpac had committed 23m breaches of the law by failing to monitor and report suspicious transactions. Ben Butler joins the Full Story podcast to discuss how the scandal unfolded and whether it will finally force Australia\u2019s big four banks to change. Sport Why do so many of New Zealand\u2019s top rugby people not want to coach the All Blacks? asks Matt McIlraith. \u201cIn a word, trust.\u201d The International Olympic Committee has demanded the \u201ctoughest sanctions\u201d against those responsible for deleting positive doping tests held by the Moscow laboratory \u2013 calling the behaviour \u201can attack on the credibility of sport itself and an insult to the sporting movement worldwide\u201d. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a man has been charged with spiking a woman\u2019s drink at a Newtown hotel. Scott Morrison has written a letter to Pamela Anderson \u201crejecting her passionate plea for Australia to help Julian Assange\u201d, the ABC reveals. The Australian details the defence force\u2019s \u201cstrategy to develop hi-tech soldiers and weaponised robots under a new program to \u2018modernise levels of protection and lethality\u2019 for frontline troops\u201d. Coming up Anthony Albanese will address the Australian Council of Social Service conference in Canberra. It\u2019s also the aria Awards tonight. So do you know who Tones and I is? And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 The \u201cworld\u2019s best sushi restaurant\u201d has been stripped of its three Michelin stars. But the decision, which was announced in Tokyo on Tuesday, has nothing to do with the quality of the restaurant\u2019s tuna belly. It is because it is no longer open to the public.

      "bodyText": "Campaigners for US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders have been lending their support to the Labour party, running phone-banking sessions from New York ahead of the general election. The city\u2019s branch of Labour International has been working with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), who have been calling British campaigners with tips on how to encourage people to register to vote and cast a ballot for Labour at the December poll. The DSA endorses and campaigns for Sanders, who is running to be the Democratic presidential candidate for a second time after losing out to Hillary Clinton in 2016. A spokesperson for Momentum, the grassroots Labour campaign group, said: \u201cThis is part of a growing relationship between Bernie, DSA activists and Momentum and Labour members abroad that has included exchanges between the nurses\u2019 unions of the US and the UK to campaign on public health in the US. \u201cMany Labour International and Momentum members have been volunteers on Sanders\u2019 campaign and so the favour\u2019s being returned.\u201d Canvassing sessions run by the US volunteers for Momentum campaigners in the UK on Saturdays are an attempt to support grassroots activism and turn out the vote for Labour. Campaigners from Sanders\u2019 team have previously run election training sessions for activists working on Corbyn\u2019s 2017 election run to try to help direct the huge volume of volunteers the organisation attracts to the right constituencies. They have also shared digital campaigning methods. The Labour International and DSA volunteers have also been running phone-banking sessions from Chicago, Toronto, Louisville and San Francisco. The New York sessions are also being supported by overseas members of the Party of European Socialists, who have helped to source office space for canvassing sessions. In Germany, where there are 16,000 British people registered to vote in the capital, Berlin, volunteers have been canvassing for Labour in bars and cafes as well as speaking to Britons at English-language events and talking to university students. Momentum supporters in Paris have been leafleting Eurostar\u2019s British customers ahead of voter registration closing. New Labour International groups have set up in southern France for the first time this election, with campaigners meeting in cities such as Lyon to try and turn out the expat vote. The international campaigning effort for Labour comes as Momentum claims its work could swing the election. It has encouraged more than 100,000 people to register to vote since the beginning of the campaign through Facebook adverts, including at least 87,000 in marginal constituencies. Of the 101,422 so far who may have registered via Momentum\u2019s voter registration adverts, it claims the majority were younger voters \u2013 below the age of 35 \u2013 in key marginal constituencies. Momentum has been targeting young people in marginals with viral videos such as \u201cWe Don\u2019t Want Your Vote\u201d \u2013 viewed 1.1m times on Facebook \u2013 and \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Vote\u201d. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cAll the polls are based on the assumption that young people and those who haven\u2019t voted before won\u2019t bother turning out.

Background The voter registration deadline of Tuesday 26 November will dictate who can and cannot take part in the 2019 general election. According to the Electoral Reform Society, there have been 3.2 million applications to register since the day the election was called, an average of 114,000 per day. That is up by 38% from the 2.3 million in a similar period before the 2017 election. An estimated 45.8 million people were already registered to vote as of December 2018, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Reality About two-thirds of new applications are from those aged 34 and under. Younger people have been shown in recent polls to be more likely to vote Labour, Liberal Democrat or Green. The polling organisation YouGov said after the 2017 vote that Labour was 47 percentage points ahead among first-time voters (aged 18 and 19), but among those over 70 the Conservatives were 50 percentage points ahead. So does a surge in registrations favour Labour? Not all young people vote. In 2017, turnout among 18- and 19-year-olds was 57%, compared with 84% for the over-70s.

British Jews, he said in an article in the Times, were gripped by a justified anxiety about the prospect of a Corbyn-led government.</p> <p>His comments caused a furore on social media and among politicians campaigning in the election. Some accused Mirvis of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DickMackintosh/status/1199352093548720129\">speaking on behalf of the Israeli government</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/damian_from/status/1199235008382283777\">being an \u201capartheid propagandist\u201d</a>. But for many, the chief rabbi\u2019s comments epitomised their revulsion at the Labour leadership\u2019s failures to deal with accusations of antisemitism.</p> <p>Raymond Simonson, chief executive of JW3, a Jewish cultural centre in north London, said: \u201cI\u2019ve worked in this community my whole career and lived in it my whole life. I can\u2019t remember something like this happening before.</p> <p>\u201cFor the chief rabbi, the most senior religious leader in the UK Jewish community, to come out with something as strong as this is extraordinary. Even if people disagree, the fact he\u2019s moved to say this publicly reflects absolute angst in his heart, soul and mind.</p> <p>\u201cI speak to hundreds of [Jewish] people as part of my job \u2013 Orthodox and Reform, religious and secular, gay and straight \u2013 and I know not everyone thinks the same on this or on any issue. But what I\u2019m hearing again and again is people who have been natural Labour voters reluctantly coming to the conclusion that they can\u2019t vote Labour this time. I guarantee this will be the number one conversation around Shabbat dinner tables this Friday.\u201d</p> <p>Nearly all those the Guardian contacted used the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d to describe Mirvis\u2019s intervention.</p> <p>According to Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, Mirvis would have written his article from a sense of duty. \u201cI think he was right to do it, and I respect him for it. It reflects the deep despair and distress felt by the community, and the absolute failure of a political party with a long history of fighting racism to deal with antisemitism today. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Katz, who chairs the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), said: \u201cSadly Mirvis\u2019s diagnosis is spot on. It\u2019s not just about policies and procedures, but politics and leadership. That\u2019s why the JLM has said, for the first time ever, we\u2019re downing tools in this election. We\u2019re only supporting exceptional [Labour] candidates in exceptional circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>The chief rabbi\u2019s intervention would have resonance among Jews of all backgrounds, he said. \u201cMirvis doesn\u2019t represent all Jews, but Reform Jews like myself will respect what he says. Nobody can claim he is speaking out of turn \u2013 plenty of non-practising Jews feel the same way.\u201d</p> <p>But another Jewish organisation within the party, Jewish Voice for Labour (JVL), said Mirvis\u2019s article was \u201cutterly inappropriate\u201d. Jonathan Rosenhead, a member of the group, added: \u201cAs with all other accusations made, they\u2019re very nearly evidence-free. It\u2019s not an endemic problem. There are antisemites in the Labour party because they\u2019re everywhere. But this country is the safest place in Europe for Jews.</p> <p>\u201cThe media gives one constant narrative. I\u2019ve been in the Labour party since 1961 and I\u2019m still waiting for my first experience [of antisemitism]. The majority of British Jews have been alarmed unnecessarily \u2013 and the chief rabbi has contributed to this.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, 64 senior rabbis from different traditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/16/68-rabbis-labour-chooses-ignore-uk-jewish-community\">signed a letter</a> that said: \u201cAntisemitism within sections of the Labour party has become so severe and widespread that we must speak out with one Jewish voice.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Janner-Klausner, the senior rabbi to Reform Judaism, told the Guardian the issue of antisemitism was core to the nature of British democracy and not only a matter of concern to Jews.</p> <p>She added: \u201cAs Rabbi Mirvis indicated, it is not our place to tell others how to vote. It would be deeply regrettable for 2019 to be remembered only for conversations about antisemitism, and we hope that all issues of racism and discrimination will be considered at this election. We ask that everyone engages with our precious democracy and votes with these concerns in mind.\u201d</p> <p>Another Reform rabbi, Jonathan Romain of the Maidenhead synagogue, said: \u201cUnfortunately, the chief rabbi is totally justified in blaming Jeremy Corbyn for allowing antisemitism to permeate the Labour party. It was never an issue under any previous Labour leader be it Michael Foot on the left, Tony Blair on the right, or Neil Kinnock in the centre.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why I broke the golden rule two weeks ago that religion and politics do not mix, and that clergy in particular should not be engaged in politics. This is not a stance against Labour per se, but against Corbyn-led Labour, and will be abandoned the moment he is no longer at the helm.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on behalf of Liberal Judaism, Rabbi Aaron Goldstein said: \u201c[Mirvis had] spoken with his conscience and echoed the fears that many of us within Liberal Judaism and the Jewish world hear daily. His worries reflect the worries of many of our members and we respect his bravery in stepping into the limelight and drawing attention to a concern that many in the Jewish community hold.</p> <p>\u201cAs Liberal Jews we know the power of being able to vote and the responsibility that comes with that power. There are many issues that need to be considered when casting our ballot, we would urge all to vote with their conscience and use their vote wisely.\u201d</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JewsAgainstBoJo/status/1199103817499004940\">Jews Against Boris tweeted</a>: \u201cThe chief rabbi is absolutely right when he says the soul of our nation is at stake. Boris Johnson is appealing to the far right in his bid to secure power, and we must do everything in our power to stop him.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that the only alternative to a Labour victory next month is a Conservative one. We understand why so many in our community feel unable to vote for the Labour party, however we must not make the mistake of thinking the Conservatives are a safer alternative.\u201d</p> <p>The Jewish author Michael Rosen also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelRosenYes/status/1199268907888058368\">took to Twitter</a> to point out that the chief rabbi had not drawn attention to antisemitism in the Conservative party. \u201cThere should be consistency across the whole political field,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIs the chief rabbi interested in combating antisemitism anywhere and everywhere?\u201d<br></p>",

      "body": "<p>Jofra Archer heads into the second Test against New Zealand on Thursday after the toughest week of his fledgling international career and with an already bright spotlight on him having increased as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/25/cricketer-jofra-archer-says-he-was-racially-abuse-during-england-nz-test\" title=\"\">reporting racial abuse</a>.</p> <p>New Zealand Cricket was still investigating the incident on Tuesday after Archer tweeted that he had been the target of a racial slur from a spectator at the back end of England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/25/england-resistance-ends-as-new-zealand-wrap-up-crushing-first-test-win\" title=\"\">innings-and-65-run defeat</a> in Mount Maunganui. David White, the NZC chief executive, met Archer after the tourists arrived in Hamilton to apologise and has promised the culprit a lifetime ban from attending cricket matches, as well as police involvement.</p> <p>Writing in his latest column for the Daily Mail, Archer insisted he had \u201cmoved on\u201d from the incident but reiterated his disappointed that it had occurred in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m over it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I found the incident a real shame. When you come to another country, you half expect fans to have a go at your cricket. If someone wants to shout at me and tell me I\u2019m bowling badly, that\u2019s fine. I may not agree but it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s part of the experience of being a touring cricketer. To hear racism, though \u2014 that\u2019s another matter. There is no time or place for it in any walk of life, let alone cricket.\u201d</p> <p>For a young fast bowler also recovering from sending down a gruelling 42 overs for one wicket on a flat pitch, and told off by the England team management earlier in the week for riding on a TV camera operator\u2019s Segway, this could be an overwhelming first overseas tour. But Archer\u2019s head coach at Sussex, Jason Gillespie, though incensed by news of the abuse, expects the 24-year-old to cope with the additional attention when the two-match series resumes at Seddon Park.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d like to think in 2019 that sort of nonsense is well and truly in the past \u2013 it\u2019s just absolute bullshit,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad and I feel for Jofra. No player should have to put up with that. It is good to see New Zealand are acting swiftly.</p> <p>\u201cJofra wouldn\u2019t have put it on Twitter if he wasn\u2019t upset about it. Players don\u2019t have to call a press conference to get their message out there, they can do it instantly. And it deserves to be called out for the crap that it is.</p> <p>\u201cBut I am confident he will be able to handle this, put it to one side and still deliver [in the Test this week]. Not that he should have to be doing that in the first place, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, lives within walking distance of Bay Oval and intends to speak with Archer at training this week to similarly apologise \u201con behalf of Kiwis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Williamson did not hear the abuse, which Archer said came while walking off the field when dismissed during England\u2019s second innings, but told <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/black-caps/117708854/kane-williamson-condemns-racist-spectator-comments-apologises-to-jofra-archer\" title=\"\">stuff.co.nz</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific thing. In a country and a setting where it is very much multicultural, it\u2019s something we need to put to bed quickly and hope nothing like that ever happens again. It certainly won\u2019t if there\u2019s any influence we can have on it.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a whirlwind first year for Archer in international cricket. A British passport holder born in Barbados, he qualified for England duty in March after serving three years of residency and went on to play a starring role during the World Cup win and the Ashes.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/08/england-australia-retain-ashes-fourth-test-day-five-report\" title=\"\">the Old Trafford Test</a> two supporters were ejected for reportedly shouting \u201cshow us your passport\u201d and Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, has said the players will \u201crally round\u201d Archer after this latest incident. When Giles was asked more broadly if, amid this meteoric rise, he was confident the team environment was successfully supporting a player from a different background, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely. And that\u2019s an ongoing discussion for us.</p> <p>\u201cCulturally, he is different. We all are, to a degree. The teammates have to respect each other. Teammates have to respect where Jofra is, and Jof has to respect where his teammates are.</p> <p>\u201cThe point about that rise, we\u2019re expecting a hell of a lot from a young bloke \u2013 to run in and bowl 95mph every day. It\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019ve got to help him through that.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this tempering of expectations Joe Root, the Test captain, said after the defeat on Monday, before he learned about the off-field abuse, that Archer needed to \u201cunleash a little bit more\u201d and \u201cmake sure every spell counts\u201d.</p> <p>Asked if the management was mindful that on-field effort might be a perception issue, given differences in background, Giles replied: \u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019re all different. We all need different management styles \u2013 the carrot and stick will work differently. Jof is gold for us and we have got to look after him. But we have to be careful how much we think we\u2019re going to get out of him every day. And on a pitch that placid, it was pretty hard work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/25/abuse-jofra-archer-racism-ingrained-in-cricket\">Abuse of Jofra Archer a reminder that racism remains ingrained in cricket | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the subject of Archer\u2019s pace at Bay Oval, which only fleetingly went above 90mph amid the heavy workload, Gillespie explained how it was not always simply a case of effort producing desired outcome. \u201cThere would be days in my career where I didn\u2019t think the ball was coming out well and the speed-gun said I was over 140kph [87mph], then others when I felt quick and it was 135kph.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Jofra is more than just pace.

      "bodyText": "Jofra Archer heads into the second Test against New Zealand on Thursday after the toughest week of his fledgling international career and with an already bright spotlight on him having increased as a result of reporting racial abuse. New Zealand Cricket was still investigating the incident on Tuesday after Archer tweeted that he had been the target of a racial slur from a spectator at the back end of England\u2019s innings-and-65-run defeat in Mount Maunganui. David White, the NZC chief executive, met Archer after the tourists arrived in Hamilton to apologise and has promised the culprit a lifetime ban from attending cricket matches, as well as police involvement. Writing in his latest column for the Daily Mail, Archer insisted he had \u201cmoved on\u201d from the incident but reiterated his disappointed that it had occurred in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m over it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I found the incident a real shame. When you come to another country, you half expect fans to have a go at your cricket. If someone wants to shout at me and tell me I\u2019m bowling badly, that\u2019s fine. I may not agree but it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s part of the experience of being a touring cricketer. To hear racism, though \u2014 that\u2019s another matter. There is no time or place for it in any walk of life, let alone cricket.\u201d For a young fast bowler also recovering from sending down a gruelling 42 overs for one wicket on a flat pitch, and told off by the England team management earlier in the week for riding on a TV camera operator\u2019s Segway, this could be an overwhelming first overseas tour. But Archer\u2019s head coach at Sussex, Jason Gillespie, though incensed by news of the abuse, expects the 24-year-old to cope with the additional attention when the two-match series resumes at Seddon Park. \u201cYou\u2019d like to think in 2019 that sort of nonsense is well and truly in the past \u2013 it\u2019s just absolute bullshit,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad and I feel for Jofra. No player should have to put up with that. It is good to see New Zealand are acting swiftly. \u201cJofra wouldn\u2019t have put it on Twitter if he wasn\u2019t upset about it. Players don\u2019t have to call a press conference to get their message out there, they can do it instantly. And it deserves to be called out for the crap that it is. \u201cBut I am confident he will be able to handle this, put it to one side and still deliver [in the Test this week]. Not that he should have to be doing that in the first place, of course.\u201d Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, lives within walking distance of Bay Oval and intends to speak with Archer at training this week to similarly apologise \u201con behalf of Kiwis\u201d. Williamson did not hear the abuse, which Archer said came while walking off the field when dismissed during England\u2019s second innings, but told stuff.co.nz: \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific thing. In a country and a setting where it is very much multicultural, it\u2019s something we need to put to bed quickly and hope nothing like that ever happens again. It certainly won\u2019t if there\u2019s any influence we can have on it.\u201d It has been a whirlwind first year for Archer in international cricket. A British passport holder born in Barbados, he qualified for England duty in March after serving three years of residency and went on to play a starring role during the World Cup win and the Ashes. At the Old Trafford Test two supporters were ejected for reportedly shouting \u201cshow us your passport\u201d and Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, has said the players will \u201crally round\u201d Archer after this latest incident. When Giles was asked more broadly if, amid this meteoric rise, he was confident the team environment was successfully supporting a player from a different background, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely. And that\u2019s an ongoing discussion for us. \u201cCulturally, he is different. We all are, to a degree. The teammates have to respect each other. Teammates have to respect where Jofra is, and Jof has to respect where his teammates are. \u201cThe point about that rise, we\u2019re expecting a hell of a lot from a young bloke \u2013 to run in and bowl 95mph every day. It\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019ve got to help him through that.\u201d Despite this tempering of expectations Joe Root, the Test captain, said after the defeat on Monday, before he learned about the off-field abuse, that Archer needed to \u201cunleash a little bit more\u201d and \u201cmake sure every spell counts\u201d. Asked if the management was mindful that on-field effort might be a perception issue, given differences in background, Giles replied: \u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019re all different. We all need different management styles \u2013 the carrot and stick will work differently. Jof is gold for us and we have got to look after him. But we have to be careful how much we think we\u2019re going to get out of him every day. And on a pitch that placid, it was pretty hard work.\u201d On the subject of Archer\u2019s pace at Bay Oval, which only fleetingly went above 90mph amid the heavy workload, Gillespie explained how it was not always simply a case of effort producing desired outcome. \u201cThere would be days in my career where I didn\u2019t think the ball was coming out well and the speed-gun said I was over 140kph [87mph], then others when I felt quick and it was 135kph. \u201cAnd Jofra is more than just pace. He has a lot to offer. England will take time learning how best to utilise him, and there will be times when he has to be flexible too. He\u2019s a great learner, who listens.\u201d",

This will be the case in the lead-up to the second Test in Hamilton, with the assistants Graham Thorpe and Paul Collingwood then due take on additional team duties in supporting Root off the field once Silverwood departs. Giles said: \u201cI think Joe is still going to wear it. You do. You\u2019re captain. You wear the pressures and worries and take it personally. But I feel the relationship [with Silverwood] is going very well \u2013 that\u2019s the feedback I\u2019m getting.\u201d Among the few plus points for England during five punishing days at Bay Oval was the batting of Joe Denly even if, like Rory Burns and Ben Stokes, the No 3 made it past 50 without being able to turn hard work into anything like the kind of match-defining score that BJ Watling \u2013 205 in 11 hours \u2013 was able to muster. Denly soaked up 323 balls across his two innings for scores of 74 and 35, looked solid at the crease and with a half-century in each of his past four Tests there are signs that the 33\u2011year\u2011old can crack this late tilt at international cricket. The right-hander says he has bought into the team\u2019s new desire to bat long but has also outlined the challenge this presents: with first-class cricket having moved to the margins of summer in recent years he believes the pitches, allied with the Dukes ball, are not conducive to such an approach. \u201cIt becomes a habit, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Denly. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well saying we need to go on and get these big scores. But if it is not something you\u2019re used to doing then it\u2019s not quite as easy as that. Hopefully we can help our young batters by producing some better wickets for them to go on and get those big scores. \u201cHaving played quite a lot of first\u2011class cricket, certainly the last few years it has been very tough as a top\u2011order batter. Going back to when I first started, the benchmark for a season would be 1,200-plus runs. Some players were scoring 1,500 or 1,600. You don\u2019t see that any more. I think 1,000 runs is a pretty good season.\u201d After 201 overs in the field England are waiting to see how their bowlers perform in training before deciding on any changes to the XI. But New Zealand are likely to require one switch after Trent Boult sustained a side strain.",

Having said on 29 November that he would stay in the job until the investigation into the murder&nbsp;was complete, on 1 December in a televised address he announced that he would stay on until a new leader of his ruling Labour party was elected in January. The prime minister expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d for Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder and spoke of the need for a \u201cfresh page\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Evidence later emerged that those companies were due to receive payments from a third shell company belonging to a well-known businessman.

Labour won by a landslide but the victory did not quell Malta\u2019s political unrest. Five months later, Caruana Galizia died after her rental car exploded and spun into a field near her home in the village of Bidnija.</p> \n<p>Tuesday\u2019s ministerial departures followed a five-hour cabinet meeting, during which Muscat came under pressure from members of his party, including the deputy prime minister, to cut loose those in his circle associated with the Caruana Galizia story.</p> \n<p>Muscat won the unanimous backing of his parliamentary party in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2019-11-25/local-news/BREAKING-PL-parliamentary-group-in-unanimous-vote-of-confidence-in-Prime-Minister-6736216656\">vote on Monday</a>, but the prime minister is now battling for his political survival. He faces pressure not just from within his own party but from politicians and campaigners across Europe.

He had spent the morning being questioned at police headquarters. Schembri has headed Muscat\u2019s office since the 2013 general election, which swept the Mediterranean nation\u2019s Labour party to power after two decades in opposition. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Cardona was questioned by police in connection with Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder on Saturday. In a statement, he said he was suspending himself \u201cfollowing a discussion with the prime minister\u201d. \u201cDr Cardona declares that he has absolutely no connection with the case, but after police had asked for further clarifications, he feels duty bound to take this step in the national interest,\u201d said the statement.</p> \n<p>Muscat left Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting without making a statement. The prime minister was bundled into his car by bodyguards as furious protesters shouted, among them Caruana Galizia\u2019s sister Helene Asciak, who ran behind the vehicle before breaking down in tears.</p> \n<p>European leaders are urging Muscat to step back and allow the judicial process to take its course away from the political arena. While the chief of police has made no public statements, the prime minister has been giving daily briefings in Maltese and English since a breakthrough in the inquiry last week.</p> \n<p>Manfred Weber, the leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, said Muscat faced \u201ca lot of additional questions\u201d following the resignation of his chief of staff. \u201cThe prime minister has to take over his political responsibility when it is about his cabinet,\u201d Weber said. Describing the situation in Malta as worrying, he called on the Maltese authorities to clarify the situation \u201cin the upcoming hours\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cb034a7eb636d8d0b452602ba46a05bcba4c014\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cb034a7eb636d8d0b452602ba46a05bcba4c014/0_82_2456_1473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The late Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia outside the Libyan Embassy in Malta on 6 April 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The late Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia outside the Libyan embassy in Malta on 6 April 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The European council\u2019s special rapporteur on Malta, Pieter Omtzigt, who is monitoring the situation, published a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PieterOmtzigt/status/1199342972325679105\">letter</a> in which he urged Muscat to distance himself from proceedings. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe suspicions of Mr Muscat having a personal and political interest in the investigation are too strong for him to be involved with it,\u201d Omtzigt wrote in a letter to Malta\u2019s justice minister.</p> \n<p>A coalition of press freedom organisations, including Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International, issued a joint statement, saying \u201cthe whole truth\u201d must emerge.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are concerned that the prime minister, by placing himself at the centre of the investigation, raises the spectre of undue executive interference in the investigation. The financial interests of Muscat\u2019s cabinet present the serious possibility of a conflict of interest for the prime minister with regard to the investigation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked on Tuesday morning whether he would now consider his own position, Muscat said: \u201cI have always said I don\u2019t intend seeking re-election. I don\u2019t intend to serve more than two terms. My role right now is to make sure that we navigate through this turbulent time in the best possible manner.

      "bodyText": "The future of Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, hangs in the balance after his chief of staff and two ministers stepped down in rapid succession amid controversy over the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The ministerial departures on Tuesday followed a series of arrests in the hunt for those behind the assassination of Caruana Galizia, a renowned investigative reporter who was killed by a car bomb near her home in October 2017. The resignations of the chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the tourism minister, Konrad Mizzi, were immediately followed by an announcement that the economy minister, Chris Cardona, was suspending himself. All three men have denied wrongdoing. The departures came almost four years after Caruana Galizia used a leak of offshore information, known as the Panama Papers, to reveal that Schembri and Mizzi, who was then energy minister, had become the beneficiaries of secretive Panama shell companies shortly after assuming office. Evidence later emerged that those companies were due to receive payments from a third shell company belonging to a well-known businessman. All those allegedly involved deny any allegations of impropriety. The journalist\u2019s revelations triggered a snap general election in 2017. Labour won by a landslide but the victory did not quell Malta\u2019s political unrest. Five months later, Caruana Galizia died after her rental car exploded and spun into a field near her home in the village of Bidnija. Tuesday\u2019s ministerial departures followed a five-hour cabinet meeting, during which Muscat came under pressure from members of his party, including the deputy prime minister, to cut loose those in his circle associated with the Caruana Galizia story. Muscat won the unanimous backing of his parliamentary party in a vote on Monday, but the prime minister is now battling for his political survival. He faces pressure not just from within his own party but from politicians and campaigners across Europe. His deputy, Chris Fearne, has described the damage from the scandal as \u201calmost irreparable\u201d. Mizzi emerged from the prime minister\u2019s office at Auberge de Castille, in Valletta, just after 3pm on Tuesday to announce his resignation. \u201cIn light of the extraordinary circumstances and the general sentiment in the country, I personally feel that the right thing to do at this moment in time is for me to step down,\u201d he said. He denied the corruption allegations against him, saying he had \u201cnot done anything wrong from a criminal point of view\u201d. His departure came as police conducted a search of Schembri\u2019s home in the north of the island. He had spent the morning being questioned at police headquarters. Schembri has headed Muscat\u2019s office since the 2013 general election, which swept the Mediterranean nation\u2019s Labour party to power after two decades in opposition. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Cardona was questioned by police in connection with Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder on Saturday. In a statement, he said he was suspending himself \u201cfollowing a discussion with the prime minister\u201d. \u201cDr Cardona declares that he has absolutely no connection with the case, but after police had asked for further clarifications, he feels duty bound to take this step in the national interest,\u201d said the statement. Muscat left Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting without making a statement. The prime minister was bundled into his car by bodyguards as furious protesters shouted, among them Caruana Galizia\u2019s sister Helene Asciak, who ran behind the vehicle before breaking down in tears. European leaders are urging Muscat to step back and allow the judicial process to take its course away from the political arena. While the chief of police has made no public statements, the prime minister has been giving daily briefings in Maltese and English since a breakthrough in the inquiry last week. Manfred Weber, the leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, said Muscat faced \u201ca lot of additional questions\u201d following the resignation of his chief of staff. \u201cThe prime minister has to take over his political responsibility when it is about his cabinet,\u201d Weber said. Describing the situation in Malta as worrying, he called on the Maltese authorities to clarify the situation \u201cin the upcoming hours\u201d. The European council\u2019s special rapporteur on Malta, Pieter Omtzigt, who is monitoring the situation, published a letter in which he urged Muscat to distance himself from proceedings. \u201cThe suspicions of Mr Muscat having a personal and political interest in the investigation are too strong for him to be involved with it,\u201d Omtzigt wrote in a letter to Malta\u2019s justice minister. A coalition of press freedom organisations, including Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International, issued a joint statement, saying \u201cthe whole truth\u201d must emerge. \u201cWe are concerned that the prime minister, by placing himself at the centre of the investigation, raises the spectre of undue executive interference in the investigation. The financial interests of Muscat\u2019s cabinet present the serious possibility of a conflict of interest for the prime minister with regard to the investigation.\u201d Asked on Tuesday morning whether he would now consider his own position, Muscat said: \u201cI have always said I don\u2019t intend seeking re-election. I don\u2019t intend to serve more than two terms. My role right now is to make sure that we navigate through this turbulent time in the best possible manner. Once this chapter is closed with the arraignment of person or persons on this case I will make my consideration.\u201d Galizia\u2019s family urged the authorities to act independently.",

British Jews will still need to be able to work with a future Labour government \u2013 as they and other minorities must do with any government \u2013 and total opposition is going to make this very difficult. Further, the focus on Labour is also drawing attention away from rightwing antisemitism. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infiniterosee/status/1193126154917629953?s=20\" title=\"\">the venom turned on Jews who still vote Labour</a> \u2013 even those who recognise there is an antisemitism problem in the party \u2013 is causing conflict within an already divided community.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would be a mistake to see this as simply stoking fears \u2013 there has to be something to stoke in the first place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But whatever the risks, it would be a mistake to see the mainstream Jewish leadership and media as simply stoking fears \u2013 there has to be something to stoke in the first place. And by now, opinions have become ingrained among Britain\u2019s Jews: surveys show that the majority see the Labour party as lax about antisemitism at best and institutionally antisemitic at worst. Most polls suggest that the Jewish Labour vote has collapsed to below 10%.</p> <p>There is still a significant minority of Jews who continue to support the party. This includes many who see antisemitism in Labour as a serious issue, but do not see it as outweighing the need for the kind of radical change that a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would offer. While Labour-supporting Jews should not be seen as \u201cbad Jews\u201d, neither does their existence invalidate the concerns of the majority.</p> <p>What remains unclear is how non-Labour supporting British Jews will react if the party comes to power. <a href=\"https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/election-poll-2019-survation-jn/\" title=\"\">A recent poll</a> for Jewish News suggested that 47% of British Jews would \u201cseriously consider\u201d leaving the country should Corbyn win. Inevitably, the Conservatives, including the party chairman, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/02/jewish-families-will-leave-uk-jeremy-corbyn-wins-general-election/\" title=\"\">James Cleverly</a>, gleefully highlighted this finding. On the Today programme on Tuesday, following the chief rabbi\u2019s intervention, Rabbi Julia Neuberger also intimated that many Jews would consider leaving if Labour formed the next government.</p> <p>So how likely is it that Jews would leave in large numbers? The short answer is that the fear in the community is real \u2013 and some will inevitably choose to emigrate if Corbyn becomes prime minister. But the long answer is more complicated.</p> <p>In the past few decades there have been three main reasons for episodes of mass Jewish migration. In some cases, Jews have been actively expelled from a country \u2013 or faced the imposition of structural discrimination that gave them little choice but to flee. This occurred in many Middle Eastern countries following the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel, and last occurred in Europe in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1968_Polish_political_crisis&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"\">Poland in 1968</a>.</p> <p>In other instances, Jews have emigrated out of a fear of violence against them, whether government-sponsored or not. In the past two decades more than 10% of the French Jewish community has <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2019/11/french-jews-fleeing-country/\" title=\"\">emigrated</a> after a string of terrorist attacks and other violent incidents.</p> <p>Jews have also emigrated as a response to economic collapse.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party antisemitism dispute has spiralled out of control. With the departure of many non-Corbynite Jewish MPs, activists and members, and with the Jewish Labour Movement promising only to campaign for selected MPs, there are few restraints left on the total alienation of much of British Jewry and the Labour party from each other. The discourse of much of the Jewish leadership and the Jewish media has hardened to a simple message \u2013 a Labour victory would be a catastrophe, vote for whoever can beat Labour. The extraordinary intervention from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who said in the Times that the \u201cpoison\u201d of antisemitism had \u201ctaken root\u201d in the party, shows how high the stakes in this election have become. The risks of this approach are enormous. British Jews will still need to be able to work with a future Labour government \u2013 as they and other minorities must do with any government \u2013 and total opposition is going to make this very difficult. Further, the focus on Labour is also drawing attention away from rightwing antisemitism. Meanwhile, the venom turned on Jews who still vote Labour \u2013 even those who recognise there is an antisemitism problem in the party \u2013 is causing conflict within an already divided community. But whatever the risks, it would be a mistake to see the mainstream Jewish leadership and media as simply stoking fears \u2013 there has to be something to stoke in the first place. And by now, opinions have become ingrained among Britain\u2019s Jews: surveys show that the majority see the Labour party as lax about antisemitism at best and institutionally antisemitic at worst. Most polls suggest that the Jewish Labour vote has collapsed to below 10%. There is still a significant minority of Jews who continue to support the party. This includes many who see antisemitism in Labour as a serious issue, but do not see it as outweighing the need for the kind of radical change that a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would offer. While Labour-supporting Jews should not be seen as \u201cbad Jews\u201d, neither does their existence invalidate the concerns of the majority. What remains unclear is how non-Labour supporting British Jews will react if the party comes to power. A recent poll for Jewish News suggested that 47% of British Jews would \u201cseriously consider\u201d leaving the country should Corbyn win. Inevitably, the Conservatives, including the party chairman, James Cleverly, gleefully highlighted this finding. On the Today programme on Tuesday, following the chief rabbi\u2019s intervention, Rabbi Julia Neuberger also intimated that many Jews would consider leaving if Labour formed the next government. So how likely is it that Jews would leave in large numbers? The short answer is that the fear in the community is real \u2013 and some will inevitably choose to emigrate if Corbyn becomes prime minister. But the long answer is more complicated. In the past few decades there have been three main reasons for episodes of mass Jewish migration. In some cases, Jews have been actively expelled from a country \u2013 or faced the imposition of structural discrimination that gave them little choice but to flee. This occurred in many Middle Eastern countries following the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel, and last occurred in Europe in Poland in 1968. In other instances, Jews have emigrated out of a fear of violence against them, whether government-sponsored or not. In the past two decades more than 10% of the French Jewish community has emigrated after a string of terrorist attacks and other violent incidents. Jews have also emigrated as a response to economic collapse. Many of the one million-plus Jews who left the Soviet Union after 1990 were motivated by a desire for a more prosperous life. It\u2019s worth pointing out that both the second and third of these drivers for leaving could actually emerge as a consequence of a Conservative victory, with a rise in far-right violence and economic collapse a real possibility in the wake of a no-deal or ultra-hard Brexit. But British Jews are far more likely to say they would consider leaving following a Labour victory\u2013 and it may be the fear of hostility and spontaneous violence that is foremost in their minds. At the same time, much of the concern doesn\u2019t easily map on to any of those three scenarios. When Jews express fear of a Labour victory, they are most likely to point to issues such as the perceived failure to deal with antisemites in the party, Corbyn\u2019s history of relationships with Islamists as part of his campaigning for Palestinian rights and, more generally, the sense that a Labour-led country\u2019s hostility to Israel would make the UK an uncomfortable place for Jews. Some also worry about the possibility of kosher slaughter being banned, funding for Jewish communal security being cut, and an atmosphere of tolerance for certain kinds of antisemitic abuse. Yet there are no hard policy proposals that would suggest any of this is planned. The fear is ultimately a more generalised sense of \u201cexistential threat\u201d. So what we are most likely to see following a Labour government coming to power would be an immediate shock, shared widely across the Jewish community (although a significant minority of Jews would be delighted, or merely ambivalent). This would probably be followed by an extended \u201cwait and see\u201d period. It would not take much, though, to tip stoicism over the edge into panic: an antisemitic attack, even one less severe than what we have seen in France and the US, could do this \u2013 even if a Labour government had no responsibility for it. Under a Labour government, there would likely be an uptick in emigration to Israel from its current level (which hovers around two per 1,000 per year), albeit one that falls short of mass emigration.

      "body": "<h2>Corbyn: a day dominated by antisemitism row</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50564965\">Jeremy Corbyn has refused to apologise</a> to the British Jewish community following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\">remarkable election intervention</a> from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who used <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ephraim-mirvis-what-will-become-of-jews-in-britain-if-labour-forms-the-next-government-ghpsdbljk\">an article in the Times</a> to suggest that the \u201cmoral compass\u201d of Britain would be awry if Labour won the election because of Corbyn\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in his party. In his article Mirvis did not raise any new allegations about Corbyn or his party, but he said the Labour claim that it was doing everything it could to tackle antisemitism in the party was \u201ca mendacious fiction\u201d. He also claimed that Corbyn did not even understand the problem properly:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party.</p> <p>Many members of the Jewish community can hardly believe that this is the same party that they called their political home for more than a century. It can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he concluded his article:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience.</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning, at the launch of Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/26/general-election-parties-attack-each-others-spending-plans-after-manifestos-lay-differences-bare?page=with:block-5ddd220f8f087b800b6216c6#block-5ddd220f8f087b800b6216c6\">Corbyn said antisemitism was \u201cvile and wrong\u201d</a> and \u201cwould not be tolerated in any form whatsoever\u201d. He also offered to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/26/general-election-parties-attack-each-others-spending-plans-after-manifestos-lay-differences-bare?page=with:block-5ddd2ccc8f080fd59fb179aa#block-5ddd2ccc8f080fd59fb179aa\">Mirvis to discuss this further</a>. Many Corbyn supporters are exasperated by this line of attack, which they believe is being amplified by rightwing newspapers with no genuine anti-racist credentials, but Corbyn himself was careful to avoid criticising Mirvis personally or denying the existence of a problem.</p> <p>However, he did point out that the Conservative party said almost nothing on race and faith issues in its own manifesto. Inspired by the chief rabbi, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was important to speak up for the experience of Muslims in the Tory party too:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a faith community, we commonly are threatened by Islamophobia. This an issue that is particularly acute in the Conservative party who have approached Islamophobia with denial, dismissal and deceit.</p> <p>It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism. It is as if the Conservative party has a blind spot for this type of racism.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Johnson: keen to move the subject on</h2> <p>Boris Johnson said the chief rabbi\u2019s comments showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/26/general-election-parties-attack-each-others-spending-plans-after-manifestos-lay-differences-bare?page=with:block-5ddd35908f080fd59fb17a05#block-5ddd35908f080fd59fb17a05\">Corbyn had been guility of a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d</a> on the issue of antisemitism. However \u2013 mindful no doubt of complaints about racist language he has used himself in the past \u2013 when Johnson was asked about this in Scotland, he seemed keen to move the subject on and he quickly made a wider point about Corbyn\u2019s supposed lack of leadership on Brexit.</p> <p>The Conservative vulnerability on this issue was on display later in the day when Sajid Javid, the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/26/general-election-parties-attack-each-others-spending-plans-after-manifestos-lay-differences-bare?page=with:block-5ddd524b8f087b800b6218d1#block-5ddd524b8f087b800b6218d1\">refused to endorse Johnson\u2019s \u201cletter box\u201d article</a> about Muslim women wearing burqas that was deemed responsible for a sharp rise in incidents of Islamophobia. Javid also claimed he was not disappointed that the inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party he proposed has been converted by Johnson into an inquiry into racism in general in the party.</p> <h2>Tory-Labour tax row rumbles on</h2> <p>Javid published a Tory analysis of the Labour manifesto that he claimed proved that ordinary people would pay more in tax under Corbyn\u2019s plans. Labour says only the richest 5% will pay more in tax. But<a href=\"https://vote.conservatives.com/news/tax-hikes-for-the-many-new-report-reveals-millions-face-tax-hikes-under-labour\"> the Tory document </a>identified six \u201ctax rises\u201d (some of them were just financial penalties, not proper tax rises) that might affect non-wealthy taxpayers under Labour.</p> <p>Javid also said that, following the publication of the Labour manifesto, the Conservatives have revised their calculations about how much extra spending they will entail, and what this will mean for taxpayers. By happy coincidence, the Tories have concluded that the overall cost, \u00a31.2tr, and the cost to taxpayers, \u00a32,400 a year, are the same as they were when the party calculated them before the Labour manifesto was published. Both those figures were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/will-labour-plans-really-cost-each-taxpayer-2400\">widely seen as bogus</a> because they were based on too many false or questionable assumptions.</p> <h2>Meanwhile</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/26/general-election-parties-attack-each-others-spending-plans-after-manifestos-lay-differences-bare?page=with:block-5ddd35908f080fd59fb17a05#block-5ddd35908f080fd59fb17a05\">Johnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum</a> on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/lib-dems-lambasted-over-fake-newspapers-campaign-material\">The Liberal Democrats have been accused of peddling misinformation</a> after distributing fake newspapers, prompting one local newspaper group to threaten to stop all coverage of the party.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/voter-registration-rise-boosts-labours-election-hopes\">A sharp rise in voter registration</a>, predominantly among young people, has boosted Labour\u2019s hopes in the general election.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/i-set-trends-dem-man-copy-michael-gove-mocks-stormzy-labour-support\">Michael Gove has mocked Stormzy</a> for expressing his support for Labour and Corbyn in the forthcoming election.</p></li> <li><p>Wondering how to vote?

By happy coincidence, the Tories have concluded that the overall cost, \u00a31.2tr, and the cost to taxpayers, \u00a32,400 a year, are the same as they were when the party calculated them before the Labour manifesto was published. Both those figures were widely seen as bogus because they were based on too many false or questionable assumptions. Meanwhile Johnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament. The Liberal Democrats have been accused of peddling misinformation after distributing fake newspapers, prompting one local newspaper group to threaten to stop all coverage of the party. A sharp rise in voter registration, predominantly among young people, has boosted Labour\u2019s hopes in the general election. Michael Gove has mocked Stormzy for expressing his support for Labour and Corbyn in the forthcoming election. Wondering how to vote? Check our bite-size guide to the manifestos.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has insisted there is no place in Labour for antisemitism after unprecedented claims from Britain\u2019s chief rabbi that he has allowed the party to become riddled with prejudice. Ephraim Mirvis accused Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d to take root in Labour, saying Jews were justifiably anxious about the prospect of the party forming the next government. His remarks prompted support from fellow religious leaders and former MPs. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in effect backed those criticisms with a tweet that highlighted the \u201cdeep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews\u201d. At the launch of Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto in Tottenham, north London, Corbyn attempted to fight back, saying his party was tackling the problem. \u201cAntisemitism in any form is vile and wrong. It is an evil within our society \u2026 there is no place for it and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Labour that also passed the Human Rights Act, that set up the Equality and Human Rights Commission. It\u2019s Labour that has to its very core the issues of justice and human rights within our society.\u201d Mirvis is the UK\u2019s most senior Jewish leader who represents Orthodox Judaism. In a highly unusual intervention in politics, he argued that the soul of the nation was at stake. Writing for the Times (\u00a3), he said it was not his place to tell people how to vote but argued that the way in which the Labour leadership had dealt with antisemitism was \u201cincompatible with the British values of which we are so proud \u2013 of dignity and respect for all people\u201d. Labour has strongly denied any suggestion that Corbyn has failed to get to grips with allegations of antisemitism, pointing to his record as an anti-racist campaigner and moves to overhaul the party\u2019s complaints process. On Tuesday he avoided addressing Mirvis\u2019 claims head-on, instead saying: \u201cSometimes, when people are challenged they say: \u2018Are you tolerant of somebody else? Are you tolerant of somebody who has a different face to you or a different appearance to you?\u2019 \u201cI don\u2019t like that word tolerant. I don\u2019t tolerate people. I respect people. So, let\u2019s do it on the basis of respect and inclusion in our society. But let\u2019s also be clear: abuse and racism in any form is not acceptable in any way in our society.\u201d Responding to allegations that antisemitism has been sanctioned from the top of Labour and that there is anxiety about him becoming prime minister, Corbyn said the party had taken measures to eradicate anti-Jewish hatred, as well as reach out to faith leaders. He added: \u201cSince I became leader of the party, the party has adopted processes that didn\u2019t exist before \u2026 a disciplinary process that didn\u2019t exist before. \u201cAnd where people have committed antisemitic acts they are brought to book or if necessary expelled from the party or suspended or asked to be educated better about it.\u201d The Labour leader said if he got into government he would like to speak to all faith leaders and invited Mirvis to meet him. \u201cI want to lead a government that has an open door to all of the faith leaders, so I invite the chief rabbi, I invite the archbishop of Canterbury, I invite all the other faith leaders to come talk to us about what their concerns are. \u201cBut be absolutely clear of this assurance from me. No community will be at risk because of their identity, faith, their ethnicity, their language,\u201d he said. At the launch, the Labour peer Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child refugee in 1939, expressed disappointment at the rabbi\u2019s words. \u201cI am bitterly disappointed by what he said. I don\u2019t accept a lot of what he said, in so far as the Labour party should have acted a lot quicker. But today of all days, for the chief rabbi to be attacking our leader, it is unjustified, unfair and I am bitterly, bitterly disappointed that he has done it,\u201d Dubs said. Labour has faced allegations of antisemitism for more than three years, leading to the suspension of a number of high-profile figures such as Ken Livingstone and Chris Williamson, and an unprecedented EHRC investigation. Some prominent Jewish Labour politicians, including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman, left the party after being the subject of abuse on social media. Some have accused Corbyn of endorsing antisemitic tropes and imagery. Following Mirvis\u2019s comments, Berger, who is standing as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cUnprecedented and devastating intervention from the chief rabbi. During the the last meeting I had with Jeremy Corbyn at the end of 2017, I told him about the many public and private Facebook groups that were littered with antisemitic posts which used the Labour leader\u2019s name/and photo in their group name. Nothing was done about it.\u201d The chief rabbi\u2019s comments overshadowed the announcement of new anti-racist policies including a new public body to oversee the legacy of colonialism, a race equality unit at the Treasury and reduced charges for Home Office documents and tests. The policies, launched by Corbyn, Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities secretary, and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, follow a party-wide consultation since September. Among the policies is the creation of what would be called an emancipation educational trust. Based around examining historical injustice, it would ensure that the role of the British empire is taught in schools. The plan, some elements of which appear in the main Labour manifesto, would also cover a review into the lack of BAME teachers in schools, and an outside review into the issue of far-right extremism. Appearing on a stage at the Bernie Grant arts centre, Tan Dhesi, who is hoping to be re-elected as MP for Slough, said the new race manifesto would also call for an independent inquiry into the storming of the golden temple and an official apology for the 1919 Amritsar massacre. Abbott reminded Labour activists that they, like the late MP Grant, who entered parliament at the same time as her in 1987, should not back down on their beliefs if they were criticised by others. \u201cIt is important to remember that just because you are vilified in the here and now does not mean that you are not right,\u201d she said. Afzal Khan, the shadow immigration minister, said Labour should not shy away from trying to tackle international issues while combatting antisemitism. \u201cWe need to heal this issue about Israel and Palestine as well. We need to do it in a fair and just manner,\u201d he said. Responding to the chief rabbi\u2019s comments during a campaign trip in Scotland, Boris Johnson said Corbyn was guilty of a failure of leadership. The prime minister added: \u201cI do think it\u2019s a very serious business when the chief rabbi speaks as he does. I have never known anything like it, and clearly it\u2019s a failure of leadership on the part of the Labour leader that he has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour party. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s accompanied with a general failure of leadership we\u2019re seeing at the moment on Brexit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally... the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day little changed, up just 6 points at 7,403. That\u2019s a two-week high. But the smaller FTSE 250 stole the limelight for once, ending at a 16-month high of 20,864, up 161 points or 0.8%. Pets at Home led the charge, up 16% after posting strong results, followed by luxury carmaker Aston Martin (which announced a tie-up with British Airways today for a limited-edition sports car). Among smaller companies, De La Rue finished down 23%, as investors baulked at its concerns that it might collapse. The pound is still showing some weakness, down a third of a cent at $1.286. But generally it was a quiet day - Alibaba\u2019s share sale in Hong Kong was the most interesting thing to happen. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the day: Though quiet, the Dow Jones still managed to add 40 or so points \u2013 enough to lift it back above 28100 and to an effective all-time high. Elsewhere the CAC added 0.2% to nudge towards its own fresh 12-year peak, while the DAX was broadly unchanged at 13250, a level it has found it pretty hard to escape for any great stretch of time in the last 3-weeks. As for the FTSE, a 0.1% increase took it to 7400, less than a week after striking an intraday low of 7200. After sharply rising on Monday on the back of polls pointing to an 80-seat majority for the Tories, the latest surveys showing a shrinking lead for Boris Johnson and co. caused the pound to go in reverse. Against the dollar it shed 0.3%, causing cable to abandon $1.29; against the euro, meanwhile, a 0.4% retreat left it the wrong side of \u20ac1.168. Goodnight! GW US consumer confidence, a metric closely followed by the White House, has fallen this month - a weaker result than expected. US house prices have picked up, rising by over 2% in the 20 largest cities. That ends a long run of falling prices, suggesting recent US interest rate cuts are feeding through. A quick recap Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has hit its highest level since August 2018, as fears of another hung parliament recede. The pound has dipped, though, after a poll showed the Conservative lead over Labour narrowing. Shares in UK bank note maker De La Rue have plunged by a fifth, as it suspends its dividend after falling into a loss. It also warned there are concerns over its ability to keep running. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has raised more than $11bn by selling shares on the Hong Kong stock market. The stock promptly surged by over 6%. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced plans to ban the mass marketing of speculative mini-bonds to ordinary investors, following several cases where people lost money. Citi has been fined \u00a344m for failing to report its capital and liquidity position accurately to the Bank of England. Just in: America\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world has narrowed. But rather than a surge in exports, the move is due to a drop in imports. That may be due to the tariffs imposed on goods from China and Europe by the Trump administration. Here\u2019s the details: The international trade deficit was $66.5 billion in October, down $4.0 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Exports of goods for October were $135.3 billion, $0.9 billion less than September exports. Imports of goods for October were $201.8 billion, $5.0 billion less than September imports. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has hit its highest level in 15 months today. The index of medium-sized companies (too small for the Footsie 100) has gained 152 points, or 0.75%, to 20,854 today. That\u2019s its best level since July 2018, before Brexit worries and fears of a global slowdown sent markets sliding. The FTSE 250 has gained almost 20% since mid-October, when Boris Johnson persuaded the EU to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. It\u2019s recent gains come as City traders grow more confident that the Conservatives will win a majority on 12 December, says Russ Mould of AJ Bell: \u201cThe market seems to be growing more confident that the Conservative Party will win the general election in December, thus bringing some clarity to what might happen with Brexit and \u2013 importantly \u2013 removing an element of uncertainty which has hung over UK equities for some time. Today\u2019s top risers are Pets At Home, up 12%, after posting 7.8% jump in half-year sales and a 18.9% surge in underlying pre-tax profits this morning. Just in: German carmaker Audi is announcing a new restructuring plan that will save \u20ac6bn by 2029, but also cut over 9,000 jobs over the next six years. There are fresh signs today that Beijing and Washington are making small steps towards a Phase One trade deal. Associated Press has the details: Top Chinese and U.S. trade negotiators have agreed to talks on a preliminary deal for resolving the tariff war between the worlds two largest economies, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday. In a brief notice, the ministry said that Vice Premier Liu He and other senior officials spoke by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The official Xinhua News Agency said the two sides discussed solving issues regarding each others core concerns, reached consensus on properly resolving related issues and agreed to maintain communication on remaining issues in consultations on the Phase 1 deal. The announcement was not immediately confirmed by the U.S. side. It came after shares struck new record highs Monday on Wall Street following Beijing\u2019s announcement of new guidelines for the protection of patents and copyrights. Ouch! Wall Street bank Citi has been fine \u00a344m by the Bank of England for serious errors in reporting its capital and liquidity positions. It\u2019s a record penalty from the BoE, which has found that Citi failed to adequately report its capital strength, and its ability to rapidly access the value of its assets. That included \u201csix substantive matters\u201d between 2014 and 2018 which had a material or potentially material impact on the numbers Citi reported to the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. PRA chief Sam Woods says: \u201cCiti failed to deliver accurate returns and failed to meet the standards of governance and oversight of regulatory reporting which we expect of a systemically important bank.\u201d The good news? Citi didn\u2019t actually slide into a capital or liquidity crisis - but if it HAD been, UK regulators couldn\u2019t have spotted it. The BoE says: While Citi remained in surplus to its liquidity and capital requirements at all times, the failings persisted over a significant length of time and were serious and widespread in nature. Sterling continues to be knocked around by the latest political developments, as the general election race heats up. The pound has shed half a cent this morning, to $1.285, after an opinion poll showed Boris Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn has narrowed. A survey by Kantar published on Tuesday found that the Conservative Party have an 11 point lead over Labour, down from 18 a week ago. Yesterday, though, the pound had rallied after a Financial Times poll of polls showed the Tories pulling ahead with a 14-point lead over Labour, with 43% support. The pound typically rallies when another hung parliament looks less likely, as investors aren\u2019t keen on the prospect of yet more Brexit deadlock. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group believes a Conservative majority looks increasingly likely, telling clients: The likelihood that the Tories disastrous 2017 election experience repeats itself now seems unlikely. We are increasing the probability of a Tory majority government from 45% to 60% and reducing the odds of a Labour minority government from 30% to 25%; we are also reducing the probability of a Tory minority government from 15% to 10%, but hold the risk of deadlock at 5%. A Johnson-led government will pass the Withdrawal Agreement in December and attempt to conclude a Canada-style free-trade agreement by December 2020; however, a one-year extension to the transition is likely, probably in May or June next year. De La Rue\u2019s management team have a fight on their hands, warns David Madden of CMC Markets. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s weak financial results from the banknote printer: De La Rue shares have plunged after the group swung to a first-half loss, plus, it scrapped its dividend. The company registered a loss of \u00a39.2 million, which compared with a profit of over \u00a310 million in the same period last year. Management will be conducting a review of the entire business, and in light of the fact the dividend was shelved, it suggests the group is facing serious problems. To make matters worse, net debt jumped by 58% to \u00a3170.7 million. The financial health of the group is poor, so Clive Vacher, the turnaround specialist who was drafted in last month as CEO has a tough task ahead of him. Despite Compass (-5.8%) acting as a drag, the wider FTSE 100 index has hit a two-week high this morning. The index is up another 9 points at 7,405, with exporters benefitting from a weaker pound this morning. The other European markets have dipped a little, though, with the pan-EU Stoxx 600 down 0.1%. Food producer Compass has also alarmed the City this morning, sending its shares down 5% to the bottom of the FTSE 100. Compass warned that business and consumer confidence in Europe had deteriorated, hurting its profit margins and sales growth. It appears that Europe\u2019s slowdown, to a near-recession in Germany, has dented demand for Compass\u2019s culinary offerings at work canteens across the region. It says: \u201cConsumer confidence (in Europe) continues to decline and a number of key clients, notably in manufacturing, automotive and financial services, have reduced their headcount in recent months. Compass, which also provides school meals, posted an 8.8% jump in revenues for the last year, thanks to strong growth in North America. But the \u201cdeteriorating macro environment in Europe\u201d has caught investors\u2019 eye today. Losing that Brexit passport contract in 2018 was the biggest blow to De La Rue\u2019s future, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. There has been trouble in Venezuela and the SFO investigation remains ongoing \u2013 but by far the biggest blow and the source of the company\u2019s collapse in market capitalization was losing the contract to make UK passports. He adds: I don\u2019t buy the argument that printing banknotes in a cashless world makes them structurally irrelevant \u2013 cash in circulation is growing all the time. The need for more secure notes that De La Rue makes is becoming more important, not less. Bad management and decisions seems to be the main reason for the malaise. De La Rue\u2019s share price is on track to close at their lowest level since 1998! Today\u2019s \u201cwave of bad news\u201d shows that the bank note printer has \u201cfallen flat on its face\u201d, says Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell. He writes: Just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse for De La Rue along comes another wave of bad news....a warning that it may not be able to stay running as a business if trading conditions keep getting worse, it incurs extra costs linked with various contingent liabilities and growth areas don\u2019t achieve forecast margins. \u201cIt is drowning in debt and has this year seen most of the executive team leave or resign, causing further instability in the business. \u201cIn an increasingly cashless world one has to wonder just how long De La Rue can survive without a radical change to its business model. It has already restructured its operations into two divisions \u2013 authenticating goods as genuine and currency services \u2013 but one has to wonder if this is still enough to secure its future. Mould suspects that De La Rue could be scooped up by a larger rival, when the price is right.... \u201cBut would a potential suitor act now or sit on the side lines in hope that the price could get a lot cheaper? After all, De La Rue still has many negative factors to stomach including a fraud investigation into suspected corruption in South Sudan. \u201cThe business seems to have fallen flat on its face as a result of poor management decisions at a time when it needed superior leadership to navigate difficult market challenges. Sadly shareholders are now suffering the consequences.\u201d De La Rue\u2019s problems really began 20 months ago, in March 2018, when it failed to win the \u00a3490m contract to print Britain\u2019s new blue passports. That contract went to Franco-Dutch printer Gemalto instead, leading De La Rue to demand an explanation as to why a \u201cBritish icon\u201d would be made offshore. But the government refused to reverse the decision, and De La Rue has been struggling to take back control ever since. The value of the company has slumped by around four-fifths, as this share price chart shows. Today\u2019s gloomy announcement (including a \u00a39.2m loss for the last six months) is De La Rue\u2019s third profits warning of 2019. CEO Clive Vacher is warning that it will take time for the currency market to normalise, implying further turbulence ahead. Vacher has pledged to make \u201cstructural changes\u201d, including a stronger focus on making more secure bank notes (where profit margin are higher). He says: \u201cBetween now and the end of calendar Q1 2020, we will complete a full review of the business and design a comprehensive turnaround plan for the Company. In the meantime, we have already identified and started to implement the urgent actions needed to stabilise the business and allow us to complete the review. With strong emphasis on cost control and cash management, coupled with a focus on innovation and reversing the revenue decline, we will become a leaner, more efficient Company and drive shareholder value.\u201d But... De La Rue\u2019s warning that there\u2019s \u2018material uncertainty\u2019 over its future is obviously casting a shadow over this plan, given the risk of breaching its banking covenants. De La Rue also warned shareholders that its debts have risen, putting more pressure on its ability to keep within its banking covenants. It says: As at the 28 September 2019 the Group\u2019s net debt was \u00a3170.7m [up from \u00a3107.5m in March] and the net debt/EBITDA ratio adjusted for the basis of the banking covenant was 2.72 times, both of which are significantly higher than previously forecast. That\u2019s partly due to the slide in operating profits, due to increased pricing pressures and lower sales volumes. While Alibaba romps away, UK bank note maker De La Rue is having a torrid morning. Shares in De La Rue have plunged by 20% this morning, after it reported an 87% plunge in operating profits for the last six months. The firm also suspended its dividend, and warned there is \u201csignificant doubt\u201d over its ability to continue as a going concern. De La Rue has suffered a series of blows in recent years, including failing to win the contract for Britain\u2019s new Brexit passports. It also lost \u00a318m when the Bank of Venezuela failed to pay its bills. Clive Vacher, CEO of De La Rue, warned investors this morning: The business has experienced an unprecedented period of change with the Chairman, CEO, senior independent director and most of the executive team leaving or resigning in the period. This has led to inconsistency in both quality and speed of execution. The new Board is working to stabilise the management team, which we believe will take some time. With the Serious Fraud Office investigating possible corruption in South Sudan, and Brexit threatening to disrupt its links with European customers, De La Rue faces huge challenges. Shares have slumped to 141p, down from 175p last night and around 420p at the start of the year.... Reaction to follow... After a strong session, Alibaba\u2019s shares have closed at HK$187.6, sharply higher than their HK$176 float price today. That\u2019s a 6.5% gain on the day. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: Alibaba\u2019s listing in Hong Kong was a success on the opening day of trading, with shares rising more than 6%. The largest listing of the year comes at a worrying time for Hong Kong but everything appears to have gone very smoothly. This was an opportunity to show that, despite the protests that have brought Hong Kong to a standstill and wreaked havoc on the economy, it\u2019s business as usual for the stock exchange. Alibaba\u2019s stock market float was quite a performance, as this video shows: So far, the stock is rewarding the exchange with a solid rally: Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong listing is an early Christmas present for the investment bankers who worked on the deal. Credit Suisse, Citigroup, and JP Morgan will all pocket decent fees for their work on the biggest share sale of 2019, as we reported last week: There\u2019s a knack to selling shares -- you want to price them high enough to raise plenty of funds, but low enough to ensure a \u2018pop\u2019 as hungry investors pile in. Alibaba appears to have got this one right - ensuring a decent rally after its Hong Kong debut today. Bloomberg calls the surge in Alibaba\u2019s share price \u201ca triumph\u201d, adding; Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. rose 7.7% in its Hong Kong debut, capping a landmark share sale that unfolded during violent anti-government protests. Chairman Daniel Zhang, lieutenants wearing Alibaba lapel pins and Hong Kong dignitaries were on hand to strike the opening gong Tuesday at a celebration of the city\u2019s biggest stock listing this year. The company presented a Chinese-style painting to the exchange -- a souvenir to go with the showy coming-out party. The Chinese e-commerce giant\u2019s shares rose to as much as HK$189.50, versus a HK$176 issuance price. The Financial Times says Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong debut is \u201ca vote of confidence by Beijing in Hong Kong\u2019s future\u201d. It adds: Dickie Wong, head of research at broker Kingston Securities, said Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong debut was \u201cslightly better than expected\u201d and that the shares were a shoe-in for quick inclusion in stock connect programmes that would allow investors in mainland China to trade them. \u201cThis is definitely a must-have stock for the portfolio of a local investor,\u201d he said. The South China Morning Post (which is owned by Alibaba!) says Asia\u2019s most valuable company is having a strong day: If sustained, the gain will rank among the best first-day performances involving the biggest IPOs in the city since 2005, after AIA Group (17.1 per cent), Bank of China (15.3 per cent), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (14.7 per cent) and China Unicom (8.9 per cent). The Alibaba listing comes as a shot in the arm for Hong Kong at a time when the city is seeking to rebound from its worst political crisis in history, with the economy in a technical recession. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The biggest share sale of the year is going with a bang today, as investors shrug off worries over trade wars and global growth. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, has successfully sold around \u00a38.8bn of shares through a secondary listing in Hong Kong. It\u2019s a vote of confidence in the company, and also Hong Kong\u2019s financial system itself after months of pro-democracy protests. The Hong Kong exchange put on a good show -- complete with a gong and an array of cartoon characters mark the occasion. CEO Daniel Zhang gave the gong a hearty tap, and told the audience that Alibaba has \u201creturned home to Hong Kong\u201d (having floated in New York back in 2014). This won a large round of applause from the crowd. Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange operator, also talked up the significance of the float, saying: After five years of travelling afar, [Alibaba has] decided to come home. Despite the difficulties and challenges in Hong Kong.\u201d Investors promptly charged in, sending Alibaba\u2019s stock surging more than 6% -- above the price set in New York last night. Alibaba has been given the stock code 9988 \u2013 numbers that are considered auspicious in Chinese culture and represent eternal prosperity. With its annual Singles Day event hitting a new sales record this month, that feels appropriate. The sale has already raised $11.3bn, which could rise to $12.9bn if Alibaba exercises the option to sell an extra tranche of shares (an over-allotment option, as they say). This means it\u2019s exceeded Uber - whose IPO had been the biggest share sale of the year. This cash could help Alibaba invest in its online offering. But there\u2019s another factor too - having a base of investors in Asia could be helpful if relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate. This early success highlights that the markets are still in bullish mood, with the US indices hitting record highs again on Monday. We also saw a flurry of takeover action yesterday, with luxury goods firm LVMH buying Tiffany\u2019s, online broker Charles Schwab agreed to buy TD Ameritrade, drugs firm Novartis acquiring rival Medicines Co, Viagogo snapping up StubHub and a Mitsubishi-led consortium agreeing to pay \u20ac4.1bn for Dutch utility Eneco. Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson says this flurry of deal-making is partly because recession risks have eased, while recent interest rate cuts mean there\u2019s lots of easy money around. But there\u2019s a political factor too... Perhaps some fears a Democrat in the White House might take a harder line on deal making. Clearly Trump is laxer on deals \u2013 companies want to act now while the going is good. Also coming up today The US economy will be under the microscope, as new trade data, house price stats and consumer confidence figures are released. Markets are expected to be calm, helped by encouraging noises about progress in the US-China trade talks. Still no actual deal yet, though... The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for October: expected to widen to -$71bn, from -$70.4bn 2pm GMT: US house price index for September: Expected to rise by 0.3% 3pm GMT: US consumer confidence survey for November: expected to rise to 127, from 125.9",

      "body": "<p>Ian Macdonald, who has died aged 80 from a heart attack, was the leader of the British bar in immigration law over the past half century. His forensic commitment to equality and race relations dated back to his successful defence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Mangrove Nine</a> in 1970, when an Old Bailey jury rejected an attempt to frame denizens of the Mangrove cafe in Notting Hill, west London, and he was still working on immigration and extradition cases at the time of his death.</p> <p>Although some of his comrades took, in time, knighthoods and judgeships, Ian remained to the end a jobbing advocate \u2013 one with an intellectual influence on the subject, through his textbook on immigration law, greater than that of any judge or academic.</p> <p>The son of Ian Macdonald, a banker, and his wife, Helen Nicolson, Ian was born and grew up in Glasgow, went to Rugby school, then studied law at Clare College, Cambridge, joining the bar via the Middle Temple in 1963. He became a member of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination at its inception in 1964, lobbying the Labour government to set up a race relations board.</p> <p>In 1971, however, came an avowedly racist Immigration Act with its invented category of \u201cpatriality\u201d designed to exclude as many black people as possible. Ian turned to the study of the civil liberties implications of immigration law, a subject which at the time was disgracefully neglected by university law faculties. In 1983 came the first edition of his textbook Immigration Law &amp; Practice \u2013 now in its ninth edition and still the leading work on the subject.</p> <p>It managed from the outset to be sufficiently authoritative to require judicial respect while at the same time infused with humanitarian principles and ideas for extracting them from the common law, which was difficult enough years before the Human Rights Act.

      "bodyText": "Ian Macdonald, who has died aged 80 from a heart attack, was the leader of the British bar in immigration law over the past half century. His forensic commitment to equality and race relations dated back to his successful defence of the Mangrove Nine in 1970, when an Old Bailey jury rejected an attempt to frame denizens of the Mangrove cafe in Notting Hill, west London, and he was still working on immigration and extradition cases at the time of his death. Although some of his comrades took, in time, knighthoods and judgeships, Ian remained to the end a jobbing advocate \u2013 one with an intellectual influence on the subject, through his textbook on immigration law, greater than that of any judge or academic. The son of Ian Macdonald, a banker, and his wife, Helen Nicolson, Ian was born and grew up in Glasgow, went to Rugby school, then studied law at Clare College, Cambridge, joining the bar via the Middle Temple in 1963. He became a member of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination at its inception in 1964, lobbying the Labour government to set up a race relations board. In 1971, however, came an avowedly racist Immigration Act with its invented category of \u201cpatriality\u201d designed to exclude as many black people as possible. Ian turned to the study of the civil liberties implications of immigration law, a subject which at the time was disgracefully neglected by university law faculties. In 1983 came the first edition of his textbook Immigration Law &amp; Practice \u2013 now in its ninth edition and still the leading work on the subject. It managed from the outset to be sufficiently authoritative to require judicial respect while at the same time infused with humanitarian principles and ideas for extracting them from the common law, which was difficult enough years before the Human Rights Act. When that was passed, in 1998, a new edition of Macdonald on Immigration was soon available to guide practitioners. In 1984 he founded the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association,which he chaired for the next 30 years, evincing, as his friend the writer Gus John has put it, \u201cintellectual muscle and unwavering commitment to holding the state to account and defending the rights and entitlements of those whom it capriciously seeks to exclude\u201d. I first met Ian at the Old Bailey in 1971 \u2013 he was in court No 1 defending the Angry Brigade, former Cambridge and Essex students who planted small bombs at the Miss World contest and the like, while I was in court No 2 (the security court) defending those the state regarded as more dangerous, the hippy editors of Oz magazine charged with \u201cconspiracy to corrupt public morals\u201d for publishing a cartoon of Rupert Bear with an erection. These were bizarre times and a virtually all-white, all-male, private-school bar had not developed the tactics for exposing the institutional racism in the Met, police corruption and the wrongful convictions soon to be inflicted on Irish terrorist suspects. We recognised the need for new thinking, new ways of defending (in particular, harnessing public law disclosure procedures) and the need to build up chambers of like-minded barristers who would pool their energies to resist state oppression of minorities and journalists. Ian became head of his chambers \u2013 Garden Court \u2013 in 1975 and, together with his co-head, Owen Davies, guided its collective expertise in immigration law. Ian was counsel in many notable cases, from the Balcombe Street siege (the convictions were later exposed as a miscarriage of justice), the Stephen Lawrence inquiry (representing Stephen\u2019s friend Duwayne Brooks) and the New Cross fire inquest, into the death of 13 young black people \u2013 Ian was seen jumping on his bike to ride to the high court for urgent orders quashing the decisions of a legally ignorant coroner. He was appointed by Manchester city council to conduct an independent inquiry into racism in local schools after the murder of a Bangladeshi schoolboy, Ahmed Ullah. The council refused to publish his report, although it subsequently emerged as a book, Murder in the Playground (1990). In 1988, Lord (Quintin) Hailsham was succeeded as lord chancellor by the more fair-minded Lord (James) Mackay of Clashfern, whose first QC appointments were said to include \u201cradicals\u201d. Ian was one, his appointment to silk after 25 years being well overdue. In 1997 he submitted to security vetting and accepted appointment by the attorney general as a \u201cspecial advocate\u201d for the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). This was a device which helped the government pretend that SIAC\u2019s proceedings were fair: special advocates were allowed to challenge evidence that their client was not allowed to see on grounds of national security. Effective challenge in such circumstances, as he later explained to a parliamentary committee, was difficult if not impossible without being able to talk to clients.

No doctor would turn a patient away from A&amp;E on the basis that the internet can diagnose their symptoms. No teacher would tell a child to educate themselves for exams on the basis that books are available at the library. Fair and equal access to legal representation for those accused of a crime is a low priority for most until they or a loved one experiences the criminal justice system directly. Then the true extent of the broken system and the real potential for a miscarriage of justice becomes real. In this election, the value of fair, equal and properly funded access to legal advice and representation must be recognised, restored and actively promoted before miscarriages of justice cease to be the exception and become the rule.

The company, which has 274 stores in the UK and 269 in Spain, and 21 gaming arenas, is set to delist later this summer.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>OTHER INVESTMENTS</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Goals Soccer Centre</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sports Direct owns an 18.9% stake that cost about \u00a315m to build up but is now worth \u00a33.9m. Shares in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/18/goals-soccer-centres-hires-advisers-potential-sale-mike-ashley\">five-a-side pitch operator</a>, which has 49 sites, were suspended in March and it is considering a sale as discussions continue with tax authorities over an unpaid VAT bill.

French Connection has been considering a sale since October 2018 after a period of poor trading. The fashion retailer has said sales at established stores fell 6.8% last year, when it made a pre-tax loss of \u00a39.3m. The results of a strategic review are not expected until September.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Findel</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mike Ashley\u2019s group has invested nearly \u00a363m building up a 37.8% stake in the online retailer, which is now worth \u00a379m. But Findel\u2019s board recently advised investors to reject a low-ball offer from Sports Direct for the rest of the shares it did not own, which would have valued the company at \u00a3140m.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Debenhams</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sports Direct spent more than \u00a3150m on building up a near-30% stake in the 165-strong department store chain, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/debenhams-is-taken-over-by-lenders-mike-ashley-loses-sta\">collapsed into administration in April</a>. Ashley fought a bitter battle for the control of the group, which is now owned by a consortium of hedge funds and banks and set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/09/debenhams-wins-green-light-for-restructuring-plan\">close 22 stores in January</a> after winning support from landlords for a rescue restructure.

In addition the former Frasers outlet is to be reopened as a Johnnie Walker visitor centre, with a rooftop bar.</p> \n<p>He suggested Ashley might wish to focus his investment elsewhere: \u201cClearly the Jenners name is iconic, it was called the Harrods of the north, but it hasn\u2019t been that for some time.\u201d He added that the department store faced heavy competition from the nearby Harvey Nichols and a John Lewis which was being rebuilt.</p> \n<p>This week Ashley announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/25/sports-direct-says-it-plans-to-rebrand-itself-as-frasers-group\">rename his Sports Direct group</a> as Frasers.

      "bodyText": "Edinburgh\u2019s Jenners department store could quit the landmark position on Princes Street it has occupied for more than 180 years under plans to turn the site into a hotel, rooftop bar and restaurants. The Danish fashion billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who bought the building for a reported \u00a350m in 2017, wants to restore and renovate the building\u2019s Victorian facade and three-storey glass-roofed central atrium and turn more than half the site into a hotel. Povlsen and his wife Anne, who have an estimated fortune of \u00a34.5bn after investing in the online clothing retailer Asos and building up his parents\u2019 fashion group Bestseller, are among Scotland\u2019s largest private landowners. The Polvsens are carrying out extensive rewilding across their 200,000 acres of estates in Sutherland and the Grampian mountains. The revival of the Jenners building could provide a boost for Princes Street, which has endured several decades of retail failures including the closure of major stores including BHS and the Frasers department store. But it is not clear if the Jenners department store \u2013 now owned by Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct \u2013 will remain. Anders Krogh, project manager of Povlsen\u2019s property development company which owns the Jenners building, said a department store was a \u201cvital future part of the project\u201d, which is set to kick off in 2020 or 2021. However, he admitted agreement had not been reached about Jenners\u2019 future with Sports Direct, which owns and operates Jenners as part of its House of Fraser group. Sports Direct, which last year shut the Frasers store that was also on Edinburgh\u2019s Princes Street, is understood to have a lease on the Jenners site which runs only until next year. A spokesman for Krogh said they had been in talks with Sports Direct: \u201cWe have up until now done our utmost to let the tenant stay in the building by offering them favourable terms. If they should end up not wanting to continue, it is unfortunately not our decision.\u201d Sports Direct bought House of Fraser out of administration in August last year. Since then, six of the group\u2019s original 59 stores have closed, including Frasers in Edinburgh, Exeter, Shrewsbury and Cirencester. A number of further sites are expected to close after Christmas following Ashley\u2019s admission that House of Fraser was losing more than \u00a31m a week and described its problems as \u201cnothing short of terminal\u201d. Ashley is understood to be operating many of the department stores on no- or low-rent deals, as landlords have opted to keep the stores open at almost any cost. Leigh Sparks, professor of retail studies at the University of Stirling, said a revamped Jenners building in Edinburgh would complement the St James shopping centre and Waverley Mall developments at the east end of Princes Street. In addition the former Frasers outlet is to be reopened as a Johnnie Walker visitor centre, with a rooftop bar. He suggested Ashley might wish to focus his investment elsewhere: \u201cClearly the Jenners name is iconic, it was called the Harrods of the north, but it hasn\u2019t been that for some time.\u201d He added that the department store faced heavy competition from the nearby Harvey Nichols and a John Lewis which was being rebuilt. This week Ashley announced plans to rename his Sports Direct group as Frasers. The group also owns the Flannels designer fashion chain, Evans Cycles, Sofa.com and the Jack Wills brand alongside the Sports Direct chain. Some key House of Fraser stores will be renamed Frasers next year.",

In the language of the age, the cathedral offers an experience without a commitment. So which are the finest?</p> <h2>10. Norwich</h2> <p>With its in-your-face tower and nave so grandly Romanesque you wonder why anyone bothered with gothic. The carved medieval figures on the doorway surrounds are delightful.</p> <h2>9. <strong>Salisbury</strong></h2> <p>The only cathedral designed in one go, and rather tedious as a result. But the view of the steeple is incomparable, a defining image of Englishness. The chapter house and cathedral close are exquisite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06f72efd658b4e808a901da739ccdfa011c768d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06f72efd658b4e808a901da739ccdfa011c768d/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canterbury Cathedral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canterbury Cathedral, the earliest gothic work in England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. <strong>Winchester</strong></h2> <p>Once the cathedral of a capital city, now famed for its west wall of Perpendicular glass and seemingly endless nave, giving way to a Norman transept more like a fortress than a church. The east end is an exhibition hall of shrines and chantries. As Winchester was built in a flood plain, its crypt is full of water, in which a naked Antony Gormley statue stands up to his shins, gazing at his cupped hands.</p> <h2>7. <strong>Westminster Abbey</strong></h2> <p>A jaded stage set for the rituals of monarchy, but its ambulatory is a fascinating junk shop of memorials of the great and no longer great, Highgate cemetery come to town. Beyond lies Henry VII\u2019s chapel, which, with its fan vault and dripping pendants, is surely the most dazzling interior in the land.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26a16630bee60a2734c5e610ab3d63672cb9ad08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26a16630bee60a2734c5e610ab3d63672cb9ad08/0_0_1956_2925/669.jpg\" alt=\"The octogonal tower at Ely.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The octogonal tower at Ely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Mayhew/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. <strong>York Minster</strong></h2> <p>A thumping Perpendicular palace, awesome from around the city walls. The largest cathedral by volume in England, with its newly restored east window containing the finest medieval glass.</p> <h2>5. <strong>Canterbury</strong></h2> <p>Silvery limestone towers beckon pilgrims across the Kent landscape to the earliest gothic work in England. A gruesome statue marks the spot where Thomas Becket died. The ancient crypt carvings are both terrifying and hilarious.</p> <h2>4. <strong>Durham</strong></h2> <p>A massive assertion of Norman power over the rebellious north, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/04/buy-a-classic-guardian-photograph-durham-cathedral-1979\">it\u2019s the most superbly sited of all cathedrals</a>. The drum roll of its mighty nave builds up to the spectacular retrochoir of double windows and weird sculptures.</p> <h2>3. <strong>Lincoln</strong></h2> <p>A mysterious warren of a cathedral, looking bashed about and in need of restoration.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s cathedrals are booming, even as parish churches are in decline. Attendance at Church of England cathedral services is up 14% in a decade and that does not include tourist visits. No one quite knows why. It appears to be a combination of music \u2013 especially evensong \u2013 fine art, architecture and coffee. In the language of the age, the cathedral offers an experience without a commitment. So which are the finest? 10. Norwich With its in-your-face tower and nave so grandly Romanesque you wonder why anyone bothered with gothic. The carved medieval figures on the doorway surrounds are delightful. 9. Salisbury The only cathedral designed in one go, and rather tedious as a result. But the view of the steeple is incomparable, a defining image of Englishness. The chapter house and cathedral close are exquisite. 8. Winchester Once the cathedral of a capital city, now famed for its west wall of Perpendicular glass and seemingly endless nave, giving way to a Norman transept more like a fortress than a church. The east end is an exhibition hall of shrines and chantries. As Winchester was built in a flood plain, its crypt is full of water, in which a naked Antony Gormley statue stands up to his shins, gazing at his cupped hands. 7. Westminster Abbey A jaded stage set for the rituals of monarchy, but its ambulatory is a fascinating junk shop of memorials of the great and no longer great, Highgate cemetery come to town. Beyond lies Henry VII\u2019s chapel, which, with its fan vault and dripping pendants, is surely the most dazzling interior in the land. 6. York Minster A thumping Perpendicular palace, awesome from around the city walls. The largest cathedral by volume in England, with its newly restored east window containing the finest medieval glass. 5. Canterbury Silvery limestone towers beckon pilgrims across the Kent landscape to the earliest gothic work in England. A gruesome statue marks the spot where Thomas Becket died. The ancient crypt carvings are both terrifying and hilarious. 4. Durham A massive assertion of Norman power over the rebellious north, it\u2019s the most superbly sited of all cathedrals. The drum roll of its mighty nave builds up to the spectacular retrochoir of double windows and weird sculptures. 3. Lincoln A mysterious warren of a cathedral, looking bashed about and in need of restoration. Its \u201ccrazy\u201d vault mystifies all who try to read it, while the Angel Choir boasts the imp turned to stone for insulting an angel. 2. Ely The ship of the Fens, its towers best seen floating on a morning mist across the fields. The swirling upward view inside the central lantern is near psychedelic \u2013 the view down from the gallery no less so. Exquisite carvings in its Lady Chapel still bear the scars of iconoclast vandalism. 1. Wells Its sculpted west front glows incomparably in the sunset, its giant scissor arches uplift its crossing, and its column capitals offer an encyclopedia of medieval life. Wells also boasts the most serene chapter house anywhere. Simon Jenkins\u2019s England\u2019s Cathedrals is published by Little, Brown \u2022 This article was amended on 27 November 2019.

The company\u2019s design chief then attempted to figuratively demonstrate this by throwing a ball at the car\u2019s \u201cshatterproof\u201d windows. The windows literally shattered and Tesla stock dropped more than 6%.</p> <p>The Cybertruck launch debacle doesn\u2019t appear to have done lasting damage to the vehicle\u2019s image. On Saturday, Musk jubilantly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280?s=20\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> to his 29.6 million followers that there had been \u201c146k Cybertruck orders so far \u2026 with no advertising\u201d. On Sunday, he tweeted: \u201c200K.\u201d And on Monday, Tesla stock rose <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-gains-elon-musk-tweets-cybertruck-pre-orders-2019-11-1028714931\" title=\"\">4% and Musk\u2019s net worth significantly recovered.</a></p> <p>The Cybertrucks retail at between $39,000 and $76,900. If Tesla had actually sold 200,000 of them in 72 hours, it would have been pretty incredible. But that 200,000 figure refers to a <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#battery\" title=\"\">fully refundable $100 deposit</a>; Tesla won\u2019t start manufacturing the apocalypse-chic vehicle until late 2021. I\u2019m willing to eat a hatchback if even 20% of those pre-orders translate into actual sales. It\u2019s far more likely that the majority of people who put down a deposit did so in order to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=bought%20a%20cybertruck&amp;src=typed_query\" title=\"\">post a boastful and/or jokey screenshot of their \u201cpurchase\u201d</a> on social media.</p> <p>Musk has quite the track record of tweeting misleading statements that drive Tesla stock up.

      "bodyText": "What goes down Musk go up, according to Tesla\u2019s third law of Twitter-based motion. On Thursday, Elon Musk\u2019s net worth plunged by $768m (\u00a3588m) after Tesla unveiled its ugly new Cybertruck. \u201cIt is literally bulletproof to a 9mm handgun,\u201d Musk proudly announced of the futuristic take on a pickup truck. The company\u2019s design chief then attempted to figuratively demonstrate this by throwing a ball at the car\u2019s \u201cshatterproof\u201d windows. The windows literally shattered and Tesla stock dropped more than 6%. The Cybertruck launch debacle doesn\u2019t appear to have done lasting damage to the vehicle\u2019s image. On Saturday, Musk jubilantly tweeted to his 29.6 million followers that there had been \u201c146k Cybertruck orders so far \u2026 with no advertising\u201d. On Sunday, he tweeted: \u201c200K.\u201d And on Monday, Tesla stock rose 4% and Musk\u2019s net worth significantly recovered. The Cybertrucks retail at between $39,000 and $76,900. If Tesla had actually sold 200,000 of them in 72 hours, it would have been pretty incredible. But that 200,000 figure refers to a fully refundable $100 deposit; Tesla won\u2019t start manufacturing the apocalypse-chic vehicle until late 2021. I\u2019m willing to eat a hatchback if even 20% of those pre-orders translate into actual sales. It\u2019s far more likely that the majority of people who put down a deposit did so in order to post a boastful and/or jokey screenshot of their \u201cpurchase\u201d on social media. Musk has quite the track record of tweeting misleading statements that drive Tesla stock up. Last year, Musk inaccurately tweeted that he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share and had secured funding; the stock subsequently rose by as much as 13.3%. The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for the \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweet; eventually he promised to be a good boy and settled. While this Cybertruck incident may not be entirely the same, it still demonstrates that Musk\u2019s online activity can have a somewhat unsettling effect on real world markets.",

Speaking at a campaign event in Bolton on Tuesday, the Conservative chancellor was asked seven times whether he would use those terms to describe Muslim women and he declined to give a direct answer. Johnson has refused to apologise for writing in a Telegraph column last year that Muslim women wearing burqas \u201clook like letter boxes\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d that anyone should choose to wear one. On a day when the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, faced trenchant criticism for his party\u2019s record on antisemitism, Javid was questioned about his own leader\u2019s use of language on Muslims. Asked directly whether he would use a term like \u201cletterbox\u201d or \u201cbank robber\u201d to describe a Muslim woman in a burqa, Javid said: \u201cThe prime minister himself has been asked that question a number of times and he explained why he used that language \u2013 it was to defend the rights of women, whether Muslim women or otherwise \u2026 so he\u2019s explained that and given a perfectly valid explanation.\u201d He added that any hatred was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that the Conservative party was \u201cabsolutely at one on that\u201d.

He said: \u201cAll politicians will choose their own words when they\u2019re explaining whatever is the point they\u2019re trying to get across. \u201cThat particular article, the prime minister has explained what was the purpose of his article and how he was actually trying to defend the rights of women, in that case, to wear what they like. \u201cI think articles like that are best read in their entirety so people can understand the point being made rather than picking out certain words.\u201d Javid was asked a further four times whether he would use those terms and he refused to give a direct answer. Javid was also asked whether he was disappointed that the Conservative party\u2019s inquiry into Islamophobia \u2013 which he had pushed for \u2013 had been widened to include all forms of hatred.

      "body": "<p>Michael Gove has hit a new low in the political discourse by quoting a Stormzy lyric in a Twitter beef with the Labour MP Angela Rayner. After Stormzy endorsed Jeremy Corbyn and laid into Boris Johnson, Gove dismissed him \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1199299773293051906\" title=\"\">as a far, far better rapper than he is a political analyst</a>\u201d. Rayner tweeted that \u201cGove is crap at both\u201d, which prompted Gove to cram his entire foot into his mouth with the comeback: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/1199304826468876288\">I set trends dem man copy</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/i-set-trends-dem-man-copy-michael-gove-mocks-stormzy-labour-support\">'I set trends dem man copy': Michael Gove mocks Stormzy Labour support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Twitter reaction was swift and unforgiving, not least because it is never ends well when a politician tries so painfully to be \u201cdown with the kids\u201d. But, aside from the usual uncle-dancing-at-wedding cringing about it, one Twitter user, @Duggs_Bunny, got to the heart of the matter with a reply to Gove that read: \u201cCongrats, you\u2019ve found the Twitter equivalent of blackface.\u201d</p> <p>Gove\u2019s dismissal of Stormzy as a rapper rather than analyst highlights the sneering elitist bigotry behind the tweet. It appears beyond his comprehension that Stormzy could possibly be intelligent, political <em>and</em> rap. Never mind that the roots of rap music lie in hip-hop which was, at first, as much social commentary as entertainment. Stormzy has been a critic of Tory policy, particularly around Grenfell; he has created a scholarship for young people to go to Cambridge; he has launched the #Merky Books imprint to showcase a \u201cnew generation\u201d of voices. Stormzy is a far better source for political analysis than Gove, who is so distant from the daily realities of regular people he could not possibly understand them.</p> <p>For Gove, Stormzy\u2019s rap lyrics have no merit other than to be appropriated. No doubt he revelled in being able to use \u201cdem\u201d, at once showing off his \u201cstreet\u201d credentials, while also highlighting his linguistic superiority. He probably aimed to mock the supposedly out-of-his-depth rapper; to show him the error of his ways for daring to call out the politician. The tweet was particularly insensitive given Johnson\u2019s history of calling \u201cdem man\u201d \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has hit a new low in the political discourse by quoting a Stormzy lyric in a Twitter beef with the Labour MP Angela Rayner. After Stormzy endorsed Jeremy Corbyn and laid into Boris Johnson, Gove dismissed him \u201cas a far, far better rapper than he is a political analyst\u201d. Rayner tweeted that \u201cGove is crap at both\u201d, which prompted Gove to cram his entire foot into his mouth with the comeback: \u201cI set trends dem man copy.\u201d The Twitter reaction was swift and unforgiving, not least because it is never ends well when a politician tries so painfully to be \u201cdown with the kids\u201d. But, aside from the usual uncle-dancing-at-wedding cringing about it, one Twitter user, @Duggs_Bunny, got to the heart of the matter with a reply to Gove that read: \u201cCongrats, you\u2019ve found the Twitter equivalent of blackface.\u201d Gove\u2019s dismissal of Stormzy as a rapper rather than analyst highlights the sneering elitist bigotry behind the tweet. It appears beyond his comprehension that Stormzy could possibly be intelligent, political and rap. Never mind that the roots of rap music lie in hip-hop which was, at first, as much social commentary as entertainment. Stormzy has been a critic of Tory policy, particularly around Grenfell; he has created a scholarship for young people to go to Cambridge; he has launched the #Merky Books imprint to showcase a \u201cnew generation\u201d of voices. Stormzy is a far better source for political analysis than Gove, who is so distant from the daily realities of regular people he could not possibly understand them. For Gove, Stormzy\u2019s rap lyrics have no merit other than to be appropriated. No doubt he revelled in being able to use \u201cdem\u201d, at once showing off his \u201cstreet\u201d credentials, while also highlighting his linguistic superiority. He probably aimed to mock the supposedly out-of-his-depth rapper; to show him the error of his ways for daring to call out the politician. The tweet was particularly insensitive given Johnson\u2019s history of calling \u201cdem man\u201d \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. Next time, Gove should take the advice from the title of the song he\u2019s quoting and \u201cshut up\u201d. Let\u2019s hope, for all our sakes, this is not a trend that his fellow politicians want to follow. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2019 because an earlier version named the wrong Twitter user, @bugsbunny. This has been corrected to @Duggs_Bunny.",

      "body": "<p>Underdog stories make for great TV, and viewers of Wednesday night\u2019s Aria awards are primed for an all-timer: the ascension of the 26-year-old Mornington Peninsula musician Tones and I from one-time busker to multiple prize-winner.</p> <p>Since releasing her debut single, Johnny Run Away, earlier this year, Tones \u2013 real name Toni Watson \u2013 has sped up the charts, with her second release, Dance Monkey, spending 16 weeks at the top, breaking Ed Sheeran\u2019s record for longest-running Aria No 1. In her first year of eligibility, Watson has been nominated for six awards, including song of the year, best female artist, breakthrough artist and best pop release.</p> <p>Dance Monkey, the multi-instrumentalist\u2019s second single, is the only Australian song to reach the Aria Top 50\u2019s top spot this year, and has held fast despite stiff competition from international stalwarts like Post Malone, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a hit in Australia, either. The track spent eight weeks at No 1 in the UK, 13 weeks at No 1 in Norway, 10 weeks at No 1 in New Zealand and eight weeks at No 1 in Austria and Switzerland. In just one November week, Dance Monkey was streamed 40m times in China; since its release, it has racked up close to a billion streams around the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0hyYWKXF0Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q0hyYWKXF0Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Watson is currently in the midst of what seems to be an ambitious bid to top the American singles chart, too: Dance Monkey currently sits at No 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, having jumped by around 20 chart points each week since its debut six weeks ago \u2013 and she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQxG8ZjYO8\">got a standing ovation for it on Jimmy Fallon</a> last week. At the time of writing, Tones and I is the 27th most-streamed artist on Spotify in the world.</p> <h2><strong>Who even is Tones and I?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"584b12f668df2e99111580574fb6adefc2f8ee92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/584b12f668df2e99111580574fb6adefc2f8ee92/0_553_3333_4167/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tones and I at the 21st NRJ music awards in Paris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tones and I at the 21st NRJ music awards in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Doignon/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson first tried her hand at busking in September 2017 on a trip to Byron Bay, and met her future manager during her first set. She quit her Melbourne retail job shortly after, deciding instead to move in to the manager\u2019s Gold Coast home and write music full-time. After being uploaded to Triple J Unearthed, Johnny Run Away was added to rotation on Triple J.</p> <p>Outside of the origin story, we don\u2019t know much else. She\u2019s only done a few interviews, and misinformation seems to be rampant: her Wikipedia page\u2019s edit history reveals users caught up in a fight over whether she\u2019s currently aged 19 or 26. (A rep for Tones and I confirmed to the Guardian that she is in her mid-20s.) Watson still performs without a band because that\u2019s how she first gained notoriety. \u201cPeople like me for who I am,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/meet-tones-and-i-busker-unearthed-profile-interview/10831236\">she told Triple J</a> earlier this year, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna change that.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What is it about this song?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to explain the secret to Dance Monkey\u2019s success. On a fundamental level, it is a very easy song to listen to, comprised of loops that are built and layered throughout the track; by around 30 seconds in, you know exactly what you\u2019ll get for the next three minutes. Listening to the song, then, is less about any potential elements of surprise than it is about hearing the same motif refracted and built upon in different ways. Like having your feed flooded with variations on the same meme over and over, it\u2019s consumption that requires almost no mental effort.</p> <p>Combine this with the fact of Watson\u2019s voice \u2013 a strange and craggy instrument that\u2019s completely singular among the virtuosic vocal performances topping pop charts right now \u2013 and you have a track that still feels like the work of an underdog despite its overwhelming success.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQxG8ZjYO8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4iQxG8ZjYO8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>How do the Arias work, and what will happen on Wednesday?</strong></h2> <p>Anything released by a member organisation of the Australian Record Industry Association (Aria) can be nominated for an Aria award. The association is comprised largely of record labels, but some independent musicians and managers are also members, as well as manufacturers, distributors and other industry organisations. Records are submitted by member organisations for nomination, and subsequently voted on by the Aria voting academy \u2013 a body of around 800 to 1,000 music industry representatives selected by Aria.

      "bodyText": "Underdog stories make for great TV, and viewers of Wednesday night\u2019s Aria awards are primed for an all-timer: the ascension of the 26-year-old Mornington Peninsula musician Tones and I from one-time busker to multiple prize-winner. Since releasing her debut single, Johnny Run Away, earlier this year, Tones \u2013 real name Toni Watson \u2013 has sped up the charts, with her second release, Dance Monkey, spending 16 weeks at the top, breaking Ed Sheeran\u2019s record for longest-running Aria No 1. In her first year of eligibility, Watson has been nominated for six awards, including song of the year, best female artist, breakthrough artist and best pop release. Dance Monkey, the multi-instrumentalist\u2019s second single, is the only Australian song to reach the Aria Top 50\u2019s top spot this year, and has held fast despite stiff competition from international stalwarts like Post Malone, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift. It\u2019s not just a hit in Australia, either. The track spent eight weeks at No 1 in the UK, 13 weeks at No 1 in Norway, 10 weeks at No 1 in New Zealand and eight weeks at No 1 in Austria and Switzerland. In just one November week, Dance Monkey was streamed 40m times in China; since its release, it has racked up close to a billion streams around the world. Watson is currently in the midst of what seems to be an ambitious bid to top the American singles chart, too: Dance Monkey currently sits at No 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, having jumped by around 20 chart points each week since its debut six weeks ago \u2013 and she got a standing ovation for it on Jimmy Fallon last week. At the time of writing, Tones and I is the 27th most-streamed artist on Spotify in the world. Who even is Tones and I? Watson first tried her hand at busking in September 2017 on a trip to Byron Bay, and met her future manager during her first set. She quit her Melbourne retail job shortly after, deciding instead to move in to the manager\u2019s Gold Coast home and write music full-time. After being uploaded to Triple J Unearthed, Johnny Run Away was added to rotation on Triple J. Outside of the origin story, we don\u2019t know much else. She\u2019s only done a few interviews, and misinformation seems to be rampant: her Wikipedia page\u2019s edit history reveals users caught up in a fight over whether she\u2019s currently aged 19 or 26. (A rep for Tones and I confirmed to the Guardian that she is in her mid-20s.) Watson still performs without a band because that\u2019s how she first gained notoriety. \u201cPeople like me for who I am,\u201d she told Triple J earlier this year, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna change that.\u201d What is it about this song? It\u2019s hard to explain the secret to Dance Monkey\u2019s success. On a fundamental level, it is a very easy song to listen to, comprised of loops that are built and layered throughout the track; by around 30 seconds in, you know exactly what you\u2019ll get for the next three minutes. Listening to the song, then, is less about any potential elements of surprise than it is about hearing the same motif refracted and built upon in different ways. Like having your feed flooded with variations on the same meme over and over, it\u2019s consumption that requires almost no mental effort. Combine this with the fact of Watson\u2019s voice \u2013 a strange and craggy instrument that\u2019s completely singular among the virtuosic vocal performances topping pop charts right now \u2013 and you have a track that still feels like the work of an underdog despite its overwhelming success. How do the Arias work, and what will happen on Wednesday? Anything released by a member organisation of the Australian Record Industry Association (Aria) can be nominated for an Aria award. The association is comprised largely of record labels, but some independent musicians and managers are also members, as well as manufacturers, distributors and other industry organisations. Records are submitted by member organisations for nomination, and subsequently voted on by the Aria voting academy \u2013 a body of around 800 to 1,000 music industry representatives selected by Aria. (The makeup of the voting academy is not public information, but representatives come from all fields of the industry.) There is only one round of voting, during which the academy votes on all submissions; nominees and winners are determined in this round. If Watson wins all of the Arias she\u2019s up for \u2013 the four previously mentioned awards, plus best video and independent release (Watson releases music through her own imprint Bad Batch, despite all its marketing, operations and distribution being handled by Sony) \u2013 she\u2019ll join the ranks of Delta Goodrem and Silverchair as a rare artist to sweep the awards on first try. It\u2019s not entirely unlikely that Watson will win, too. Commercial acumen is prized in these awards \u2013 you can only be nominated for best song or album if your recording places on the Top 50 chart, for example \u2013 and many voters will likely be inclined to vote for Watson simply because she\u2019s been the most visible Australian musical export in a long time. Nominees are more variegated than ever this year \u2013 best song, for example, includes Morgan Evans\u2019 bro-country hit Day Drunk, Guy Sebastian\u2019s gospel-lite Choir, psych-rock, rap and more \u2013 a fact that makes many awards hard to judge. (How does one even begin to compare Birds of Tokyo and Watson?) The easy out, obviously, is to simply award the most commercially successful. Who else could win? Watson does face stiff competition: In the best song category, she\u2019s up against Ocean Alley\u2019s Hottest 100-winning single Confidence as well as labelmate Amy Shark\u2019s Mess Her Up; and she goes head-to-head with singer-songwriter Thelma Plum for best pop release, best female artist and best breakthrough artist. Plum, who goes into Wednesday night with five nominations, already picked up a trophy for best cover art at the pre-ceremony artisan awards for her record Better In Blak; like Watson, she is a first-time nominee. Another artist worth keeping an eye on during Wednesday\u2019s awards is the beloved Australian rock statesman Paul Kelly, who has already won best classical album for his record 13 Ways to Look at Birds, and is also nominated for best adult contemporary (for his latest album Nature), best blues and roots (for his recent live album) and best male artist. Kelly \u2013 who is undergoing something of a career renaissance, having just attained his third No 1 record in as many years \u2013 has already made Arias history, becoming the first artist to ever be nominated across three genres. Three more wins on Wednesday night would bring Kelly\u2019s career-length total to 17 awards from a whopping 53 nominations. \u2022 The Arias are broadcast on Wednesday 27 November at 7.30pm on Nine",

The 2019 Lowy global diplomatic index maps the size and reach of 61 diplomatic networks around the world by embassies, consulates, permanent missions and other diplomatic posts. Tracking all G20 and OECD countries, and most Asian nations, it showed an emerging China rivalling and, numerically at least, surpassing the US, caught \u201cin a period of limbo\u201d. China has 276 posts, three more than the US, and 96 consulates to the US\u2019s 88, a reflection of its emphasis on its economic and diplomatic interests. A Lowy Institute research fellow, Bonnie Bley, said although Beijing had put a significant diplomatic infrastructure in place, it reflected China\u2019s ambition more than its influence. \u201cThe US remains the global hub for diplomatic activity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is \u2013 by a wide margin \u2013 the most important place for countries to locate their diplomatic posts ... China \u2026 is a distant second.\u201d China continues to expand its diplomatic footprint \u2013 it has added five posts in the past two years \u2013 and America\u2019s has shrunk. It closed its St Petersburg consulate after its fallout with Russia. The Trump administration has not announced any new posts. Only 73% of the US state department\u2019s key positions are filled, the index reported. The former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, told Congress this month a \u201chollowed-out\u201d department was in \u201ccrisis\u201d, saying \u201cthe policy process is visibly unravelling\u201d. Australia went without a US ambassador for two years. Bley said staff vacancies nearly three years into Trump\u2019s term were concerning, but that the US\u2019s diplomatic influence, developed over decades, would not be unwound in a single presidential term. \u201cInstead, president Trump\u2019s abrupt abandonment of multilateral initiatives \u2013 the trans Pacific partnership, the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate agreement \u2013 is a greater threat to enduring US diplomatic influence,\u201d she said. Significantly, Beijing\u2019s advances have come at Taiwan\u2019s expense. In 2016 Taipei maintained 22 posts but this has dropped to 16. Beijing has opened five embassies \u2013 in El Salvador, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and the Dominican Republic \u2013 all countries that formerly recognised Taiwan. Australia\u2019s diplomatic footprint ranks 27th in the world. It is second-last in the G20, ahead of only Saudi Arabia, and 20th of the 36 OECD countries. \u201cAustralia continues to run a diplomatic deficit: at 27th place, it is on par with Belgium, despite having more than twice the population and almost three times the economic size,\u201d the index report said. \u201cWhile many countries continue to grow their own networks, Australia is treading water.

Many victims said an earlier round of more than NZ$10m raised by New Zealand charity Victim Support was disbursed without consulting them. Basharati, the community advocate, said the agency and other bodies had relied too much on the same handful of local community leaders, and the conversations had not filtered down to those most affected.</p> <p>\u201cSome individuals who are part of the boards, some of them have never seen the faces of the victims. They\u2019ve never spoken to them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go individually, you speak to them, you go to their house, you give them respect individually.\u201d</p> <p>Some community members criticised a decision to exclude those present at the mosques \u2013 but who were not shot \u2013 from most of the earlier funding. Others decried the ruling that those with severe, life-changing injuries \u2013 a woman paralysed, a man who might lose his hand \u2013 were given the same amounts as those with less serious wounds.</p> <p>The Christchurch Foundation plans, after the conversations with victims, to make payouts to the bereaved families and those shot in the attacks, and to set aside extra funding for the medical costs of those most seriously injured. Other tranches of money are set aside for children\u2019s education, hardship, and community initiatives.</p> <p>Some of the most severely injured were still recovering in hospital when the first round of funding was distributed, and their voices were absent from the conversations, said Basharati.</p> <p>In one case, a 25-year-old woman who was paralysed in the attack had been discharged from the hospital to a property that did not accommodate her needs, and had to be driven across the city every time she needed to shower.</p> <p>The government\u2019s housing agency had been in the process of making modifications to a home for the woman and her husband to move into, but Basharati said she had visited the property and found it was in \u201crevolting\u201d condition.</p> <p>Manji said when Basharati told him the situation, he helped arrange for the woman\u2019s compensation to be released to her early, and assembled a team of people \u2013 including a lawyer who spoke the woman\u2019s first language, and representatives of a local bank \u2013 so the woman and her husband could put down a deposit on their own home.</p> <h2>\u2018This will cost a lot of money\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c7e1655c5653d4e18429066a939ea05f5a6c3f32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7e1655c5653d4e18429066a939ea05f5a6c3f32/0_348_2619_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after Friday prayers at Hagley Park outside Al-Noor mosque in Christchurch in the days after the massacre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after Friday prayers at Hagley Park outside Al-Noor mosque in Christchurch in the days after the massacre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talking to survivors from month to month reveals the volatile nature of their situations, and the starkly different challenges each family faces.

He is barred from his previous work as a plasterer due to his injury and is retraining to be a social worker.</p> <p>The worst thing for many survivors is the uncertainty; some who are likely to be among the most severely affected do not yet know the outcomes of their medical situations.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to think about people who have bullet particles in their body, because if that bullet particle shifts, they could need emergency surgery,\u201d says Basharati, who believes more work should be done to track the victims and their needs. \u201cI mean, I get that this is the first time New Zealand has been going through something like this.

Megan Woods, the minister responsible for the government\u2019s response to the attacks, said in an emailed statement: \u201cThis attack was unlike any other in the history of our country, and providing appropriate support for the victims is a complex task but one that it is vital we get right.\u201d She cited the \u201cdedicated and personalised case managers\u201d each family had been assigned, and added that it was important to balance information-sharing requests between government agencies with \u201crespecting the privacy of victims and their families\u201d. \u2018There has to be integration\u2019 The government faced extraordinary challenges in responding to the attacks, partly because not all of the community had integrated into New Zealand life, and many did not understand how systems worked, said Zhiyan Basharati, an advocate for the victims in Christchurch who has worked with dozens of victims\u2019 families to raise their complaints with officials. Sometimes translators provided at meetings did not understand government systems either. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to bring people into the country, we need to make sure that they are integrating, that they feel safe, that there is no fear,\u201d said Basharati, whose family settled in New Zealand as Kurdish refugees in 2001. \u201cAnd to achieve that outcome, there has to be integration.\u201d Woods agreed in her statement that \u201cissues around assimilation and integration have come to the fore for the community in the months after the attacks\u201d. The Christchurch Foundation\u2019s interviews with members of the community came as the organisation prepared to distribute NZ$9m donated from around the world since March; Manji wanted the community\u2019s advice on what to do with the funds. Such questions have proved fraught. Many victims said an earlier round of more than NZ$10m raised by New Zealand charity Victim Support was disbursed without consulting them. Basharati, the community advocate, said the agency and other bodies had relied too much on the same handful of local community leaders, and the conversations had not filtered down to those most affected. \u201cSome individuals who are part of the boards, some of them have never seen the faces of the victims. They\u2019ve never spoken to them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go individually, you speak to them, you go to their house, you give them respect individually.\u201d Some community members criticised a decision to exclude those present at the mosques \u2013 but who were not shot \u2013 from most of the earlier funding. Others decried the ruling that those with severe, life-changing injuries \u2013 a woman paralysed, a man who might lose his hand \u2013 were given the same amounts as those with less serious wounds. The Christchurch Foundation plans, after the conversations with victims, to make payouts to the bereaved families and those shot in the attacks, and to set aside extra funding for the medical costs of those most seriously injured. Other tranches of money are set aside for children\u2019s education, hardship, and community initiatives. Some of the most severely injured were still recovering in hospital when the first round of funding was distributed, and their voices were absent from the conversations, said Basharati. In one case, a 25-year-old woman who was paralysed in the attack had been discharged from the hospital to a property that did not accommodate her needs, and had to be driven across the city every time she needed to shower. The government\u2019s housing agency had been in the process of making modifications to a home for the woman and her husband to move into, but Basharati said she had visited the property and found it was in \u201crevolting\u201d condition. Manji said when Basharati told him the situation, he helped arrange for the woman\u2019s compensation to be released to her early, and assembled a team of people \u2013 including a lawyer who spoke the woman\u2019s first language, and representatives of a local bank \u2013 so the woman and her husband could put down a deposit on their own home. \u2018This will cost a lot of money\u2019 Talking to survivors from month to month reveals the volatile nature of their situations, and the starkly different challenges each family faces. Al Zarzour\u2019s parents and brother have arrived in New Zealand to help him and his wife and children, and are likely to be able to stay long term, providing the government approves visas for them. The presence of his relatives had been comforting and helpful, he said, but \u201cmore responsibility\u201d too; once their visas are processed, he must help them find jobs and a place to live. \u201cThey are my family, and it is my responsibility to find for them a house to rent and buy a car and then to buy the things in the house,\u201d says al Zarzour, who survived after the shootings on donated grocery vouchers. \u201cThis will cost a lot of money.\u201d His landlord has told him he must vacate his rental home by April, so he must also find a new house for his family of five. He is barred from his previous work as a plasterer due to his injury and is retraining to be a social worker. The worst thing for many survivors is the uncertainty; some who are likely to be among the most severely affected do not yet know the outcomes of their medical situations. \u201cWe need to think about people who have bullet particles in their body, because if that bullet particle shifts, they could need emergency surgery,\u201d says Basharati, who believes more work should be done to track the victims and their needs. \u201cI mean, I get that this is the first time New Zealand has been going through something like this. But we\u2019re not idiots.\u201d One of those whose future is in limbo is Ahmed Jahangir, the chairman of Linwood mosque \u2013 the second the gunman attacked \u2013 who is a good-humoured man with his arm in a sling and big dimples when he smiles. Jahangir, who was shot in the shoulder and has lost the use of his right hand, will not know for another year whether more treatment might help. For now, someone else is running the Indian restaurant that was his pride and joy.He is full of praise for how government officials dealt with his case, but his future, and that of his young family and his business, are up in the air. \u201cAs of now, I haven\u2019t planned anything for the next year after this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it as it comes. No certainty yet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A controversial Chinese-backed multi-million-dollar tourist development in Tasmania has been blocked by the state\u2019s planning commission, which found the application to rezone 3,000 hectares of agricultural land was not supported by the necessary paperwork. Australian-listed company Cambria Green applied for the creation of a special development zone in April 2018 to enable the construction of a sprawling complex including 550 accommodation units and hotel rooms, two golf courses and an 80-bed health spa or palliative care unit. The proposed development overlooks Freycinet National Park, near Swansea, and covers 12 titles owned by seven companies and two individuals. The land was purchased in 2015, and nine of the purchases were made on the same day. All but one of the companies \u2013 Cambria Green Agriculture Development Pty Ltd \u2013 are incorporated in Hong Kong. In a scathing decision published on Friday, the planning commission said the proponent failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove it had the consent of all of the Hong Kong-based landowners to make the rezoning application, and had failed to comply with the Corporations Act in the letter of consent for the one title owned by Cambria Green. There was therefore \u201cno valid amendment request\u201d for it to consider. The decision means Cambria Green would have to re-submit its rezoning application to council, beginning the two-year process anew, to resurrect the development. The letter of consent for three titles was signed by Shandong businessman Liu Kejing, who was listed as the owner. One was signed by another landholder. Cambria Green manager Ronald Hu said Liu was also the signatory for the seven other companies, claiming Liu was the sole shareholder and director. The commission said consent forms from seven of the companies appeared to have been signed using identical Chinese characters but that it had not been provided with evidence to prove either that the signatory was Liu or that Liu had the authority to sign for those companies. Those letters did not list the name of the signatory. One of the companies, Shenglong Hong Kong Investment Ltd, listed Liu as the minority shareholder, with the other director controlling 90% of the company. Liu was also the sole signatory for Cambria Green Agriculture Development Pty Ltd despite not being the sole director, which the commission said made that letter non-compliant with the Australian Corporations Act. Hu and his lawyers did not provide documentary evidence or statutory declarations to prove consent had been obtained. He made two unsworn statements and gave unsworn oral evidence at a hearing of the planning commission in Hobart in August, before commission chair Ann Cunningham and Peter Fischer. They wrote that they found his evidence \u201cdefensive, evasive and not credible\u201d. Hu\u2019s argument that he had been told Liu had the power to act on behalf of Shenglong was dismissed as \u201cunreliable hearsay evidence\u201d. He admitted he had made mistakes, described inconsistencies in the paperwork as \u201cprinting errors\u201d and invited the commission to look up public company information on the Hong Kong registry itself. The commission declined. The rezoning application was narrowly supported by Glamorgan Spring Bay Council in November 2018. The mayor, Debbie Wisby, who voted against the application, said the council accepted the planning commission\u2019s decision. \u201cWhere to from here will depend on the proponents.\u201d Greens leader Cassy O\u2019Connor said the proposal was a threat to the way of life for East Coast residents and to Tasmania\u2019s brand. She said the application was \u201copaque\u201d and that any renewed attempt to have the land rezoned would require the developer to provide a clear ownership structure for the companies involved. \u201cWe hope the proponents listen to the community and just be content to look after the 3,000-plus hectares as prime agricultural land, rather than try to develop it into a massive resort and palliative care centre for cashed up Chinese tourists.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats have been accused of peddling misinformation after distributing fake newspapers with names similar to be independent publications, prompting one local newspaper group to threaten to stop all coverage of the party. Jo Swinson\u2019s party has produced publications in more than a dozen seats with titles such as Cheltenham Courier, North West Leeds News and York News to promote their candidates. Each \u201cnewspaper\u201d has a similar look to a traditional news outlet but is accompanied by a small line of text saying it is a party publication. Toby Granville, the editorial director of Newsquest, a local newspaper group which owns titles in many marginal seats, said it was outrageous that the Lib Dems had produced a publication called the Gazette to promote their candidate in an area close to his company\u2019s Basingstoke Gazette title. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t pulled I\u2019ll advise all Newsquest editors not to publish any campaign news for your party,\u201d he told the Lib Dems. Ian Murray, the executive director of the Society of Editors, called for guidelines to stop political parties \u201cpackaging their partial messages to ape independent newspapers\u201d, while noting it was \u201cironic how \u2026 often politicians who complain about fake news then set out to at least blur the lines for readers\u201d. The Yorkshire Post went further and called the Lib Dems\u2019 Leeds publication a \u201cpiece of political propaganda masquerading as local news\u201d. In an editorial the newspaper said: \u201cHere we have someone peddling imitation newspapers around the country in the hope that those reading them will be fooled into thinking the messages are checked and endorsed by the same local journalists who fought for their libraries; demanded their A&amp;Es were saved; exposed that corrupt business person or found out the politician who was up to no good. \u201cWhen ordinary readers realise they\u2019ve been hoodwinked by the medium that looks just like ours, the next time they come to read journalism produced by us, they will trust it that bit less. This all leads to the powerful becoming more powerful; more insulated to scrutiny; less accountable to the public. It has to stop.\u201d The tactic of masquerading political pamphlets as newspapers has been used by all major British political parties for many years, with local Labour and Conservative candidates also taking the same approach during this election. The Tories have produced a similar publication called Pudsey Future, while voters in Tooting, south London, have received a publication called Daily Press, which presents itself as a newspaper that is \u201cfree, paid for by local residents\u201d, but does not state on its front page that it is a Labour campaign leaflet. Mark Pack, a veteran Lib Dem campaigner, said the aim was to get members of the public to pick up the newspapers when pushed through their door. \u201cThe intention from all the parties that use them is to get people reading them, and as long as it\u2019s made clear who the leaflet is from then that\u2019s as legit as any other leaflet or other piece of literature, not all of which say at the top who they are from but make it clear somewhere else,\u201d he said. However, the Lib Dems\u2019 systematic use of the approach during this campaign has attracted particular attention, potentially because of increased awareness around campaigning tactics and misinformation after recent election scandals. The party\u2019s infamous use of dubiously labelled bar charts to emphasise that they were in with a chance of winning a constituency has also come under repeated scrutiny, despite having been a standard campaign tactic for decades. The Lib Dems have been approached for comment. With just over a fortnight until polling day it is unlikely that any party will be tempted to bin printed campaign material.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe nature of the football sector where teams regularly travel great distances for fixtures, in addition to having international playing staff and managers who frequently fly \u2026 is a recipe for a high carbon footprint\u201d \u2013 Andrew Welfle, a climate researcher from the University of Manchester, after finding that air travel by the top 20 players nominated for the Ballon d\u2019Or has been responsible for producing 505 tonnes of CO2 emissions this year alone. RECOMMENDED LOOKING It\u2019s David Squires on \u2026 Jos\u00e9 Gerry Francis Mourinho. RECOMMENDED LISTENING You can catch up on the latest Football Weekly podcast right here. RECOMMENDED VOTING Vote! Vote! Vote! And \u2026 Vote! Vote! Vote! FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Still Want More? Your writers would be better off channelling Mick Jones, rather than Joe Strummer, given that it was Mick\u2019s mangled vocals that made Should I Stay or Should I Go so winsome. And like many managers, he was sacked. Definitely go, in his case\u201d \u2013 Nick Austin. \u201cThere\u2019s something strange about nostalgia and memories of old football. Looking back at the top 10 summer transfers of 1996 in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, it turns out that we (\u2018we\u2019 being Sheffield Wednesday) only spent half a million less on Huddersfield legend Andy Booth than Juventus spent on Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid spent on Clarence Seedorf. To be fair though, spending like that did get us where we belong\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cAfter the recent sad passing of the great celebrity photographer Terry O\u2019Neill, I chanced upon the archive of his photographs and what a veritable treasure trove it is; Johan Cruyff in his pomp, Paul Gascoigne looking like his Madame Tussauds waxwork circa 1992 and this really should have been made into a hit TV detective series (based on the classic novels of Newcastle manager Bernard Cribbins). Apropos of nothing, do any of The Fiver\u2019s 1,057 pedants have any idea who \u2018unknown\u2019 is in this photo of ITV\u2019s 1974 World Cup pundits?\u201d \u2013 er, Noble Francis.

BITS AND BOBS: ADMIN SPECIAL Pep Guardiola doesn\u2019t want to see Mikel Arteta leaving his role as Manchester City No 2 for another gig this season. \u201cI\u2019d like him to stay with us,\u201d he cooed. \u201cManchester City has a person of incredible value to work here in the future. But professional desires are professional desires.\u201d Brighton like the cut of Graham Potter\u2019s jib and have extended his contract through to 2025. \u201cI\u2019ve had a tremendous welcome from everyone connected to the club \u2013 staff, players and fans \u2013 and have found it very easy to settle,\u201d he trousered. Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers chairman Dave King is stepping down. \u201cI cannot overemphasise how stressful [it] has been for me personally and to my fellow directors on the board as we had to juggle our personal finances to make funds available to the club at short notice,\u201d he tooted. \u201cIt is a private joke between [deputy chairman] Douglas Park and myself that every time I meet him I ignore the customary handshake and put my hand straight into his pocket. Thankfully it was always filled with cash.\u201d Carlisle have appointed assistant manager Chris Beech as their new head coach after Steven Pressley was sacked a fortnight ago. Craig Gardner will become Birmingham City first-team coach in July once he has retired from playing at the end of the season. \u201cTo be given this opportunity is a privilege and this club is a great place to be,\u201d he cheered. And Lyon\u2019s owners are in talks to buy NWSL franchise Reign FC. \u201cOur ambition has always been to operate the best women\u2019s football club in the world,\u201d whooped Reign co-owner Bill Predmore. \u201cThis is a distinction long held by OL, making them the perfect organisation to help us achieve our long-term objectives for the club.\u201d STILL WANT MORE?

We are not drafting an IPCC report,\u201d Canfin said. \u201cWe are drafting something that will apply to business, SMEs, agriculture, farmers and citizens.\u201d The Greens\u2019 preferred goal of at least 65% is based on a recommendation by the Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, a coalition of 1,700 NGOs that bases its analysis on an an IPCC report on how to keep global heating below 1.5C. That report shows other pathways to cut emissions, but some increase the risk of overshooting the 1.5C ceiling on temperature rises, which scientists say is essential to avoid the most dangerous consequences. The scale of the task was outlined by the UN environmental agency on Tuesday, when it reported that global emissions must fall by more than 7% each year from now until 2030 to stay within the 1.5C limit. Most EU member states have signed up to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, although Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary continue to hold out, as they await promised EU funds to help their economies go green. The EU has focused its attention on the more distant 2050 target, fearful of damaging splits over the imminent 2030 deadline. \u201cWe have been campaigning on the increase of the 2030 target for years and it was disgracefully ignored,\u201d said Klaus R\u00f6hrig, EU climate and energy policy coordinator at CAN Europe. The EU\u2019s current objective is to cut emissions by 40% by 2030, which was \u201cshockingly insufficient\u201d R\u00f6hrig said.",

On Saturday evenings, in community centres turned banquet halls, we huddled by round tables and scraped jollof rice from our plates while Afrobeat and African highlife blared from heavy speakers. Vocalists floated over pulsing drums and jazz-tinged brass. The songs sounded like sunshine and our parents danced through the evening till the sky went pink.</p> <p>I hear the hall party in J Hus. There is a softness in his songs, a feeling of grace and ease that casts me back to those summer dances in south London.</p> <p>We both hail from a generation tugged between our family\u2019s native lands and our own birth country. Black kids raised in Britain by immigrant parents and grandparents who moved up the Atlantic from Africa. They left Gambia and Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon; with them, they brought artists such as Fela Kuti and Victor Uwaifo, whose music told stories of the countries they had left behind.</p> <p>But our upbringings, in new towns amid foreign cultures, meant we sat slightly askew from our parents. We had United Kingdom on our birth certificates and British accents on our tongues. Outside of our homes, away from the grip of family gatherings and hall parties, we were reared on homegrown genres such as grime and UK rap; we discovered bashment from our Caribbean neighbours.

His mother came to England from Gambia and raised him in Stratford, taking him to parties where, he says, they played \u201cAfrican music all night long\u201d. Early music memories also include bashment, Michael Jackson tapes, and reeling off grime verses with his friends at school. When he started rapping, it seemed natural to incorporate them all.</p> <p>His debut album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/11/j-hus-common-sense-review-unashamed-grooves-from-east-london-rapper\">Common Sense</a> is where diaspora genre boundaries crumble; the 2017 record, nominated for three Brit awards, finds comfort in their dust. It blends the lightness of Afrobeats and bashment with the grittier tones of UK rap. The influences are vast and reflect the range of sounds and cultures that raised a generation of black British kids \u2013 Hus flits between pidgin English, patois and even cockney.</p> <p>The production is handled by Hus\u2019s long-time collaborator, JAE5. Apart, they are stellar but unified the music approaches something divine. On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rk6_Ax0mQo\">Did You See</a>, Hus glides over tingling marimbas like birds skimming the sea, his voice at one with bashment-inspired melodies, deftly curling round the warm bassline and slightly off-key percussion. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkS9tn8idEc\">Plottin</a> nods to the bounce and easy delivery of Mike Skinner and UK garage; the menacing thump of Clartin is pure gangsta rap, but you can hear traces of grime in his stammering delivery.</p> <p>The album is a generational story captured in sound, a tale of immigration and new identities woven across 17 songs. In the ongoing conversation about what it means to be both black and British, Common Sense carves out a home in a country that can feel foreign, a reminder that though we are a generation stranded between heritage and birthplace, we have music that is distinctly our own, melodies that explain our existence, and albums that pay homage to the music we were raised on as well as the new sounds that found us in Britain.</p> <p>From as early as 2011, there were dancehall-drenched cult rap classics such as Sneakbo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgO9tem1ObY\">Touch Ah Button</a> and posse cuts like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luY34wzR8_I\">Gal Call Mi Up</a>; the likes of Timbo had begun to successfully blend rap with Afrobeats. But what set Hus apart was the way he blurred the lines between all three and sang while doing it.</p> <p>This inclination comes from slightly further afield: Hus grew up in an era where 50 Cent reigned supreme and In Da Club rang out at every kid\u2019s birthday party. Hus has said that 50 has been \u201ca massive inspiration\u201d and that 2003\u2019s Get Rich Or Die Tryin\u2019 was \u201cone of the first albums I ever bought and listened to from start to finish\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rk6_Ax0mQo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3rk6_Ax0mQo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>You can hear the influence in the way he slips in and out of his low-crooned vocals, how he half-raps and half-sings, rarely committing totally to either. Instead of 50\u2019s slurry east coast drawl, Hus adopts a distinctly black British cadence. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gttfNjIDg\">Dem Boy Paigon</a>, his first breakout song, is testament to this unique style. Released in 2015, the instrumental was gritty and haunting, with Afrobeats and trap stitched into its fabric by teenage producers Hendrix and Beatz. Throughout, Hus switches style like a boxer switches stance, murmuring in pidgin and patois before breaking into strait-laced English during the final verse.</p> <p>The versatility of tone makes him adept at almost any genre that falls under the black British family tree. In this golden period of British music, where rap and grime have completed blistering ascents, traces of J Hus can be found across the era\u2019s seminal records. He is the only artist to feature on all of the most recent albums from Skepta, Dave and Stormzy, coveted for his inimitable range of vocals.</p> <p>He has diamonds on his tongue. He is in a league by himself. He finds comfort no matter the setting. I have seen his songs turn out bashment raves in south London, blare from soundsystems at Notting Hill carnival, grip crowds in Ghana and the floor at Nigerian wedding receptions. His music is welcomed under all roofs, a pioneer who has translated the black British experience into sound. He has cleared the path for a new crop of musicians to avoid quarantine by genre: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9RnnZf6zHQ\">Not3s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvNANmsC0ds\">NSG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY2H2AU0moA\">Belly Squad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1mUEhKQfc\">Lotto Boyzz</a> and more, with few objections to the way these artists hop between sounds.</p> <p>Behind every rap icon is a story about the moment they straightened their lives out. Skepta flew to America and slept on friends\u2019 floors while gathering inspiration for Konnichiwa. Stormzy quit a steady job at an oil refinery when he watched neighbourhood friends Krept and Konan win a Mobo award on TV. Rappers\u2019 fables always begin at these forks in the road, and J Hus has his own.</p> <p>On a late summer evening in 2014, somewhere in the East End, J Hus sat in a car with his childhood friend Moe. As night descended, conversation turned to the future. Hus had been incarcerated twice already and was unsure about which direction to steer his life in. When he asked his friend for counsel, Moe told him to give music a go. Hus agreed, but only if Moe would manage him. Five years on, Common Sense is certified gold, Did You See is certified platinum, and Hus has toured Europe. He is still managed by Moe and his brother Kilo under their company 2K Management.</p> <p>But in 2015, Hus was stabbed five times, and a year later was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon. He would serve five months in jail, hearing inmates thump the walls whenever his songs played on the radio. A few months later, I stood in the rafters of a full O2 Arena for the <a href=\"https://www.redbull.com/car-en/culture-clash-jamaica-2019\">Red Bull Culture Clash</a>, a soundclash between four battling soundsystems. Rumours floated up that Hus was free, that he would show up to surprise us all \u2013 and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jR67XTL0yaU?t=2103\">he was duly brought out as a special guest</a> by Brooklyn-based dancehall label <a href=\"http://mixpakrecords.com/\">Mixpak</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuXwFqjYVNw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QuXwFqjYVNw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We erupted at his appearance, jubilant at his return, as he yelled the shifting melodies of Dem Boy Paigon. It felt like the opening of a new chapter, Hus dusting himself off from a prison sentence to return to where he belonged: the stage. But two years later, in December 2018 he was convicted again, this time for carrying a knife. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/14/j-hus-jail-knife\">He was sentenced to eight months</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a story of the problems faced by young rappers who have emerged from inner cities in the last half of the decade \u2013 rappers whose lives have changed so quickly with record deals and brand endorsements that they have had little time to adjust and leave old circumstances behind.</p> <p>The path to becoming a legitimate career musician is a tightrope, and many, including J Hus, have stumbled. In the courtroom, the day he was sentenced, Hus\u2019s lawyer told the judge that \u201chis client had felt isolated because of his fame,\u201d and had suffered from PTSD after the 2015 stabbing.</p> <p>He hints at the fallout in his music. In a freestyle from May 2015, Hus is mournfully poetic, rapping \u201cTell me why I always die when I\u2019m having dreams / I had a dream that my mother had to bury me / I got rolled on by the enemy / They turnt J Hus to a memory.\u201d These lines bring into focus the pressures shouldered by working class teenagers growing up in the UK\u2019s inner cities, and how, layered beneath frightening headlines, are young men in need of help.</p> <p>By April 2019, J Hus was a free man again. Hours after he left his cell, he walked out on to the O2 Arena stage once more \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/06/british-rapper-j-hus-released-from-jail-performs-at-drake-show-london\">this time with Drake</a>. Seemingly halfway between laughter and tears, he told the crowd \u201cI missed you so much\u201d; they wailed in disbelief as he performed Did You See.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1801f39c23d891686f9f59ec5af5fac2a25300f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1801f39c23d891686f9f59ec5af5fac2a25300f5/0_0_6782_4521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J Hus at Wireless festival, Finsbury Park, London, 7 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J Hus at Wireless festival, Finsbury Park, London, 7 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Garfitt/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from an appearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/08/wireless-festival-review-future-young-thug-cardi-b-finsbury-park-london\">at Wireless festival</a> over the summer, he then went into hibernation, prepping a second album. His social media channels detailed further battles with his mental health. In October on Snapchat, he opened up in a series of posts, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be here no more. Not that I\u2019m stressed or fed up, it\u2019s just I need to go to the next stage,\u201d and also mentioned that his forthcoming album \u201cwill be a good note to end on\u201d. Years after that verse about dreams of dying, the mood still lingers in his music: a recent freestyle contained the line \u201cself-medicate myself through my depression,\u201d his delivery so smooth that it is easy to gloss over the bleak reality he speaks of.</p> <p>Earlier this month, new song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2D8OkMKsG4\">Must Be</a> was released, with all the charm and finesse that stole our ears years ago. Back in arms with his masterful accomplice JAE5, Hus slides over soft strings and a deep bass. A weeping saxophone and strings herald a bittersweet return \u2013 the lyrics are east London war stories, awash with the sense of distrust that still haunts his life. Even at this testing hour, the quality of music is never in question, but supporters are anxious about how the next chapter of his story will play out.</p> <p>Many hope for his peace. Whatever happens, his first chapter changed the course of black British music and picked apart the lives of a generation. Through his hybrid music, J Hus told the story of African kids who grew up on rap and grime, ate jollof at family functions and sang 50 Cent in the school playground. It\u2019s the music we\u2019ll one day play to our own children, years far from now when albums like Common Sense remind us not to forget the lands we came from and the cultures in which we were raised. It is music that reflects our chaotic identities. At the hall parties, we will play J Hus loud.</p>",

Not that I\u2019m stressed or fed up, it\u2019s just I need to go to the next stage,\u201d and also mentioned that his forthcoming album \u201cwill be a good note to end on\u201d. Years after that verse about dreams of dying, the mood still lingers in his music: a recent freestyle contained the line \u201cself-medicate myself through my depression,\u201d his delivery so smooth that it is easy to gloss over the bleak reality he speaks of. Earlier this month, new song Must Be was released, with all the charm and finesse that stole our ears years ago. Back in arms with his masterful accomplice JAE5, Hus slides over soft strings and a deep bass. A weeping saxophone and strings herald a bittersweet return \u2013 the lyrics are east London war stories, awash with the sense of distrust that still haunts his life. Even at this testing hour, the quality of music is never in question, but supporters are anxious about how the next chapter of his story will play out. Many hope for his peace. Whatever happens, his first chapter changed the course of black British music and picked apart the lives of a generation. Through his hybrid music, J Hus told the story of African kids who grew up on rap and grime, ate jollof at family functions and sang 50 Cent in the school playground. It\u2019s the music we\u2019ll one day play to our own children, years far from now when albums like Common Sense remind us not to forget the lands we came from and the cultures in which we were raised. It is music that reflects our chaotic identities. At the hall parties, we will play J Hus loud.",

      "body": "<p>The broadcaster John Sergeant thinks the Netflix drama The Crown is \u201cdangerous \u2026 I think we\u2019re now asking too high a price from the Royals,\u201d he told the Radio Times. Obviously I want to nitpick and say, you don\u2019t ask a high price, you pay it, and actually, we don\u2019t ask anything of them at all, except that they don\u2019t traduce all values of decency with their associations. But parking that, has he got a point? Is it unfair to dramatise them?</p> <p>It is possible to read too much constitutional significance into TV, which is to say, any at all: The Crown has only ever pretended to be guided by historical atmospherics, rather than, say, bound to represent history accurately. So what could the third season rationally convey about the real Royal family?</p> <p>Quite a lot: the Windsors, even in real life, are functionally fictional. Nobody really knows them; they rarely say anything, except when one of them does, and it\u2019s so bizarre that it makes them all seem further away. So when you turn that mediocre fiction into good fiction \u2013 characters behaving in a three-dimensional way that you can empathise with \u2013 this will, inevitably, flatter them more than the patchwork of Hello! photoshoots and Emily Maitlis interviews. That\u2019s before you consider the casting: Olivia Colman beams human being out of her face. I don\u2019t think she can help it. Helena Bonham Carter would have you on her side in a war against a kitten \u2013 it\u2019s something to do with the fine line she treads between light and dark energy, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be any more specific than that. So yes, in that sense, and before you consider the visual sumptuousness, which leaves you with a vague feeling that the world is enriched just because they exist in it, this season of The Crown in particular is a right royal PR exercise. It\u2019s the only thing that could have saved them from the birthday-party-cancelling maelstrom in which they find themselves.</p> <p>And yet \u2026 there is also the It\u2019s a Knock Out effect, the downside of humanisation. When you consider the family to be so distant as to be incomprehensible, you don\u2019t wonder too much about their decisions. Any universality in the smallest amount and you start to wonder, what are these people playing at? Can the notion of duty go even halfway towards explaining why they live as zoo animals? Or are they completely weighed down by the material luxuries that, over a lifetime, could never compensate for the fullness of freedom, but day-to-day probably seem quite important? And if it\u2019s that \u2026 if it\u2019s just that, then maybe you still sympathise, but they slip down the list a bit, beneath \u201cbanker who doesn\u2019t get time to see his family\u201d and \u201cdog who feels sick but shouldn\u2019t be eating things out of bins\u201d.</p> <p>If I were the Queen, I would take the uptick but sue the programme anyway, for making out that I was a cold and loveless mother.

      "bodyText": "The broadcaster John Sergeant thinks the Netflix drama The Crown is \u201cdangerous \u2026 I think we\u2019re now asking too high a price from the Royals,\u201d he told the Radio Times. Obviously I want to nitpick and say, you don\u2019t ask a high price, you pay it, and actually, we don\u2019t ask anything of them at all, except that they don\u2019t traduce all values of decency with their associations. But parking that, has he got a point? Is it unfair to dramatise them? It is possible to read too much constitutional significance into TV, which is to say, any at all: The Crown has only ever pretended to be guided by historical atmospherics, rather than, say, bound to represent history accurately. So what could the third season rationally convey about the real Royal family? Quite a lot: the Windsors, even in real life, are functionally fictional. Nobody really knows them; they rarely say anything, except when one of them does, and it\u2019s so bizarre that it makes them all seem further away. So when you turn that mediocre fiction into good fiction \u2013 characters behaving in a three-dimensional way that you can empathise with \u2013 this will, inevitably, flatter them more than the patchwork of Hello! photoshoots and Emily Maitlis interviews. That\u2019s before you consider the casting: Olivia Colman beams human being out of her face. I don\u2019t think she can help it. Helena Bonham Carter would have you on her side in a war against a kitten \u2013 it\u2019s something to do with the fine line she treads between light and dark energy, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be any more specific than that. So yes, in that sense, and before you consider the visual sumptuousness, which leaves you with a vague feeling that the world is enriched just because they exist in it, this season of The Crown in particular is a right royal PR exercise. It\u2019s the only thing that could have saved them from the birthday-party-cancelling maelstrom in which they find themselves. And yet \u2026 there is also the It\u2019s a Knock Out effect, the downside of humanisation. When you consider the family to be so distant as to be incomprehensible, you don\u2019t wonder too much about their decisions. Any universality in the smallest amount and you start to wonder, what are these people playing at? Can the notion of duty go even halfway towards explaining why they live as zoo animals? Or are they completely weighed down by the material luxuries that, over a lifetime, could never compensate for the fullness of freedom, but day-to-day probably seem quite important? And if it\u2019s that \u2026 if it\u2019s just that, then maybe you still sympathise, but they slip down the list a bit, beneath \u201cbanker who doesn\u2019t get time to see his family\u201d and \u201cdog who feels sick but shouldn\u2019t be eating things out of bins\u201d. If I were the Queen, I would take the uptick but sue the programme anyway, for making out that I was a cold and loveless mother. But that\u2019s the genius of the show, apparently; Royals very rarely sue.",

      "bodyText": "Name: Robert Peter Williams. Age: 45. Appearance: Bare-chested more often than necessary. This is that singer who was famous in the 1990s? It is. Although he is still fairly famous now. What for? Right now, for not having a fistfight with Liam Gallagher. Couldn\u2019t quite a lot of people say the same? They could, but Williams enjoys boxing, and says that the promoter Eddie Hearn was ready to make it happen. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen how much KSI and Logan Paul made from their fight and I think we could trounce that,\u201d Williams told GQ last month. So it\u2019s just about money? Not entirely. \u201c[Liam] represents a school bully to me and I would like to take the bully down,\u201d Williams told the Sun. He also taunted Gallagher on Twitter with a boxing glove emoji and the suggestion to \u201cbuy yourself a pair of bollocks\u201d. Ah, the cheeky-macho Williams shtick that we all know and tolerate. Is Gallagher up for it? \u201cHe hasn\u2019t responded twice,\u201d Williams told Jonathan Ross. And now the fight is officially off, after Williams\u2019s wife, Ayda Field, banned him from pursuing it. On what grounds? \u201cYou\u2019re 45, man,\u201d she said on their new podcast. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go in a ring and smack each other? That\u2019s just lame.\u201d Wait \u2026 \u201con their new podcast\u201d? Yup. They have launched one to promote Robbie\u2019s new Christmas album. That is also why he has been doing all these interviews. So this fight business was all a stunt to sell a record? Possibly, yes; but then also, no. Williams and Gallagher have been avoiding violence for 20 years. Really? Oh, yes. Liam\u2019s brother Noel called Williams \u201cthat fat dancer from Take That\u201d. While Robbie was engaged in the late 1990s to Nicole Appleton, who later married, then divorced, Liam. OK \u2026 And on stage at the 2000 Brit awards, Robbie challenged Liam, saying: \u201cA hundred grand of your money, a hundred grand of my money. We\u2019ll get in the ring and we\u2019ll have a fight.\u201d I see \u2026 In 2013, Liam called Robbie a \u201cfat fucking idiot\u201d on stage in Manchester, and later responded to a taunt that his songs didn\u2019t have choruses by saying: \u201cThey do, fatty. And they\u2019re good and they\u2019re better than yours \u2026 Don\u2019t write choruses, fat boy. Yeah, his verses are shit and all.\u201d I just don\u2019t know what to say about two men being so childish. That\u2019s show business? Do say: \u201cFirst they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they won\u2019t fight you. Then you start a podcast.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWho do you reckon Noel would be cheering for?\u201d",

He still recalls the vicious abuse he\u2019d receive whenever there was a special occasion and he was forced to wear his Indian formal suit: \u201cEven just walking from the house to the car was difficult.\u201d And he still remembers discovering kung fu movies for the first time, seeing heroes fighting in similar robes, and the transformative effect they had on him.</p> <p>\u201cIt was old Hong Kong movies late at night,\u201d he says, \u201cand much later it was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This freeing up of the idea that a man just wears a shirt or T-shirt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b702bf89080782c3b08d9cc8ef08144d6a3b843c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b702bf89080782c3b08d9cc8ef08144d6a3b843c/1508_0_2537_3172/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m interested in bridge building\u2019 \u2026 Hetain Patel.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m interested in bridge building\u2019 \u2026 Hetain Patel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hetain Patel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suddenly, Patel was able to reinvent himself, no longer an outsider in strange clothes but a kung fu hero. And why stop there? With a little imagination, he could pretend to be Spider-Man, Eddie Murphy or Michael Jackson. He became an expert mimic in the playground and, at home, he was a head-in-the-clouds fantasist, weaving Spidey-webs around his grandmother\u2019s house with little more than a piece of string and a paperclip.</p> <p>He was also laying the groundwork for an artistic career that has frequently looked back towards these coming-of-age moments, raising questions about identity, communication and cultural overlap. It\u2019s work that has led to the 38-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/25/hetain-patel-wins-film-london-jarman-award-video-art\">winning this year\u2019s Film London Jarman award</a>, which recognises outstanding artists working with moving image.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/24/celebrating-derek-jarman-20-years-death\">Derek Jarman</a> \u2013 the late experimental film-maker the awards are named after \u2013 Patel\u2019s work connects with an audience outside the art world, largely because he likes to wrap them all in the language of Hollywood: epic soundtracks, highly choreographed movement, impressive slow-motion effects (filmed on a shoestring although you\u2019d never guess). On 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fvu.co.uk/projects/dont-look-at-the-finger\">Don\u2019t Look at the Finger</a>, the turquoise and purple costumes dazzle, while the camera swings around the action in true bullet-time, Matrix style.</p> <p>At first glance, it\u2019s a high-production fight movie, but the more you look the less generic it seems. The fight seems to be taking place at an African wedding ceremony; the kung fu moves incorporate sign language. Patel has brought together different cultures and marginalised groups, using a global language we can all understand.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiGrFmmY_yk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PiGrFmmY_yk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in bridge building,\u201d he says. \u201cIt comes from a personal place of wanting to fit in and be accepted. Of course, on paper an afro kung fu sign language film with transforming costumes shouldn\u2019t work. But when you hear or see it, you should feel instantly familiar with it.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, Patel didn\u2019t enjoy discussing his identity: it was only through art that he felt able to express his feelings. Surprisingly for someone trained in visual art, he\u2019s spent much of his career in dance: \u201cI secured some funding and I went in with a naivety, not knowing the rules, which was helpful. I never had to pretend I had a dance-trained body.\u201d</p> <p>His stage work includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/22/hetain-patel-american-boy-review\">American Boy</a> \u2013 which sees Patel shapeshift through a range of movie and comic-book impersonations \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/27/hetain-patel-american-man-review-sadlers-wells-satire-misogyny\">American Man</a>, a satire on misogyny that has him appearing as a \u201cbad\u201d Obama. Experience in the dance arena has clearly fed into his video work. In 2015\u2019s The Jump we see Patel dressed as Spider-Man, leaping off the sofa in his grandmother\u2019s front room while his extended family look on in smart Indian dress. It was, he says, the first sofa he ever jumped off pretending to be the superhero. The suit took him four months to make, and the day of filming was fraught as his family had not been told what to expect and his grandmother \u2013 who had been recently burgled by a gang of masked white men \u2013 spent the session berating the (white) camera crew.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vYEKQMyoGU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2vYEKQMyoGU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cLuckily, it was in Gujarati so they couldn\u2019t understand her,\u201d says Patel. The resulting piece is both funny and moving, an exploration of his family\u2019s roots (their own great leap involved moving the family to the UK) and our desire for shared experiences. \u201cAt that age, what I wanted to be most when I grew up was white,\u201d notes Patel, who was drawn to Spider-Man because the full facial mask took ethnicity out of the equation.</p> <p>He\u2019s still working through issues with his background and you get a good sense of this in 2008\u2019s It\u2019s Growing on Me, a time-lapse video that shows him gradually adopting his father\u2019s look \u2013 a moustache and side parting. The reactions to his changing image fascinated him: at first friends would make jokes about him looking like a \u201cpaedo\u201d. (\u201cI had a BMX at the time and it put me off going to the track because there were children there.\u201d) People would stare at him in shops, or even tug it in nightclubs. Then he started getting discounts in Indian shops \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019d assume I couldn\u2019t be British-born so must be fresh off the boat\u201d \u2013 and a newfound respect among relatives who he\u2019d barely spoken to before. \u201cIt\u2019s just hair, but it\u2019s amazing the associations it brings.\u201d</p> <p>Patel\u2019s work isn\u2019t just for gallery audiences. <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/hetain_patel_who_am_i_think_again?language=en\">He has a fascinating TED talk</a> that plays the audience\u2019s preconceptions (he speaks in Mandarin, which a translator turns into English, only to reveal that he\u2019s just been repeating the same phrase over and over), while his YouTube videos can be equally engaging \u2013 his one on how to make a cup of tea found a viral audience in the Gujarati community, \u201cwhich is definitely not my audience in the gallery\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cevXg_SlT-Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cevXg_SlT-Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>He recently secured funding for his next film, about two women who rediscover an ancient physical language that once united humanity. Inspired by the biblical tower of Babel, it will be about body swapping, and whether an increase in empathy could solve many of today\u2019s problems. He hopes to turn it into a feature film and winning the \u00a310,000 Jarman prize will certainly help.

      "bodyText": "Hetain Patel remembers what it was like to grow up in Bolton as part of the \u201conly brown family in town\u201d. He still recalls the vicious abuse he\u2019d receive whenever there was a special occasion and he was forced to wear his Indian formal suit: \u201cEven just walking from the house to the car was difficult.\u201d And he still remembers discovering kung fu movies for the first time, seeing heroes fighting in similar robes, and the transformative effect they had on him. \u201cIt was old Hong Kong movies late at night,\u201d he says, \u201cand much later it was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This freeing up of the idea that a man just wears a shirt or T-shirt.\u201d Suddenly, Patel was able to reinvent himself, no longer an outsider in strange clothes but a kung fu hero. And why stop there? With a little imagination, he could pretend to be Spider-Man, Eddie Murphy or Michael Jackson. He became an expert mimic in the playground and, at home, he was a head-in-the-clouds fantasist, weaving Spidey-webs around his grandmother\u2019s house with little more than a piece of string and a paperclip. He was also laying the groundwork for an artistic career that has frequently looked back towards these coming-of-age moments, raising questions about identity, communication and cultural overlap. It\u2019s work that has led to the 38-year-old winning this year\u2019s Film London Jarman award, which recognises outstanding artists working with moving image. Like Derek Jarman \u2013 the late experimental film-maker the awards are named after \u2013 Patel\u2019s work connects with an audience outside the art world, largely because he likes to wrap them all in the language of Hollywood: epic soundtracks, highly choreographed movement, impressive slow-motion effects (filmed on a shoestring although you\u2019d never guess). On 2017\u2019s Don\u2019t Look at the Finger, the turquoise and purple costumes dazzle, while the camera swings around the action in true bullet-time, Matrix style. At first glance, it\u2019s a high-production fight movie, but the more you look the less generic it seems. The fight seems to be taking place at an African wedding ceremony; the kung fu moves incorporate sign language. Patel has brought together different cultures and marginalised groups, using a global language we can all understand. \u201cI\u2019m interested in bridge building,\u201d he says. \u201cIt comes from a personal place of wanting to fit in and be accepted. Of course, on paper an afro kung fu sign language film with transforming costumes shouldn\u2019t work. But when you hear or see it, you should feel instantly familiar with it.\u201d As a child, Patel didn\u2019t enjoy discussing his identity: it was only through art that he felt able to express his feelings. Surprisingly for someone trained in visual art, he\u2019s spent much of his career in dance: \u201cI secured some funding and I went in with a naivety, not knowing the rules, which was helpful. I never had to pretend I had a dance-trained body.\u201d His stage work includes American Boy \u2013 which sees Patel shapeshift through a range of movie and comic-book impersonations \u2013 and American Man, a satire on misogyny that has him appearing as a \u201cbad\u201d Obama. Experience in the dance arena has clearly fed into his video work. In 2015\u2019s The Jump we see Patel dressed as Spider-Man, leaping off the sofa in his grandmother\u2019s front room while his extended family look on in smart Indian dress. It was, he says, the first sofa he ever jumped off pretending to be the superhero. The suit took him four months to make, and the day of filming was fraught as his family had not been told what to expect and his grandmother \u2013 who had been recently burgled by a gang of masked white men \u2013 spent the session berating the (white) camera crew. \u201cLuckily, it was in Gujarati so they couldn\u2019t understand her,\u201d says Patel. The resulting piece is both funny and moving, an exploration of his family\u2019s roots (their own great leap involved moving the family to the UK) and our desire for shared experiences. \u201cAt that age, what I wanted to be most when I grew up was white,\u201d notes Patel, who was drawn to Spider-Man because the full facial mask took ethnicity out of the equation. He\u2019s still working through issues with his background and you get a good sense of this in 2008\u2019s It\u2019s Growing on Me, a time-lapse video that shows him gradually adopting his father\u2019s look \u2013 a moustache and side parting. The reactions to his changing image fascinated him: at first friends would make jokes about him looking like a \u201cpaedo\u201d. (\u201cI had a BMX at the time and it put me off going to the track because there were children there.\u201d) People would stare at him in shops, or even tug it in nightclubs. Then he started getting discounts in Indian shops \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019d assume I couldn\u2019t be British-born so must be fresh off the boat\u201d \u2013 and a newfound respect among relatives who he\u2019d barely spoken to before. \u201cIt\u2019s just hair, but it\u2019s amazing the associations it brings.\u201d Patel\u2019s work isn\u2019t just for gallery audiences. He has a fascinating TED talk that plays the audience\u2019s preconceptions (he speaks in Mandarin, which a translator turns into English, only to reveal that he\u2019s just been repeating the same phrase over and over), while his YouTube videos can be equally engaging \u2013 his one on how to make a cup of tea found a viral audience in the Gujarati community, \u201cwhich is definitely not my audience in the gallery\u201d. He recently secured funding for his next film, about two women who rediscover an ancient physical language that once united humanity. Inspired by the biblical tower of Babel, it will be about body swapping, and whether an increase in empathy could solve many of today\u2019s problems. He hopes to turn it into a feature film and winning the \u00a310,000 Jarman prize will certainly help. In fact, winning the prize means a lot to Patel in other ways. \u201cThe biggest challenge I\u2019ve faced is being recognised as a British artist outside of my ethnicity,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll get invited to do shows around the subject of diaspora or race. So to be acknowledged for the medium I\u2019m working in, alongside peers I respect and admire? That\u2019s yet another freeing thing for me.\u201d",

Mariano Rubinacci\u2019s father, who began the business, was obsessed with the tailors of Savile Row, adapting the English style to suit the Mediterranean climate. To this day, its suits are sewn entirely by hand by artisans using British fabrics in the workshop above the elegant ochre-coloured <a href=\"https://www.marianorubinacci.net/stores\" title=\"\">boutique on Via Chiaia</a> (suits and shirts made to order).</p> <p>No suit is complete without a tie, and with <a href=\"https://www.emarinella.com/stores/?v=79cba1185463\">Marinella</a> close by it would be criminal not to pay a visit.

Can\u00e9, who is in his 70s, belongs to a past era of old-fashioned Neapolitan charm and enjoys helping clients decide on the leather and finishes for their bespoke sandals, which can be decorated as simply or as extravagantly as desired and can be ready to wear in a day (bespoke sandals from \u20ac60).</p> <p>Some of these artisan enterprises are unknown to outsiders but in Naples they are household names, revered by Neapolitans who are keen to shift the negative reputation that has, on occasion, suffocated the city.

Mariano Rubinacci\u2019s father, who began the business, was obsessed with the tailors of Savile Row, adapting the English style to suit the Mediterranean climate. To this day, its suits are sewn entirely by hand by artisans using British fabrics in the workshop above the elegant ochre-coloured boutique on Via Chiaia (suits and shirts made to order). No suit is complete without a tie, and with Marinella close by it would be criminal not to pay a visit. Marinella, which shares Oscar Wilde\u2019s philosophy that \u201ca well-tied tie is the first serious step in life\u201d, has been the leading producer of neckties in Europe for a century. Its skill is reflected in a client list that includes presidents, princes and politicians, who wear the handmade silk ties with their traditional but unique prints (ties and scarfs from \u20ac80). Traditionally, Naples goes heavy on menswear. However, for women passing through Naples, en route to the chic islands of Ischia, Capri or Procida, it is almost compulsory to pick up a pair of sandali capresi from Pasquale Can\u00e9\u2019s tiny workshop on Via Nardones (97). Can\u00e9, who is in his 70s, belongs to a past era of old-fashioned Neapolitan charm and enjoys helping clients decide on the leather and finishes for their bespoke sandals, which can be decorated as simply or as extravagantly as desired and can be ready to wear in a day (bespoke sandals from \u20ac60). Some of these artisan enterprises are unknown to outsiders but in Naples they are household names, revered by Neapolitans who are keen to shift the negative reputation that has, on occasion, suffocated the city. With tourism increasing in recent years, however, and the enthusiastic younger generations, such as Mario Talarico and Alberto Squillace, keen to take up the artisanal mantle, Naples is striving to reclaim its title as the flourishing capital of craftsmanship. \u2022 Sophia Seymour offers guided walks of Naples inspired by Elena Ferrante\u2019s novels, lookingforlila.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Organised crime groups based in the UK generate more money from selling illegal drugs on the dark web than in any other country in Europe, according to the EU\u2019s drugs agency. Darknet vendors in the UK were estimated to have sold drugs worth more than \u00a324m with a total weight of 2,825kg in 2017-18. Although they did not generate as much revenue, dark web vendors in Germany were estimated to have traded a higher quantity of drugs, 3,153kg, worth over \u00a316m. The disparity could reflect price variations and the differences in types of drugs offered. However, the true figures were almost certainly much higher. Including on the darknet, drug users across the EU spend more than \u00a326bn on illicit substances each year. A number of online marketplaces where drugs are sold have been closed in recent years by international law enforcement agencies, but the dark web markets ecosystem has proved resilient and take-downs did not significantly impact revenues, the 2019 EU drug markets report noted. The report said the number of online stores run by single vendors had grown in response, and the market was expected to continue to both fragment and migrate to encrypted communication apps such as Discord and Telegram. It is estimated that the number of people in England who buy drugs on the dark web has more than doubled since 2014 amid similar rises in other countries. Darknet vendors in the UK sell mainly cocaine and cannabis, along with stimulants such as MDMA and dissociatives including ketamine. However, a number of vendors in the UK also sell fentanyl, a powerful painkiller 50 times stronger than heroin. Some UK-based fentanyl vendors recruit criminals in other countries where they enjoy large customer bases to sell the dangerous opioid on their behalf, according to the report. The use of postal and parcel services to transport drugs has expanded rapidly in the past two years, posing added dilemmas for law enforcement agencies. Dr James Nicholls, from Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said the report showed that international law enforcement agencies were finding it \u201calmost impossible\u201d to deal with the expansion and innovation of the illicit drug market. \u201cResearch cited in the report shows that when one darknet market is taken down another takes its place, having no effect on the overall scale of the drug market,\u201d he said. \u201cLaw enforcement are playing \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 and it is not working. We need a different approach. The only way to undermine organised crime, and to reduce the enormous harm that illegal drug markets create, is to legally regulate drug supply.\u201d The director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which compiled the report, said it represented \u201ca clear wake-up call for policymakers\u201d to address an \u201cincreasingly global, joined-up and digitally enabled\u201d rapidly growing drug market. \u201cHyper-production of drugs, within and beyond EU borders, is leading to high availability of natural and synthetic substances,\u201d Alexis Goosdeel said. \u201cThis means that consumers now have access to a diverse range of highly potent and pure products at affordable prices.\u201d",

There have been on average 114,000 registrations per day this time around, compared with 68,000 registrations per day in 2017. It is estimated that around a million of those who registered were just being cautious and will already have been on the register, but that still leaves a large number of new applicants. Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society, said: \u201cThis surge in registrations is highly encouraging, given the huge numbers missing from the electoral roll. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a major uplift in new registrations compared to the last election, with large numbers of young people signing up too \u2013 a traditionally under-registered demographic. It\u2019s vital we close the demographic divides in terms of who is registered. This is a strong start. \u201cHowever, since you cannot check whether you\u2019re registered already, we estimate over a million of the registrations we\u2019ve seen are likely to be duplicates.\u201d Politicians have been urging people to register to vote with just a few hours to go until the window closes at midnight on Tuesday. Monday was the biggest day for voter registration so far, with 351,257 applications. Ahead of the deadline and as the polls showed Labour narrowing the Tory lead, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThere are less than 24 hours left to register to vote and it couldn\u2019t be more important. \u201cOn Friday, Labour, unlike the Tories, got behind National Voter Registration Day, and it saw the largest surge in people registering to vote in this general election campaign. \u201cPlease take five minutes and register to vote now and please ask your friends, family, neighbours and co-workers to do the same. \u201cThis election is a once in a generation chance for real change: to end privatisation and give the NHS the funding it needs, to give people the final say and get Brexit sorted, to tackle the climate emergency that threatens all our futures and to invest in good jobs in every region and nation of our country.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this month, at a large gala hall in Berlin, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, presented Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble \u2013 the former German minister of finance \u2013 with the Ehren-Victoria award for outstanding achievements in challenging times. \u201cFew have done so much for Europe and the euro. His commitment, rigour and statesmanship are a source of inspiration,\u201d Lagarde later <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/christinelagarde/photos/a.331390653891/10156883662828892/?type=1&amp;theater\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Such is the dominant image of Germany: the rock holding fast in the high seas of global economic turmoil and southern European fiscal mismanagement.</p> <p>But the opposite is true. Under Sch\u00e4uble and since, Germany has been a wrecking ball to the European economy. Since the early 2000s, its governments have deliberately engineered record high current-account surpluses, not only damaging southern European prospects but also pushing the German economy toward problems of its own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The surpluses, the official line goes, are simply driven by success of private German companies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/9996/trade/effect-current-account-surplus/\" title=\"\">current account surplus</a> happens when a country\u2019s earnings from exports exceed the amount it spends on imports. You may be thinking: isn\u2019t it good to run a \u201csurplus\u201d? Not the German kind.</p> <p>The clearest side-effect of Germany\u2019s perennial surplus is that it sucks demand from the European economy. As BMWs, aspirin and industrial robots flow from Germany to the rest of Europe, money flows into Germany. Because Germany imports significantly less than it exports, this money gets stuck, failing to return, for example, as Germans buying Italian goods or Spanish services. The scale of this is astounding. Since 2008, Germany\u2019s surpluses have hoovered an average of \u20ac110bn (\u00a394bn) out of the rest of Europe each year, according to data from Germany\u2019s central bank.</p> <p>But this economic strategy is no more successful back home. Because Germany imports so little, other European countries cannot earn enough to pay for German exports in a sustainable manner.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this month, at a large gala hall in Berlin, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, presented Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble \u2013 the former German minister of finance \u2013 with the Ehren-Victoria award for outstanding achievements in challenging times. \u201cFew have done so much for Europe and the euro. His commitment, rigour and statesmanship are a source of inspiration,\u201d Lagarde later tweeted. Such is the dominant image of Germany: the rock holding fast in the high seas of global economic turmoil and southern European fiscal mismanagement. But the opposite is true. Under Sch\u00e4uble and since, Germany has been a wrecking ball to the European economy. Since the early 2000s, its governments have deliberately engineered record high current-account surpluses, not only damaging southern European prospects but also pushing the German economy toward problems of its own. A current account surplus happens when a country\u2019s earnings from exports exceed the amount it spends on imports. You may be thinking: isn\u2019t it good to run a \u201csurplus\u201d? Not the German kind. The clearest side-effect of Germany\u2019s perennial surplus is that it sucks demand from the European economy. As BMWs, aspirin and industrial robots flow from Germany to the rest of Europe, money flows into Germany. Because Germany imports significantly less than it exports, this money gets stuck, failing to return, for example, as Germans buying Italian goods or Spanish services. The scale of this is astounding. Since 2008, Germany\u2019s surpluses have hoovered an average of \u20ac110bn (\u00a394bn) out of the rest of Europe each year, according to data from Germany\u2019s central bank. But this economic strategy is no more successful back home. Because Germany imports so little, other European countries cannot earn enough to pay for German exports in a sustainable manner. Instead, this debt is paid by borrowing from, or selling assets to, German lenders and investors. In 2017, for example, households and firms in other EU countries owed half a trillion euros to German banks and their subsidiaries, and the Greek state sold 14 regional airports to the German company Fraport. This continental imbalance is clearly unsustainable: both stockpiles of assets and the patience of lenders eventually run out. At this point, an \u201cadjustment crisis\u201d will occur: unless Germany is willing to run large deficits to allow other countries to repay their debts, German banks will face losses as loans are written down, and Bavarian factories will idle as customers can no longer afford their orders. The German government\u2019s response has been to brush the problem under the carpet: the surpluses, the official line goes, are simply driven by success of private German companies. Accurate or not, this response is largely beside the point: what matters are the consequences, not the causes, of Germany\u2019s export surpluses. It would seem, then, that a European strategy is necessary: the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and others, for example, have called for fiscal transfers to rebalance the European economy. But this wouldn\u2019t work. Even within countries, permanent transfers from rich to poor regions can spark a toxic mixture of arrogance among payers and resentment among recipients. For an example of the former, look no further than the Northern League, whose roots lie in Italy\u2019s rich northern regions and their discontent at perennially financing subsidies for the south. So what do we propose the German government does? Facilitate a rise in the wages of its own workers: 5% real growth for five years in a row would amount to a tripling of recent wage growth rates. Why will this work? Increasing wages increases consumption. Because 22% of consumption is imported in Germany \u2013 and because increasing wages doesn\u2019t increase exports: if anything, the opposite \u2013 Germans having more money in their pockets will lead to them buying more foreign goods, reducing the current account surplus. This won\u2019t be easy to execute. There is a deep bipartisan consensus in Germany to maintain the status quo. The current account surplus actually worsens German economic inequality \u2013 the export industry profits tend to accrue to a small group of people, as the International Monetary Fund has shown \u2013 but this inequality doesn\u2019t affect the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democrats\u2019 (SPD) core voters: business-owning families and unionised workers.

Caruana Galizia, one of Malta\u2019s best-known investigative journalists, was killed in a bomb explosion as she left her home on 16 October 2017.

      "body": "<h2><strong>\u2018The bears leapt off the rocks on to the whales\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Chadden Hunter, producer, North America and South America</em></p> <p>We had heard about polar bears up in the Canadian Arctic hunting in an incredible new way during the summer when the sea ice has gone. There\u2019s an area in the Hudson Bay where the water is shallow and tides rip in through boulder fields. Apparently, the bears climb up on to boulders and wait for beluga whales to swim past. Then they leap on to the backs of these beautiful snow-white giants, grab them and bite the back of their heads to try to kill them. It sounded unbelievable.</p> <p>There is no coastguard up there, no help at all. Storms can whip up quickly and boats get turned over. One day, ours got stuck on a rock. The tide was rushing around and it was going to flip. We had to get out. The cameraman stripped down to his underwear and jumped into the freezing water to push the boat off. A curious polar bear, meanwhile, swam towards us and kept circling.</p> <p>We had a rifle for safety. One day, while we were on shore, I went for a pee in some bushes, thinking it was safe because we\u2019d scouted the area. All of a sudden, I see this big white lump just in front of me: a sleeping polar bear. I look over my shoulder and see my team and the guide who has the gun. They\u2019re about 100m behind me.</p> <p>So I\u2019m trying to whistle like a bird to get their attention, without startling the bear. He lifts up his head and gives this indignant look, as if to say: \u201cYou call that a bird whistle?\u201d I guess he was shocked at how bad my whistling was \u2013 but also by the fact that a human was standing there at all. So I\u2019m trying to do my business with a polar bear staring me down, when another head rises up in the bush. Now I have two of them, 20m away, and my team are looking the other way, out to the ocean.</p> <p>I whistled louder. Eventually they heard me \u2013 just as the polar bears stood up and I realised I could never have got to safety. But they took one look at me and decided to head in the other direction. I was lucky: they were well fed. </p> <h2>\u2018We sat motionless in -10C every night for a month\u2019</h2> <p><em>Justine Evans, camera operator for Europe and Australia</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"183763e574de6f225347afed7b2b4fc9c31bc6ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/183763e574de6f225347afed7b2b4fc9c31bc6ea/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We got a report of a kill\u2019 \u2026 wolves in Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We got a report of a kill\u2019 \u2026 wolves in Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marian Tudor/500px/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolves are highly nocturnal, which makes them notoriously difficult to film. We were in Abruzzo, the national park in southern Italy, staking out entire areas. Wolves hunt across the mountains there but they could be anywhere. So it\u2019s like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p> <p>It took a month of nights, sitting motionless in -10C for hours on end. There were just two of us. I looked like the Michelin Man in down trousers and a down jacket, like a big pudding. There were sheepdogs around too. They\u2019d suddenly appear in the middle of the night and scare the living daylights out of you.</p> <p>We staked out one area for over a week, saw the odd deer wandering past, but no wolves. That was demoralising. Then we got a report of a wolf kill, a deer carcass on another site. We went there and three wolves appeared that night. And then they started hunting, which was incredible. They\u2019d chase deer down a slope and hope they tripped. Can you imagine running hell for leather down a mountain in the pitch black? And yet the wolves often didn\u2019t succeed. It was lots of effort for little reward.</p> <p>Unbelievably, the sheepdogs would group together and steal the kills. The wolves were working so hard, then losing out. When I do night work like this, I often see things that have never been seen before. This was like a new frontier in nature.</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019ve just been shot at by poachers\u2019</h2> <p><em>Giles Badger, producer of Europe and Africa</em></p> <p>My producer Jo Haley was filming gorillas in the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo-brazzaville\">Congo-Brazzaville</a> and one night rang on the satellite phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been shot at by poachers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re having to evacuate.\u201d The crew had been filming and suddenly heard two gunshots. They were up on a viewing platform to keep them away from forest elephants, which can be very dangerous. They felt like sitting ducks. So they had a very tough decision to make.</p> <p>The one rule of the forest is that you don\u2019t walk around after dark. But at dusk, they took their essentials and walked for an hour to reach the safety camp. The next morning, the armed poaching patrols came in and said they had found the body of a slaughtered elephant. The crew felt it had to be the end of the shoot. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/illegal-wildlife-trade\">poachers</a> were still on the run. There were armed people in the forest and the gorilla sequence never got finished.</p> <h2>\u2018The first thing we heard was a rhino singing\u2019</h2> <p><em>Emma Napper, producer of Asia and Australia</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5f802f7b364ddf19f20f03cba1ae7bdc4918ae2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5f802f7b364ddf19f20f03cba1ae7bdc4918ae2/444_107_2116_1269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They\u2019re shorter than me and a bit hairy\u2019 \u2026 a Sumatran rhino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They\u2019re shorter than me and a bit hairy\u2019 \u2026 a Sumatran rhino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are fewer than 70 Sumatran rhinos left. In 10 years\u2019 time, they may no longer exist, so they\u2019re kept in a secret location behind fences within a national park. There had been just one recording made of them singing before. But when we got out of the car, the first thing we heard was a rhino singing \u2013 and it was loud. </p> <p>They\u2019re such lovely little rhinos, quite different from African ones. I\u2019m five foot two and they\u2019re shorter than me and a bit hairy. The jungle is so dense that if they want to find a mate they have to sing. It\u2019s like the song of a humpback whale, an amazing, haunting sound. But their chances of finding a mate when there\u2019s only 70 left across the whole island of Sumatra is slim to none.</p> <h2>\u2018When he saw the blows, he said: Abi, this is it!\u2019\u2019</h2> <p><em>Abigail Lees, assistant producer of Antarctica</em></p> <p>The holy grail of wildlife-filming is to capture a great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/whales\">whale</a> aggregation in Antarctica. We suspected something was happening in an area near Elephant Island, off the coast of Antarctica, but there was no way of telling whether the whales were just passing or how many were there.

It was huge \u2013 150 whales \u2013 and it all happened on the last day. When he saw the number of blows spouting from the water, my cameraman Gregory shook me and said: \u201cAbi, this is it!\u201d I was in shock. </p> <p>We ran to get our drone, my heart was beating like mad. We sent it up then quickly brought it back down again to change the memory cards. After the second trip, it landed very hard and broke, so we had to run and find our backup drone, which could only fly for five minutes before the batteries needed replacing. We didn\u2019t have time to change lenses either, so it\u2019s all on this wide-angle lens, which turned out to be a good thing. Somehow that cut through the glare of the sea. That tiny drone ended up giving the best shots we got.</p> <p>This is the first evidence that fin whales are recovering from whaling. They think 750,000 were slaughtered in the Southern Ocean alone, bringing their numbers down to a few thousand, mainly for margarine and soap. Which is insane \u2013 they\u2019re just such simple household items.</p> <h2>\u2018If a diver got lost, we would scrape arrows in the ice above\u2019</h2> <p><em>Fredi Devas, producer of Antarctica</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad521e5f5c3214216a47d79aa06906cf838037bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad521e5f5c3214216a47d79aa06906cf838037bf/0_0_3500_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No safety ropes \u2026 a cameraman swims beneath the sea ice to film seals in Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No safety ropes \u2026 a cameraman swims beneath the sea ice to film seals in Antarctica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Espen Rekdal/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Filming under sea ice is enormously difficult.

      "body": "<p>The Yiwu-to-London train pulls into the DB Eurohub terminus in Barking, east London, 18 days after leaving the Chinese city, a trading centre south of Shanghai. Over the course of its 7,500-mile (12,000km) journey to Europe, the train has wound its way through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium and France, following part of the old east-west Silk Road. </p> <p>This freight-rail link is just one of many new routes that, along with roads and ports, form China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\" title=\"\">Belt and Road Initiative</a>. Whether the branding is an elaborate PR exercise or a new version of the Silk Road, what is real is that as China globalises, its investment is being gratefully sought across Europe. From ports to power stations, football clubs to financial companies, from the Norwegian city of Kirkenes to the Greek port of Piraeus and the Portuguese national grid, Chinese investment has become indispensable to the European economy. However, the country\u2019s rise as a global economic power poses a strategic dilemma for European governments. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned in March that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-china/eu-leaders-call-for-end-to-naivety-in-relations-with-china-idUSKCN1R31H3\" title=\"\">\u201cperiod of European naivety\u201d</a> about China had to end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/europe-squeezed-hungry-china-surly-us-merkel-trump\">Europe is squeezed between a hungry China and surly US | Simon Tisdall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is this overblown fear bordering on xenophobia? Workers at British Steel\u2019s Scunthorpe plant will surely be grateful that the company has been sold to the Chinese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/10/chinese-industrial-giant-poised-to-buy-up-british-steel-for-70m\" title=\"\">Jingye Group</a>, saving 4,000 jobs. EU state aid rules were blamed for preventing the nationalisation that steel unions demanded, but even the hardest of Brexits under World Trade Organization rules would have limited Britain\u2019s ability to give state aid to an ailing company. That many Chinese investors have a financial link to the Chinese state or, in some cases, are fully state-owned is more than coincidental. It raises questions about the geopolitical motivation for much Chinese investment around Europe: why would a Chinese company see a failing British steelmaker as a good investment?</p> <p>Over recent months, I and other journalists from around Europe have been looking in depth at the Chinese investment offensive, seeking to assess its scale and how welcome, or worrying, it is.

      "bodyText": "The Yiwu-to-London train pulls into the DB Eurohub terminus in Barking, east London, 18 days after leaving the Chinese city, a trading centre south of Shanghai. Over the course of its 7,500-mile (12,000km) journey to Europe, the train has wound its way through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium and France, following part of the old east-west Silk Road. This freight-rail link is just one of many new routes that, along with roads and ports, form China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Whether the branding is an elaborate PR exercise or a new version of the Silk Road, what is real is that as China globalises, its investment is being gratefully sought across Europe. From ports to power stations, football clubs to financial companies, from the Norwegian city of Kirkenes to the Greek port of Piraeus and the Portuguese national grid, Chinese investment has become indispensable to the European economy. However, the country\u2019s rise as a global economic power poses a strategic dilemma for European governments. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned in March that the \u201cperiod of European naivety\u201d about China had to end. Is this overblown fear bordering on xenophobia? Workers at British Steel\u2019s Scunthorpe plant will surely be grateful that the company has been sold to the Chinese Jingye Group, saving 4,000 jobs. EU state aid rules were blamed for preventing the nationalisation that steel unions demanded, but even the hardest of Brexits under World Trade Organization rules would have limited Britain\u2019s ability to give state aid to an ailing company. That many Chinese investors have a financial link to the Chinese state or, in some cases, are fully state-owned is more than coincidental. It raises questions about the geopolitical motivation for much Chinese investment around Europe: why would a Chinese company see a failing British steelmaker as a good investment? Over recent months, I and other journalists from around Europe have been looking in depth at the Chinese investment offensive, seeking to assess its scale and how welcome, or worrying, it is. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary is the only EU country with a significant Silk Road project \u2013 a \u20ac2bn high-speed Budapest-to-Belgrade railway (linked to Piraeus) financed with Chinese credit. A \u20ac357m bridge in Croatia is under construction by a Chinese company, four-fifths of it funded by EU taxpayers. Overall Chinese investments in Europe have been increasing at a steady pace over the last two decades across most industries and sectors. From 2008 to 2018, China spent an estimated \u20ac300bn on the acquisition of European companies or the establishment of their subsidiaries in Europe (the EU plus Switzerland and Norway). Britain, Germany and France have attracted most of the Chinese investment in the last decade. To keep things in perspective, this is not as much as EU companies have invested in China, and is just a fraction of US investment in Europe. However, in March the EU issued a paper declaring China a \u201csystemic rival\u201d. As this shift in language signalled, there\u2019s a new level of concern in Brussels that the billions member governments are accepting from China will leave it strategically compromised. Signs of this backlash can be dated to at least December 2016, when the Chinese household appliance group Midea bought the German robotics manufacturer Kuka \u2013 regarded as a pearl of German industry \u2013 for \u20ac4.5bn. Michael Clauss, then German ambassador in Beijing, and currently Germany\u2019s permanent representative to the EU, said it was \u201cto be feared\u201d that such companies as Kuka \u201cwill only be used as tools and thrown away once they have transferred sufficient technology\u201d. Yet, take the example of Chinese car manufacturer Geely. In 2010, for about $1.5bn the company acquired the loss-making Swedish manufacturer Volvo in a deal that turned out to be highly successful for both sides.

The lawsuit says that more than 100 human rights activists, journalists, lawyers and academics were among those targeted, and that at least one US phone number with a Washington DC area code was among those potentially compromised. In a rare move for a major US company, WhatsApp has also twice referred its complaints about NSO to the US Department of Justice. The Facebook-owned company alerted the DoJ in May, when it first became aware of the issue, and again in October. WhatsApp said it believed NSO had violated criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law that is used to prosecute hackers. The justice department declined to comment. NSO has said it would defend itself against the lawsuit, insisting it sells its signature spyware, known as Pegasus, to foreign governments solely for the purpose of fighting crime and preventing terrorist attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that our technology helps governments save lives and address the challenges posed by criminals and terrorists using encrypted messaging technology,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cNSO software is specifically designed to not function on US phone numbers and cannot be used on phones with US area codes,\u201d the spokesperson added.

Ingka Group, the holding company that runs the majority of Ikea stores, said operating profit fell to \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) in the year to the end of August despite a 5.3% rise in revenue to \u20ac39.1bn. Pretax profits for the business, which also includes an investment arm and TaskRabbit, the odd-job gig economy app, rose 19% to \u20ac2.5bn as a result of a surge in income from financial investments. The company, which employs 166,000 staff at 374 Ikea stores in 30 countries, said it was \u201ca challenging time for retail\u201d but that sales continued to rise at its existing stores, smaller city stores and online. Sales at established stores rose 0.7% while online sales were up nearly 50%, to account for more than 10% of total retail sales. The company has previously reported that UK sales rose 8% to \u00a32.1bn in the year largely thanks to a surge in online business. Juvencio Maeztu, Ingka Group\u2019s deputy chief executive, said Ikea would aim to accelerate sales growth by opening more city-centre stores and aim to cut costs by investment in new technology and ways of working with sustainability in mind. Last year, the group said it was cutting 7,500 office jobs worldwide, including 350 in the UK, to focus on improving its online operation and city-centre format. But Ingka, which is one of 12 franchise groups that operate under deals with the brand\u2019s owner, Inter IKEA Systems, has also invested in wind and solar power, which it says will keep costs down longer term. Since 2009 Ikea has pumped close to \u20ac2.5bn into renewable energy so that it now owns 534 wind turbines and 715,000 solar panels in 14 countries as well as a further 920,000 solar panels on store rooftops. The company said it was on track to produce as much energy from renewable sources as consumed in its operations by next year.

It is even clearer that financial performance and sustainability go hand in hand, and for us this is how we will grow, stay relevant and remain profitable, long term.\u201d He said the financial performance for this financial year is in line with plans. \u201cWe will continue to test and try new things. At times we will fail and that\u2019s OK, as that\u2019s part of how we constantly develop and improve our business to better meet the needs of our customers for many years to come,\u201d Maeztu said.",

He told the court the fee was \u201cunaffordable\u201d for a \u201clarge number of would-be applicants\u201d who were entitled to British citizenship, who he said would \u201calso be living in poverty, or with severely limited means\u201d.</p> <p>During a protest before the hearing, Solange Valdez-Symonds, the director of PRCBC, said the case emphasised the importance of children\u2019s citizenship rights, which had been \u201cforgotten, neglected, and stamped on\u201d. Valdez-Symonds added: \u201cThe children we are talking about are not migrants, they don\u2019t have immigration problems. They were given statutory rights to register as citizens.\u201d</p> <p>She described the fee to register as a \u201cbig obstacle\u201d for children entitled to citizenship and said there were dire consequences for those who could not afford to register. \u201cChildren are at the moment either being detained, removed to countries they\u2019ve never been or their lives are in limbo. They have fears and nightmares on a day-to-day basis without the citizenship that their friends have. It\u2019s a daily, daily suffering for these children.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement submitted as part of the proceedings, O, aged 12, said: \u201cI was born in England in 2007. I have never travelled to another country. I don\u2019t want to tell my friends that I am not British like them because I\u2019m scared. I worry that if my friends find out, they won\u2019t understand that I really am British like them.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy playing netball for my school team. My team have been abroad twice for netball tournaments, but I could not travel because I do not have my British passport.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/04/unfair-citizenship-charges-for-children-are-damaging-britains-reputation\">Unfair citizenship charges for children are damaging Britain\u2019s reputation | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lisa Incledon, a volunteer for Amnesty International Children\u2019s Human Rights Network, said: \u201cThis is a generation of children who are going to become the next Windrush generation, where they are being shut out because they didn\u2019t get their citizenship. The government is making \u00a3645 profit on every application, so where we should be supporting children\u2019s rights, they\u2019re profiteering from children\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cCitizenship is really important, but it\u2019s not a commodity, it\u2019s a right. And to put a price on it, to be charging children who have a right to citizenship, so you can get funds to prop up the immigration system is indefensible.\u201d</p> <p>The British Nationality Act 1981 ended birthright citizenship and states people born in the UK are automatically British citizens if one of their parents is a British citizen or one of their parents is settled in the UK. The act makes a provision for children with parents without settled status, but who are born or grow up in the UK, allowing them the right to register as British citizens.</p> <p>The case challenges the profit element in all cases and the lawfulness of charging any fee where a child cannot afford it. The judicial review claim asks the Home Office to reduce the registration fee so it is no more than the administrative cost, introduce a fee waiver for children who cannot afford the fee and provide a fee exemption for children in local authority care.</p> <p>The Home Office keeps all fees under review. In written submissions, Sir James Eadie QC, for the Home Office, argued the entitlement to British citizenship was \u201cconditional upon payment of a fee and always has been \u2013 it is not an unconditional statutory right\u201d. Eadie said that \u201cif any particular applicant is genuinely unable to pay the fee, their ability to acquire citizenship is not lost; it is postponed until they can\u201d.</p> <p>The case will be heard by Mr Justice Jay at the royal court of justice over the next three days. More than a dozen children and supporters held a lively demonstration outside court on Tuesday before the hearing. The children were chanting: \u201cPassports, not profit. We are not for sale.\u201d</p>",

Valdez-Symonds added: \u201cThe children we are talking about are not migrants, they don\u2019t have immigration problems. They were given statutory rights to register as citizens.\u201d She described the fee to register as a \u201cbig obstacle\u201d for children entitled to citizenship and said there were dire consequences for those who could not afford to register. \u201cChildren are at the moment either being detained, removed to countries they\u2019ve never been or their lives are in limbo. They have fears and nightmares on a day-to-day basis without the citizenship that their friends have. It\u2019s a daily, daily suffering for these children.\u201d In a statement submitted as part of the proceedings, O, aged 12, said: \u201cI was born in England in 2007. I have never travelled to another country. I don\u2019t want to tell my friends that I am not British like them because I\u2019m scared. I worry that if my friends find out, they won\u2019t understand that I really am British like them. \u201cI enjoy playing netball for my school team. My team have been abroad twice for netball tournaments, but I could not travel because I do not have my British passport.\u201d Lisa Incledon, a volunteer for Amnesty International Children\u2019s Human Rights Network, said: \u201cThis is a generation of children who are going to become the next Windrush generation, where they are being shut out because they didn\u2019t get their citizenship. The government is making \u00a3645 profit on every application, so where we should be supporting children\u2019s rights, they\u2019re profiteering from children\u2019s rights.\u201d She added: \u201cCitizenship is really important, but it\u2019s not a commodity, it\u2019s a right. And to put a price on it, to be charging children who have a right to citizenship, so you can get funds to prop up the immigration system is indefensible.\u201d The British Nationality Act 1981 ended birthright citizenship and states people born in the UK are automatically British citizens if one of their parents is a British citizen or one of their parents is settled in the UK. The act makes a provision for children with parents without settled status, but who are born or grow up in the UK, allowing them the right to register as British citizens. The case challenges the profit element in all cases and the lawfulness of charging any fee where a child cannot afford it. The judicial review claim asks the Home Office to reduce the registration fee so it is no more than the administrative cost, introduce a fee waiver for children who cannot afford the fee and provide a fee exemption for children in local authority care. The Home Office keeps all fees under review. In written submissions, Sir James Eadie QC, for the Home Office, argued the entitlement to British citizenship was \u201cconditional upon payment of a fee and always has been \u2013 it is not an unconditional statutory right\u201d. Eadie said that \u201cif any particular applicant is genuinely unable to pay the fee, their ability to acquire citizenship is not lost; it is postponed until they can\u201d. The case will be heard by Mr Justice Jay at the royal court of justice over the next three days. More than a dozen children and supporters held a lively demonstration outside court on Tuesday before the hearing. The children were chanting: \u201cPassports, not profit. We are not for sale.\u201d",

Ironically it was the late Peter Deakin at both Sale and Saracens who first showed rugby union how best to put unfamiliar bums on seats 20 years ago: increasingly the trend has been for in-house TV interviews, decreasing access to the big stars and fewer enlightened press officers, particularly around international teams.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the 21-year-old Curry was just finishing a short press conference when he was asked how he was handling fame? Before he could reply, Sale\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, called a halt. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering questions about that,\u201d Diamond said crisply, before escorting Curry out of the room.

      "body": "<p>The NFL has a real problem when the marquee match-up for its most famous broadcast is best enjoyed on mute. This week, Lamar Jackson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/26/lamar-jackson-throws-five-tds-as-ravens-rout-rams-on-the-road-baltimore-la-nfl\">eviscerated the Rams on Monday Night Football</a> in one of the most impressive individual performances in recent memory. The only problem: the experience of watching Jackson\u2019s genius was made worse, not better, by ESPN\u2019s announcing crew, Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland.</p> <p>This is the broadcast of Madden and Gruden and Michaels and Cosell. It is the pinnacle of the profession. Such an event broadcast by a company that <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/2019/05/24/espn-new-slogan-worldwide-leader-sports/1225307001/\">once styled itself</a> the Worldwide Leader In Sports should not have you wondering every five minutes how this is the best they can offer. Here are just a few doozies from McFarland\u2019s latest Monday night:</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cTess, in order for Lamar Jackson to win MVP, he will have to convince people he is more valuable than Patrick Mahomes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cIf I\u2019m the Rams, I\u2019m gonna force Lamar to have the football. All you gotta do is tackle him!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cA false start penalty on second-and-five might actually help the Rams.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cThe Rams, you know, have yellow uniforms.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cAmerica, listen to me now: stop allowing tight ends to block premier pass-rushers one-on-one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/26/lamar-jackson-throws-five-tds-as-ravens-rout-rams-on-the-road-baltimore-la-nfl\">Lamar Jackson throws five TDs as Ravens rout Rams on the road</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That final one is his magnum opus. McFarland addressed the country as if the electorate had voted for an idiotic football strategy and he was here to ignite a revolution. In truth, Monday Night Football has been a mess since Mike Tirico left for NBC in 2016. Jon Gruden\u2019s Jon Gruden-ness papered over the cracks during a shaky two-year affair with Sean McDonough, but the broadcast has been in freefall ever since.</p> <p>Last season ESPN tried to emulate CBS\u2019s success with Tony Romo by hiring another retired Dallas Cowboy, Jason Witten. One issue: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/tony-romo-cbs-nfl-analyst-dallas-cowboys\">Romo is a once in a generation broadcast talent</a>, smart and funny and natural and unique. Witten was not: to call him wooden would be an insult to pine. ESPN pulled the plug after just one year, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/28/jason-witten-unretires-dallas-cowboys-espn\">Witten returned to the playing field</a>. Tessitore\u2019s ropey debut was given a pass: <em>Working with Witten would be tough for anyone, </em>became the consensus.</p> <p>Up stepped McFarland, who had spent much of the season patrolling the sidelines in the now-infamous \u201c<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/03/07/espns-booger-mobile-is-dead/\">Booger Mobile</a>\u201d, one of the most bizarre and pointless inventions in the history of television. McFarland was a decent in-studio college football analyst, but he has been awful as a national NFL voice. He sounds like he\u2019s started a sentence and has no idea where it\u2019s going to end. On Monday, McFarland officially entered the Biden Zone. At this point, you don\u2019t really care what he says, you\u2019re just hoping he can stumble his way to a coherent conclusion. Tessitore is a real problem, too. That booming voice was perfect for the ever-ridiculous world of college football but falls flat in the pros. In the NFL, Tessitore sounds like a condescending try-hard.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vof8y0xPtoI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vof8y0xPtoI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And then there\u2019s the graphics department, which was subject to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vof8y0xPtoI\">John Oliver scolding</a> a little over a year ago. Things haven\u2019t improved. The network had to update its graphics bar <em>mid-game </em>during its <a href=\"https://www.newscaststudio.com/2019/09/10/espn-monday-night-football-graphics-venom/\">debut broadcast of the season</a> because the new down-and-distance box was bright yellow, causing viewers to think a penalty was being called on every play. Think about that: meetings took place over that decision. People had coffee and sandwiches and showed PowerPoints and shook hands and high-fived.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/tony-romo-cbs-nfl-analyst-dallas-cowboys\">Is Tony Romo already the greatest TV analyst in US sports?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It often feels like the show\u2019s producers are more interested in their carefully choreographed packages and graphics than the actual game unfolding on the field. No other broadcast misses a play as consistently as Monday Night Football, continuing to prove that there is nothing in media or entertainment that cannot be ruined by more money and time. Spare us dancing 3D models and show us what Patrick Mahomes is doing at the line of scrimmage.</p> <p>Moving on from one or both of Tessitore and McFarland is inevitable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/31/nfl-tv-coverage-racial-demographics-super-bowl\">McFarland\u2019s selection was important</a> because the NFL\u2019s flagship broadcast hadn\u2019t had an African American analyst in the booth in decades, but his performance has become indefensible. ESPN has a bunch of talented people in-house \u2013 Louis Riddick, Dan Orlovsky to name but two \u2013 or they could pinch someone away from a rival network.</p> <p>ESPN\u2019s owners, Disney, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/sports/football/espn-extends-deal-with-nfl-for-15-billion.html\">handed over $15.2bn to the NFL</a> for the rights to broadcast one game per week and receive the worst of the league\u2019s playoff match-ups. Executives justify that price by saying it allows ESPN to show highlights and game footage throughout the season across its range of channels and talking-head shows. Yet Monday Night Football remains the company\u2019s prestige telecast, despite its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanberr/2018/03/07/can-espns-new-ceo-jimmy-pitaro-save-monday-night-football/#7272115b58e6\">flagging ratings</a>. Disney is a market leader and conqueror, it is not in the business of being mocked. There is a real problem when the only enjoyable part of the show is the rules analyst, John Parry. Right now, Monday Night Football is fundamentally broken and remains dead stinking last among national broadcasts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The NFL has a real problem when the marquee match-up for its most famous broadcast is best enjoyed on mute. This week, Lamar Jackson eviscerated the Rams on Monday Night Football in one of the most impressive individual performances in recent memory. The only problem: the experience of watching Jackson\u2019s genius was made worse, not better, by ESPN\u2019s announcing crew, Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland. This is the broadcast of Madden and Gruden and Michaels and Cosell. It is the pinnacle of the profession. Such an event broadcast by a company that once styled itself the Worldwide Leader In Sports should not have you wondering every five minutes how this is the best they can offer. Here are just a few doozies from McFarland\u2019s latest Monday night: \u2022 \u201cTess, in order for Lamar Jackson to win MVP, he will have to convince people he is more valuable than Patrick Mahomes.\u201d \u2022 \u201cIf I\u2019m the Rams, I\u2019m gonna force Lamar to have the football. All you gotta do is tackle him!\u201d \u2022 \u201cA false start penalty on second-and-five might actually help the Rams.\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe Rams, you know, have yellow uniforms.\u201d \u2022 \u201cAmerica, listen to me now: stop allowing tight ends to block premier pass-rushers one-on-one.\u201d That final one is his magnum opus. McFarland addressed the country as if the electorate had voted for an idiotic football strategy and he was here to ignite a revolution. In truth, Monday Night Football has been a mess since Mike Tirico left for NBC in 2016. Jon Gruden\u2019s Jon Gruden-ness papered over the cracks during a shaky two-year affair with Sean McDonough, but the broadcast has been in freefall ever since. Last season ESPN tried to emulate CBS\u2019s success with Tony Romo by hiring another retired Dallas Cowboy, Jason Witten. One issue: Romo is a once in a generation broadcast talent, smart and funny and natural and unique. Witten was not: to call him wooden would be an insult to pine. ESPN pulled the plug after just one year, and Witten returned to the playing field. Tessitore\u2019s ropey debut was given a pass: Working with Witten would be tough for anyone, became the consensus. Up stepped McFarland, who had spent much of the season patrolling the sidelines in the now-infamous \u201cBooger Mobile\u201d, one of the most bizarre and pointless inventions in the history of television. McFarland was a decent in-studio college football analyst, but he has been awful as a national NFL voice. He sounds like he\u2019s started a sentence and has no idea where it\u2019s going to end. On Monday, McFarland officially entered the Biden Zone. At this point, you don\u2019t really care what he says, you\u2019re just hoping he can stumble his way to a coherent conclusion. Tessitore is a real problem, too. That booming voice was perfect for the ever-ridiculous world of college football but falls flat in the pros. In the NFL, Tessitore sounds like a condescending try-hard. And then there\u2019s the graphics department, which was subject to a John Oliver scolding a little over a year ago. Things haven\u2019t improved. The network had to update its graphics bar mid-game during its debut broadcast of the season because the new down-and-distance box was bright yellow, causing viewers to think a penalty was being called on every play. Think about that: meetings took place over that decision. People had coffee and sandwiches and showed PowerPoints and shook hands and high-fived. It often feels like the show\u2019s producers are more interested in their carefully choreographed packages and graphics than the actual game unfolding on the field. No other broadcast misses a play as consistently as Monday Night Football, continuing to prove that there is nothing in media or entertainment that cannot be ruined by more money and time. Spare us dancing 3D models and show us what Patrick Mahomes is doing at the line of scrimmage. Moving on from one or both of Tessitore and McFarland is inevitable. McFarland\u2019s selection was important because the NFL\u2019s flagship broadcast hadn\u2019t had an African American analyst in the booth in decades, but his performance has become indefensible. ESPN has a bunch of talented people in-house \u2013 Louis Riddick, Dan Orlovsky to name but two \u2013 or they could pinch someone away from a rival network. ESPN\u2019s owners, Disney, handed over $15.2bn to the NFL for the rights to broadcast one game per week and receive the worst of the league\u2019s playoff match-ups. Executives justify that price by saying it allows ESPN to show highlights and game footage throughout the season across its range of channels and talking-head shows. Yet Monday Night Football remains the company\u2019s prestige telecast, despite its flagging ratings. Disney is a market leader and conqueror, it is not in the business of being mocked. There is a real problem when the only enjoyable part of the show is the rules analyst, John Parry. Right now, Monday Night Football is fundamentally broken and remains dead stinking last among national broadcasts.",

Hell, it\u2019s been a hellish three years. I used to worry that the contradictory demands of Brexit might kill off the civil service.

What worries me now is that Brexit might not kill us. That it will never \u201cjust get it done\u201d. That we will all simply keep going, endlessly orbiting around this Brexit black hole in a perpetual, exhausting state of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/boris-johnson-drops-word-onanism-from-speech-after-criticism\" title=\"\">onanistic</a>, no-deal groundhoggery.

This year, there have been <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/senior-civil-servants-open-about-mental-health-struggles-awareness-campaign\" title=\"\">awareness campaigns</a>, posters on the walls reminding us exactly how OK it is not to be OK, and endless emails from HR and senior civil servants telling us to look after our mental health.

      "bodyText": "Civil servants are in the pre-election period that used to be called \u201cpurdah\u201d, before anyone realised we shouldn\u2019t use that word. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d just assumed it was an election campaign portmanteau cooked up by Dominic Cummings to unsettle northern Labour voters by giving the words \u201cpurgatory\u201d and \u201cmurder\u201d a Cockney mashup. It has more than unsettled us. PFFP \u2013 or the period formerly famous as purdah \u2013 normally means knackered civil servants like me have a chance to put our trotters up for a bit. That\u2019s because, until the result comes in, Cabinet Office rules mean we aren\u2019t allowed to get stuck into any major new policy or spending decisions. Trouble is, this election is proving to be far from normal \u2013 its wintry setting doesn\u2019t even make the top five most Game of Thrones things about it. Facing almost wartime levels of uncertainty \u2013 as the Institute for Government explains \u2013 is putting the civil service under incredible strain, and we need to get ready for some potentially huge U-turns in government policy. Meanwhile, although Operation Yellowhammer has officially been stood down, thousands of us \u2013 me included \u2013 are still working on preparations for a no-deal outcome after 31 January. For civil servants, says the IfG\u2019s director of research, Emma Norris, \u201call bets are off\u201d. All in all, it\u2019s been a bruising few months for us. Hell, it\u2019s been a hellish three years. I used to worry that the contradictory demands of Brexit might kill off the civil service. Then, when the full horrific impact of any sort of Brexit first became known, I started hoping that Brexit would kill us off. Better that than actively facilitating \u2013 and then being blamed for \u2013 the most significant act of national self-harm in living memory. Thankfully, that was just a momentary wobble. What worries me now is that Brexit might not kill us. That it will never \u201cjust get it done\u201d. That we will all simply keep going, endlessly orbiting around this Brexit black hole in a perpetual, exhausting state of onanistic, no-deal groundhoggery. The idea that all this could be celebrated one day by our amphibious descendants at a festival of Brexit \u2013 a sort of cognitive dissonance Olympics \u2013 is too horrible to bear. I admit it \u2013 I\u2019m depressed. So many of us are. Earlier this year, the Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake flagged the rising multimillion-pound cost of mental illness in the civil service as partly due to the impact of Brexit \u201cboth in terms of direct attacks on civil servants \u2026 and diverting staff from other policy work\u201d. In some ways, we\u2019re incredibly lucky \u2013 many government departments now offer a range of mental health support services. This year, there have been awareness campaigns, posters on the walls reminding us exactly how OK it is not to be OK, and endless emails from HR and senior civil servants telling us to look after our mental health. And last month we saw the launch of the government-wide annual People Survey, which for the first time has asked all 400,000 of us questions about our mental wellbeing \u2013 our bosses anxiously and unironically await the full results in mid-January. If I sound less than grateful for all this, it\u2019s because these efforts aren\u2019t working. Like the rest of the UK, we feel utterly powerless about Brexit. I wrote about no-deal risk management meetings where no one dares name the real risks to the country\u2019s sanity. I\u2019m no psychologist, but I\u2019m convinced the cause of all this stress on us \u2013 and on you \u2013 isn\u2019t actually Brexit. It\u2019s a spectacular and persistent failure of government and politicians simply to tell the truth about Brexit. The defenestrated senior Tory David Gauke spoke last week of the \u201cfailure to level with the British people \u2026 the idea that we\u2019re just going to kind of get Brexit done on 31 January and then we can move on to other things \u2026 simply doesn\u2019t reflect the reality\u201d. He hit the nail on the head. This pernicious and systematic contempt for the truth must be tackled by the incoming cohort of parliamentarians if we\u2019re to have any chance of avoiding a Trumpian descent into a paralysing, partisan madness that\u2019ll poison politics for a generation. But civil servants are not blameless either. We aren\u2019t just victims of political gaslighting, we\u2019re also unwilling accomplices in a range of crimes against the country\u2019s mental health. What do they say? Hurt people hurt people. Take those in the Department for Work and Pensions, who are amassing their own miserable scrapbook of stories about how its systems are driving up poverty and demoralising the people they are supposed to be helping \u2013 and then telling claimants to hide the subsequent effects on their mental health. There\u2019s also the DWP\u2019s campaign that last month was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for brazenly misleading the public about the effects of universal credit. I don\u2019t say this to blame or shame my DWP colleagues. Given the kind of policies they have to enforce, it\u2019s actually strangely reassuring that the DWP sits at the top of the government rankings for total numbers of stress-related absence. In the end, we are all human beings. The reality is that civil servants ache to talk about reality, about how things really are. We instinctively know that the freedom to do that lies at the heart of both good government and good mental health.

      "body": "<p>Three years ago, coral reef along the Kenyan coastline was almost totally destroyed in some areas. Rising surface sea temperatures had triggered devastating bleaching episodes for the fourth time in less than two decades, and with the whitening of coral came a dwindling of marine life. Overfishing only exacerbated the problem.</p> <p>For coastal communities dependent on the sea for their livelihoods, the degradation of the coral reef and its effect on the marine ecosystem threatened to overturn an entire way of life. In some areas surveyed by the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), as much as 60-90% of coral was destroyed.</p> <p>A fightback was needed and so the institute began working with local communities to rehabilitate degraded coral reefs along the country\u2019s coastline. Among the areas targeted was Wasini Island, a tiny strip of land off Kenya\u2019s south-east coast. The results have been startling.</p> <p>Women on the island have led an initiative to restore degraded coral that has shown how coral restoration techniques can revive marine ecosystems and create sustainable livelihoods for communities that depend on fishing and eco-tourism.</p> <p>\u201cThe fish have started coming back since the restoration activities began,\u201d says Nasura Ali, of the Wasini Beach Management Unit, which has about 250 members, of whom roughly 150 are women. More than 40 people have been trained in restoration techniques.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9652364791a4404a00742acdbe5b5b5ca75ef7f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9652364791a4404a00742acdbe5b5b5ca75ef7f6/419_517_1736_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nasura Ali and Nazo Yaro, members of the  Wasini Beach Management Unit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nasura Ali and Nazo Yaro, both members of the Wasini Beach Management Unit, with coral reef models they have constructed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoffrey Kamadi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year-long study by the KMFRI had tested the viability of raising coral fragments from areas affected by bleaching events, explains Jelvas Mwaura at the KMFRI\u2019s department of marine environment and ecology. Many of the corals transplanted from coral gardens to degraded reef areas for the study survived, providing new habitats for fish species including jacks, groupers, emperors and sweetlips.</p> <p>This success led to funding from the Kenya Coastal Development project (KCDP). Locals on Wasini Island have since grown more than 3,000 corals.</p> <p>Coral reefs provide shelter and breeding grounds for hundreds of species of marine life. Fish populations in waters around the island have increased three times as much as in other areas, says the KMFRI.</p> <p>\u201cNot only have these conservation efforts increased fish numbers in protected areas but the rising populations are spilling over into non-protected areas, benefiting many more people,\u201d says Dishon Murage, a consultant with US-based environmental conservation organisation <a href=\"https://www.seacology.org/\">Seacology</a> and lecturer at the Technical University of Mombasa.</p> <p>The women of Wasini Island have also been restoring fish populations by cultivating seagrass. Overfishing of certain species, such as trigger fish, had led to the disappearance of seagrass because trigger fish fed on the sea urchins that devoured it. Using gunny bags made of sisal to protect the seedlings and prevent them from getting washed away, the women replanted seagrass seedlings on the ocean floor.</p> <p>In addition to providing food, seagrass plays a key role in the overall coral reef ecosystem, providing shelter to juvenile fish after they hatch by shielding them from strong waves until they mature and move into the coral reefs.</p> <p>Murage, who has been working with the people of Wasini Island for more than a decade, says the coral restoration has also boosted ecotourism. Before the conservation project, only 30% of the community relied on ecotourism for an income. \u201cThis rate has gone up to nearly 80% today,\u201d says Murage.</p> <p>Tourists pay a nominal fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (\u00a33.80) to experience the marine environment, while locals are charged about 102 shillings.</p> <p>Nazo Yaro, who is also part of the marine conservation effort, says educating fishermen to stop indiscriminate fishing, especially in vulnerable areas of the reef, has also helped. \u201cLobsters and octopuses are back as a result,\u201d she says triumphantly.</p> <p>Both Ali and Yaro have been trained in making artificial reefs courtesy of a joint initiative by the KMFRI and the UN development programme through the <a href=\"https://www.thegef.org/about/funding\">Global Environment Facility Fund</a>, which supports community-led environmental conservation efforts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59af917b7309c490ebeff2c33a043bbf3a52343c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59af917b7309c490ebeff2c33a043bbf3a52343c/0_22_2212_1327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corals growing on a man-made coral reef off Wasini Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corals growing on a man-made coral reef off Wasini Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoffrey Kamadi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coral reefs can be created in various ways.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, coral reef along the Kenyan coastline was almost totally destroyed in some areas. Rising surface sea temperatures had triggered devastating bleaching episodes for the fourth time in less than two decades, and with the whitening of coral came a dwindling of marine life. Overfishing only exacerbated the problem. For coastal communities dependent on the sea for their livelihoods, the degradation of the coral reef and its effect on the marine ecosystem threatened to overturn an entire way of life. In some areas surveyed by the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), as much as 60-90% of coral was destroyed. A fightback was needed and so the institute began working with local communities to rehabilitate degraded coral reefs along the country\u2019s coastline. Among the areas targeted was Wasini Island, a tiny strip of land off Kenya\u2019s south-east coast. The results have been startling. Women on the island have led an initiative to restore degraded coral that has shown how coral restoration techniques can revive marine ecosystems and create sustainable livelihoods for communities that depend on fishing and eco-tourism. \u201cThe fish have started coming back since the restoration activities began,\u201d says Nasura Ali, of the Wasini Beach Management Unit, which has about 250 members, of whom roughly 150 are women. More than 40 people have been trained in restoration techniques. A year-long study by the KMFRI had tested the viability of raising coral fragments from areas affected by bleaching events, explains Jelvas Mwaura at the KMFRI\u2019s department of marine environment and ecology. Many of the corals transplanted from coral gardens to degraded reef areas for the study survived, providing new habitats for fish species including jacks, groupers, emperors and sweetlips. This success led to funding from the Kenya Coastal Development project (KCDP). Locals on Wasini Island have since grown more than 3,000 corals. Coral reefs provide shelter and breeding grounds for hundreds of species of marine life. Fish populations in waters around the island have increased three times as much as in other areas, says the KMFRI. \u201cNot only have these conservation efforts increased fish numbers in protected areas but the rising populations are spilling over into non-protected areas, benefiting many more people,\u201d says Dishon Murage, a consultant with US-based environmental conservation organisation Seacology and lecturer at the Technical University of Mombasa. The women of Wasini Island have also been restoring fish populations by cultivating seagrass. Overfishing of certain species, such as trigger fish, had led to the disappearance of seagrass because trigger fish fed on the sea urchins that devoured it. Using gunny bags made of sisal to protect the seedlings and prevent them from getting washed away, the women replanted seagrass seedlings on the ocean floor. In addition to providing food, seagrass plays a key role in the overall coral reef ecosystem, providing shelter to juvenile fish after they hatch by shielding them from strong waves until they mature and move into the coral reefs. Murage, who has been working with the people of Wasini Island for more than a decade, says the coral restoration has also boosted ecotourism. Before the conservation project, only 30% of the community relied on ecotourism for an income. \u201cThis rate has gone up to nearly 80% today,\u201d says Murage. Tourists pay a nominal fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (\u00a33.80) to experience the marine environment, while locals are charged about 102 shillings. Nazo Yaro, who is also part of the marine conservation effort, says educating fishermen to stop indiscriminate fishing, especially in vulnerable areas of the reef, has also helped. \u201cLobsters and octopuses are back as a result,\u201d she says triumphantly. Both Ali and Yaro have been trained in making artificial reefs courtesy of a joint initiative by the KMFRI and the UN development programme through the Global Environment Facility Fund, which supports community-led environmental conservation efforts. Coral reefs can be created in various ways. One method, widely practised in Japan and Malaysia, involves the use of concrete blocks. \u201cHowever, it is very expensive, because it demands a lot of cement and sand,\u201d says Mwaura. Since the project aims to increase coral restoration in a vast area of roughly 2 hectares (4.9 acres), locally available materials are used instead of concrete. Rock boulders found on the shoreline, and held together with hydraulic cement, are used to create artificial reef structures. But before corals are planted on these man-made reefs, they are raised in a nursery, a process that takes three to four weeks. \u201cThe nursery ought to be a suitable area free of sedimentation, strong currents and boat traffic, where the water is mostly free-flowing,\u201d says Mwaura. Visual observation indicates that corals transplanted in this way have a survival rate of 75%. Research carried out by KMFRI in 2013 found that 15 out of 32 coral species studied were able to survive. The method was then used for restoration in areas of the ocean chosen by local people. Kenya and the Seychelles are the only African countries to implement this type of coral reef restoration, with Kenya lighting the way for such efforts along the Indian Ocean coast as long ago as 1968, when Malindi national marine park was established. However, the Seychelles, Madagascar and Mauritius are among countries that have overtaken Kenya in coral reef conservation by securing financial support, as well as effective monitoring and law enforcement.",

      "body": "<p>I first came across Sharron Maasz in January this year when I watched her being interviewed on a number of videos on YouTube. I discovered them after hearing that a woman had died in accommodation designated for women experiencing homelessness in my home city of Oxford. Sharron was 44 years old.</p> <p>She was popular and, according to those who knew her, warm, kind, compassionate and loving. Sharron was a mother and a grandmother. She died after a long period of experiencing homelessness in Oxford, the city where we were both born and raised, and which we both called home. Later, through devastated mutual friends, I learned that we attended the same school; our paths never crossed as she was older than me, and we ended up living very different lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Just because you are on the streets doesn\u2019t mean you are a piece of rubbish,' Sharron says to camera. 'It just breaks my heart'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the past two years, however, I\u2019ve had a lot of direct contact with people experiencing homelessness in my own city and across the country as co-founder of the <a href=\"https://www.labourhomelessness.org.uk/\">Labour Homelessness Campaign</a>. I discovered that domestic violence triggered the loss of Sharron\u2019s job, home and child custody \u2013 just some of the factors that led to her spiralling into drink and addiction.</p> <p>Sharron, talking directly to the camera in one of the videos, describes in detail the mental pain from a former abusive relationship. \u201cJust because you are on the streets doesn\u2019t mean you are a piece of rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody knows the stories everyone I know has been through \u2026 It just breaks my heart.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz3cAS84lSY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qz3cAS84lSY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This video broke my heart, too. Sharron\u2019s words echo the experiences of many women sleeping rough and homeless, not only in Oxford but also across the country. Tory austerity over the past nine years means that the help women should be able to turn to \u2013 domestic violence services, women\u2019s refuges, mental health and addiction services \u2013 have been destroyed by funding cuts, putting women and children at greater risk.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/26/domestic-abuse-survivors-and-children-sleeping-rough-survey-finds\">Recent research by Women\u2019s Aid</a> shows that more than one in 10 women supported by the charity in the 12 months to January 2018 had been forced to sleep rough after fleeing domestic abuse, while almost half \u2013 many of whom had their children with them \u2013 had to sofa-surf. All the evidence shows that violence against women is one of the biggest triggers of rising numbers of women experiencing homelessness.</p> <p>My work as a city councillor in Oxford has been focused on women who are sleeping rough or homeless. Almost every woman I\u2019ve met in the past two years has a story connected to domestic violence, sexual abuse, coercive control and threats. This violence becomes even more of a threat to women when they become homeless. Many enter controlling and abusive relationships with other men on the streets to try to stay safe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4994bfd385630091a58fd520f1f30a3d4bbf9201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4994bfd385630091a58fd520f1f30a3d4bbf9201/0_270_4385_2632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shaista Aziz and Monica Gregory, who knew Sharron Maasz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaista Aziz (right) with Monica Gregory, who knew Sharron Maasz.

It reminded everyone of how loved she was, how many people she knew, and how hard she tried to overcome the injustices inflicted upon her and her body. A number of other people experiencing homelessness have died this year in Oxford. The most recent death was last week \u2013 the third this year of a person in homeless accommodation.</p> <p>These deaths, and the work of campaigners in the city, have finally started to shift the narrative, but it didn\u2019t save Sharron. Oxford, a wealthy city, has no specific shelter or safe space where women who have just begun to experience homelessness and rough sleeping can be accommodated in women-only spaces. That must change.</p> <p>Sharron, because she was on the \u201chomeless pathway\u201d (to use that grim bureaucratic term), was living in what should have been a safe, women-only space. As a city councillor I visited the property before it opened to women. More projects like this are needed across the country to enable women to turn their lives around.</p> <p>However, these projects must be genuine safe spaces for women with very complex needs \u2013 spaces where they are safe from men preying on their vulnerability. The official account of Sharron\u2019s death tells us that this was not the case.

      "bodyText": "I first came across Sharron Maasz in January this year when I watched her being interviewed on a number of videos on YouTube. I discovered them after hearing that a woman had died in accommodation designated for women experiencing homelessness in my home city of Oxford. Sharron was 44 years old. She was popular and, according to those who knew her, warm, kind, compassionate and loving. Sharron was a mother and a grandmother. She died after a long period of experiencing homelessness in Oxford, the city where we were both born and raised, and which we both called home. Later, through devastated mutual friends, I learned that we attended the same school; our paths never crossed as she was older than me, and we ended up living very different lives. Over the past two years, however, I\u2019ve had a lot of direct contact with people experiencing homelessness in my own city and across the country as co-founder of the Labour Homelessness Campaign. I discovered that domestic violence triggered the loss of Sharron\u2019s job, home and child custody \u2013 just some of the factors that led to her spiralling into drink and addiction. Sharron, talking directly to the camera in one of the videos, describes in detail the mental pain from a former abusive relationship. \u201cJust because you are on the streets doesn\u2019t mean you are a piece of rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody knows the stories everyone I know has been through \u2026 It just breaks my heart.\u201d This video broke my heart, too. Sharron\u2019s words echo the experiences of many women sleeping rough and homeless, not only in Oxford but also across the country. Tory austerity over the past nine years means that the help women should be able to turn to \u2013 domestic violence services, women\u2019s refuges, mental health and addiction services \u2013 have been destroyed by funding cuts, putting women and children at greater risk. Recent research by Women\u2019s Aid shows that more than one in 10 women supported by the charity in the 12 months to January 2018 had been forced to sleep rough after fleeing domestic abuse, while almost half \u2013 many of whom had their children with them \u2013 had to sofa-surf. All the evidence shows that violence against women is one of the biggest triggers of rising numbers of women experiencing homelessness. My work as a city councillor in Oxford has been focused on women who are sleeping rough or homeless. Almost every woman I\u2019ve met in the past two years has a story connected to domestic violence, sexual abuse, coercive control and threats. This violence becomes even more of a threat to women when they become homeless. Many enter controlling and abusive relationships with other men on the streets to try to stay safe. I interviewed a group of women last year as part of Oxford council\u2019s No Local Connection review group, including trans women and those with disabilities, and invited women to the town hall to speak about their lives. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sat asking people for money I feel invisible,\u201d said one. \u201cI am not treated as a person. I am seen as a junkie, a problem, a prostitute, an alcoholic. They don\u2019t see you as a normal person who is down on their luck.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been spat on, I\u2019ve been pissed on, people look at me like I\u2019m dirt,\u201d said another. \u201cIn the day and night-time, and by men and women.\u201d Off the back of this work, the women came together to create the Women\u2019s Hope Forum, to share their experiences and create a network of mutual support. After Sharron\u2019s death, there was a great deal of anguish in the city among those who knew her. It reminded everyone of how loved she was, how many people she knew, and how hard she tried to overcome the injustices inflicted upon her and her body. A number of other people experiencing homelessness have died this year in Oxford. The most recent death was last week \u2013 the third this year of a person in homeless accommodation. These deaths, and the work of campaigners in the city, have finally started to shift the narrative, but it didn\u2019t save Sharron. Oxford, a wealthy city, has no specific shelter or safe space where women who have just begun to experience homelessness and rough sleeping can be accommodated in women-only spaces. That must change. Sharron, because she was on the \u201chomeless pathway\u201d (to use that grim bureaucratic term), was living in what should have been a safe, women-only space. As a city councillor I visited the property before it opened to women. More projects like this are needed across the country to enable women to turn their lives around. However, these projects must be genuine safe spaces for women with very complex needs \u2013 spaces where they are safe from men preying on their vulnerability. The official account of Sharron\u2019s death tells us that this was not the case. Lessons must now be put into action.

The judge said the jury had rejected Williams\u2019 account and that by 7pm on the Saturday, eight hours after receiving the video, she was aware a video was on her phone and of \u201cits broad context\u201d, given her sister\u2019s extreme reaction to it. The judge said it was \u201ca grave error of judgment\u201d by Williams to do nothing about the video, adding that, because of her experience as a police officer, she knew the \u201cimperative\u201d to act to safeguard the five-year-old child shown in the video being abused by an adult. Janet Hills, chair of the BPA, said: \u201cThere have been many examples in the last couple of years of black senior officers being held to account at a higher level than their white counterparts. This has to stop. The finer detail of this case needs to be scrutinised to ensure that there is fairness for all.\u201d The judge said as he sentenced Williams: \u201cThe fact that you did nothing about it was a grave error of judgment on your part, especially given the fact that by dint of your job, you knew the imperative of so doing and had the ready means at your disposal to act \u2026 It is though an error of judgment from which you neither gained nor stood to gain in any way which makes it all the harder to understand.\u201d The Met deputy assistant commissioner Matthew Horne said: \u201cThe prosecution called this a \u2018sad case\u2019 and referred to the \u2018serious errors of judgement\u2019 made by those involved. \u201cThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is carrying out an independent misconduct investigation into the actions of Supt Williams and we await the outcome.\u201d The court heard that Hodge, who was convicted of distributing the image, had lost her job with the charity Scope after 17 years and it had destroyed her relationship with her sister. She was sentenced to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. \u201cI have no doubt you are a thoroughly decent woman,\u201d the judge told her. He accepted she sent the video in outrage and the court heard she had wanted those behind it caught and jailed. Throughout the three-week trial, Williams stayed away from Hodge and her partner, and did not seem to exchange a word or glance. Hodge\u2019s partner, Dido Massivi, has lost his job as a bus driver after 20 years. The court heard he blamed himself for the damage inflicted on Williams and her career, and his partner. Massivi, 61, was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment suspended for two years, and to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. He was convicted of distributing two indecent images and possessing an extreme image.",

      "body": "<p>For the second time in a few years, Uber is under threat in London. Transport for London has judged the firm to not be \u201cfit and proper\u201d. It\u2019s likely Uber will make a few minor tweaks to win back the licence. But if TfL wants a truly fit and proper ride-hailing service in London, it should establish a driver-owned alternative to Uber.</p> <p>Back in 2017, London\u2019s transport regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/22/uber-licence-transport-for-london-tfl\" title=\"\">cancelled Uber\u2019s licence</a>, saying the company was compromising the safety of riders and not sharing data with the regulator. Uber promised to clean up its act. It added new rider safety features to the app, tightened the driver registration process, and promised to share more of its data with the regulator. The TfL license was reinstated.</p> <p>Now, two years down the line, TfL has put the ride-hailing company on notice again. This time the regulator found that Uber\u2019s driver registration system is relatively easy to deceive. That has meant customers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/25/uber-loses-licence-london-tfl\" title=\"\">taken over 14,000 rides</a> with unregistered drivers.</p> <p>Uber is not facing problems only in London. Critics around the world have called out the company for undermining working conditions, clogging up city streets, destroying the traditional taxi industry, minimising the tax it pays, side-stepping national regulations and fostering a culture of toxic masculinity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/09/uber-sharing-economy-ride-share-ipo\">What is Uber? Forget the sharing economy \u2013 it's just a libertarian scam | Dominic Rushe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Uber has been <a href=\"https://www.tourism-review.com/many-cities-around-the-world-banned-uber-news11032\" title=\"\">banned</a> in cities including Frankfurt, Barcelona and Budapest. Even in places where Uber continues to operate, its business model has been attacked by regulators. In recent years, the European court of justice has ruled that Uber is not a tech firm but a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/20/uber-european-court-of-justice-ruling-barcelona-taxi-drivers-ecj-eu\" title=\"\">transportation services</a>\u201d company. This means Uber can no longer side-step the rules which apply to other taxi companies. Regulators in Europe and California have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/technology/california-gig-economy-bill.html\" title=\"\">ruled</a> that Uber drivers are employees not independent contractors. This means they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/19/uber-loses-appeal-over-driver-employment-rights\" title=\"\">entitled to the basic rights</a> of regular employees such as sick pay and holidays.</p> <p>Uber is likely to appeal the decision to ban it from London. The company will probably promise to further tighten up its driver registration procedures and police drivers more closely. And considering Uber has become such an important part of the city\u2019s transport infrastructure and is popular with customers, I suspect TfL will eventually reinstate its licence.</p> <p>But there is a danger that this pattern of ban, improve and reinstate will be repeated every time Uber\u2019s licence is up for renewal.

      "bodyText": "For the second time in a few years, Uber is under threat in London. Transport for London has judged the firm to not be \u201cfit and proper\u201d. It\u2019s likely Uber will make a few minor tweaks to win back the licence. But if TfL wants a truly fit and proper ride-hailing service in London, it should establish a driver-owned alternative to Uber. Back in 2017, London\u2019s transport regulator cancelled Uber\u2019s licence, saying the company was compromising the safety of riders and not sharing data with the regulator. Uber promised to clean up its act. It added new rider safety features to the app, tightened the driver registration process, and promised to share more of its data with the regulator. The TfL license was reinstated. Now, two years down the line, TfL has put the ride-hailing company on notice again. This time the regulator found that Uber\u2019s driver registration system is relatively easy to deceive. That has meant customers have taken over 14,000 rides with unregistered drivers. Uber is not facing problems only in London. Critics around the world have called out the company for undermining working conditions, clogging up city streets, destroying the traditional taxi industry, minimising the tax it pays, side-stepping national regulations and fostering a culture of toxic masculinity. Uber has been banned in cities including Frankfurt, Barcelona and Budapest. Even in places where Uber continues to operate, its business model has been attacked by regulators. In recent years, the European court of justice has ruled that Uber is not a tech firm but a \u201ctransportation services\u201d company. This means Uber can no longer side-step the rules which apply to other taxi companies. Regulators in Europe and California have ruled that Uber drivers are employees not independent contractors. This means they are entitled to the basic rights of regular employees such as sick pay and holidays. Uber is likely to appeal the decision to ban it from London. The company will probably promise to further tighten up its driver registration procedures and police drivers more closely. And considering Uber has become such an important part of the city\u2019s transport infrastructure and is popular with customers, I suspect TfL will eventually reinstate its licence. But there is a danger that this pattern of ban, improve and reinstate will be repeated every time Uber\u2019s licence is up for renewal. If TfL really wanted to get serious about ensuring Londoners have access to \u201cfit and proper\u201d riding-hailing services, it could take the more ambitious step of helping to set up a driver-owned alternative to Uber. This is not as strange as it might sound. When regulators in Austin, Texas decided to run Uber out of town, local drivers set up their own app called RideAustin. In 2017, the New Economics Foundation launched a project called CabFair which sought to create a driver-owned alternative to Uber in London. These alternatives should not come as a surprise. Co-operative structures are popular with drivers as not only do they make economic sense, they also give workers a greater say in how the systems which they rely on are run. Beyond the taxi industry, there is mounting evidence that worker-ownership has many benefits for organisations and industries as a whole. Recent research by some of my colleagues at Cass Business School found that worker-ownership had benefits such as better levels of productivity, more resilient local economies and greater employee engagement. The evidence in economics tends to suggest that employee-owned organisations are an important way of smoothing out income inequality. Employee ownership can also have significant psychological benefits for employees too. A meta-analysis found that workers in employee-owned businesses tended to be more satisfied, more motivated, more supportive and more likely to act in a civil and pro-social way at work.

There was even a social media move to try to make #BrendaDay an annual event in her honour., 4:B - 1979 was the Dimbleby debut. The picture above features Robin Day and Peter Snow alongside Dimbleby in 1987. It looks like a lifetime ago., 5:D - Margaret Thatcher won the Finchley seat at nine general elections. She came from Grantham, but was never MP there. , 6:D - Nuttall was possibly confusing her with Natalie Bennet of the Green party? Or maybe he was just very, very bad at TV debates., 7:B - It was 209. 229 was Neil Kinnock's tally in 1987. Ed Miliband led the party to 232 MPs in 2015., 8:B - Asquith narrowly managed to form a government after the January 1910 election, but was forced to call another before the year was out. 1974 also saw two elections, as Wilson's minority government took over from Heath's Conservatives, and then attempted to strengthen their position. , 9:D - After Clegg's TV debate performances sparked an up-tick for the Lib Dems in the polls. People reacted to a sudden glut of negative Clegg scare coverage on the front pages of the rightwing press., 10:B - Lord Buckethead never stood against Tony Blair.

After they met she told reporters that Brown was a \"very nice man\" and that she had voted Labour all her life and intended to do so again the following week. But then Brown's comments about her, calling her \"bigoted\", were caught on microphone., 13:C - Major contested the North London constituency twice in the 1970s before eventually becoming an MP and going on to become prime minister., 14:B - Ukip won one seat at the 2015 general election when Douglas Carswell was re-elected. They did at one point have two MPs, when Mark Reckless defected from the Conservatives and then successfully won a byelection, but he lost his seat in the 2015 campaign., 15:B - Just two votes separated Gethins from Liberal Democrat challenger Elizabeth Riches. It will be one of the most closely watched constituencies in the 2019 election., 16:C - A rescued stray cat chosen by Downing Street staff, Larry the cat moved into Number 10 in February 2011, when Cameron was in office.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"5\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Not so great.

Estimates for the number of demonstrators who remain range from less than 10 to a few dozen.</p> \n<p>The removal of the last few protesters brings to an end one of the most dramatic confrontations of the last five months of political unrest. According to the government, 1,100 people have left the campus in Kowloon since riot police surrounded it on 17 November after a day of intense clashes between protesters and police. </p> \n<p>Over the last week, the number of protesters remaining at the university has dwindled as groups escaped, some abseiling off a bridge and others tunnelling under barriers to nearby roads where volunteer drivers were waiting to drive them to safety.

      "bodyText": "Staff at Polytechnic University in Hong Kong, the site of a days-long police siege, say they have thoroughly swept the campus and found only one remaining protester, suggesting a bitter standoff between anti-government protesters and police is close to an end. A team of university staff, counsellors, medics, social workers and security personnel searched the campus for more than six hours and found one female demonstrator lying on a couch who \u201cappeared physically weak and emotionally unstable\u201d, according to a statement from the university. The university said its team had searched most buildings and car parks and would resume its search on Wednesday in case other protesters were still hiding on campus. Estimates for the number of demonstrators who remain range from less than 10 to a few dozen. The removal of the last few protesters brings to an end one of the most dramatic confrontations of the last five months of political unrest. According to the government, 1,100 people have left the campus in Kowloon since riot police surrounded it on 17 November after a day of intense clashes between protesters and police. Over the last week, the number of protesters remaining at the university has dwindled as groups escaped, some abseiling off a bridge and others tunnelling under barriers to nearby roads where volunteer drivers were waiting to drive them to safety. Many others have been caught by police and arrested. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities and Hong Kong\u2019s leader suggested on Tuesday they had little intention to compromise with the city\u2019s protest movement, despite a landslide victory for pro-democracy campaigners in local elections that served as a proxy referendum on six months of unrest. The city has enjoyed a few days of relative calm, as protesters held off turning out over the weekend to ensure the election could go ahead without disruption, and then waited to see how officials in China and Hong Kong would respond. That is unlikely to hold if there is no meaningful response to the vote. Pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of seats in district councils across the city, with 3 million people \u2013 70% of registered voters \u2013 casting a ballot. Beijing appears to be scrambling to respond to the unprecedented democratic rebuke to the Communist party. Officials have not directly addressed the outcome, instead repeating standard lines that Hong Kong is part of China. Chinese state media largely avoided reporting the results, noting only that polls had closed. However, late on Monday, an editorial from the state news agency Xinhua tried to delegitimise the huge democratic mandate Hong Kong had given the protesters by blaming \u201crioters\u201d supported by \u201cexternal forces\u201d for affecting the outcome of the election. \u201cThe rioters and anti-China Hong Kong politicians reap political benefits through the unfair election process by creating \u2018black terror\u2019 and chilling effect,\u201d it said. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who had for months claimed the support of a \u201csilent majority\u201d for her hardline stance on the protests, has accepted that the vote was a sweeping condemnation of her administration. In her first press conference since the vote ended, she said normally sleepy district council elections had had a rare \u201cpolitical dimension\u201d this year. \u201cWe were aware of the large number of voters coming out to cast their vote \u2026 to express a view on many issues in society, including, I would readily accept, that, deficiencies in governance, including unhappiness with the time taken to deal with the current unstable environment and of course to end violence,\u201d she said. However, she did not address the \u201cfive demands\u201d the protest movement has been making for months, including greater democracy and an independent inquiry into police violence during protests in which two people have died and hundreds left injured. Instead she repeaed vague promises of social consultations, which protesters have previously rejected, and returned to her September decision to drop the extradition bill that originally sparked protests, even though even at the time that was rejected as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. Lam also reiterated the pro-Beijing campaign line \u2013 clearly rejected at the polls \u2013 that Hong Kong residents\u2019 main desire was an end to the violence. \u201cHong Kong people have realised very clearly that Hong Kong can no longer tolerate this chaotic situation. Everybody wants to go back to their normal life,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I have said repeatedly, resorting to violence will not give us that way forward. So please help us to maintain that relative calm and peace that we have seen in the last week or so and provide a good basis for Hong Kong to move forward.\u201d Chinese authorities are so concerned by the city\u2019s spiralling unrest that the president, Xi Jinping, is getting daily written briefings on the situation, Reuters has reported. The government mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily also claimed that the election \u2013 which proceeded almost without incident on voting day \u2013 was skewed by violence. \u201cSocial unrest, which has lasted for months, has seriously disrupted the electoral process,\u201d it said. China Central Television\u2019s (CCTV) anchorwoman Liu Xin wrote in a commentary on the state broadcaster\u2019s website that the election had not been a fair game, and that pro-establishment candidates and their supporters had faced widespread harassment and intimidation. China has set up a crisis command centre in a villa just across the border with the mainland, and is considering replacing its official liaison for Hong Kong, the report said. The operation run out of \u201cBauhinia villa\u201d bypasses the formal structures for managing ties between the semi-autonomous city and Beijing. China has also summoned the US ambassador to protest against the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act just passed by the US Congress, accusing Washington of meddling in China\u2019s domestic affairs. China\u2019s vice-foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, told the ambassador that passing the bill amounted to encouraging violence, and the US should \u201ccorrect its errors and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China\u2019s internal matters\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Indian massacres have returned to Bolivia. There is a history \u2014 a blood feud, to be precise \u2014 behind this tragedy. The self-declared \u201cpresidency\u201d of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez has revived the old oligarchy\u2019s race hatred and the barbaric practice of Indian killing, the collective punishment of the nation\u2019s Indigenous majority for daring to defy a centuries-old racial order of apartheid and oppression. Since the ousting of Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous president Evo Morales, security forces have carried out at least two massacres of Indigenous people protesting the military coup.</p> <p>Only two weeks since seizing state power, the evidence is clear: this is a rightwing, military dictatorship. The telltale sign for a country like Bolivia is the outright Indian killing.</p> <p>On November 15, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Cochabamba, killing eight and wounding dozens more. On November 16, a day after the Cochabamba massacre, \u00c1\u00f1ez issued <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alferdez/status/1195841043066953729?s=21\">a decree</a> exempting the police and military from criminal responsibility in operations for \u201cthe restoration of order and public stability.\u201d A carte blanche to kill at will, security forces have obliged the directive with increasing cruelty.</p> <p>Last Tuesday, teargas and bullets rained down on a blockade at the Senkata gas plant in El Alto. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/bolivia-el-alto-violence-death-protest\">Eight were killed, </a>and dozens injured. And this was just the first week of \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>Two days later in La Paz, from behind armored vehicles, security forces showered a funeral procession with teargas and rubber bullets. The coffins of victims from the Senkata massacre fell to the ground as people scattered in panic, adding further humiliation to already grief-stricken families and communities.</p> <p>The official death toll since the protests began is estimated to be<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/20/781219670/at-least-6-killed-as-political-turmoil-continues-in-bolivia\"> more than 30</a>, with dozens missing, more than 700 injured, and nearly a thousand arrests. Bolivia\u2019s Indigenous majority are the primary targets of this racist, state-sanctioned violence.</p> <p>The last time there was Indian killing of this magnitude by the state, Bolivia\u2019s current opposition leader, Carlos Mesa, was vice president. In 2003, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bolivia-trial/u-s-jury-finds-ex-bolivia-leader-responsible-for-civilian-deaths-idUSKCN1HA2W4\">more than 60 Indigenous Aymara people were killed during the \u201cGas War.\u201d</a> President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada\u2019s plan to sell oil and gas exports through a consortium of multinational corporations to the United States \u2014 continuing a centuries-long tradition of pillaging the nation\u2019s resources for outside interests \u2014 led to a popular uprising demanding the nationalization Bolivia\u2019s hydrocarbons, forcing the president\u2019s resignation.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept killing as a response to popular pressure,\u201d Mesa <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2pJJATj\">said in 2003</a> after the massacres. But he appears to have had a change of heart.</p> <p>After losing to Evo Morales during the October 20 presidential elections this year, Mesa was the first to recognize \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s coup presidency, while remaining silent about her authoritarian actions, her alignment with Christian far-right such as the millionaire <a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/11/11/bolivia-coup-fascist-foreign-support-fernando-camacho/\">Luis Fernando Camacho</a>, and the massacres of Indigenous people taking part in popular protesters. Others find lessons in the rightwing-orchestrated chaos and liberal acquiescence.</p> <p>\u201cBehind every moderate liberal, you find a fascist,\u201d Bolivia\u2019s ousted vice president \u00c1lvaro Garcia Linera remarked about Mesa and his ilk <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/alvaro-garcia-linera-bolivia-coup-evo-morales-mas\">in a recent interview</a>.</p> <p>There are also echoes from Bolivia\u2019s past dictatorships, showing \u00c1\u00f1ez derives her authority not from popular power but at the end of a rifle barrel. In contrast to the Indigenous president she deposed, she wasn\u2019t elected, and there was no civilian coronation for her presidency. The Plurinational Legislative Assembly, which normally appoints the president, like they did with Evo Morales thrice before, was nearly absent. Instead, a military general placed the presidential sash on \u00c1\u00f1ez.</p> <p>The last time a general placed a sash on a president after a military coup was in 1980. That year, General Luis Garc\u00eda Meza achieved a military dictatorship by assassinating the socialist leader Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz and massacring dozens of Indigenous miners.</p> <p>The desire to overthrow Evo Morales and the Indigenous social movements that brought him to power has existed for years. The first coup attempt happened in 2008, when the Media Luna, which is composed of the four opposition-dominated regions in the East where most of the European-descended population is concentrated, tried to secede from the country. The racist separatist movement emerged amidst the drafting of a new constitution, which recognized Bolivia as a Plurinational state with the equal status of Indigenous peoples and control over natural resources. The region erupted into open rebellion, attempting to divide the country into two states: a wealthy one dominated by descendants of Europeans home to a large oil and gas industry and agribusiness and one with a poor Indigenous majority. The rightwing protests against resource nationalism and ending apartheid took 20 Indigenous lives.</p> <p>The United States\u2019 role in fomenting the racial divisions is <a href=\"https://nacla.org/news/usaids-silent-invasion-bolivia\">without question</a>.</p> <p>The most recent wave of anti-Indian violence is made to look like self-defense. The interior minister Arturo Murillo, appointed by \u00c1\u00f1ez, wants to prosecute and imprison Evo Morales for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/bolivia-evo-morales-vow-jail-rest-life-arturo-murillo\">terrorism and sedition</a> for allegedly ordering the blockading of Bolivian cities. But testimony from survivors of the Senkata massacre tells a different story. During an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights hearing held on Sunday in La Paz, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/camilatelesur/status/1198723178564083712?s=21\">the sister</a> of one of the men killed by security forces said it is Jeanine A\u00f1ez, Carlos Mesa, Luis Fernando Camacho, and Arturo Murillo who belong in prison. Her brother was gunned down while walking to work, she testified.</p> <p>Justice for the dead and wounded is still an open question.</p> <p>Although the legislative body approved <a href=\"http://www.diputados.bo/prensa/noticias/c%C3%A1mara-de-diputados-sanciona-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-r%C3%A9gimen-excepcional-y-transitorio?fbclid=IwAR3pFMmGzID5XE77fqjDx1r6CVbydGM_o_lNKbZFyt-zpvkS8XZIsfRiyEk\">new elections</a>, the decision comes with serious compromises and little promise of diminishing \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s grip on power.

Reining in the $1.2bn prison phone industry For years, prison reform advocates have been trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to fix the $1.2bn prison phone industry, more than 70% of which is controlled by two companies, who often charge inmates and their loved ones exorbitant rates just to hear each other\u2019s voices. Michael Sainato reports. Opinion Ilana Cohen and Camilla Ledezma were among the hundreds of student climate protesters who invaded the pitch at this year\u2019s Harvard-Yale football game. By continuing to invest in the fossil fuel industry, they argue, America\u2019s elite universities are complicit in the climate crisis. Our universities are not immune to narratives of climate disaster and injustice. Yet so long as they continue to invest in an extractivist industry, they undermine the voices of these lived narratives within their walls. Sport The World Anti-Doping Agency is set to recommend that Russian athletes receive a four-year ban from global sporting events including the Tokyo Olympics, after investigators found positive drugs tests had been deleted from a database at a Moscow lab. A new documentary charts Andy Murray\u2019s recovery from a hip injury that he thought might end his tennis career.

Protesters went head to head with a local authority during a five-day hearing to stop demonstrations outside Anderton Park school. The school, in the Sparkhill area of the city, has become the focus of a long campaign to halt LGBT equality messages being taught in the classroom.

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday 28 April 2010, 20 months had passed since the financial crash of 2008, and there were eight days left until the UK general election. Soon, the reins of government would be taken by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, committed to a programme of austerity that would still be making its effects felt a decade later. But for another fortnight, Gordon Brown would be prime minister, and he was on a walkabout in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. It was there that he was introduced to 65-year-old Gillian Duffy.</p> <p>Surrounded by men in suits, and accompanied by the snap of cameras, Duffy ran through a mess of grievances \u2013 about the tax she had to pay on her pension, the state of the national finances, and a benefits system she claimed paid out to people who \u201caren\u2019t vulnerable\u201d while denying help to those who needed it. She reached a climax <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript\" title=\"\">with a single broken sentence about immigration</a>: \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything about the immigrants\u2026 but all these easterns European what are coming in, where are they flocking from?\u201d Still wearing a radio microphone pinned to his lapel by Sky News, Brown then got back in his car, and let rip. \u201cShe\u2019s just this sort of bigoted woman who said she used to be a Labour voter,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The media bowed to the inevitable and called the episode \u201cBigotgate\u201d. And over the next five or six years, Duffy became a minor political celebrity. Thanks to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight and a piece she wrote for the Daily Mirror, we know that she enthusiastically voted Leave in the 2016 referendum \u2013 partly, she said, because, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9pjyMH6so\" title=\"\">\u201cI love being English, and I don\u2019t want to be a European.\u201d</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a leftwing version of populism. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her small place in political history should be assured, because her encounter with Brown represented the first stirrings \u2013 in Britain, anyway \u2013 of changes wrought by people and places far from the usual centres of power. Duffy remained loyal to the Labour party, which was soon tying itself in knots about how to appeal to such voters, eventually offering its members mugs emblazoned with the words \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d. But here and elsewhere, lots of other people embraced parties that \u2013 and I\u2019m being generous here \u2013 viewed their small \u201cc\u201d conservative, nationalistic instincts and hostility to political establishment as a giant political opportunity.</p> <p>Thanks to a term that dates back to the 19th century, we know it as populism: to quote from the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201ca political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups\u201d. There is a leftwing version of populism, seen lately in the way Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is campaigning in the general election, against an \u201cestablishment elite\u201d and \u201crigged system\u201d. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b18225cb6619f5df9e4dcf6bc17fa95eeac44a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b18225cb6619f5df9e4dcf6bc17fa95eeac44a2/0_18_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage campaigning to leave the EU in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage campaigning to leave the EU in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Berry/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ukip got only 3.1% of the national vote in 2010, but by the end of 2016, Nigel Farage had played a key role in the leave side\u2019s referendum victory. Europe has been shaken by such hard-right populist parties as Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), the Sweden Democrats, the revived French National Front (these days known as National Rally), and Italy\u2019s Northern League. At the same time, the world has seen the rise of a new breed of populist \u201cstrongmen\u201d, defined by their hostility to the conventions of democracy and gleeful embrace of prejudice and bigotry. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n began his second stint as prime minister in 2010. Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan became president in 2014; India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, took power in the same year. Five years later came the election victory of perhaps the most reckless populist of them all: Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/01/jair-bolsonaro-inauguration-brazil-president\" title=\"\">who replied to a congratulatory tweet from Donald Trump</a> thus: \u201cTogether, under God\u2019s protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to the big orange baby in the White House. Back in 2011, as the Labour party licked its wounds and Farage began to push his way into the political mainstream, Trump was slowly edging towards the US presidency, a prize on which he had fixed his eyes in the past. In 2011, a poll in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/another-poll-confirms-trump-republican-frontrunner/349693/\" title=\"\">the Wall Street Journal</a> put him in front of all the Republican contenders. Not long after, he jumped on a conspiracy theory that dated back to 2008, questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US, and demanding to see the president\u2019s birth certificate. This mischief laid the path to 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy with a characteristically rambling speech delivered in Trump Tower, in New York.</p> <p>\u201cOur country is in serious trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us\u2026 When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u2026 I\u2019ve watched the politicians\u2026. They\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests\u2026 the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d</p> <p>Here was every key facet of populism, in full, shameless effect: racism, the rejection of free trade and globalisation, and a self-serving loathing of supposed elites, made all the more ludicrous by the fact that it was voiced by a billionaire. What Trump said may have regularly tumbled into incoherence and contradiction, but it was also built around a winning slogan stolen from Ronald Reagan, which Trump registered as a trademark in November 2012: \u201cMake America great again\u201d.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday 28 April 2010, 20 months had passed since the financial crash of 2008, and there were eight days left until the UK general election. Soon, the reins of government would be taken by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, committed to a programme of austerity that would still be making its effects felt a decade later. But for another fortnight, Gordon Brown would be prime minister, and he was on a walkabout in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. It was there that he was introduced to 65-year-old Gillian Duffy. Surrounded by men in suits, and accompanied by the snap of cameras, Duffy ran through a mess of grievances \u2013 about the tax she had to pay on her pension, the state of the national finances, and a benefits system she claimed paid out to people who \u201caren\u2019t vulnerable\u201d while denying help to those who needed it. She reached a climax with a single broken sentence about immigration: \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything about the immigrants\u2026 but all these easterns European what are coming in, where are they flocking from?\u201d Still wearing a radio microphone pinned to his lapel by Sky News, Brown then got back in his car, and let rip. \u201cShe\u2019s just this sort of bigoted woman who said she used to be a Labour voter,\u201d he said. The media bowed to the inevitable and called the episode \u201cBigotgate\u201d. And over the next five or six years, Duffy became a minor political celebrity. Thanks to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight and a piece she wrote for the Daily Mirror, we know that she enthusiastically voted Leave in the 2016 referendum \u2013 partly, she said, because, \u201cI love being English, and I don\u2019t want to be a European.\u201d Her small place in political history should be assured, because her encounter with Brown represented the first stirrings \u2013 in Britain, anyway \u2013 of changes wrought by people and places far from the usual centres of power. Duffy remained loyal to the Labour party, which was soon tying itself in knots about how to appeal to such voters, eventually offering its members mugs emblazoned with the words \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d. But here and elsewhere, lots of other people embraced parties that \u2013 and I\u2019m being generous here \u2013 viewed their small \u201cc\u201d conservative, nationalistic instincts and hostility to political establishment as a giant political opportunity. Thanks to a term that dates back to the 19th century, we know it as populism: to quote from the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201ca political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups\u201d. There is a leftwing version of populism, seen lately in the way Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is campaigning in the general election, against an \u201cestablishment elite\u201d and \u201crigged system\u201d. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world. Ukip got only 3.1% of the national vote in 2010, but by the end of 2016, Nigel Farage had played a key role in the leave side\u2019s referendum victory. Europe has been shaken by such hard-right populist parties as Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), the Sweden Democrats, the revived French National Front (these days known as National Rally), and Italy\u2019s Northern League. At the same time, the world has seen the rise of a new breed of populist \u201cstrongmen\u201d, defined by their hostility to the conventions of democracy and gleeful embrace of prejudice and bigotry. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n began his second stint as prime minister in 2010. Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan became president in 2014; India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, took power in the same year. Five years later came the election victory of perhaps the most reckless populist of them all: Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, who replied to a congratulatory tweet from Donald Trump thus: \u201cTogether, under God\u2019s protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\u201d Which brings us to the big orange baby in the White House. Back in 2011, as the Labour party licked its wounds and Farage began to push his way into the political mainstream, Trump was slowly edging towards the US presidency, a prize on which he had fixed his eyes in the past. In 2011, a poll in the Wall Street Journal put him in front of all the Republican contenders. Not long after, he jumped on a conspiracy theory that dated back to 2008, questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US, and demanding to see the president\u2019s birth certificate. This mischief laid the path to 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy with a characteristically rambling speech delivered in Trump Tower, in New York. \u201cOur country is in serious trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us\u2026 When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u2026 I\u2019ve watched the politicians\u2026. They\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests\u2026 the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d Here was every key facet of populism, in full, shameless effect: racism, the rejection of free trade and globalisation, and a self-serving loathing of supposed elites, made all the more ludicrous by the fact that it was voiced by a billionaire. What Trump said may have regularly tumbled into incoherence and contradiction, but it was also built around a winning slogan stolen from Ronald Reagan, which Trump registered as a trademark in November 2012: \u201cMake America great again\u201d. And if he was gauche and inarticulate, maybe that was the point: here was someone so far from the usual polished politicians that his speeches didn\u2019t even have a clear beginning, middle and end. In 2016, I watched Trump do his thing at a rally in Evansville, Indiana, a faded place with a dilapidated downtown, where a refrigerator factory that had once employed 10,000 people had closed six years before, something locals blamed on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the way it had incentivised moving jobs to Mexico. He rambled on about the economic threat from China, the need to bring jobs back to America, and his fabled border wall. The 12,000-strong crowd roared their approval. I recognised many of them as kindred spirits of voters I\u2019d spoken to in Britain: older, anxious, often angry white people, wondering what had happened to the world they knew, and where on earth everything was going next. *** Why now? Obviously, it is no accident that populism began its rebirth only a couple of years after the 2008 crash, and the spectacle of reckless financiers taking the global economy to the brink of disaster but suffering almost no comeback. To compound people\u2019s sense of injustice, the long slump that followed has seen wages stagnate, and changes to the world of work that have made more and more jobs insecure, and poorly paid. These developments exacerbated resentments that went back years, into the deindustralisation and automation that had been eating away at people and places\u2019 collective esteem for decades.

      "body": "<p>The chief rabbi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\">Ephraim Mirvis, has said Jews are justifiably anxious</a> about the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d has taken root in Labour.</p> <h2>Is the chief rabbi urging voters not to opt for Labour?</h2> <p>No, he was not that explicit. But writing in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ephraim-mirvis-what-will-become-of-jews-in-britain-if-labour-forms-the-next-government-ghpsdbljk\">the Times</a>, he asked people to \u201cvote with their conscience\u201d. He said supporters of Corbyn had \u201chounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism\u201d, and that 130 cases of antisemitism were outstanding against Labour members.</p> <h2>Are there 130 cases of antisemitism outstanding in the party?</h2> <p>Labour insists the figure of 130 is inaccurate and says it is \u201ctaking robust action\u201d to tackle antisemitism, including quick suspensions, a process for rapid expulsions and an education programme. However, it has not yet provided its own up-to-date figure. The estimate of 130 come from the Jewish Labour Movement, which has been tracking complaints and their resolution.</p> <h2>What has the reaction in Labour been?</h2> <p>Corbyn denied the rabbi\u2019s claims, saying the party stood against antisemitism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn-rabbi-criticism-labour\">which was \u201cvile and wrong\u201d</a>, and all forms of racism. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said \u201ceverybody now accepts that we took too long to deal with\u201d antisemitism and that regaining trust was difficult, but said Mirvis was wrong to say that anti-semitism had taken root in the party. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said she had not found Jewish people \u201canxious and frightened\u201d.</p> <p>Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who was among Jewish children saved from the Nazis, told Radio 4 he felt Mirvis had \u201cgone too far\u201d, while acknowledging Labour had been \u201cmuch too slow in getting to grips with this\u201d.</p> <p>Others in the party have been more critical. Charlie Falconer, the former shadow justice secretary, said it was a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d that cases had not been investigated properly and argued Labour \u201cdeserved an attack that strong\u201d.</p> <p>The Labour backbencher Jess Phillips, seeking re-election in Birmingham Yardley, said the response to the chief rabbi should be: \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I\u2019ll do whatever I possibly can to win back your community\u2019s trust.\u201d Wes Streeting, another backbencher seeking re-election in Ilford North, said he was \u201cashamed\u201d of Labour and \u201cmore sorry than words can say\u201d.</p> <h2>Has Labour seen departures over the issue of antisemitism?</h2> <p>Yes. The Jewish Labour MPs Louise Ellman and Luciana Berger both left the party, citing antisemitic abuse and bullying, while others who quit cited solidarity with their Jewish colleagues as a factor in their decision. That group included Joan Ryan, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Ann Coffey, Chris Leslie and Ian Austin. Three Labour peers \u2013 Ara Darzi, Leslie Turnberg and David Triesman \u2013 also quit over the issue. In October, the Jewish Labour Movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/jewish-group-removes-campaigning-support-for-labour-in-election\">withdrew campaigning support</a> for the party in the general election in protest. The group said it would support only \u201cexceptional candidates\u201d, such as its parliamentary chair, Ruth Smeeth.</p> <h2>What is the background to the row?</h2> <p>Hundreds of complaints about alleged antisemitic comments by Labour members have been submitted over the last few years to the central party, which has struggled to cope with the volume. For example, 635 complaints were made in the first six months of 2019, which resulted in eight expulsions from the party during that time period.</p> <p>Many of the allegations against Labour members involve sharing social media posts that contain antisemitic tropes, such as suggesting Jews are wealthy or control the government or media. Critics of Corbyn also say that criticism of Israel among some of his supporters, for example about the treatment of the Palestinian people, can too readily tip over into a generalised condemnation that becomes antisemitic.</p> <p>The party has been accused of dealing too lightly with people accused of serious antisemitism and failing to resolve complaints quickly enough.

      "bodyText": "The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has said Jews are justifiably anxious about the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d has taken root in Labour. Is the chief rabbi urging voters not to opt for Labour? No, he was not that explicit. But writing in the Times, he asked people to \u201cvote with their conscience\u201d. He said supporters of Corbyn had \u201chounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism\u201d, and that 130 cases of antisemitism were outstanding against Labour members. Are there 130 cases of antisemitism outstanding in the party? Labour insists the figure of 130 is inaccurate and says it is \u201ctaking robust action\u201d to tackle antisemitism, including quick suspensions, a process for rapid expulsions and an education programme. However, it has not yet provided its own up-to-date figure. The estimate of 130 come from the Jewish Labour Movement, which has been tracking complaints and their resolution. What has the reaction in Labour been? Corbyn denied the rabbi\u2019s claims, saying the party stood against antisemitism, which was \u201cvile and wrong\u201d, and all forms of racism. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said \u201ceverybody now accepts that we took too long to deal with\u201d antisemitism and that regaining trust was difficult, but said Mirvis was wrong to say that anti-semitism had taken root in the party. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said she had not found Jewish people \u201canxious and frightened\u201d. Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who was among Jewish children saved from the Nazis, told Radio 4 he felt Mirvis had \u201cgone too far\u201d, while acknowledging Labour had been \u201cmuch too slow in getting to grips with this\u201d. Others in the party have been more critical. Charlie Falconer, the former shadow justice secretary, said it was a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d that cases had not been investigated properly and argued Labour \u201cdeserved an attack that strong\u201d. The Labour backbencher Jess Phillips, seeking re-election in Birmingham Yardley, said the response to the chief rabbi should be: \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I\u2019ll do whatever I possibly can to win back your community\u2019s trust.\u201d Wes Streeting, another backbencher seeking re-election in Ilford North, said he was \u201cashamed\u201d of Labour and \u201cmore sorry than words can say\u201d. Has Labour seen departures over the issue of antisemitism? Yes. The Jewish Labour MPs Louise Ellman and Luciana Berger both left the party, citing antisemitic abuse and bullying, while others who quit cited solidarity with their Jewish colleagues as a factor in their decision. That group included Joan Ryan, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Ann Coffey, Chris Leslie and Ian Austin. Three Labour peers \u2013 Ara Darzi, Leslie Turnberg and David Triesman \u2013 also quit over the issue. In October, the Jewish Labour Movement withdrew campaigning support for the party in the general election in protest. The group said it would support only \u201cexceptional candidates\u201d, such as its parliamentary chair, Ruth Smeeth. What is the background to the row? Hundreds of complaints about alleged antisemitic comments by Labour members have been submitted over the last few years to the central party, which has struggled to cope with the volume. For example, 635 complaints were made in the first six months of 2019, which resulted in eight expulsions from the party during that time period. Many of the allegations against Labour members involve sharing social media posts that contain antisemitic tropes, such as suggesting Jews are wealthy or control the government or media. Critics of Corbyn also say that criticism of Israel among some of his supporters, for example about the treatment of the Palestinian people, can too readily tip over into a generalised condemnation that becomes antisemitic. The party has been accused of dealing too lightly with people accused of serious antisemitism and failing to resolve complaints quickly enough. Labour\u2019s troubled complaints unit was the subject of a BBC Panorama documentary in July, in which former staff members said they were driven to despair by the process and alleging interference by the leader\u2019s office, which was strongly denied. Labour later submitted a complaint of bias to the BBC about the programme. Labour says its complaints process has been overhauled under Corbyn and vastly improved. It also says that complaints connected to antisemitism amount to 0.1% of party membership and it argues that prejudice in the Conservative party is more widespread. Is there an investigation taking place? Yes. Aside from internal Labour investigations, in May the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it had placed Labour under formal investigation over whether the party had unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they were Jewish. Has Corbyn himself been criticised over antisemitism? Yes, particularly his record when he was a backbencher. For example, Corbyn has said he regrets calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah \u201cfriends\u201d at a meeting in parliament in 2009. Last year, he accepted he had made a mistake by supporting a graffiti artist after his work, featuring several known antisemitic tropes, was removed from a wall in east London after complaints. Last year, the UK\u2019s three most prominent Jewish newspapers published a joint editorial saying a government led by Corbyn would pose an existential threat to Jewish life in the UK. How has Labour dealt with candidates accused of antisemitism? Some prospective candidates have been accused of antisemitism during the campaign. Gideon Bull stepped down in Clacton after denying he used the term \u201cShylock\u201d in front of a Jewish councillor, while Kate Ramsden, who had been standing for Gordon, in Aberdeenshire, withdrew after it emerged she was being re-interviewed by Labour over posts comparing Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. However, other candidates criticised for antisemitism have remained in place, including Apsana Begum, who shared a post referring to \u201cZionist masters\u201d. She later distanced herself from the post saying she did not share those views. Two Conservative candidates \u2013 Ryan Houghton and Amjad Bashir - have also been suspended from the Tory party over allegations of antisemitism but remain on the ballot. What was the row over the definition of antisemitism? Labour faced criticism from some Jewish groups after it adopted a working definition of antisemitism by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, but left out one of the 11 examples given in the definition, which said it would be antisemitic to claim \u201cthat Israel\u2019s existence as a state is a racist endeavour\u201d. Labour later adopted all 11 examples.",

The Labour manifesto is the product of a complex, months-long democratic process involving half a million grassroots members. The Tory manifesto comes from the <a href=\"https://www.thearticle.com/meet-the-ex-communist-trying-to-save-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">pen of a fracking lobbyist</a>.</p> <p>While the Labour manifesto technically has one author \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s head of policy Andrew Fisher \u2013 the document he produces is just one part of a lengthy collaborative process. Each shadow cabinet member, along with their team, has been developing policy according to their particular brief since being appointed. Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, is a key example. While forcing the government to release critical Brexit documents and providing essential scrutiny in parliament, the barrister is also widely credited with slowly but surely shifting the Labour position from an unambiguously pro-Brexit stance to one firmly in support of a fresh EU referendum. That push has required detailed policy work. Other frontbenchers, namely Jon Ashworth and Angela Rayner, have dug deep into their own lived experiences to bring out policy solutions close to their hearts, respectively: expanded addiction support services and <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/11/corbyn-and-rayner-vow-to-open-a-sure-start-centre-in-every-community/\" title=\"\">Sure Start centres in every community</a>.</p> <p>Labour campaign groups made up of ordinary members have also been formulating their own ideas, and most have enjoyed a high level of access to shadow secretaries of state \u2013 especially in the run-up to party conference. It is at this annual summit, held in September, that many of the battles were fought: on Brexit, where \u201cfull remain\u201d was avoided but another referendum with remain as an option was agreed; on immigration, which saw delegates overwhelmingly endorse a sweeping set of demands, some of which were strongly opposed by key leadership figures; on the climate crisis, which culminated in a protracted fight in which two sides claimed victory. Remarkable compromises have been made since then \u2013 but, crucially, they have been made by everybody involved.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Such a collaborative process, involving so many voices from across the party, is bound to throw up some arguments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If conference delegates \u2013 who are elected by local parties, socialist societies and affiliated trade unions \u2013 approve a policy motion by a large majority, it goes into the party programme. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/11/labours-clause-v-meeting-what-is-it-and-what-will-it-decide\" title=\"\">clause V</a>\u201d meeting then picks items from the programme for the final document. This is the final stop on the manifesto-making journey. You might assume that it would be a small gathering of key players \u2013 but you\u2019d be wrong. The weekend before last Thursday\u2019s manifesto launch, about 80 people joined to discuss the transformative agenda. Representatives assembled from the frontbench, the parliamentary party, the ruling body, the national policy forum, affiliated trade unions, plus the Scottish and Welsh Labour leaders, and more. They gather in the party\u2019s Southside HQ in London, where electronic devices are handed in and two hours of \u201creading time\u201d begins. They then go through each section of the manifesto, with the relevant shadow cabinet member fielding questions and suggestions. As one attendee remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle it only took six hours.\u201d</p> <p>Such a detailed and collaborative process, involving so many voices from across the party, is bound to throw up some arguments. Going into the clause V meeting this year, there were two big contentious issues.</p> <p>The first, continued freedom of movement after Brexit, has not been guaranteed as requested by conference; instead, it will be \u201csubject to negotiations\u201d. But Labour\u2019s wider offer on immigration has changed in meaningful ways since 2017. The new manifesto says the \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d policy, which prevents certain migrants from accessing benefits from their local council, should be scrapped. It promises to \u201creview the alternatives to the inhumane conditions of detention centres\u201d, though falls short of closing all detention centres. The biggest change may be the one advocating universal suffrage: a key demand in the conference motion, Labour is now in favour of extending full voting rights to all UK residents. That includes EU and non-EU migrants. The <a href=\"https://www.labourfreemovement.org/\" title=\"\">Labour Campaign for Free Movement</a> has reason to be disappointed, as its name suggests, but the activists have been hugely successful in important areas for migrants. Nondiscriminatory national voting rights are rare, and represent an outstanding victory.</p> <p>The second contentious issue was the extent of Labour\u2019s ambitions in the timing of its mission to decarbonise the British economy. Grassroots group <a href=\"https://www.labourgnd.uk/\" title=\"\">Labour for a Green New Deal</a> (GND) had joined forces <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/09/the-fbu-for-a-socialist-green-new-deal/\" title=\"\">with the Fire Brigades Union</a> to push for a bold 2030 decarbonisation target at conference. They were backed by Momentum and the Communication Workers Union. The GND activists wanted the deadline to be for \u201czero carbon emissions\u201d, to emphasise that the UK should not rely on risky offsetting methods, but they compromised on \u201cnet zero\u201d in September. The activist group couldn\u2019t accept anything other than a 2030 date, however, which resulted in two separate motions \u2013 one without the date, that was supported by party-affiliated union GMB. Both were approved, and neither took precedence.</p> <p>Clause V negotiations gave more weight to the concerns of those sceptical about the \u201cjust transition\u201d, which claims energy workers will not bear the brunt of decarbonisation. That\u2019s why the manifesto vows to \u201cput the UK on track for a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s \u2013 and go faster if credible pathways can be found\u201d, rather than achieve net-zero by 2030. Again, climate activists did not get everything they campaigned for, but they applied pressure that helped produce a heavily climate-focused programme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/labour-manifesto-blueprint-for-the-future-will-hutton-mariana-mazzucato\">Labour\u2019s manifesto: economic experts' verdict on its radical vision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour\u2019s manifesto-making process may be messy.

But that\u2019s just the start of it.</p> \n<p>The ultimate goal of <a href=\"https://edwinsrestaurant.org/\">Edwins Leadership &amp; Restaurant Institute</a> is to heal the wound in the bleeding heart of America.

The culinary school takes in 40 or more former inmates, about 80% of whom are African American and 15% female. Some are fresh out of prison, most have been scarred by decades of addiction, poverty and neglect. None have ever enjoyed what Edwins offers them: a second chance.</p> \n<p>Over the next six months they are put through gruelling training in professional cooking and front-of-house hospitality.

Every year almost 23,000 prisoners are released from custody in Ohio, yet within three years almost a third of them will be back inside. Nationally, the picture is much worse. Of the more than 650,000 offenders released every year, 68% are rearrested by the end of year three.</p> \n<p>Compare that with the record at Edwins. Of 350 students to complete the leadership course to date only two have landed back in prison.</p> \n<p>Edwins is one of 25 inspirational people and organizations that the Guardian is highlighting as part of a week-long City Champions project in Cleveland. The project is designed to showcase the upsides in a city like Cleveland where grassroots activists faced with endemic problems \u2013 like lead poisoning, infant mortality and gun violence \u2013 and little or no state support, are taking the initiative and helping to change lives in some of the city\u2019s most marginalised communities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"79702742-1f04-4cdf-82aa-fb3908ce9960\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many cities across the US face significant challenges \u2013 places like Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cleveland\">Cleveland</a> are among them.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 9am and there\u2019s a hush in the kitchen of Edwins restaurant on the east side of Cleveland. Apples are stewing gently on the stove, filling the room with unctuous aromatic promises. Suddenly, the back door bursts open and a tall man with a shock of white hair rushes in dressed in jogging gear. The calm is shattered as Edwins transforms into a vortex of energy that barely ceases until closing time 13 hours later. Brandon Chrostowski has a mission: to create one of the great French cooking and hospitality schools, in a largely African American neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. But that\u2019s just the start of it. The ultimate goal of Edwins Leadership &amp; Restaurant Institute is to heal the wound in the bleeding heart of America. The injury that condemns 2.3 million men and women to life behind bars, 49,000 in Ohio alone, then brands them as felons and condemns them a second time to failure and recidivism when they are released back into society. \u201cHow do you change the face of re-entry?\u201d Chrostowski says, stirring Pommeau de Normandie into the apple sauce. \u201cHow do you change the views of men and women coming out of prison so that they gain confidence? You have to show them the impossible.\u201d Every two months Edwins does just that: the impossible. The culinary school takes in 40 or more former inmates, about 80% of whom are African American and 15% female. Some are fresh out of prison, most have been scarred by decades of addiction, poverty and neglect. None have ever enjoyed what Edwins offers them: a second chance. Over the next six months they are put through gruelling training in professional cooking and front-of-house hospitality. By the time they graduate they are fully equipped to become the next generation of Cleveland\u2019s culinary leaders. Edwins turns out first-rate chefs and, as importantly, has a magnificent record in breaking the cycle of re-offending. Every year almost 23,000 prisoners are released from custody in Ohio, yet within three years almost a third of them will be back inside. Nationally, the picture is much worse. Of the more than 650,000 offenders released every year, 68% are rearrested by the end of year three. Compare that with the record at Edwins. Of 350 students to complete the leadership course to date only two have landed back in prison. Edwins is one of 25 inspirational people and organizations that the Guardian is highlighting as part of a week-long City Champions project in Cleveland. The project is designed to showcase the upsides in a city like Cleveland where grassroots activists faced with endemic problems \u2013 like lead poisoning, infant mortality and gun violence \u2013 and little or no state support, are taking the initiative and helping to change lives in some of the city\u2019s most marginalised communities. \u2018The idea behind Edwins is the story of my own life\u2019 \u201cThe toughest part is building esteem in someone who has had it ripped out of them,\u201d Chrostowski says. \u201cThat starts right at the beginning when you tell them, \u2018You are in the program, you are accepted\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s 10am and we\u2019re on the move. As we sprint out of the kitchen to his car, it becomes clear why the need for jogging gear: Brandon Chrostowski doesn\u2019t do walking. We drive at breakneck speed to the Edwins campus, a collection of brick buildings in a previously derelict part of Buckeye that he chose because it represents the collision point between Cleveland\u2019s poor and wealthy neighborhoods. \u201cIf you go a day without heavy gunshots around Buckeye there\u2019s something wrong, but four blocks away, that\u2019s where the millionaires live,\u201d he says. The campus includes very low-cost accommodation for Edwins students and graduates, and facilities to support their successful re-entry, such as a gym and an entire room full of suits and dresses donated by supporters. In the same complex, there\u2019s a butcher\u2019s shop that\u2019s already open for business, soon to be joined by a 20-table diner, coffee shop and bakery that are still covered in dust in mid-construction. Time and money are tight: the bakery must open in six weeks, Chrostowski explains, and he\u2019s still short of $30,000 out of the total budget of $600,000 to build and launch it. The money is being raised in large part through donations from Edwins diners under the motto: \u201cEat well, do good.\u201d Chrostowski picks up a paint brush and starts painting the bakery walls with his own hands. A master multitasker, as he paints with one hand he uses the other to order on an old Blackberry a batch of wood panelling, dozens of nails and several pounds of pork belly for week-long marinading. Amid the whirlwind of activity that surrounds him, there is an ethical core of steel to Chrostowski that holds him and everyone else together. It stems from his own experiences growing up as a bright but somewhat lost teenager in Detroit. \u201cThe idea behind Edwins is the story of my life,\u201d he says, using a roller to apply a top coat of cobalt blue paint to the bakery walls. \u201cI was 17, just a kid with a lot of energy and not much direction, going wherever the impulse led me.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve survived, I\u2019m alive, I\u2019ve got out of a really shitty place\u2019 The impulse led him into trouble. He was convicted of resisting arrest and faced 10 years in prison, at which point he would have become just one more statistic in the gruesome graveyard of US mass incarceration. But a far-sighted judge saw the potential in him \u2013 Chrostowski is convinced the whiteness of his skin was a major factor \u2013 and he was spared a custodial sentence in favor of probation. Soon after that he had his second big break: he acquired a mentor, a chef named George Kalergis, who inducted him into the culinary arts. \u201cIt was a one-two punch: I was forgiven, then I was mentored and introduced to a high-level skill. I never looked back.\u201d Forgiveness then inspiration \u2013 the combination put him on a path to a top-flight career in prestigious restaurants in Chicago, New York and Paris. Despite the rewards, a niggling voice kept telling him that his own success was not enough: he had to give the same second chance to others. \u201cI\u2019ve survived, I\u2019m alive, I\u2019ve got out of a really shitty place.

He splashes cognac into the pan then ignites to produce a dramatic golden fireball. That\u2019s nothing compared with the drama of his own life. Six months ago Leonard was in Grafton correctional institute. The Guardian asked him whether he was happy to describe his prison time \u2013 something that Edwins never does. The restaurant never requires trainees to divulge any details of their penal history before, during or after the program. Leonard said he was fine to share the information. He served 24 years for murder. As part of his parole terms, he went straight from Grafton into the Edwins program, and in 10 days\u2019 time he will graduate. \u201cI\u2019ve found my worth,\u201d he says. \u201cComing from where I come from, a poor family where as a kid I went hungry at the end of every month, I didn\u2019t know my worth.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe broke the traditions of football in Spain,\u201d Javier Tebas says in a manner so matter-of-fact that it is genuinely startling. But then the president of La Liga has long been unafraid to speak his mind and, as such, it is not overly surprising he is so forthright during a discussion centred on his desire to see his country\u2019s top division become the most popular in the world. The ambition is clear and if that means radical change than so be it.</p> <p>That has perhaps been seen most clearly in La Liga with the scheduling of games. Under Tebas, who took charge of Spain\u2019s top flight in April 2013, every fixture is now staggered to ensure they can be screened live on television, at home and abroad. At one stage this had the effect of stretching each set of La Liga fixtures across four days, from Friday to Monday, with some on Saturday and Sunday kicking off late morning, a significant adjustment in a country where for so long matches took place solely at the weekend and later in the day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/25/barcelona-top-la-liga-not-very-good-messi-neymar\">Flawed, dysfunctional Barcelona are top of La Liga but not very good  | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe always have to think about traditions but we have been working for the past five years to change the schedule so there are no overlapping matches,\u201d says Tebas. \u201cPeople said that would mean less spectators going to the stadium but instead more are \u2013 25% more. Why? Because there were times before that didn\u2019t allow families to watch football in the stadium but now there are many family-friendly times. The schedule is more flexible.\u201d</p> <p>That may be true but the president\u2019s tinkering has also been controversial, specifically in regards to the scheduling of games on Monday evenings. The move proved so unpopular that it led to protests, among them the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47206376\" title=\"\">mock funeral put on by Alav\u00e9s supporters during their home win over Levante in February</a>. Spectators carried a coffin into the Mendizorroza and proceeded to hold up a banner that read \u2018RIP Football\u2019.</p> <p>It required legal intervention from the Spanish Football Federation for Monday evening games to be scrapped before this season and if Luis Rubiales, the federation\u2019s president, had had his way Friday evening games would have gone as well. However, the judge denied that, <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2019/08/09/5d4d66e946163fbbb98b4570.html\" title=\"\">providing Tebas with a victory of sorts</a>. But it was not long before he was again railing against the governing body in regards to scheduling.</p> <p>Last month it was decided the first <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> of the season would move from Saturday 26 October to Wednesday 18 December because of political protests in Catalonia. The change, approved by Barcelona, Real Madrid and the federation, means the game at the Camp Nou will take place at 8pm local time, great for viewers in Spain but less so for those hoping to watch in Asia given a time difference of up to eight hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94443c0f83ca4e3df13ca81ac9f69087b0733185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94443c0f83ca4e3df13ca81ac9f69087b0733185/0_315_5220_3132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Alav\u00e9s stage a mock funeral ahead of the visit of Levante in February in protest at the game being moved to a Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Alav\u00e9s stage a mock funeral ahead of the visit of Levante in February in protest at the game being moved to a Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Ruiz de Hierro/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/barcelona-real-madrid-agree-wednesday-18-september-rescheduled-clasico\" title=\"\">Tebas\u2019s ire and threat of legal action</a>. He dropped that but remains adamant Spain\u2019s outstanding club fixture must be scheduled with an overseas rather than domestic audience in mind. \u201cOf the two <em>cl\u00e1sicos</em> there are in a season, one should always be so people in Asia can watch without being asleep and the other should always be so people in the US can watch without being asleep,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to recognise that the followers of Spanish football are not just people who live in Spain. We must also respect the fans who are in Asia and the Americas \u2013 they are also contributing because they pay for their TV subscriptions, which in turn allows the clubs to pay big stars and helps turns La Liga into a global product.\u201d</p> <p>Tebas\u2019s desire to see La Liga\u2019s international standing grow is undeniable. He speaks of it being a \u201ckey objective\u201d and the 57\u2011year\u2011old is clearly prepared to become unpopular in order to get as many overseas viewers as possible, which is not a shock given that since he became head of La Liga he has regularly and spectacularly clashed with Rubiales \u2013 most recently <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2019/11/11/5dc9ae73e2704e90538b458a.html\" title=\"\">over Tebas\u2019s desire to play a La Liga fixture abroad</a> \u2013 and on more than one occasion demanded Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/21/manchester-city-psg-kicked-out-europe-la-liga-president\" title=\"\">kicked out of European competition</a>. The Costa Rica-born Spaniard is as fearless as he is brash.</p> <p>To Tebas\u2019s credit, he has taken a modern and forward-thinking approach to making La Liga more appealing to a global audience, establishing a partnership with Microsoft that means many decisions made by him and his team are, and have been, based on data collected by the tech giant. This has even included the use of sunlight readings to decide where best to base TV cameras inside stadiums for the clearest and sharpest pictures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a81100d46495997fe51352ee5cd87e828df572f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81100d46495997fe51352ee5cd87e828df572f4/0_240_3680_2208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Tebas says he is \u2018not obsessed\u2019 with the Premier League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javier Tebas says he is \u2018not obsessed\u2019 with the Premier League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ballesteros/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have also been strategies such as allowing people on the Indian subcontinent to watch La Liga content for free on Facebook and streaming live coverage of Segunda Division games on YouTube, with the aim of \u2018boosting the brand\u2019 and increasing revenues. Recent forecasts suggest global TV income for Spain\u2019s top two leagues will <a href=\"https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcasting/laliga-tv-revenues-set-to-pass-2bn/5144299.article\" title=\"\">exceed \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn)</a> at the end of this campaign.</p> <p>That figure is dwarfed by the \u00a39bn that the Premier League is <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/premier-league-to-make-record-9bn-from-tv-deals-dr6fhkk9h\" title=\"\">reportedly set to generate from its current three-year broadcast deal</a> and puts into context the challenge Tebas faces to make Spain\u2019s top flight bigger and more lucrative than England\u2019s. He insists he is \u201cnot obsessed\u201d with the Premier League, partly because such are the changes in the way people are consuming football content that, long term, La Liga may be better placed to dominate international markets.</p> <p>\u201cOur cumulative global audience figure is more than 3.2 billion but what that means is hard to say given the concept of an audience is changing,\u201d says Tebas, speaking to the Guardian at the recent Web Summit in Lisbon. \u201cNow it is also about \u2018users\u2019 and the minutes they are consuming your content. It could be people who are watching La Liga matches but it could also be people who are watching highlights on another device.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe broke the traditions of football in Spain,\u201d Javier Tebas says in a manner so matter-of-fact that it is genuinely startling. But then the president of La Liga has long been unafraid to speak his mind and, as such, it is not overly surprising he is so forthright during a discussion centred on his desire to see his country\u2019s top division become the most popular in the world. The ambition is clear and if that means radical change than so be it. That has perhaps been seen most clearly in La Liga with the scheduling of games. Under Tebas, who took charge of Spain\u2019s top flight in April 2013, every fixture is now staggered to ensure they can be screened live on television, at home and abroad. At one stage this had the effect of stretching each set of La Liga fixtures across four days, from Friday to Monday, with some on Saturday and Sunday kicking off late morning, a significant adjustment in a country where for so long matches took place solely at the weekend and later in the day. \u201cWe always have to think about traditions but we have been working for the past five years to change the schedule so there are no overlapping matches,\u201d says Tebas. \u201cPeople said that would mean less spectators going to the stadium but instead more are \u2013 25% more. Why? Because there were times before that didn\u2019t allow families to watch football in the stadium but now there are many family-friendly times. The schedule is more flexible.\u201d That may be true but the president\u2019s tinkering has also been controversial, specifically in regards to the scheduling of games on Monday evenings. The move proved so unpopular that it led to protests, among them the mock funeral put on by Alav\u00e9s supporters during their home win over Levante in February. Spectators carried a coffin into the Mendizorroza and proceeded to hold up a banner that read \u2018RIP Football\u2019. It required legal intervention from the Spanish Football Federation for Monday evening games to be scrapped before this season and if Luis Rubiales, the federation\u2019s president, had had his way Friday evening games would have gone as well. However, the judge denied that, providing Tebas with a victory of sorts. But it was not long before he was again railing against the governing body in regards to scheduling. Last month it was decided the first cl\u00e1sico of the season would move from Saturday 26 October to Wednesday 18 December because of political protests in Catalonia. The change, approved by Barcelona, Real Madrid and the federation, means the game at the Camp Nou will take place at 8pm local time, great for viewers in Spain but less so for those hoping to watch in Asia given a time difference of up to eight hours. Hence Tebas\u2019s ire and threat of legal action. He dropped that but remains adamant Spain\u2019s outstanding club fixture must be scheduled with an overseas rather than domestic audience in mind. \u201cOf the two cl\u00e1sicos there are in a season, one should always be so people in Asia can watch without being asleep and the other should always be so people in the US can watch without being asleep,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is important to recognise that the followers of Spanish football are not just people who live in Spain. We must also respect the fans who are in Asia and the Americas \u2013 they are also contributing because they pay for their TV subscriptions, which in turn allows the clubs to pay big stars and helps turns La Liga into a global product.\u201d Tebas\u2019s desire to see La Liga\u2019s international standing grow is undeniable. He speaks of it being a \u201ckey objective\u201d and the 57\u2011year\u2011old is clearly prepared to become unpopular in order to get as many overseas viewers as possible, which is not a shock given that since he became head of La Liga he has regularly and spectacularly clashed with Rubiales \u2013 most recently over Tebas\u2019s desire to play a La Liga fixture abroad \u2013 and on more than one occasion demanded Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain be kicked out of European competition. The Costa Rica-born Spaniard is as fearless as he is brash. To Tebas\u2019s credit, he has taken a modern and forward-thinking approach to making La Liga more appealing to a global audience, establishing a partnership with Microsoft that means many decisions made by him and his team are, and have been, based on data collected by the tech giant. This has even included the use of sunlight readings to decide where best to base TV cameras inside stadiums for the clearest and sharpest pictures. There have also been strategies such as allowing people on the Indian subcontinent to watch La Liga content for free on Facebook and streaming live coverage of Segunda Division games on YouTube, with the aim of \u2018boosting the brand\u2019 and increasing revenues. Recent forecasts suggest global TV income for Spain\u2019s top two leagues will exceed \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) at the end of this campaign. That figure is dwarfed by the \u00a39bn that the Premier League is reportedly set to generate from its current three-year broadcast deal and puts into context the challenge Tebas faces to make Spain\u2019s top flight bigger and more lucrative than England\u2019s. He insists he is \u201cnot obsessed\u201d with the Premier League, partly because such are the changes in the way people are consuming football content that, long term, La Liga may be better placed to dominate international markets. \u201cOur cumulative global audience figure is more than 3.2 billion but what that means is hard to say given the concept of an audience is changing,\u201d says Tebas, speaking to the Guardian at the recent Web Summit in Lisbon. \u201cNow it is also about \u2018users\u2019 and the minutes they are consuming your content. It could be people who are watching La Liga matches but it could also be people who are watching highlights on another device. This is a growing trend and why, as well as working to grow our audience, we are working towards having more users. I\u2019m convinced in 10 years nobody will be taking about audience figures \u2013 instead we\u2019ll be taking about users.\u201d That is for the future. For now TV audience figures remain relevant and, in that regard, it is a boost to La Liga\u2019s presence in the UK that a recently-signed deal means games from Spain\u2019s top flight will continue to be broadcast there via Premier Sports until the end of the 2021-22 season, as well as on LaLigaTV, a 24-hour channel scheduled to launch on Sky TV early next year. However, it remains a source of frustration for Tebas that La Liga games which kick off on Saturday afternoons in Spain cannot be broadcast live in the UK because of the longstanding blackout policy. Asked what he thinks about that, the president offers a typically blunt reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake\u201d.",

The average cost of an in-state jail 15-minute phone call in Wisconsin was $7.99 (\u00a36.23), the sixth-highest in the US.

A national survey published in February 2019 by the Prison Policy Initiative found that, in 2018, the highest cost of a 15-minute in-state jail phone call in Wisconsin was $21.97 (\u00a317.12), the third most expensive rate in the country. The average cost of an in-state jail 15-minute phone call in Wisconsin was $7.99 (\u00a36.23), the sixth-highest in the US. These rates are often compounded with extra fees for family members to open and maintain accounts. \u201cThe burden placed on families is outrageous and cruel that folks are having to pay this amount of money to speak with their loved ones in order to maintain contact with their family,\u201d said Sean Wilson, a statewide organizer with ACLU-Wisconsin who spent 17 years in Wisconsin\u2019s prison system. \u2018Our situation is being exploited\u2019 In Missouri, a 15-minute phone call from a jail can cost over $20, and these costs are part of difficult conditions reported at St Louis medium security institution, referred to as the Workhouse, that activists have been pushing to have closed down. \u201cIf you\u2019re already there because you\u2019re poor and can\u2019t afford bail, the odds of you having someone on the outside who can make the trip to the Workhouse to put money on your account and being able to constantly add money is not realistic,\u201d said Inez Bordeaux, manager of community collaborations with ArchCity Defenders, a St Louis-based legal advocacy organization. Bordeaux spent a month in the Workhouse jail in 2016. \u201cThe situation people are in is being exploited. There are people profiting off the pain and trauma of poor, mostly black people in this city.\u201d Jamie Lambing, a records supervisor at the St Louis medium security correctional institution, told the Guardian current phone call rates are $3 for up to a 15-minute local call, 50 cents per minute for out-of-state calls, in-state calls are a flat rate of $3.50 for the first 15 minutes and 21 cents per minute after that. A $3 fee is charged to put money on any prisoner\u2019s account. Daniel Jones was recently released from prison in Michigan, where the highest jail and prison phone call rates rank second in the United States. \u201cThe phone rates caused a strain between my family and I,\u201d said Jones, who worked as a porter while in prison and only made 17.5 cents per day, leaving no money left over for phone calls after spending money on food, hygiene products and medications. \u201cMy family lives out of state. Not being able to talk to them as frequently as necessary to maintain our family ties created space, distance between us.\u201d Jennifer Pruitt was released from the Michigan department of corrections last year after serving 23 years, and often went several months at a time without making a phone call because she couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford the phone calls for years,\u201d said Pruitt. She was part of a successful lawsuit against the state of Michigan for being raped by prison guards in the 1990s and couldn\u2019t afford the phone calls until she was awarded money from that lawsuit. \u201cI was so thankful when I was able to get money to make phone calls, but it was still expensive.\u201d A Michigan department of corrections spokesperson said in an email, \u201cWe believe in the importance of maintaining family connections and we want the phone call rates to be as low as possible,\u201d and shared a press release from 2018 when the Michigan department of corrections reduced phone call rates from 20 cents a minute for prepaid calls to 16 cents a minute for all phone calls. Pruitt said even after the rates were decreased, she spent a few hundred dollars on phone calls the month before she was released in October 2018.

      "bodyText": "Can Labour come back from here? There are 16 days to go, a Conservative leader has been to Wrexham again, and the average of the five weekend polls look roughly as bad as they did for Jeremy Corbyn at this stage in 2017. Labour now sits at 30%, 13 points behind the Conservatives on an election-winning 43%. At this point in the last election Theresa May\u2019s lead was 11 points, although the cracks were already appearing in her campaign. Then, the Tory manifesto collapsed into a row about the \u201cdementia tax\u201d and the then prime minister was forced to retreat in Wrexham, declaring \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. This time, Boris Johnson chose to pose crouching alongside a sheep. So far, the Conservatives have been relatively fortunate: the party has gained eight points since the start of the campaign \u2013 to Labour\u2019s five \u2013 helped almost entirely by Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to pull out of Tory seats. That suggests that the Tory vote could be at its peak, given that Johnson is so unpopular with remain supporters. Labour also needs to improve less than the headline data might suggest. If the Conservative lead dips below six or seven points then that could be enough to deprive Johnson of the 326-plus seat overall majority he craves, according to experts such as political scientist John Curtice of Strathclyde University. To achieve that, Labour has plenty to do. It first needs to hang on to the combination of voters that brought it to 40% at the last general election: the young voters who helped it win seats like Canterbury and Warwick and Leamington, retain Cambridge, and who it needs to win hyper-marginal Southampton Itchen. Labour also needs to shore up its base of traditional voters in \u201cred wall\u201d seats ranging from Wrexham and elsewhere in north Wales, through to the West and east Midlands at a time when party insiders are jittery. Here, perhaps, some of Labour manifesto policies will help. Taxing those earning over \u00a380,000 a year more is supported by 81%, according to Deltapoll, who conducted fieldwork after last Thursday\u2019s launch, making it one of the party\u2019s most popular policies. Scrapping university tuition fees and providing free education for life is supported by 57% and renationalising rail by 51%. Even Labour\u2019s renegotiate-and-vote-again Brexit policy may be more popular than the heavy attack on it by the Conservatives might suggest: with Deltapoll suggesting it is liked by 42% and opposed by 36%. Labour also has to further squeeze the Liberal Democrats, currently polling at 15%, who are still well ahead of their 7.4% finish in 2017. With the Lib Dems finally focusing their attacks on Johnson, Corbyn\u2019s party has a chance to ram home the message that seats won in 2017 like Kensington in London will be vulnerable if the anti-Tory vote is split. Ultimately, though, Labour has to take the argument direct to the Conservatives, and neutralise some of Corbyn\u2019s relative unpopularity to the prime minister. Here, the party is helped by the fact that in a week\u2019s time Donald Trump arrives in London for the two-day Nato summit. That gives Labour a fortuitous opportunity to present an image of Britain under a Johnson government, in thrall to an erratic and unpopular US president and its chlorinated chicken-led trade policy. Labour also needs to find a way to highlight Johnson\u2019s biggest weakness: trust. It is the issue that the party\u2019s candidates say recurs on the doorstep, linked as it is to the complicated personal life that lingers, unsaid, in voter\u2019s minds. Corbyn was notably reluctant to stray into that territory during the first leader\u2019s debate on ITV, although the audience laughed at the prime minister, but has another chance to do so in the BBC head-to-head on 6 December, if he can find the appropriate language. In the interim, Labour has to try and highlight holes in Conservative promises. It has started by demonstrating that Johnson\u2019s pledge to recruit 50,000 more nurses is an exaggeration, but it is also the case that the promise to resolve the social care crisis is just a vague statement of aspiration and talk of tax cuts has been exaggerated. As for Brexit, not only is no deal at the end of the transition period not ruled out but the coming months of negotiations about a free trade deal suggest that the issue will not be done but instead dominate throughout 2020. With the Conservatives pursuing a risk-averse, sheep-first policy, Labour has to attack.",

But the extraordinary find last year underlined the precarious situation of the small team at the Mamirau\u00e1 Institute for Sustainable Development which found them. Reliant on international funding, they are the only archaeologists for 500km in every direction. \u201cWe need students, researchers, money,\u201d said Kazuo. \u201cAnd now we have the government that we have \u2026\u201d Recent findings are radically changing our understanding of the region\u2019s prehistory. New evidence suggests that pre-Columbian Amazonian civilisations were comparable in scale and complexity to better-known Andean and Mesoamerican cultures. They had populations numbering in the millions, living in interconnected, fortified villages. They left rock art, vast ceremonial earthworks, sprawling irrigation channels and causeways, but any stone buildings, described in fanciful accounts by conquistadors, have not survived. Perhaps even more intriguingly, a growing body of research suggests that much of the world\u2019s largest rainforest was moulded by humans. But archaeologists across the Amazon warn that progress is imperilled by the policies of Brazil\u2019s nationalist president, Jair Bolsonaro. The field is facing dramatic funding cuts, while proposed legal changes on salvage archaeology will endanger priceless physical evidence. And the mass displacement of indigenous communities \u2013 resulting from Bolsonaro\u2019s promises to turn the Amazon over to loggers, miners and farmers in the name of development \u2013 risks destroying the local knowledge needed to reconstruct the Amazon\u2019s past, and potentially safeguard its future. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be doing archaeology, but it\u2019s threatened,\u201d said Eduardo Neves, a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) and the doyen of modern Brazilian archaeology. \u201cScience and higher education in Brazil are under a major cloud \u2026 The whole outlook is pretty bleak.\u201d In Rond\u00f4nia, western Brazil, Eduardo Bespalez and Silvana Zuse \u2013 archaeologists at the state\u2019s federal university UNIR \u2013 squeezed through thick foliage. On both sides of the trail rose huge banks of terra preta, or Amazonian dark earth: dense, fertile soil, produced from ancient cooking fires, rubbish and farming. Spongy to the touch, the black dirt was studded with fragments of pre-Columbian pottery to several metres\u2019 depth. Rond\u00f4nia \u2013 now one of Brazil\u2019s most deforested states \u2013was once a crucible of South American civilisation. This site, known as Teot\u00f4nio, displays \u201csome of the deepest, oldest and most fertile terra preta in the Amazon\u201d, said Bespalez, with some deposits 7,000 years old. Ancestors of the Arawak, Tupi-Guarani and Pano linguistic groups overlapped here, farming, fishing and foraging amid the forest and extending networks of migration, trade and cultural exchange as far as the Orinoco Basin, the Gran Chaco forest and the Andes. \u201cThe cultural diversity here is one of the greatest in the Amazon,\u201d added Zuse. \u201cThere are materials dating back 9,000 years.\u201d The excavation was spurred by the construction of the nearby Santo Ant\u00f4nio hydroelectric dam. Such projects currently require archaeological surveys beforehand , but even this chance to rescue some priceless evidence is set to be foreclosed. Bolsonaro\u2019s administration has revived proposals that prior surveys are only carried out where archaeological material is already proven to exist. Most describe this as absurd: in most cases the archaeology is completely unknown until surveyed. \u201cIf they change the law, archaeology in Brazil is over,\u201d said Bespalez. The vast data produced by such surveys has enabled archaeologists to challenge traditional ideas about the Amazon\u2019s peoples \u2013 that they were primitive and constrained by the forest, rather than adapting to and shaping it \u2013 and redraw the shape of human history. \u201cAgriculture is older here in the Amazon than in the Andes,\u201d said Bespalez. Scientific expeditions have so far concentrated on accessible areas along major rivers. Forays into far western and inland areas could uncover untold additional evidence, further supporting estimates of a pre-Columbian Amazonian population larger than 10 million people. But these investigations may now be put on hold indefinitely. In March, Bolsonaro\u2019s administration announced a surprise budget cut of 42% to the science ministry and of 30% to university funding. In September, the government indicated that CNPq, the main grant-providing body for trainee scientists will lose 87% of its research budget in 2020, while another scientific funding agency, Capes, will suffer cuts of 50%. These drastic cutbacks could produce a \u201clost generation\u201d among Brazilian scientists, forcing many archaeology departments to close, warned Jennifer Watling, an archaeologist at USP. The cuts are defended by Bolsonaro\u2019s government as balancing the books and encouraging researchers to collaborate with the private sector. But Lima argued that the president wants to \u201cdiscredit the role of science\u201d, because recent research poses a direct challenge to his vision of the Amazon as an untouched wilderness ripe for modern development. Palaeobotanists have identified at least 83 species of plant in the Amazon \u2013 including manioc, cacao, sweet potato, peppers, fruits, palms and tobacco \u2013 that were domesticated and up to 5,000 that were exploited by pre-Columbian peoples across their houses, gardens, fields and orchards. Even after European diseases killed many of its indigenous peoples from the early 16th century, the Amazon remained profoundly shaped by ancient human hands. And their descendants retain a strong understanding of how to manage their surroundings sustainably. This knowledge is still evident in Tauary, where on a 20-minute walk through the forest resident Francisco Dias pointed out a dozen different trees whose bark, fruit, wood, sap and roots are used in food, medicine, ceramics, perfumes, adhesives and even to immobilise fish for the net. Most researchers identify the violent, mass displacement of traditional communities likely to result from Bolsonaro\u2019s policies as the biggest threat to their work \u2013 and a tragedy in itself. \u201cLarge dams or mining will destroy a lot of archaeological sites,\u201d said Anne Rapp Py-Daniel, an archaeology professor at Ufopa, a university in Santar\u00e9m. \u201cBut seeing people losing everything worries me more.\u201d Neves argued that archaeologists can bring \u201canother perspective\u201d to the debate over the Amazon, polarised between conservationists emphasising its supposedly pristine state and those seeking to extract its undeveloped resources. \u201cThe Amazon has to be protected, not only because it\u2019s natural, but because it represents very sophisticated systems of knowledge that have been developed over the millennia,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea what we can learn.\u201d Leaders of an indigenous occupation in Rio de Janeiro known as the Aldeia Maracan\u00e3, who hope to set up a university to preserve and share such knowledge, agreed. \u201cInternational organisations should take note,\u201d said Ash Ash\u00e1ninka, a member of a the Ash\u00e1ninka indigenous group in Acre state. \u201cIf they want to conserve the planet, leave forested land to indigenous peoples. Because we know how to protect it and live there without destroying, poisoning or burning it. We know how to live well.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury has in effect backed the chief rabbi\u2019s comments on the Labour leadership\u2019s record on antisemitism with a tweet highlighting the \u201cdeep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews\u201d. Justin Welby does not explicitly refer to the Labour party, but his intervention a few hours after the chief rabbi\u2019s excoriating public criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is significant. In an article in the Times, Ephraim Mirvis, Britain\u2019s most senior Jewish leader, accused Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d to take root in the party, saying the way the Labour leadership had dealt with anti-Jewish racism was \u201cincompatible with the British values of which we are so proud \u2013 of dignity and respect for all people\u201d. Welby posted on Twitter: \u201cThat the chief rabbi should be compelled to make such an unprecedented statement at this time ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews. They should be able to live in accordance with their beliefs and freely express their culture and faith.\u201d Acknowledging the Church of England\u2019s own history of antisemitism \u2013 the subject of a major report last week \u2013 Welby continued: \u201cNone of us can afford to be complacent. Voicing words that commit to a stand against antisemitism requires a corresponding effort in visible action.\u201d The chief rabbi\u2019s comments were also supported by the rabbi Julia Neuberger, a crossbench peer, who said the Jewish community had been gripped by anxiety.

She added: \u201cIf they\u2019re not willing to tackle that, if they\u2019re not willing to apologise for it, if they\u2019re not willing to sympathise, then something is going very wrong. \u201cA political party where some of its members leave because of antisemitic taunting, which still cannot deal with it, makes people feel very uncomfortable.\u201d Britain was still \u201ca very good place to live as a Jew\u201d, she added. \u201cBut, and it\u2019s an important but, I think what people are feeling is that that is shifting.\u201d If a Corbyn government was elected, \u201cthen I think this comfortable place to live may feel less comfortable\u201d.

The bank\u2019s crisis \u2013 which was triggered last Wednesday when Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched a blockbuster lawsuit against it \u2013 has also reignited controversy over executive pay in the financial services sector after Westpac told the market Hartzer will receive a payout of almost $2.7m. It also provoked a warning from ratings agency S&amp;P that compliance scandals were likely to drag down the profits of the big four banks for the next two years and has derailed a pushback, led by Hartzer, against increased regulation of the sector after last year\u2019s royal commission. Whether investors were told enough about the brewing Austrac lawsuit when they tipped $2.5bn into the bank\u2019s coffers in a 4 November capital raising also came under fresh scrutiny on Tuesday, with Maxsted admitting the regulator told Westpac child exploitation payments were a focus of its regulation in an email on 20 September. The bank faces a raft of other investigations into the scandal from the Australian federal police, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Chairman: \u2018I was horrified\u2019 Westpac reported itself to Austrac last year over its failure to properly implement anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws relating to international fund transfers. In its federal court lawsuit, Austrac alleges Westpac broke the law 23 million times in transactions involving about $11bn. But it is a far smaller number of payments to the Philippines that has ignited public disgust and drawn condemnation from politicians. The payments, which were discovered by Austrac during its investigation, are allegedly consistent with child exploitation including live streaming of abuse and the sale of children for sex.

Hartzer, who was not on the call, will finish on Monday. While the company searches for a permanent replacement, the top job will be filled by the chief financial officer, Peter King \u2013 who was planning to \u201cretire\u201d next year at the age of 49 amid speculation he had fallen out with Hartzer. Maxsted, who has been on the board since 2008 and chairman since 2011, says he will retire before the middle of next year. The director Ewen Crouch, who heads the board\u2019s risk committee, will not stand for re-election at the Westpac annual shareholder meeting on 12 December. Louise Davidson, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (Acsi), which gives advice to super funds that control $2.2tn in assets, welcomed the departures but said Westpac needed to consider whether it needed to do more to refresh its board. \u201cGiven all that\u2019s occurred, what are the skills and experience that the board needs and how are they going to make sure they have them?\u201d she said. She said Acsi had yet to advise its member funds on how to vote at the AGM and would keep talking to Westpac about its plans to investigate how the breaches occurred and make sure they do not happen again. \u201cWe think it\u2019s really important now that they have an opportunity to get on with that work,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the organisation, it will be important to understand what went wrong in the first place, to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Maxsted said further turnover of the board would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d. He said the board and management wanted to demonstrate accountability. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to go too far so that it\u2019s very disruptive to the business,\u201d he said. Greens call for CEO salary caps Hartzer\u2019s $2.68m payout triggered a pledge by the Greens to put forward legislation limiting the pay of banking executives, similar to failed amendments it proposed to the new Banking Executive Accountability Regime that would have capped remuneration at 10 times annual average full-time wages. \u201cI suggest Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer donate his $2.7 million payout to a charity like Save the Children who have been working tirelessly on the issue of child protection,\u201d the Greens treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, told the Guardian. \u201cCEO resignations aren\u2019t enough.

Questions asked about capital raising Westpac shares rose 1.72% on Tuesday on the back of the boardroom clearout, ending a four-day run of losses. However, the depressed share price means investors who participated in the 4 November capital raising now face taking a loss, instead of the easy profit they would have reaped under normal circumstances. The leading bank analyst Brett Le Mesurier, of Shaw and Partners, said investors would be asking why the capital raising wasn\u2019t put off until after Austrac filed its court documents on Wednesday, given that the bank already had adequate capital to meet regulatory requirements. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they wait?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was the urgency? \u201cThey must have had some indication that Austrac wasn\u2019t that far away [from filing the lawsuit] because they said they were in enforcement phase around the time of the annual report.\u201d Maxsted said the bank was \u201cabsolutely\u201d confident it had met its disclosure requirements in relation to the capital raising. He denied that the bank ignored the risk posed by anti-money laundering laws but admitted that in the past it \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough focus on operational risk and compliance matters\u201d. \u201cSo we\u2019ve really turned the dial up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go and think about the [Austrac] statement of claim, much of the material in that statement of claim is because we actually did that. \u201cSo we increased our capabilities, increased our resources, had greater accountabilities, and as a result of that, unfortunately, we found issues.\u201d Westpac then reported the issues to Austrac, he said. \u201cThe exception to that is that we didn\u2019t see that we had an issue in relation to the LitePay system.\u201d He said that Westpac first learned that Austrac was investigating LitePay on 20 September, in a \u201cfifth or six notice\u201d issued by the regulator compelling the bank to produce documents. Austrac followed up with an email on 15 November specifically talking about LitePay and payments into the Philippines. \u201cThat was the first time it was mentioned that there were 12 customers and particular concerns related to them,\u201d Maxsted said.",

      "body": "<p>Visitors entered this summer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/art/sweet_harmony.php\">Sweet Harmony exhibition</a> through a tangle of ripped-up fencing, as if stealthily gaining access to a forbidden ritual. Inside, old-skool rave anthems rattled the Saatchi Gallery\u2019s window frames. On the walls were hundreds of flyers alongside photographs of saucer-eyed youngsters waving air-horns and wearing T-shirts adorned with amusingly brazen drug references.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.daveswindells.com/\">Dave Swindells</a>, the man responsible for many of these classic photographs \u2013 and, indeed, many of the most memorable visual documentations of 1988\u2019s summer of love \u2013 was struck by how much his images meant to strangers whose reckless youth he captured. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional. I was getting messages from people saying how amazing it was that they were on the walls of the Saatchi!\u201d</p> <p>These ravers will be deep into middle age by now, so it is easy to forget that today\u2019s gallery-fodder was yesterday\u2019s tabloid terror. \u201cShoot These Evil Acid Barons!\u201d screamed a Sun headline in November 1988. But perhaps the fear and fury generated by rave\u2019s first wave is why this year\u2019s significant flurry of interest in the UK\u2019s last great pop-cultural sea change feels like more than simple nostalgia. Alongside Sweet Harmony, Joe Muggs\u2019s book, Bass, Mids, Tops explores a wider continuum of British sound system culture that encompasses everything from lovers rock to grime. There are also forthcoming books on London rare groove (by Caspar Melville) and Yorkshire bleep and bass (Matt Anniss). Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/09/jeremy-deller-on-raving-stormzy-and-dave-give-me-hope\">Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary Everybody in the Place</a>, which aired on BBC Four in August, traced the roots of rave, locating its importance in terms of both folk memory and cultural subversion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84051ec125467145a51923b1b82913d5f289d1a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84051ec125467145a51923b1b82913d5f289d1a9/0_126_2256_1353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Megadog nightclub at the Rocket, 1994\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Megadog nightclub at the Rocket, 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Stevenson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But why has our desire to explore the breadth and depth of rave\u2019s wider implications surfaced now? Have we simply reached the inevitable moment when the nation\u2019s editors, curators and controllers are drawn from the rave generation? Or is our troubled present finding an echo in the late 1980s? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/young-people-rage-failed-politics\">Everybody in the Place, with its classroom setup and audience of modern teens</a>, could easily have been the 2019 equivalent of a middle-aged man in 1988 expecting the original rave kids to be wowed by footage of Bill Haley and the Comets. But, somehow, it felt altogether more vital than that.</p> <p>The distinct but intersecting scenes played out in the 1980s and 90s and documented this year shared an unmediated, self-generated quality. These events were communal and often lawless. They were not happening with anyone\u2019s permission but instead were reactions to the prevailing currents of their time. Deller\u2019s film analyses rave\u2019s role in the traumatised aftermath of the miners\u2019 strike. Rave, he proposed, was \u201ca death ritual marking the transition of Britain from an industrial to a service economy\u201d.</p> <p>Swindells \u2013 who also took photos at the 1984 battle of Orgreave \u2013 agrees that \u201cthere was a strong anti-Thatcher thing going on\u201d in early rave. His Sweet Harmony images and archive film in Everybody in the Place feel simultaneously distant and recognisable; familiar faces waving (and gurning) to us across an unbridgeable chasm. Maybe this explains its resonance in 2019. We have no shortage of things to be furious about. After years of fragmentation and polarisation, the joyful militancy of early rave feels poignant; the kind of unified response to political strife that this era is yet to produce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/jul/12/celebrating-rave-culture-in-pictures\">Aciiiiid!

      "bodyText": "Visitors entered this summer\u2019s Sweet Harmony exhibition through a tangle of ripped-up fencing, as if stealthily gaining access to a forbidden ritual. Inside, old-skool rave anthems rattled the Saatchi Gallery\u2019s window frames. On the walls were hundreds of flyers alongside photographs of saucer-eyed youngsters waving air-horns and wearing T-shirts adorned with amusingly brazen drug references. Dave Swindells, the man responsible for many of these classic photographs \u2013 and, indeed, many of the most memorable visual documentations of 1988\u2019s summer of love \u2013 was struck by how much his images meant to strangers whose reckless youth he captured. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional. I was getting messages from people saying how amazing it was that they were on the walls of the Saatchi!\u201d These ravers will be deep into middle age by now, so it is easy to forget that today\u2019s gallery-fodder was yesterday\u2019s tabloid terror. \u201cShoot These Evil Acid Barons!\u201d screamed a Sun headline in November 1988. But perhaps the fear and fury generated by rave\u2019s first wave is why this year\u2019s significant flurry of interest in the UK\u2019s last great pop-cultural sea change feels like more than simple nostalgia. Alongside Sweet Harmony, Joe Muggs\u2019s book, Bass, Mids, Tops explores a wider continuum of British sound system culture that encompasses everything from lovers rock to grime. There are also forthcoming books on London rare groove (by Caspar Melville) and Yorkshire bleep and bass (Matt Anniss). Meanwhile, Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary Everybody in the Place, which aired on BBC Four in August, traced the roots of rave, locating its importance in terms of both folk memory and cultural subversion. But why has our desire to explore the breadth and depth of rave\u2019s wider implications surfaced now? Have we simply reached the inevitable moment when the nation\u2019s editors, curators and controllers are drawn from the rave generation? Or is our troubled present finding an echo in the late 1980s? Everybody in the Place, with its classroom setup and audience of modern teens, could easily have been the 2019 equivalent of a middle-aged man in 1988 expecting the original rave kids to be wowed by footage of Bill Haley and the Comets. But, somehow, it felt altogether more vital than that. The distinct but intersecting scenes played out in the 1980s and 90s and documented this year shared an unmediated, self-generated quality. These events were communal and often lawless. They were not happening with anyone\u2019s permission but instead were reactions to the prevailing currents of their time. Deller\u2019s film analyses rave\u2019s role in the traumatised aftermath of the miners\u2019 strike. Rave, he proposed, was \u201ca death ritual marking the transition of Britain from an industrial to a service economy\u201d. Swindells \u2013 who also took photos at the 1984 battle of Orgreave \u2013 agrees that \u201cthere was a strong anti-Thatcher thing going on\u201d in early rave. His Sweet Harmony images and archive film in Everybody in the Place feel simultaneously distant and recognisable; familiar faces waving (and gurning) to us across an unbridgeable chasm. Maybe this explains its resonance in 2019. We have no shortage of things to be furious about. After years of fragmentation and polarisation, the joyful militancy of early rave feels poignant; the kind of unified response to political strife that this era is yet to produce. Yet the potential for this kind of unity feels stifled by changes that can never be reversed. There is a moment in Deller\u2019s film when one student has a realisation. \u201cThere\u2019s no technology or nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo everyone\u2019s just in their own space.\u201d This speaks to a modern fear concerning a loss of freedom, in the context of both state surveillance (pertinent given the regularity with which original rave culture involved breaking the law) and a more personal issue related to the self-curation of social media. However, Muggs senses change in the air: \u201cThere will never be another acid house because it was a reaction to its times. But I think we are entering a period of backlash against this isolation and being in your own bubble.\u201d Muggs\u2019s book Bass, Mids, Tops sidesteps obvious figures, instead celebrating continuity \u2013 from production great Dennis Bovell to underrated Bristol breakbeat duo Smith &amp; Mighty. \u201cBass culture,\u201d writes Muggs in his introductory chapter, \u201cis folk culture.\u201d Perhaps that is what we\u2019ve seen the beginnings of this year.

He was fostered until the age of eight before returning to his mother and a father \u2013 who, in this account, is intermittently, erratically and violently on the scene \u2013 in London.

The Tottenham boss is looking to bolster his squad after arriving mid-season following Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s departure but might not have too much money to play with. Mourinho has also been poo-pooing the claim he will bring in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, saying it would make \u201cno sense\u201d. After watching 45 minutes of Phil Jones on Sunday evening, Manchester United are once again looking for a new centre-back. The latest name to be thrown into the ring is Mohammed Salisu of Real Valladolid, whose agent \u2013 it says here \u2013 is Juan Mata\u2019s dad. He could cost just \u00a310m. Due to the fact almost every single team is underperforming in the Premier League, according to pundits/fans/chief executives, there are going to be some changes in the coming weeks so clubs can gear up for the January transfer window. Arsenal are considering getting rid of laugh-a-minute Unai Emery, with some of their top, top players growing increasingly unhappy and meaning they might run away at the end of the season if the Spaniard is still at the wheel. Head honchos at the Emirates fear the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, who both have 18 months to run on their current contracts, could pack their bags in the summer in order to clear space in their diaries on Thursday nights. Pep Guardiola has warned the Gunners and Everton off appointing his right-hand man, Mikel Arteta, saying the Basque will be sticking around at the Etihad until the end of the season. Marco Silva could have two more games to save his job, though, which gives the Toffees\u2019 hierarchy a bit of extra time to find David Moyes\u2019s phone number down the back of the Goodison Park dugout. The next man for a P45 is Manuel Pellegrini, whose West Ham career is set to be defined by the flapping of Roberto in goal. For some reason, the Hammers think Chris Wilder might depart free-wheeling Sheffield United in order to take charge at the London Stadium. Elsewhere, it is reported Pellegrini has been told to improve results, which is a cunning plan. Having returned for a second spell in charge of Watford at the start of September, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores is already having to look over his shoulder having won once in the Premier League since his arrival, with their last game resulting in a 3-0 home defeat to Burnley. Watford are considering who could potentially replace the replacement if things do not pick up. If they wait a few weeks there will be hundreds of recently-sacked managers to choose from.",

Officials and ministers will meet in Madrid next week to clear the way for a crunch meeting a year from now in Glasgow, where the gap between countries\u2019 current emissions pledges and scientific estimates of what cuts are needed will be addressed. Current pledges under the Paris agreement are deemed inadequate; if countries stick to them next year, they would have to reduce emissions to zero from 2030 to avoid raising temperatures by more than 1.5C. For that reason, Andersen urged nations not to wait to enshrine new commitments, but to take immediate action. UNEP has been reporting on the \u201cemissions gap\u201d between countries\u2019 pledges and the cuts needed since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, but rising emissions in the meantime have made the situation even more urgent. Last year\u2019s landmark scientific assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change revealed the ravages that would result from a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels, including the near-total extinction of coral reefs, and extreme weather around the world. The current pledges made by countries under the Paris agreement would cause temperature rises of about 3.2C this century, according to scientific estimates.",

      "bodyText": "The chief rabbi has accused Jeremy Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d to take root in Labour, saying Jews are justifiably anxious about the prospect of the party forming the next government. Ephraim Mirvis, the spiritual leader of the UK\u2019s 62 orthodox synagogues, made a rare intervention in politics to argue that the \u201csoul of the nation is at stake\u201d as the country goes to the polls in just over two weeks\u2019 time. Writing for The Times, he said it was not his place to tell people how to vote but argued that the way in which the Labour leadership had dealt with anti-Jewish racism was \u201cincompatible with the British values of which we are so proud \u2013 of dignity and respect for all people\u201d. Labour has always strongly denied any suggestion that Corbyn has failed to get to grips with allegations of antisemitism in Labour, pointing to his record as an anti-racist campaigner and moves to overhaul the party\u2019s complaints process. The rabbi wrote: \u201cThe party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party.\u201d Mirvis said British Jews were gripped by a justified anxiety about the prospect of a Corbyn government. He wrote: \u201cHow complicit in prejudice would a leader of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition have to be to be considered unfit for office? Would associations with those who have incited hatred against Jews be enough? Would describing as \u2018friends\u2019 those who endorse the murder of Jews be enough? It seems not. \u201cIt is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When 12 December arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.\u201d The rabbi also claimed that there were 130 cases of antisemitism that were outstanding against Labour members, an allegation the party disputes. \u201cThe Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism,\u201d Mirvis wrote. \u201cEven as they received threats, the response of the Labour leadership was utterly inadequate. We have endured quibbling and prevarication over whether the party should adopt the most widely accepted definition of antisemitism. \u201cNow we await the outcome of a formal investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into whether discrimination by the party against Jews has become an institutional problem. And all of this while in opposition. What should we expect of them in government?\u201d A Labour party spokesman said Corbyn was a \u201clifelong campaigner against antisemitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name\u201d. He added: \u201cA Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising antisemitism in our country and across Europe. Our race and faith manifesto, launched today, sets out our policies to achieve this. \u201cThe 130 figure is inaccurate and it is categorically untrue to suggest there are thousands of outstanding cases. We are taking robust action to root out antisemitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members. \u201cAntisemitism complaints account for about 0.1% of the Labour party membership, while polls show antisemitism is more prevalent among Conservative than Labour supporters. In the past week it\u2019s been revealed Conservative candidates said events in the Holocaust were \u2018fabricated\u2019 and called British Jews \u2018extremists\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has stood by his energy minister, Angus Taylor, despite revelations Taylor\u2019s office is under police investigation for relying on falsified documents to attack Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore. How did we get to this point? Here\u2019s a recap of the main events that led Taylor into controversy. 24 June 2019 Moore declares a climate emergency which is endorsed by the council. The council writes to the federal government to tell it of its decision. 29 September 2019 Taylor writes a letter to Moore in response suggesting councils take practical steps to reduce their own emissions and points out the council\u2019s annual report shows \u201cyour council spent $1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel\u201d. The letter is also handed to the Daily Telegraph. 30 September 2019 The Daily Telegraph publishes a story on page three and online, quoting the letter claiming the council spent more than $15m on domestic and international travel. Moore disputes the Telegraph story and asks the reporter to provide evidence. The reporter provides a page from the council\u2019s annual report, which she says was handed to her by Taylor\u2019s office. The page contains two figures purporting to show the council spent \u201c$14.2\u201d in expenses on interstate travel and \u201c$1.7\u201d on overseas visits. Moore checks the annual report: on page 14 it shows councillors spent $4,206.32 on interstate travel and $1,727.77 on overseas visits. Moore angrily disputes the story with Taylor via Twitter. 22 October 2019 Moore writes to Taylor asking him to \u201ccorrect a stark error in your letter\u201d saying the $15m figure was grossly inaccurate. Moore lodges a complaint with the Press Council. 23 October 2019 The Guardian publishes a story revealing the falsified figures and their use by Taylor\u2019s office. 24 October 2019 Taylor says he makes \u201cno apology for suggesting that the lord mayor should take real and meaningful action to reduce the City of Sydney\u2019s carbon emissions instead of hollow virtue-signalling through letters\u201d. He states that he obtained the version of the annual report from the council\u2019s website. But the council releases evidence from its systems showing the documents had not been changed since they were uploaded with the accurate figures in November 2018. 25 October 2019 Labor refers the matter to the NSW police, citing the Guardian\u2019s story and asking for an investigation of whether someone had \u201cmade a false document with the intention\u201d of inducing journalists at the Daily Telegraph to accept it as genuine for the purpose of influencing the \u201clord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, and other City of Sydney councillors in the exercise of their public duties\u201d. Police are also asked to investigate whether an offence had been committed \u201con the basis that Mr Taylor or one or more individuals from Mr Taylor\u2019s office\u201d knew or believed an offence had been committed but failed to bring it to the attention of police. Taylor issues a statement sticking to his version of events. He says again he had accessed the document from the council\u2019s website, and says he had evidence multiple versions of the annual report existed at various points since they were uploaded. He says minor formatting differences between the Word and PDF files on the council\u2019s website show multiple versions could have existed online, leaving open the possibility his office downloaded some version of the report containing false figures. The explanation is rejected by Labor and Moore. 31 October 2019 Taylor apologises unreservedly for relying on inaccurate figures to attack Clover Moore, but insists he downloaded them from the council\u2019s website. 25 November 2019 Taylor refuses to answer questions about whether he misled the House when he told parliament he had sourced incorrect figures about City of Sydney travel directly from the council\u2019s website. 26 November 2019 Police reveal they are investigating the allegations against Taylor through Strike Force Garrad. Morrison stands by Taylor. Morrison says he believes there is no need for action after a conversation with the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller.",

In recent months the Guardian has reported on numerous cases in which the Home Office has refused visas to academics working at British universities, or to their families.</p> <p>The Home Office expects all employers to check that potential employees are not working illegally. It is becoming increasingly common for universities, which seem more nervous than ever of falling foul of the Home Office, to apply this even to one-off activities such as taking a PhD viva, reviewing research or delivering a guest lecture.</p> <p>Now academics, furious about the Home Office refusing visas to established university staff, are fighting back, with some declining to volunteer their passports for checks for casual work at other universities. Others are lobbying university managers to support migrant researchers by paying their visa and immigration fees, which can run into the tens of thousands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/15/uk-deport-academic-to-democratic-republic-of-congo-never-visited-sexual-violence\">UK to deport academic to Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 which she has never visited</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wells agreed to submit her passport rather than jeopardising the student\u2019s viva exam, but wrote a formal letter to the university about its big brother tactics. Following this, the institution allowed her to supervise the exam without checking her passport.</p> <p>She says: \u201cIf an academic already works at a university there is no need to check their papers. People in universities are being made to feel either like immigration suspects or immigration police.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities should absolutely resist this. I find it extremely worrying that we have just accepted that it\u2019s our job to monitor international students for the Home Office. I have to report a student for not attending a supervision meeting. I have to authorise and justify PhD students leaving the country to do field work.

      "bodyText": "Karen Wells, professor of human geography at Birkbeck, University of London, was outraged to be informed that before she could conduct a PhD viva exam at another university she had to submit her passport for Home Office checks. Wells says this sort of heightened surveillance is part of the same \u201chostile environment\u201d that has seen academics threatened with deportation and unable to bring their children into the country. In recent months the Guardian has reported on numerous cases in which the Home Office has refused visas to academics working at British universities, or to their families. The Home Office expects all employers to check that potential employees are not working illegally. It is becoming increasingly common for universities, which seem more nervous than ever of falling foul of the Home Office, to apply this even to one-off activities such as taking a PhD viva, reviewing research or delivering a guest lecture. Now academics, furious about the Home Office refusing visas to established university staff, are fighting back, with some declining to volunteer their passports for checks for casual work at other universities. Others are lobbying university managers to support migrant researchers by paying their visa and immigration fees, which can run into the tens of thousands. Wells agreed to submit her passport rather than jeopardising the student\u2019s viva exam, but wrote a formal letter to the university about its big brother tactics. Following this, the institution allowed her to supervise the exam without checking her passport. She says: \u201cIf an academic already works at a university there is no need to check their papers. People in universities are being made to feel either like immigration suspects or immigration police. \u201cUniversities should absolutely resist this. I find it extremely worrying that we have just accepted that it\u2019s our job to monitor international students for the Home Office. I have to report a student for not attending a supervision meeting. I have to authorise and justify PhD students leaving the country to do field work. Now they are monitoring academics too.\u201d Chris Chambers, an Australian and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Cardiff University, was recently told to send his passport for checks before an unpaid guest lecture at another university. He refused on principle. \u201cEvery time an academic says yes to an inappropriate request like this, they are feeding the beast,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd where does it all end up? In academics being deported. \u201cScience is a global pursuit and universities have a lot of people coming through their departments from other countries who might not have a right to work here. Are we seriously saying those people shouldn\u2019t be able to give guest lectures?\u201d The university\u2019s human resources department responded aggressively, he says, telling him the Home Office could fine them up to \u00a320,000 for failing to make the checks. However, a colleague took his case higher and a senior lawyer at the institution declared that because he was giving the lecture unpaid, the checks were unlawful. The request was dropped. Chambers says universities are terrified of breaking Home Office rules and being fined, or losing their ability to recruit lucrative international students \u2013 as London Metropolitan University did temporarily in 2012. He is calling on senior academics to resist unreasonable Home Office checks. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen a massive drop in the number of EU nationals who apply for positions here. This country is now seen as unwelcoming to people who aren\u2019t British,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a floating xenophobia in the system that isn\u2019t shared by academics, but is harming the global connectivity of science.\u201d A lecturer at a modern university, who asked not to be named, says her institution recently warned a departmental administrative assistant that she personally would be responsible for a fine of thousands of pounds if an academic acting as anexternal examiner was paid without a right-to-work check. \u201cI would like to see universities presenting some resistance as a sector to this profoundly unjust government policy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they should not cascade responsibility for it to individual members of staff.\u201d Ian Donald, professor of psychological sciences at Liverpool University, was horrified when he was asked by a competitor institution last week to send in his passport for two days\u2019 work reviewing research. \u201cI wrote back saying I was appalled and I wouldn\u2019t be prepared to do that. \u201cIt is a bit like having a coercive partner.

A young postdoctoral researcher with a three-year contract, a partner and two children on the average salary is now expected to pay more than 30% of their first year\u2019s take-home pay \u2013 \u00a37,240 \u2013 upfront on visa and immigration costs. In addition, the Conservatives plan to increase the immigration health surcharge they have to pay to \u00a3625 a year \u2013 \u00a32,500 for an academic with a partner and two children. Institutions including St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Sheffield University, the University of East Anglia and Lancaster University now cover visa fees for their staff from overseas. But many others don\u2019t. Gareth Edwards, senior lecturer in geography at UEA: University of East Anglia, and co-founder of International and Broke, which campaigns for migrant staff at British universities, says: \u201cUniversities obviously can\u2019t control the fees the Home Office charges or the terrible proposals to increase the health surcharge.

Like many young academics he has had to reapply for a visa \u2013 and pay again \u2013 each time his contract has changed, spending \u00a313,000 on visa fees for himself and his family. Cambridge does not cover these costs, although it has introduced an interest-free loan to help. \u201cI see the impact of staff shortages in my clinical role, but it is more and more difficult to recruit and retain doctors in the presence of current visa regulations,\u201d he says.",

despite the minister\u2019s claim, all the evidence to date is that no such documents ever existed on the website, the altered document has only ever been produced by the minister\u2019s office and the doctored figures have only ever been used by the minister in his official ministerial correspondence;</p> <p>d. today the New South Wales Police confirm that it had launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate the matter;</p> <p>e. paragraph 7.1 of the ministerial standards makes clear that it is for the Prime Minister to stand aside a minister if that minister becomes a subject of an official investigation of alleged illegal conduct;</p> <p>f. In question time today the Prime Minister stonewalled, ridiculed Labor for demanding the Minister for Emissions Reduction be immediately stood aside and shut down debate on the minister\u2019s conduct.</p> <p>and</p> <p>2. therefore condemns the Prime Minister for his contempt for this Parliament and the principles of ministerial integrity and accountability.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I am astounded that the prime minister has shown such contempt to come into this parliament and to stonewall again further for this minister.

The word \u201cblock\u201d contains a strong imputation. I might note if that word is to be included in the question, then the question needs to be directed to me as the minister in charge of freedom of information pursuant to standing order 98.

As I\u2019ve made clear before, and for a number of years now, as have previous Speakers, particularly Speaker Andrew on this topic, that whilst the standing orders obviously were quoted accurately by the leader of the House, the practice has been lenient with respect to inferences and also on imputations. </p> <p>That\u2019s certainly been the case. And, indeed, Speaker Andrew pointed out that if they were strictly enforced, most questions would simply not be in order, or not be able to be asked. I\u2019ve always said I\u2019m happy to look at how we might change things in the future. But if we had a strict reading of questions, I would have a very strict reading of the standing orders around answers. </p> <p>And that can obviously change the nature of things. The other point Speaker Andrew made was, in ruling questions out of order on that basis, it does prevent the minister from having any opportunity, as the manager of opposition business says. So, on this occasion I\u2019m going to allow the question to proceed, and it\u2019s up to the minister how he deals with that. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T04:01:01.855Z\">at 4.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ddc9f4c8f083aa6d578b248\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T03:43:27.269Z\">3.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Dreyfus </strong>has been told not to speak for an hour after being caught making a bunch of interjections.<br></p> <p>The chamber is taking bets on whether he\u2019ll make it.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T03:44:43.833Z\">at 3.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ddc9e8b8f080fd59fb17540\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-26T03:41:52.190Z\">3.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And to go to the question again, of course we will cooperate with any and all matters, Mr Speaker.

And around and around we go: The Australian Republican Movement is holding an event at Old Parliament House tonight \u2013 Malcolm Turnbull, Anthony Albanese and Richard Di Natale are all slated to speak. Personally, I think it would be a lot easier to just put up a giant photo of Prince Andrew, but I guess words are cool too. Adam Bandt on Angus Taylor: Scott Morrison is deep in denial. The PM has thrown integrity overboard to hang on to a 1 seat majority on the floor of Parliament. The government says unions need special \u2018integrity\u2019 legislation because they can\u2019t manage their own affairs, then the Liberals keep a Minister under police investigation on the front bench. If you\u2019ve got a blue collar the Liberals throw the book at you, but if you\u2019ve got a white collar they turn a blind eye. Not only is Scott Morrison refusing to accept that burning coal makes bushfires worse, he\u2019s backing a Minister being investigated by police for using forged documents in a climate-related attack. For those asking, and this is from my memory as a police reporter, a strike force is just the name given to an investigation which involves specialists \u2013 investigating different crimes needs different skills, and when those skills are called upon, a strike force is called in. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a team of people are working on it. Goodness \u2013 do they know they let a woman in? The emojis will never stop now. We are stuck with them. The speakers list for this debate is very, very looooooooooooooonnnnnnng And some more Mike Bowers: How Mike Bowers saw question time and some of those divisions go down: And here is what Anthony Albanese managed to get out in that motion: And I move that so much of standing orders be suspended as would allow the leader of the opposition to move the following motion immediately. That the House, 1. notes: a. that on the evening of the 23 October 2019, the Guardian reported that the Minister for Emissions Reduction had used incorrect figures from the City of Sydney\u2019s annual report 2017/18 in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney; b. on 24 October 2019, the minister told the House that the document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney\u2019s website; c. despite the minister\u2019s claim, all the evidence to date is that no such documents ever existed on the website, the altered document has only ever been produced by the minister\u2019s office and the doctored figures have only ever been used by the minister in his official ministerial correspondence; d. today the New South Wales Police confirm that it had launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate the matter; e. paragraph 7.1 of the ministerial standards makes clear that it is for the Prime Minister to stand aside a minister if that minister becomes a subject of an official investigation of alleged illegal conduct; f. In question time today the Prime Minister stonewalled, ridiculed Labor for demanding the Minister for Emissions Reduction be immediately stood aside and shut down debate on the minister\u2019s conduct. and 2. therefore condemns the Prime Minister for his contempt for this Parliament and the principles of ministerial integrity and accountability. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am astounded that the prime minister has shown such contempt to come into this parliament and to stonewall again further for this minister. This minister must go. This minister must go. There was a reason the random name generator of NSW police investigations made some headlines... It might be the Queenslander in me, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great that a prime minister can ring up a police commissioner and ask for information about why they have launched an investigation. Here\u2019s the whole statement Scott Morrison made to the House: Coming back to the House in question time today I undertook to make contact with the New South Wales police to inform myself on the matters that were the subject of the questions raised by the leader of the opposition regarding the statement of ministerial standards, specifically clauses 7.1 and 7.2. I take matters of ministerial standards very seriously. I\u2019ve since spoken with the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller about the investigation and the nature and substance of their inquiries, which he advised me were based only on the allegations referred by the shadow attorney general. And based on the information provided to me by the commissioner, I consider there is no action required by me under clauses 7.1 and 7.2. The NSW police should now be left to complete their inquiries which will be considered upon their completion. The motions in the House are coming to their inevitable conclusion \u2013 the government has the numbers and the debate will end. Simon Birmingham: No, I\u2019m saying that the police need to do their job as I said before. I\u2019m sure the federal Labor party would criticise the police if they didn\u2019t look at this letter that the Labor party have sent them and investigated, so the police are quite possibly in a no-win situation there, but I have no doubt the police will do a thorough job and the government will cooperate with them in so far as this is required. Patricia Karvelas asks Simon Birmingham if he feels comfortable standing by Angus Taylor while the police investigation is ongoing: Governments are judged on all manner of things. Ultimately the Australian people want us to get on with looking after their interests. Their interests, giving them the confidence to plan for the future, giving them the confidence that there will be jobs for them and their children, giving them the confidence that the services they want will be available to them and that is exactly what we as a government are focused on. The federal opposition and the Labor party can play all sorts of games on side issues, but our focus is about actually, in my case today, having passed through parliament legislation for the Indonesian free trade agreement. The Senate is now getting on with talking about how we can actually make sure that our construction industry works more effectively and reduces costs in the future so there can be more jobs and more building opportunities without the type of union lawlessness we have seen in the past. These are the things that mums and dads around the country care about. Simon Birmingham: You want to draw analogies. It is not that long ago that in your home state that 21 members of the Victorian Labor party in the Victorian government were under investigation including six ministers. I didn\u2019t hear Anthony Albanese or any other members of the Labor party suggesting that those [members should stand down]. Simon Birmingham is defending the decision not to stand down Angus Taylor while the police investigation is carried out to Patricia Karvelas on ABC TV: Let\u2019s put the investigation clearly in context there. The prime minister having had these matters raised purely at the start of question time has come out of question time, has spoken to the police commissioner, has ascertained that apparently the only information there is the referral by the federal Labor opposition to the NSW police. The prime minister of course has indicated that, as you would expect, the government will give full cooperation to their investigation but we have the minister, who has made clear his position for quite some period of time now, in terms of where the information was sourced from, from the City of Sydney website, he has made his public statements, these matters really have been dealt with. Yes, the NSW police are acting on a request from the federal Labor party to look at this matter. We will cooperate with that but that should really be the end of the matter while we get on with governing the country. The government gags the debate \u2013 Labor loses its mind \u2013 and we go to a division. Anthony Albanese is denied a statement on indulgence \u2013 because there is no precedence for it. Tony Smith says he denies it regretfully. Albanese is now trying to suspend standing orders to discuss the issue. \u201cI am astounded that the Prime Minister has shown such contempt.... This minister must go.\u201d Scott Morrison announces he has spoken to the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller. He says he takes \u201cmatters of ministerial standards very seriously\u201d, but he has determined there is \u201cno action\u201d required. I have since spoken with the NSW police commissioner about the investigation and the nature and substance of their inquiries, which he advised me were based only on the allegations referred to by the shadow attorney general. Based on the information provided to me by the commissioner, I consider there is no action required by me under the clause. Labor is back in the federation chamber \u2013 the suspension lasted just under five minutes. But it is about making the point, not actually shutting down parliament. The MPI continues \u2013 Fiona Phillips is getting her five minutes now. Scott Morrison is still at the table, writing notes. Bob Katter has a minute 1.10 on the clock. Bob Katter, talking on the dairy industry as part of the MPI, has never had such a big audience. Scott Morrison has just walked into the chamber and is sitting at the table. Bob Katter is about to be cut off. The Office of National Intelligence has given evidence to a spillover session of budget estimates for the Finance and Public Administration committee. Under questioning from the Liberal senator James Paterson, the director general of the ONI, Nick Warner, said he was \u201cloath\u201d to comment on recent reports on an alleged Chinese plot to infiltrate Australia\u2019s parliament, saying it was a matter for the Department of Home Affairs and Asio. But Warner said he supported the former director of Asio, Duncan Lewis, on the current threat of foreign interference. \u201cAs Duncan Lewis ... used to say with some frequency, foreign interference into Australia and espionage against Australia are at unprecedentedly high levels and we need to take these issues very seriously.\u201d The federation chamber (where speeches go to die, but still get a guernsey in the Hansard) has been suspended \u2013 because of a lack of quorum. Labor is going on strike over the government having gagged the debate on Angus Taylor. The backbench cleared out of QT, and now it\u2019s cleared out of the federation chamber. We are just waiting on the matter of public importance to finish up, and then we are expecting Scott Morrison to address the chamber. On Scott Morrison\u2019s call for an apology if the allegations go nowhere, Anthony Albanese says: There is a strike force, that has been established by the New South Wales police. Have a look at what the prime minister was saying today in question time. I certainly have no influence over what the NSW police do and whether they establish a strike force. They do not do it because they wake up in the morning and say, how about we have a strike force into a federal cabinet minister. They do it because there is a clear case to be made. Anthony Albanese: Angus Taylor should not be a representative of anybody at this point in time. He should be a backbencher. He is under investigation for very serious allegations. You can\u2019t go around producing documents defaming someone, giving them to the media, which aren\u2019t factual documents. And be a minister of the crown. This is the most open and shut circumstances I\u2019ve seen and the fact that yesterday, when we moved to suspension of standing orders, not a single minister was prepared to stand up and to defend minister Taylor. I\u2019m not surprised that they weren\u2019t and say again, they were prepared to do that and indeed, they weren\u2019t even allowed... They weren\u2019t even good enough to allow to have a debate. To shut down the leader of the opposition when we had made a very clear case. Every question, in question time, was about this. There is a police strike force into a cabinet minister and into a fraudulent document and this government does not think that is worthy of even discussion. They are showing contempt for the parliament and in terms of a lack of scrutiny, now they can\u2019t avoid the scrutiny. The prime minister must ask the minister to stand aside today. The hours motion has passed 39 to 33 \u2013 reordering debate to allow more time to discuss the Ensuring Integrity bill. The motion said: (a) the routine of business for the remainder of today shall be: (i) consideration of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019, second reading speeches only, (ii) if a division is called after 7.20 pm, the division shall be taken on the next day of sitting, and (iii) the Senate shall adjourn without debate after the conclusion of the second reading debate, or at 9 pm, or after a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister, whichever is the earlier; and (b) on Wednesday, 27 November 2019: (i) the routine of business from 7.20 pm shall be consideration of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019, second reading speeches only, and (ii) if a division is called after 7.20 pm, the division shall be taken on the next day of sitting, and (iii) the Senate shall adjourn without debate after the conclusion of the second reading debate, or at midnight, or after a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister, whichever is the earlier Anthony Albanese: This prime minister will do anything to avoid scrutiny and today the shutting down of the debate in the parliament about his embattled minister for emissions reduction just highlighted the lack of respect for scrutiny that this prime minister has. The prime minister mightn\u2019t want scrutiny from the parliament or from the crossbench or indeed from the media where he refuses to answer questions but he can\u2019t avoid scrutiny by the New South Wales police force with their strike force that they have launched, operation Garrad, into the behaviour of the minister for emissions reduction. ... We know from the scrutiny that has occurred from outside of the metadata from that website that this document did not come from the website. We don\u2019t know where it came from but we know that it was given to the Daily Telegraph by the minister\u2019s office. And now we have an investigation, a strike force by the NSW police force into this fraudulent document and the minister under section 7.1 of the ministerial code of conduct is subject to the prime minister\u2019s decision as to whether he should step aside or not. Now Arthur Sinodinos stepped aside, no doubt with the encouragement of the then coalition prime minister, over something where there wasn\u2019t a police investigation, there was an inquiry by the ICAC into his conduct. He stepped aside voluntarily. This minister cannot survive this day. The prime minister needs to stand him aside today. This farce whereby a minister has continued to just have this born to rule mentality on display for all, thinking that he can get away with anything he likes because he\u2019s above the common people, and indeed the parliament, well the fact is he is accountable. Scott Morrison will make a statement to the house in a few minutes. Anthony Albanese and Mark Butler will hold a press conference in a couple of minutes \u2013 it\u2019s in the opposition leader\u2019s courtyard, which is Labor\u2019s most serious press conference spot. As the frontbench of the government moves out, Scott Morrison reaches across and pats Angus Taylor on the back. But he does it just inside the door, where it starts to go dark. Question time ends. Scott Morrison also makes notes of the Labor backbench having cleared out. It is great to see the leader of the opposition\u2019s backbench support here in full swing. Greg Hunt gets one more dixer. Question time has been extended as a \u2018whatevs\u2019 to Labor having attempted to gag Sussan Ley, but we should be done after this. Mark Butler gets another question \u2013 to Angus Taylor: The minister\u2019s department blocked access under freedom of information to two sets of emails sent to his office on the very day his conduct was referred to the NSW police. Those emails also been withheld from the NSW police and will they now be provided to the NSW police strike force Garrad? Taylor: Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. After being in opposition for seven years you\u2019d think the member for Hindmarsh would know how FOIs work. Freedom of information requests are being, as they always are, processed in accordance with the Act. Now I tabled my statement from 25 October in the House and I stand by that statement. But, Mr Speaker, the poor understanding of FOI from the member for Hindmarsh isn\u2019t his only mistake. It isn\u2019t his only mistake. We know he was the architect of Labor\u2019s energy and climate policies in 2013, 2016 and 2019. (Scott Morrison nods along with each of these dates.) The member for McMahon. He was the architect of all of those election-losing policies. He is an election-losing machine. (\u201cGood stuff,\u201d Morrison mouths.) Now he is the self-proclaimed master tactician who couldn\u2019t even hold the Labor party presidency is at it again. The member for Hindmarsh is Labor\u2019s special weapon. He\u2019s an election-losing machine. Labor\u2019s backbench has cleared out. That gag motion is also lost. Shockingly. Sussan Ley returns to answer the dixer. And then we can all go. Which for some of us, straight to the principal\u2019s office, me thinks. The hours motion to allow further debate on the union penalty (ensuring integrity) bill, has really set the Labor Senate leader, Penny Wong, off: The government is moving this motion so it can ram through it\u2019s extreme anti-worker legislation. It doesn\u2019t apply to banks. It doesn\u2019t apply to Angus Taylor. It doesn\u2019t apply to Senator Cash. It only applies to working people and their representatives. It is an attack on nurses, police, and their representatives... I was here for the Work Choices legislation \u2013 and you lot haven\u2019t changed. After that Wong hit the Coalition for slow pedalling on the national integrity commission, the banking royal commission and leaving it up to Westpac\u2019s board to respond to allegations of 23m breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Wong notes that in Senate question time, the government refused to rule out changes to unfair dismissal laws and the Better Off Overall Test: Wong concludes: It\u2019s the same ideology and the same agenda as WorkChoices... You think there should be one standard for workers and their representatives and one standard for everyone else. This government doesn\u2019t care about integrity, it doesn\u2019t care about lawlessness, it doesn\u2019t care about workers. Scott Morrison looks like my dad did when I got home from my \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d house when I was 16, after his police friends told him I had been seen pouring vodka into a slurpee cup in the Surfers Paradise mall at 4am. That did not end well for me, FYI. Scott Morrison has the folders stacked. Sussan Ley moves up for her dixer \u2013 and Tony Burke moves that the minister no longer be heard. A bit of tit for tat there, as a gag motion, and also extends the awkwardness for a few minutes longer. The members return to their seats. Scott Morrison indicates there will be one more dixer. Andrew Laming and Tony Pasin once again took the opportunity to sit on the frontbench during the division. Warren Entsch is also there, but it looks like he has some business with Sussan Ley and is seizing the opportunity for a chat. Angus Taylor found a friend in Alan Tudge, who made a beeline to sit next to him in the division. They are having a good old chat. Hey, it\u2019s one way to ensure you\u2019ll get your face on the TV. Better plan than this, anyway. Scott Morrison is VERY busy on his phone We are at the swapping sides of the never-ending division. 73 to 67, the government wins. We move to the final gag motion. Tony Burke moves to second Anthony Albanese\u2019s motion, but that too is gagged (which is normal). We divide again. The government has the numbers, so you know how it will end. Meanwhile, the question remains \u2013 was question time the first Scott Morrison was aware of the police investigation? Because it certainly seems that way. Meanwhile, in the Senate: Jacqui Lambie has asked the government about three Rwandan refugees brought to Australia who had been charged (but not convicted of) murder. \u201cWhat kind of deal is this? The US clearly didn\u2019t want them in their community \u2013 they held them for more than a decade in immigration detention. Do they pose a risk?\u201d Michaelia Cash chooses her words very carefully \u2013 noting Scott Morrison confirmed earlier this year that two of the Rwandans had come to Australia because they were found to be refugees, and were subject to strict security and character tests. She doesn\u2019t confirm the third Rwandan has come to Australia. Lambie suggested it looks like Australia is sending genuine refugees to the US and getting back accused criminals. Cash responds that the Rwandans did not come to Australia as part of a deal with the US. This is mid \u201cthis is a disgrace\u201d: Meanwhile: Christian Porter has moved to gag the debate \u2013 Labor is very upset about that, but it is pretty normal practice for a question time suspension. The motion: I seek leave to move the following motion \u2013 That the House: notes that: on the evening of 23 October 2019, the Guardian reported the Minister for Emissions Reduction had used incorrect figures from the City of Sydney Annual Report 2017-18 in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney; on 24 October 2019, the Minister told the House: \u201cThe document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney\u2019s website\u201d; despite the Minister\u2019s claim, all the evidence to date is that no such document ever existed on the website, the altered document has only ever been produced by the Minister\u2019s office and the doctored figures have only ever been used by the Minister in his official Ministerial correspondence; today, the NSW Police confirmed that it had launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate the matter; paragraph 7.1 of the Ministerial Standards make clear that it is for the Prime Minister to stand aside a Minister if that Minister becomes the subject of an official investigation of alleged illegal conduct; and therefore, calls on the Prime Minister to do what only he can under the Ministerial Standards and immediately stand the Minister for Emissions Reduction down. Christian Porter has denied leave to move the motion. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders over the Angus Taylor saga. This will fail. The government backbenchers \u2013 Julian Simmonds and Phil Thompson, I hear you \u2013 seem to think that mention of the Guardian is worth a guffaw or two. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt has asked the government why just $44m of Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility funding has been spent, and how many jobs have been created. The resources and northern Australia minister, Matt Canavan, replied that $1.5bn of investments will create 4,000 jobs, although he acknowledged it \u201cgot off to a slow start\u201d before changes to the investment mandate 16 months ago. \u201cThere is a reason the Australian people don\u2019t trust Labor with money. [The reason not all the money has been spent is that] money is provided as milestones are met,\u201d he said. Watt then asks about a $610m loan for a pumped hydro project in Queensland, which has been delayed. Canavan confirms that funding for the investment \u201cremains on the table\u201d. Watt heckles \u201cone day, maybe, eventually, down the track\u201d to reinforce his argument the jobs are not real (yet). Angus Taylor: And as I said yesterday, I made a statement on 25 October, which I tabled in the House yesterday. And as I said in that statement, this is an outrageous accusation against me by the Labor party. But to answer the question, Mr Speaker, to answer the question, of course I\u2019ll cooperate with any matter of this sort. Now, as I said in my statement, I reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the documents in question. And, Mr Speaker, I won\u2019t be lectured to by the party of Aldi bags and wine boxes full of cash, Mr Speaker. I\u2019m not going to be lectured to about integrity in the week that Labor is celebrating Eddie Obeid coming out on parole. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Why did the minister block access under freedom of information to more than 200 documents about his use of false figures in official ministerial correspondence? Is it because he knows that the documents reveal that he misled the House when he claimed he downloaded false figures from the City of Sydney website? And will he now assure the House that all 200 documents will be provided to the NSW police strike force Garrad? Christian Porter gets up immediately, while Scott Morrison speaks to Angus Taylor, who is displaying the body language of the school prefect sent to the principal\u2019s office. Porter: The first is with respect to the standing order, around inferences and imputations. The word \u201cblock\u201d contains a strong imputation. I might note if that word is to be included in the question, then the question needs to be directed to me as the minister in charge of freedom of information pursuant to standing order 98. I would be happy to take the question on notice to determine whether or not that inference and imputation is correct. But I very much doubt that it is. Burke: I would simply refer to your earlier rulings about the opportunity for the minister, if he disagrees to the words of the question, to make that clear in his answer. Tony Smith: I thank both the leader of the House and the manager of opposition business. As I\u2019ve made clear before, and for a number of years now, as have previous Speakers, particularly Speaker Andrew on this topic, that whilst the standing orders obviously were quoted accurately by the leader of the House, the practice has been lenient with respect to inferences and also on imputations. That\u2019s certainly been the case. And, indeed, Speaker Andrew pointed out that if they were strictly enforced, most questions would simply not be in order, or not be able to be asked. I\u2019ve always said I\u2019m happy to look at how we might change things in the future. But if we had a strict reading of questions, I would have a very strict reading of the standing orders around answers. And that can obviously change the nature of things. The other point Speaker Andrew made was, in ruling questions out of order on that basis, it does prevent the minister from having any opportunity, as the manager of opposition business says. So, on this occasion I\u2019m going to allow the question to proceed, and it\u2019s up to the minister how he deals with that. Mark Dreyfus has been told not to speak for an hour after being caught making a bunch of interjections. The chamber is taking bets on whether he\u2019ll make it. Scott Morrison continues: And to go to the question again, of course we will cooperate with any and all matters, Mr Speaker. I would just hope that the leader of the opposition, once we\u2019ve had the opportunity to review these matters fully, if it is indeed the case, Mr Speaker, that he has jumped the... They\u2019re getting a bit excited, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, once we have worked through this matter, I would just simply hope that the leader of the opposition will do the decent thing if, indeed, Mr Speaker, this is just one of the many occasions upon which the opposition have made these references and they\u2019ve ended up nowhere, that just once, maybe, Mr Speaker, they might want to \u2013 they might want to walk back from the breathless accusations that they\u2019ve made. Except, in this case, the police are the ones who have decided to investigate the referral \u2013 the police have announced the task force and the police have confirmed the investigation. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister, and I refer to his previous answers, where he said he will contact NSW police about Strike Force Garrad into the minister for emissions reduction and the doctored document about Clover Moore. Will the prime minister commit to fully cooperate with any request for information from the NSW police about this scandal? Morrison: Mr Speaker, like with all matters that are pursued by any law enforcement authorities, the commonwealth always cooperates fully with all of those matters, Mr Speaker, which you would expect us to do, and of course we would, Mr Speaker, of course we would. But, Mr Speaker, just because the opposition has referred matters to the NSW police, and just because the opposition have referred so many matters on so many members, Mr Speaker, and they\u2019ve all ended up going absolutely nowhere at the end of the day, forgive me, Mr Speaker, for not, for not leaping to the conclusions that the leader of the opposition had on this day, Mr Speaker. And breathlessly coming to the dispatch box and making the allegations that he is making against the member, and the minister, Mr Speaker. I understand, I understand why the leader of the opposition wants to distract attention today. It\u2019s not just because there are 65 representatives of the CFMEU before the courts across 28 separate matters, brought by the ABCC, Mr Speaker. Albanese has a point of order: I don\u2019t have the capacity to demand the NSW police launch a strike force into one of his ministers. Tony Smith tells the prime minister to stick to the topic. It is all very, very tense in here at the moment. Anthony Albanese asks Scott Morrison to withdraw the union thuggery line. Morrison does not. Someone in the government benches is heckling something about \u201cthe Guardian\u201d but it\u2019s not loud enough for me to hear to judge whether or not I should respect it as a burn. This is not a place for grown-ups. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: And I refer to his previous answers, where he said that he will contact the NSW police about Strike Force Garrad into the minister for emissions reduction. Will he assure the police and this House that the minister will do what he hasn\u2019t done to this parliament, and state exactly what the origins of this doctored document about the City of Sydney Mayor was \u2013 what the origins of it were? Morrison: I\u2019m going to leave the matters of pursuing these issues to the NSW police. And I will speak directly to the NSW police, Mr Speaker. And I will consider the information they provide me about this matter. And I will exercise my responsibilities under the standards once I have had the opportunity to have those discussions. What I won\u2019t do, Mr Speaker, is engage in the breathlessness of the leader of the opposition. I won\u2019t engage in that, Mr Speaker. I calmly consider my responsibilities. I soberly consider serious matters, Mr Speaker. I don\u2019t rush to the judgment of the leader of the opposition. And I know why this is happening today, Mr Speaker, because in the other place, in the other place, Mr Speaker, we are dealing with the ensuring integrity bill. Ah! That\u2019s the bill we\u2019re dealing with over there. And the militant unionism that this mob over here, Mr Speaker, want to engage in a protection racketed. Mr Speaker, I was wondering what the collective noun was for a group of militant unionists, and I think they\u2019re called a \u201cthuggery\u201d of unionists, Mr Speaker. And it\u2019s that thuggery that this leader of the opposition wants to protect by not supporting the government\u2019s bill to ensure that union thugs are held to account. Peter Dutton delivered his daily dose of JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU. Breaking: STILL AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE BUT OMG L A B O R I\u2019m not sure about the prime minister\u2019s assertion that he will speak to the NSW police about the investigation, because in my experience, police tend to keep that stuff under wraps, because you know \u2013 it is a police investigation. And I also don\u2019t understand the constant comparisons to Eddie Obeid, who actually went to jail. What is the relevance? Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister and it goes to events under a different Coalition prime minister, when Arthur Sinodinos had the integrity to stand aside from the ministry even though a police investigation was never commenced. Strike Force Garrad has now commenced. It\u2019s investigating the potential criminality of the minister for emissions reduction. Why is he still here on your frontbench, prime minister? Morrison: And I would refer the member to clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards, and that makes it very clear the process, Mr Speaker. And so I don\u2019t take the leader of the opposition\u2019s word for these matters, Mr Speaker. What I will do is what I said in response to the last question, and I will speak directly to the NSW police force and understand the nature of what these reports are... And then, Mr Speaker, I will make the necessary assessments of that case at that time. But, Mr Speaker, I\u2019m not going to take lectures from the leader of the opposition, who is a member of a NSW branch, Mr Speaker, who had NSW government ministers imprisoned, Mr Speaker. Imprisoned. I mean, Eddie\u2019s coming out in December, Mr Speaker, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference to the fact that he is a member of a rotten branch of the Labor party. I missed a question \u2013 this was the second question and answer exchange between Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison: Albanese: The ministerial code makes it the personal responsibility of the prime minister to decide whether to stand aside a minister in the exact circumstances that the minister for emissions reduction now finds himself in. Prime minister, the NSW police have established Strike Force Garrad into the potential criminal behaviour of a minister sitting on your frontbench right now. Prime minister, why is he still sitting there? When will you stand him aside? Scott Morrison: The matters that the opposition leader refers to have not been provided to me or been presented to me by the NSW police. I have not been advised of those developments, Mr Speaker. And so I think that deals with the issues that he has raised in relation to the code. But Mr Speaker, can I say, about the minister for energy and the minister for emissions reduction, I think I can understand why those opposite have taken such a keen interest in him, Mr Speaker, because he\u2019s responsible for policies that we are finally starting to see stabilise electricity prices in this country. And take the pressure off... and he\u2019s overseeing an emissions reduction program, Mr Speaker, which is taking action on climate change without taking the jobs of Australians, Mr Speaker. Which is the policies of those opposite. I am enabling the minister to continue to get around his job, his job, Mr Speaker, which is about getting power prices down, and which is about meeting our important commitments to take action on climate change. Now, Mr Speaker, they might not like the progress that he is making as a minister. They may feel uncomfortable, Mr Speaker, about the progress that this minister is making. But, Mr Speaker, at the end of the day, the Australian people know when they see their power bills start to stabilise, and when they see the fact that we are taking the action that we need to on climate change without taking their jobs, they will know that the Labor party, once again, is on another frolic, Mr Speaker, and we know where these frolics always end. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally has started the opposition question time attack with quotes from groups representing senior Australians, after the announcement of 10,000 more home care packages on Monday. Leading Age Services Australia described the $537m package as a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d that would disappoint the rest of the 120,000 people on the waitlist for a home care package. National Seniors Australia noted the 10,000 packages is \u201cless than the number of people who died last year waiting for a package\u201d (16,000). The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, boasted the package was good news, and resorted to his standard defence that the rollout can\u2019t be rushed, or else it will cause \u201cPink Batts\u201d style problems of encouraging shonky operators. That set off a slanging match between Penny Wong and Eric Abetz about which issue was more serious \u2013 elderly people dying waiting for home care, or installers of home insulation dying on the job. The first dixer also goes to Colbeck. Perhaps the government sees this as the way to give a vote of confidence to ministers in Labor\u2019s sights, or it wants to boast about the aged care package. In any event, the shouting continues. This is what happened just before Scott Morrison\u2019s last answer on Angus Taylor. He\u2019s just taking another document and is using the Josh Frydenberg dixer on how amazing the economy is to chat to advisers who sit in the wings. The phone is in hand and is getting a workout at the moment. In the meantime, Michael McCormack, displaying the leadership charisma of a bowl of soggy rice bubbles, attempted to deliver sentences featuring infrastructure. Angus Taylor has spent those questions grinning and tapping his feet. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: What actions is he taking, given the Strike Force Garrad investigation of the minister for emissions reduction, given his ministerial statement says, \u201cMinisters must accept it is for the PM to decide when and where a minister should stand aside if that minister becomes subject of an official investigation of alleged, illegal or improper conduct.\u201d 7.1, prime minister \u2013 what are you gonna do to implement it? Morrison: Now, this is a very recent matter, and I will be happy to take advice from the NSW police in relation to any matters that they\u2019re pursuing. I will be taking advice from the NSW police on any matter that they are currently looking at. And I will form a view, Mr Speaker, based on taking that advice in considering these issues. And, Mr Speaker, I would only note this \u2013 I would only note this, Mr Speaker. And the leader of the opposition may want to reflect on the standard that he is setting, Mr Speaker. And I would simply note this \u2013 if there are questions ever being raised in any such investigations by any member sitting on that bench, well, Mr Speaker, he has clearly set a standard. Question time is turning into the Angus Taylor hour. Understandably. After Anthony Albanese\u2019s line to caucus about the religious discrimination bill, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said this to Guardian Australia: Labor has been consulting widely across the entire community, holding dozens of meetings and roundtables with LGBTIQ groups, religious organisations and other community representatives. We will need to see the actual legislation the government proposes to bring before the parliament before we can decide whether any changes are needed. We agree with the core principle in the bills: that all Australians should be able to go about their lives free from discrimination. But any laws aimed at protecting Australians from discrimination because of their religious belief must not compromise anti-discrimination protections that already exist in the law for LGBTIQ and other Australians. The first question is on Angus Taylor following Anne Davies story: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Moments ago, it was revealed that the New South Wales Police have formed a Strike Force to investigate possible criminal behaviour connected to the Minister for Emissions Reduction. What action will the Prime Minister take? Morrison: I would simply note that any investigations that are undertaken are a matter for authorities in other places other than here. And I would refer the member to those authorities in terms of what they are doing...Mr Speaker, there seems to be a presumption made by those on the other side, which they have a habit of making, Mr Speaker, and they...If they wish to make smears against members, Mr Speaker, there are standing orders that prevent them from doing that. And I assume that\u2019s what they\u2019re seeking to do on this occasion. A delegation from the Northern Territory is in parliament to talk to crossbench senators and MPs about the government\u2019s proposal to expand the cashless debit card into the NT, replacing the Basics card. The delegation includes representatives from the Central Land Council, the NPY Women\u2019s Council and the Arnhem Land Progress Association. Senator Malarndirri McCarthy said the group was advocating against the expansion of the cashless debut card, legislation for which has been introduced into the House. Dr Josie Douglas from the Central Land Council said there had not been consultation with affected Indigenous communities. The delegation has met Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie, as well as government representatives and Indigenous Australians minister, Ken Wyatt. She said the group had been \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d the crossbench to vote against the bill and had been given a positive reception, particular from Lambie. \u201cWe are thankful that the senator has listened to us and appreciates and understands there has been a lack of consultation,\u201d Douglas said. Anne Davies has this update on the Angus Taylor document saga: New South Wales police have contacted the City of Sydney requesting information about downloads of its 2017-18 annual report after an altered version was relied upon by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, to lash the lord mayor, Clover Moore, over the council\u2019s carbon footprint and accuse her of hypocrisy. NSW police said the investigation was in the early stages and detectives from the state crime command\u2019s financial crimes squad had launched Strike Force Garrad to determine if any criminal offences had been committed. The doctored document, which contained grossly inflated travel figures for the 10 city councillors \u2013 it claimed they had spent $15m in a year \u2013 was quoted in a letter sent by Taylor to Moore on 29 September and provided at the same time to the Daily Telegraph, which used the figures in an article published the same day. In what Chris Kenny on Sky News has declared \u201cvery surprising comments\u201d from Pauline Hanson, Hanson has implied China is attempting to take over Australia by bringing people here because the number of Chinese immigrants are \u201cever increasing\u201d. \u201cYes, that is how I see the future, yes I do,\u201d said Hanson to him a little earlier. This has now made Barnaby Joyce the voice of reason. We have every right to discuss influence on our nation, ownership of our nation, absolutely that is our sovereign right as a sovereign nation, but when you bring in this sort of stuff you actually reduce the argument. Because people say, \u2018I told you, it\u2019s all bat poo crazy what you were saying\u2019 and this is an example why. If you actually go to the history of China, they are not an expansionist \u2013 there has never been, when they have been the pre-eminent power in the world \u2013 their desire to go live in other parts of the world, that is not how the middle kingdom works. But if you said there is an instance where the autocratic power of China tries to create supplicant states, well, yes, that is the case. You see that in places such as Cambodia and Laos. There is a desire of them to have an economic control which could be to the detriment of the people they have control over ... That is definitely something we should consider and definitely something we should make sure we protect our nation against. We are in the invidious position where we have to recognise they are our biggest trading partner ... and we have to recognise that China currently, the autocratic power that many people, Hong Kong for example, that many people don\u2019t support, but as they push forward, we are very reticent to push back because we are aware of the consequences. For any power, that works very well, they just say, \u2018We\u2019ll keep pushing forward and pushing forward,\u2019 but they are pushing forward on an economic basis and in some instances in a military basis. But they are not pushing forward by pushing their people into other countries. They haven\u2019t done that before in history; they haven\u2019t done that now. And it is a little perverse to suggest that for some unknown reason, people in China are going to stop wanting to live in China. It\u2019s where Chinese people prefer to live, generally \u2013 China.\u201d Pffft. Scientists. What do they know? Kevin Rudd, and his hand movements, were back in the building to launch Peter Hartcher\u2019s Quarterly Essay today (Sarah Martin was there and has given you a taste a few posts down) In October the federal court ruled in favour of the Australian Workers Union regarding the Registered Organisations Commission raids, finding the \u201csuspicion\u201d that the union had breached its rules was not a reasonable ground to conduct the raid. But the case continued in order to decide what flowed from that in terms of whether evidence collected would need to be returned. On Tuesday Justice Mordecai Bromberg gave orders including: THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 1. The decision of the first respondent by his delegate Mr Chris Enright made on 20 October 2017 to commence investigation INV2017/30 into the applicant (\u201cDecision\u201d), is invalid. THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 2. The decision of the first respondent, by his delegate Mr Chris Enright, is quashed. 3. The second respondent (by himself or by his servants or agents) return to the applicant the documents seized pursuant to the warrants issued by Magistrate Reynolds on 24 October 2017 pursuant to s 335L of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (Cth). So the AWU has had the documents returned. Kevin Rudd has launched Peter Hartcher\u2019s Quarterly Essay on Australia\u2019s relationship with China, talking about the \u201cdifficult\u201d relationship and making recommendations on what the government can do to improve ties. He would not comment on this week\u2019s explosive revelations in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age about an alleged infiltration plot of Australia\u2019s parliament, saying he was \u201cout of the loop\u201d, but said asylum should be considered for Liqiang Wang, the self-declared defecting Chinese spy who has sought protection from the Australian government. Rudd directed his barbs at the Liberal party\u2019s approach to China after the change in government in 2013, saying both Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull had \u201ccapitulated\u201d to the Chinese on a range of issues. He singled out Australia\u2019s retreat from the Pacific as having \u201copened the door\u201d to Chinese influence in the region, pointing to Australia\u2019s cuts to the aid budget and weak climate change policy. Australia had been \u201creckless\u201d by cutting the aid budget. He also criticised the Turnbull government for allowing the Chinese to lease the port of Darwin, saying the port was the point of entry for US marines and equipment. \u201cThe Americans were horrified, while the Chinese couldn\u2019t believe their luck.\u201d However, the former PM also warned against \u201cyellow peril\u201d, saying the crackdown on foreign influence could easily lead to a form of racial profiling and warned against a \u201cpopulist witch-hunt\u201d. The AWU has had a win in the federal court, with Justice Mordecai Bromberg ordering a return of the documents seized during the 2017 raid on the AWU offices. The ACTU has announced the news, linking it to the ensuring integrity bill: Justice Bromberg has ruled that the [Registered Organisations Commission] did not have grounds to order an AFP raid on the offices of the AWU and has ordered the return of the documents that were seized on behalf of the regulator in their first act after being established by the Liberal government in 2017. The decision comes as the Morrison government attempts to pass the ensuring integrity bill in the Senate which would give the ROC the extreme power to determine which unions are deregistered and which officials are disqualified under the dangerous and hypocritical new union-busting law. Under the EI bill the ROC would have the power to begin deregistration proceedings against a union which had made a handful of paperwork mistakes over a period of 10 years. Josh Frydenberg said the government would be introducing two more pieces of legislation related to the banking royal commission recommendations this week. Labor says only six of the 76 recommendations have so far been implemented, meaning the government is running out of time to meet its own timetable. Stephen Jones: After yet another banking scandal, it\u2019s clear the government haven\u2019t got the message. Only six of the 76 banking royal commission recommendations have been implemented. It has been 299 days since the government received the royal commission recommendations. I think it\u2019s fair for the public to be asking what the government has been doing. The government talks a big game on banks, but we all know that their heart isn\u2019t really in it. The Nationals water minister, David Littleproud, is calling for \u201ccalm, leadership and common sense\u201d in the NSW water debate and I cannot stop laughing at the irony. Littleproud says it\u2019s important the New South Wales government understands the full ramifications of withdrawing from the Murray-Darling basin plan. \u201cThe federal government would be potentially forced by NSW to recover water by buybacks, not the $1bn of water infrastructure we are prepared to deliver,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t support buybacks. They destroy communities and I don\u2019t want to be forced by law to undertake them if NSW pulls out. \u201cThat would be the outcome of leaving the plan. \u201cWe want to spend that money on water infrastructure to help stimulate NSW basin economies and create jobs. \u201cThe facts are clear: pulling out of the plan would not deliver one drop of water to a NSW farmer. \u201cRipping up the plan will only result in a worse one. \u201cThis is a time to show leadership and work together to get the best outcome in these difficult times.\u201d Parliament\u2019s human rights committee is unusually torn, AAP reports. Labor and the Greens are arguing against the government to seek an urgent change to laws aimed at reducing restraints in aged care. The deputy chair of the traditionally bipartisan committee, Labor MP Graham Perrett, says the legislation creates confusion that could lead to physical and chemical restraints being used without consent. \u201cThe dissenting report recommends that ... a new instrument be urgently reintroduced that ensures there is informed consent for the use of chemical restraints, a reduction in the use of restraints, and oversight and effective reporting on the use of restraints,\u201d he told parliament. Andrew Leigh had a chat to Adelaide radio 5AA this morning, which included this exchange: AL: There is some great economic research that suggests that much of the pleasure of holidays comes not from having them, but from anticipating them. So our family always tries to plan our holidays as far in advance as we can, so we can have that anticipation effect. Question: But Andrew, isn\u2019t that about everything in life? Isn\u2019t the anticipation, the pre-savouring of something, far more interesting than the actual meal? AL: Everything except chocolate, sex and television, I entirely agree. Question: [laughter] Chocolate, sex and television. AL: They\u2019re the three that I think don\u2019t let you down in the enjoyment. Question: Now is this going to be the title of the next book? AL: It could be, couldn\u2019t it? Television?! \u201cI\u2019d like to see the banks reined in a lot more ... I am not saying where I stand on the integrity bill. I still need to have more discussions with the unions,\u201d Pauline Hanson says. Hanson says she was busy at the weekend so has only just had a chance to look over the amendments Christian Porter released on the bill late on Friday. \u201cI will not be rushed on this,\u201d she says. Pauline Hanson is on Sky, saying she believes there is \u201ca place for unions in Australia, by all means\u201d but by the sound of things, she is close to agreeing to the bill. There are whispers around that the government will seek to reorder business in the Senate this afternoon to bring on the ensuring integrity debate \u2013 but not the vote. We\u2019ll keep an eye on that. Josh Frydenberg: I\u2019ve been consistent and clear. Decisions about who are on boards are matters for shareholders. Decisions about who are on senior management teams are decisions for boards. But these alleged breaches are of the most serious nature. And there needed to be accountability. You heard very strong language from our prime minister, from myself, and from other ministers, about the seriousness of these issues and the need for accountability at the bank. I also want to point out that our financial services sector contributes about 10% of GDP, employs more than 400,000 Australians. It\u2019s a vitally important sector to our economy. And we need to continue to ensure that they uphold the highest standards of professionalism, but also that we have strong financial institutions. Because it\u2019s our banks that ensure the flow of credit to households for their mortgages and for other borrowings and to businesses as they continue to innovate, to expand, and grow. So it\u2019s very important that we have a financial services sector that only upholds the highest standards of professionalism, that that continues to prosper, and to support the Australian economy. The Greens also want to cap banking executive pay. That comes after the news Brian Hartzer will get a year\u2019s payout \u2013 just over $2.6m. Just picking up from Paul Karp\u2019s tweet a bit earlier about the Labor caucus, the main development was the opposition bracing for the religious freedom debate. In his leader\u2019s report, Anthony Albanese told the troops that Labor ended the year with \u201ca clear strategic plan\u201d. He said the campaign review had been handed down, and that drew a line over looking at the past. He said the next of his vision statements would be delivered on 7 December. Albanese has done two of these thus far, the first on jobs and the second on the economy. The next one will be on the theme of democracy. Labor has begun the process of selecting members of the national policy forum ahead of the party\u2019s national conference, which will be held in Canberra at the end of next year. There was a briefing for caucus members about the constitutional recognition of Indigenous people and the voice to parliament. Albanese also said it was \u201cbeyond belief\u201d that Angus Taylor remained a minister of the crown after the botched criticism of the Sydney lord mayor, and he signalled Labor would continue to pursue Taylor. Asked if he, or the government put pressure on Brian Hartzer to resign, Josh Frydenberg says: I\u2019ve had conversations with Westpac and those discussions were constructive. I made clear the seriousness of those issues, but also the bank itself and the board itself has been having many meetings \u2013 including with its own shareholders \u2013 and in our conversation this morning with the chairman he told me, before the public announcement, of what was to take place. Josh Frydenberg says more legislation inspired from the banking royal commission recommendations will be coming this week, as he officially responds to the Westpac news: A lack of appropriate oversight by the board, and a systemic failure by the bank. As you\u2019re aware, both Apra and Asic \u2013 in addition to Austrac \u2013 are conducting their own inquiries. And Apra is doing that under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime at that the coalition introduced and that took effect in 2018. Together with the Bear \u2013 the Banking Executive Accountability Regime \u2013 we\u2019ve also increased both the civil and criminal penalties for misconduct in the financial sector. We\u2019ve boosted the resources of our regulators. We\u2019re putting in place a criminal division of the federal court. And we\u2019re taking action on all 76 recommendations of the royal commission. And this week, I\u2019ll be introducing two pieces of legislation which will implement more of those royal commission recommendations. For some reason, I am reminded of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s line of: I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder \u2013 louder \u2013 louder! In other news, the parliament bells are ringing. This is interesting as well Looks like the official government response on the Westpac news is coming \u2013 Josh Frydenberg has called a press conference for 11.50am in the Senate Courtyard-Mural Hall- Senate Courtyard* That is 10 minutes before the parliament sits, so it limits the questioning time as well. *Seems like there has been some moving around of the press conference at the last minute, but they\u2019ve decided on the Senate courtyard From AAP: An unlikely alliance of federal politicians have joined forces to demand WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange be brought back to Australia. The group, which includes Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie and Queensland conservative George Christensen, are concerned about Assange\u2019s health and potential extradition from the UK to America. The pair described his treatment as a direct attack on journalists. \u201cThe group is unanimously and strongly of the view that the US extradition request of Mr Assange be rescinded and that he be allowed to return to Australia,\u201d Wilkie said on Tuesday. The politicians want to meet with the US ambassador and UK high commissioner to Australia to discuss Assange\u2019s case. The parliament will begin sitting at midday. Woo. Hoo. Penny Wong was also doorstopped about the China situation this morning. Here is some of what she had to say in the hallway: Question: Should there be vetting of candidates before the election? And do you think Gladys Liu owes the parliament an explanation? PW: Well in relation to the second part, Gladys Liu has refused to give a statement to the parliament. She has been protected from doing so by Mr Morrison. I do believe that in circumstances where discrepancies have been raised on the public record, where issues have been raised, parliamentarians should make a statement to the parliament. Mr Morrison has never explained why he refuses to do so. Q: And in terms of potential vetting of candidates? PW: Look, I think all political parties, particularly parties of government, do have to ensure that our processes are robust and that Australian sovereignty is safeguarded. You might recall that in the last parliament, Labor sought for a number of years \u2013 and the government finally reluctantly agreed \u2013 to the banning of foreign donations. Rex Patrick has been pushing for more security vetting of candidates and MPs, and wants MPs to have security checks done, similar to what staffers and public servants undergo, with the results presented to the prime minister of the day, who can then determine the response (what, if any committees they would be eligible to sit on, cabinet positions, access etc). So far, it has not received a lot of support from the major parties. Chris Bowen was also asked about the government\u2019s assertion that it was taking its time responding to the aged care royal commission interim report, because it did not want another \u201cpink batts\u201d situation. This was Scott Morrison yesterday: Now, I\u2019m not going to rush that and see things put into legislation that could have been addressed through the consultation period that would otherwise have avoided some unintended consequence. I\u2019m going to make sure we give that time to work with the sector to make sure that these legislative responses are correct. I don\u2019t understand Labor\u2019s position. What are they expecting, that we should have some rushed and harried legislation? That\u2019s how you end up with pink batts fiascos and overpriced school halls, when you don\u2019t take care on making responses to these things. And we are taking care. This is a very, very significant priority of the government, to get this right. Just as all the other matters are, and we will continue to just work through that process of delivering on our agenda. Bowen: What an insult what a disgusting insult to Australians on the waiting list for in-home care packages or on the waiting list for aged care. I mean, this is a government who is funding 10,000 extra places when the waiting list is over 100,000, with 16,000 Australians dying on the waiting list last year, and to justify the paltry rollout of care places, he compares it to pink batts. That is a disgusting insult and he should withdraw and apologise today. Sarah Hanson-Young has written about her defamation court victory against David Leyonhjelm in the Guardian today: Chris Bowen is responding to this story: (As reported by Melissa Davey) Private health insurance will continue its slow death spiral unless unnecessary private hospital costs and exorbitant specialist bills are reined in, a Grattan Institute report has found. The report, written by health economists Stephen Duckett and Kristina Nemet, said a small minority of greedy specialist doctors billed their patients at more than twice the official Medicare benefit schedule fee. Patients were not being told about the fees in advance. \u201cOnly about 7% of all in-hospital medical services are billed at this rate, yet these bills account for almost 90% of all out-of-pocket medical costs for private hospital patients,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf these high-charging specialists only billed patients 50% more than the official Medicare benefits schedule fee then patients would save $350m each year.\u201d Bowen: Greg Hunt is fiddling while private health insurance burns and across Australia people know it is broken and not working for them and they are voting with their feet. Greg Hunt has been warned and warned and warned and he\u2019s refused to act and he\u2019s told us he\u2019s delivered the biggest reforms in history. Newsflash, Greg, all of Australia knows they haven\u2019t worked and today we have another report pointing out that private health insurance needs big reform. What is minister Hunt\u2019s answer? To try to distract with a thought bubble. A thought bubble which I put to you has not been to the cabinet of Australia. Release your policy, Greg, show us the modelling and tell us the details about how your idea will fix private health insurance and how it will make it more valuable for Australians. Extending private health insurance to some procedures currently done in hospital and could be done at home and elsewhere is a worthy enough idea but it is not the holistic reform that private health insurance needs. Private health insurance needs a big fix, not fiddling. The Greens have once again picked up their fight against political donations: \u201cThe fact is that if we banned political donations and introduced election spending caps, then no foreign entity or vested interest would be able to buy their way into parliament,\u201d Richard Di Natale said. \u201cThe additional safeguards against foreign interference supported by both major parties will fail unless real action is also taken on donations reform,\u201d Larissa Waters said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Labor and the Coalition to join the Greens in calling for banning political donations from all big for-profit corporates and foreign entities so no one \u2013 not Clive Palmer and no foreign government \u2013 has more influence on Australia\u2019s democracy than our citizens do.\u201d Meanwhile, Katharine Murphy has the latest Guardian Essential poll (caveats on polls implied). An increasing proportion of voters worry Australia is not doing enough to reduce the risks of climate change, and more people see a direct link between warming and bushfires, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Ominously for the Morrison government, which bristles at regular public criticism it is not doing enough to reduce the risks of the climate crisis, 60% of the sample of 1,083 voters believes Australia should be doing more. This is up from 51% in March. Just under half the sample, 43%, believes it is likely bushfires are linked to climate change, and argues it is entirely appropriate to discuss that link during an emergency of the scale we\u2019ve seen around Australia over the past fortnight. When this question was last put to survey respondents in 2013, only 27% of the sample had this view. Medevac is still listed for debate tomorrow. Peter Dutton is still working on negotiating with Jacqui Lambie for her support. Kristina Keneally is working to debunk some of Dutton\u2019s public claims on medevac: If you listen to Mr Dutton, you would believe that he is somehow powerless when it comes to medevac. Nothing could be further from the truth. And the Independent Health Advice Panel reports that are tabled in the Senate show that under the medevac laws the minister retains the power to determine who comes into the country when it comes to security grounds \u2013 that is un-appealable and unquestionable. Those reports also show that when the minister or doctors the minister appoints, approve a transfer on medical grounds, people are able to get the healthcare they need. Those reports also show that when the minister refuses a determination on medical grounds \u2013 a recommendation on medical grounds \u2013 that has been more often than not upheld by the doctors the minister has appointed. In every step of the way the minister or doctors appointed by the minister make decisions about who needs a medical transfer. And around and around we go. There have been some reports about some of the charges some of the medevac transfers are facing. It is worth mentioning that people transferred under medevac remain in detention and under guard. And also, as you may have noticed, we still treat people who have been convicted of some pretty heinous crimes. Ivan Milat, for instance, received the necessary treatment for his cancer in the last months of his life. The argument that we should not give the necessary treatments independent doctors have decided are necessary because of either charges (and you know, innocent before being proven guilty and all that) or crimes, is a very slippery slope for a democratic and compassionate society to start wandering down. The government is still attempting to extend the cashless debit card \u2013 which would include installing it across the Northern Territory. Labor\u2019s NT senator Malarndirri McCarthy has been fighting against it. She had a chat to her local ABC this morning, ahead of when the bill is slated for debate: MM: My hope is that if there is still concern amongst the crossbenchers, if they haven\u2019t made a decision then that may mean the government isn\u2019t confident enough to bring it into the House. But that\u2019s a hopeful scenario obviously that I\u2019m hoping for and the delegation from Central Australia is hoping for but it\u2019s quite likely that it possibly still will go through the House. Question: Can you tell us who\u2019s been there from central Australia? MM: Yes of course. We have here in Canberra walking the halls is the Central Land Council representatives, also the NPY Women\u2019s [Council] and also the Arnhem Land Progress Association from Arnhem Land who\u2019ve come down as well so there\u2019s quite a large delegation who have come down in the hope that they can stop the cashless debit card being passed. Q: Jacqui Lambie is seen as being the key vote in the Senate. Have you got any idea of which way she is leaning at the moment? MM: Look I\u2019ve been working very hard with the crossbenchers and certainly with senator Lambie. What I have asked is for time to take her to the Northern Territory, to Central Australia and to Arnhem Land to actually hear from people herself. If she had that opportunity, Stuart, I do believe that she would have a better understanding of the concerns that people have and the fact that they don\u2019t want it in the Northern Territory. Kevin Rudd is in Canberra today \u2013 he will be launching Peter Hartcher\u2019s quarterly essay (on China) at midday Tis the season His face sums up how I feel seeing a Queenslander wear blue for a footy match And here is another indication of where question time is headed: A group of north Queensland dairy farmers are on their way to Canberra to express their frustrations at what is happening within their industry. That\u2019s at the same time the Nationals are trying to get ahead of Pauline Hanson, who may have come late to the issues, but certainly has been running full steam ahead since becoming aware of it. And Joel Fitzgibbon from Labor is very happy to poke that particular wound. This was him on Sky News this morning: David Littleproud, the drought minister, some time ago said he fixed the supermarket [milk price] problem. He said he thumped his chest, waved his fists at them, and demanded they put their milk prices up. Well, we know that solution lasted about five minutes. They are still fiddling with this dairy code of conduct. It\u2019s now more than 20 months since the ACCC recommended we have a mandatory code of conduct for the dairy industry. The Labor party has been supporting one for a number of years, so there has been no interference from the opposition party. There is no excuse, and yet they\u2019re still arguing within the National party and the Liberal parties about what this diary code of conduct should look like. This is after, of course, introducing a sugar code, a code of conduct for the sugar industry literally overnight a number of years ago when Scott Morrison was the treasurer.\u201d That came after Queensland LNP senator, Susan McDonald, told ABC radio that consumers should be telling supermarkets to raise the price of milk in order to pay farmers more. Fitzgibbon says it is not up to consumers to fix the problem. Stuart Robert is the latest MP to decide Twitter streams just really need more emojis: He has a long way to go to catch up to Kimberley Kitching though. The \u201ckeep medevac\u201d advocacy is still going strong. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is the latest to urge senators (meaning Jacqui Lambie) to stay the course: GP and chair of the RACGP Refugee Health Network Dr Kate Walker said that repealing the legislation would be a huge mistake. Asylum seekers and refugees must be able to receive a proper level of healthcare as determined by qualified medical professionals. What this legislation does is give doctors, not administrators, greater power in determining whether people on Manus Island or Nauru require transfer to Australia for medical treatment. At least 200 patients have been transferred for urgent medical care using the medevac legislation. That is how it should be \u2013 doctors making a judgment on what type of care is needed. It is party room time, so the building has gone quiet. We\u2019ll bring you the updates from that very soon Jim Chalmers also gave us an idea of where Labor\u2019s attacks will be going today: My criticism of the government when it comes to the banking royal commission is that they talked a big game before the election when they knew people wanted to hear tough talk on the banks and then afterwards they dragged their feet. Now they\u2019ve got a roadmap for implementing the banking royal commission\u2019s recommendations that needs to be adhered to. They\u2019ve got the so-called BEAR legislation that they passed a couple of years ago. They should be looking for every avenue and every opportunity to hold the banks accountable and to clean up the banks so that Australians can have confidence in the system again. Labor, today through Penny Wong, is continuing to raise the issue of Gladys Liu never having provided a statement to parliament about her associations with groups linked to the Chinese Communist party. It is almost impossible to separate Chinese businesses from the Chinese Communist party. And there is no suggestion Liu has any issues herself. But Labor says she should have provided a statement to the parliament to put any lingering concerns to bed. I think from my perspective, it\u2019s less it\u2019s not of ethnicity, it\u2019s an issue of transparency,\u201d Wong told RN. And I have been critical of of Ms Liu, the member for Chisholm, and I was critical because, her story had discrepancies and there was a failure of disclosure in relation to substantial donations. This is not about ethnicity, this is about making sure we have appropriate transparency. And it is, I think, a matter of record and a matter of regret that this government has been \u2013 dragged its feet when it comes to a whole range of transparency issues around foreign donations, which at their heart are about protecting the integrity of Australia\u2019s democratic system. The medevac repeal bill is still ticking away in the background. It is meant to come up for debate on Wednesday, but it is a moving feast at this stage. Jacqui Lambie will decide the bill\u2019s fate. There is some suggestion floating around that Lambie may seek to amend the bill to give the minister more powers. Critics say if that happens, the whole point of medevac \u2013 to give doctors more power to make independent medical decisions \u2013 will be moot. Negotiations continue. I think Greg Hunt really wants you to know Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg were VERY CLEAR about what they wanted to happen in terms of Westpac. Here he is after his Sky interview, where he said much the same thing: I think is appropriate. I think it is necessary and it follows the strongest, clearest comments from the prime minister and treasurer about community and government expectations in the face of a serious and profound breaches.\u201d In case you missed it yesterday, Paul Karp had a story on the latest with FOIs surrounding Angus Taylor: The environment department has blocked access to two emails about Angus Taylor\u2019s use of incorrect figures to attack the City of Sydney\u2019s travel spending, claiming they are exempt from freedom of information because they relate to an unspecified \u201congoing process\u201d. In response to Labor\u2019s FOI request, the department has refused access to two emails sent at 8.52am on 25 October \u2013 the day after Guardian Australia revealed the controversy \u2013 and a second email chain at 3.23pm on the same day. Penny Wong was on RN this morning talking about China. Sorry for the delay \u2013 the Westpac news interrupted my transcription time, but here is some of the interview: You know, China is continuing to develop and change politically and we need to have a very clear understanding of that. I mean, I think the China relationship should be above domestic partisan politics. And I\u2019d encourage the prime minister, Mr Morrison and the foreign minister, Senator Payne to make it so. Wong agreed that this was a \u201ctricky time\u201d for Australia: I again, go back to where I started. This is a complex, consequential relationship. It\u2019s a relationship that, you know, we need to continue to engage \u2013 but we have to recognise that engagement does entail us ensuring we safeguard our sovereignty in our democracy. And that I think demands a discussion, and a policy framework that is led by the government, not \u2013 with all due respect to the media who are doing, you know their job in a in a making sure there is transparency \u2013 this should be led by the government and they should engage the parliament and the opposition. This is good news \u2013 from Ken Wyatt and Paul Fletcher: The Morrison Government welcomes the return of the remains of 45 Australian Indigenous ancestors from Germany to communities in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. A ceremony will be held this week at the Grassi Museum in Leipzig, with five community members attending to receive their ancestors and accompany them home. Thirty-five ancestral remains will be returned to the Gunaikurnai people in Victoria, six ancestors to the Menang people in Western Australia; and one old person to the Ngarrindjeri people in South Australia. Three ancestral remains will return to Australia under the stewardship of the Commonwealth Government and be placed into temporary care while further research and consultation is undertaken to determine their community of origin. Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher said the repatriation brings the total number of Australian Indigenous ancestors repatriated to Australia from Germany through the Indigenous Repatriation Program to 150, and is the second repatriation from Germany this year. Jim Chalmers stopped by doors to give Labor\u2019s response to the Westpac news: Labor welcomes the resignation of Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer. The behaviour at Westpac under Brian Hartzer\u2019s leadership was nothing short of disgraceful. Brian Hartzer had no option but to resign after the extremely serious and appalling revelations of what has gone on in Westpac over a period of some years. After 23m breaches of the counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws, Brian Hartzer had no option. We welcome the decision that he\u2019s taken today to step down. There was no other alternative for Brian Hartzer but to step down. This decision today doesn\u2019t, of itself, fix all of the issues which have emerged in recent weeks about the behaviour of Westpac over a period of some years. There\u2019s a legal process. I think Australians will be looking for all kinds of accountability when it comes to the behaviour of Westpac. They will welcome Brian Hartzer\u2019s resignation, but they will be looking for every avenue for the bank to be made accountable for what are appalling, astounding and disgraceful actions, which have been uncovered. In a week when the Morrison government\u2019s highest priority is to pick on workers and unions, it beggars belief that for so long now the Morrison government has gone soft on the banks, resisted a banking royal commission, voted against it 26 times, dragged their feet on the recommendations of the banking royal commission. We need to make sure that the Australian people can have confidence in their banks and in their financial system. It\u2019s a key part of the economy. Actions like that, which has been uncovered at Westpac, only damage confidence in the banking system. We need to make sure that people can feel, with some confidence, that the banking system works for them and not against them. \u201cYou could not have heard stronger, clearer positions set out by the prime minister in response to what were frankly, quite shocking allegations,\u201d Greg Hunt tells Sky in response to the Brian Hartzer news. Westpac made the announcement in a statement to the ASX. You can find that, here. Among the titbits \u2013 Brian Hartzer leaves with a year\u2019s pay, $2.686m \u2013 but he loses out on some bonuses. Peter King becomes acting CEO, with a $2.1m pay packet. The Westpac statement announcing Brian Hartzer\u2019s departure includes this line, just in case anyone was unclear about the motivations: As was appropriate, we sought feedback from all of our stakeholders, including shareholders, and having done so it became clear that board and management changes were in the best interests of the bank. Wow, a minute really is a long time in news these days. Just breaking \u2013 Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer will step down from the bank on 2 December, AAP reports. We\u2019ll have more on that very soon. On the Westpac front, the Australian had quite the story this morning, with insights from a closed-door meeting with the Westpac boss, Brian Hartzer. From the report: Mr Hartzer, who is fighting to remain in Westpac\u2019s top job, tried to assure the bank\u2019s most senior leaders that the scandal \u201cwas not playing out as a high street issue\u201d. \u201cWe all read the Fin [The Australian Financial Review] and The Australian, and we all read that and think the world is ending,\u201d he said, according to the two people. \u201cBut actually for people in mainstream Australia going about their daily lives, this is not a major issue so we don\u2019t need to overcook this.\u201d You can find the whole report, here. The board, and Hartzer, are trying to find a way to hold on to their jobs in the wake of the financial intelligence agency, Austrac, announcing it had launched proceedings against Australia\u2019s oldest bank for 23m failures to uphold its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism responsibilities. Among the alleged failures were transactions being used to facilitate child exploitation. Josh Frydenberg announced, since confirmed by the banking regulator itself, that Apra was looking at ways it could disqualify the board. All eyes will be on what shareholders do when the bank holds its annual general meeting on 12 December. Meanwhile, the bank has announced it has cancelled its Christmas party and that some bonuses (not all) will be scrapped or partly scrapped. \u201cYeah, nah, that\u2019s not it\u201d has never seemed more relevant. We enter the seventh last sitting day for the year at a slightly calmer pace than yesterday. The big story from yesterday \u2013 allegations Beijing attempted to infiltrate our parliament \u2013 is still ticking over. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, spoke of the issue during his daily news briefing yesterday, telling journalists that some of Australia\u2019s media and politicians had \u201cbecome seized with imaginary fears\u201d about China\u2019s influence. \u201cThey constantly fabricate cases of so-called Chinese spies infiltrating Australia ... However bizarre the story, lies are still lies in the end, whatever new guise they wear.\u201d In the meantime, we are watching our politicians try to balance Australia\u2019s trade relationship with China \u2013 which accounts for about a third of our export revenue \u2013 and cracking down on alleged attempts to influence our political system. That will continue to unfold today. But domestically, we have other worries. Among them is a growing concern about the climate. The 2019 Scanlon Foundation\u2019s Mapping Social Cohesion report found we have bumped up climate change and its effects on our list of nightly worries. As David Marr reports: This is the verdict of the Scanlon Foundation\u2019s 2019 Mapping Social Cohesion report, published on Tuesday. The mission of the foundation for the past decade or so has been to measure how this migrant nation hangs together. In that time an extraordinary 50,000 of us have been polled to track the hopes and fears that sweep Australia \u2013 and not just about immigration. The author of the reports, Prof Andrew Markus of Monash University, finds most Australians now share \u201can underlying concern about the government not properly managing the situation \u2013 the impact on overcrowding, house prices, environment\u201d. We\u2019ve already seen that play out in recent weeks, with the debate over whether or not a bushfire emergency was the right time to talk about cause and effect. Overwhelmingly, our leaders said it wasn\u2019t (and yes, despite the term \u201cleader\u201d, I include Michael McCormack in this) but it turns out, they probably got that wrong. We\u2019ve seen Scott Morrison go quiet and then come back talking about how his government acknowledges climate change, and has policies in place to deal with it. But it\u2019s getting harder to spin such a flimsy message, and summer hasn\u2019t properly begun as yet. We\u2019ll have that as well, plus party room meetings, plus Westpac\u2019s ongoing fallout and whatever news happens on medevac and ensuring integrity. Mike Bowers is here, as is Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. I\u2019ve had two coffees and am headed for a third. So let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>This is quite a long book in praise of brevity. Lydia Davis, who has emerged relatively late in life to take a seat at the top table of American letters, is the peerless exponent of what has come to be known as \u201cflash fiction\u201d. She writes short stories or texts of unsettling wit and invention \u2013 or sudden piercing melancholy \u2013 that rarely last more than a page or three and often consist of only a few sentences adrift in white space.</p> <p>For many years, because of her experiments with form, Davis was considered a literary anomaly \u2013 the micro-story writer who also translated Proust \u2013 but that changed when a fat volume of her collected stories was published in 2009 and her serial instances of brilliant minimalism could be viewed as the stem cells of a larger body of work. Since then she has enjoyed a wide readership and acclaim, including winning the international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/22/man-booker-international-prize-lydia-davis\" title=\"\">Man Booker prize in 2013</a>, when, happily, the chair of the judges was Christopher Ricks, a critic excitedly alive to writing at the scale of syllable and caesura.</p> <p>These essays, written over several decades, illuminate Davis\u2019s own processes while attending to the work of writers and artists she admires. She is in some ways the most honestly solipsistic of writers \u2013 her narrators are rarely set in the context of society or even company; their voices, conscious of written language, emerge with minimal framing. Here, for example is her story A Double Negative in its entirety:</p> <p><em>At a certain point in her life, she realizes it is not so much that she wants to have a child as that she does not want not to have a child, or not to have had a child.</em></p> <p>And here is They Take Turns Using a Word They Like:</p> <p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d says one woman.</em><br><em>\u201cIt is extraordinary,\u201d says the other.</em></p> <p>Her essays about experimenting with genre experiment with genre. The tone of this volume is set by four lectures given at New York University on \u201cForms and Influences\u201d. They establish a loose-limbed memoir of Davis\u2019s evolution as a writer. She was fated to her vocation \u2013 both her parents had published short stories in the <em>New Yorker</em> \u2013 but within those confines she determined to find her own way. Samuel Beckett was her first disrupter. She was drawn to Beckett\u2019s slow torturing of grammar, the way his comedy loosened the logic and rhythm of sentences until words became unmoored. And then to Kafka. And then to a range of eccentric stylists and poets who included a writer called \u201cSparrow\u201d, who wrote \u201cTranslations from the <em>New Yorker</em>\u201d, whittling away at the more garrulous and portentous of the contributions to the magazine, like this version of a John Updike sonnet:</p> <p><em>The problem with dying</em><br><em>is you can\u2019t be funny anymore,</em><br><em>or charming</em></p> <p>This led Davis to the question that her work implies: \u201cIf you write it so differently, are you, in fact, saying the same thing?\u201d Or how much can you lose before you lose everything?</p> <p>The essays that follow are, in essence, 30 ways of looking at that question.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s music industry risks falling behind its European competitors unless action is taken to support smaller venues and nurture the talent developing at grassroots level, according to Ben Lovett of Mumford &amp; Sons.</p> <p>Lovett, who is opening a new mid-sized venue in King\u2019s Cross, central London, next February, said there were too few spaces where bands could develop, and that could lead to a slowdown in British talent compared to other European nations.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhen you go to Sweden it\u2019s not like those artists are doing it without the support of public and private investment. The infrastructure is really strong. If we do all those things we could have many more artists like Skepta and Stormzy.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to bridge the gap between being massive and people having no idea who you are. That\u2019s why grassroots venues are so important.\u201d</p> <p>Lovett said London would not feature in his top 10 destinations for music venues in the world because there was a dearth of beloved venues. \u201cI can pretty much name all of them in the UK and that shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crisis like five years ago, but we\u2019re a long way off from great new venues opening and not having enough bands to fill the stage. We have some catching up to do.\u201d</p> <p>In February 2018, the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/16/uks-first-live-music-census-finds-small-venues-struggling\">first ever music venue census</a> found that a third of Britain\u2019s small venues outside London were struggling, with respondents saying property development and increased business rates were to blame for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/20/save-londons-live-music-venues-city-wide-campaign-launched\">the squeeze</a>.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s music industry risks falling behind its European competitors unless action is taken to support smaller venues and nurture the talent developing at grassroots level, according to Ben Lovett of Mumford &amp; Sons. Lovett, who is opening a new mid-sized venue in King\u2019s Cross, central London, next February, said there were too few spaces where bands could develop, and that could lead to a slowdown in British talent compared to other European nations. He said: \u201cWhen you go to Sweden it\u2019s not like those artists are doing it without the support of public and private investment. The infrastructure is really strong. If we do all those things we could have many more artists like Skepta and Stormzy. \u201cYou need to bridge the gap between being massive and people having no idea who you are. That\u2019s why grassroots venues are so important.\u201d Lovett said London would not feature in his top 10 destinations for music venues in the world because there was a dearth of beloved venues. \u201cI can pretty much name all of them in the UK and that shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crisis like five years ago, but we\u2019re a long way off from great new venues opening and not having enough bands to fill the stage. We have some catching up to do.\u201d In February 2018, the UK\u2019s first ever music venue census found that a third of Britain\u2019s small venues outside London were struggling, with respondents saying property development and increased business rates were to blame for the squeeze. There was positive news, with the census finding that 78% of music fans had visited small music venues, while 47% of respondents were spending more than \u00a320 a month on concerts or festival tickets, and a quarter said they spent the same amount on recorded music. Data released by the mayor of London\u2019s office in July suggested that over the last three years the trend for venue closures in the capital had been halted. The research found that the trend for closures \u2013 between 2007 and 2016 more than a third of grassroots venues shut down \u2013 had been reversed, with a 6% increase since 2016. Lovett said that despite the improvement, the UK was still lagging behind countries including the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia and Canada in terms of providing the venues needed for developing groups and artists to grow. \u201cLots of people are on it, and there\u2019s been a spike in venues opening. But it\u2019s a collective fight to preserve a culture in its truest form,\u201d added Lovett. The Music Venues Trust (MVT) recently published its manifesto for grassroots music venues, which made five recommendations: reform business rates, create additional funding opportunities for grassroots venues, establish culture and heritage tax relief and expand the remit of research and development tax relief to include development of new talent, and give venues the same protections as theatres. A spokesperson for the Music Venues Trust said the solutions to the problem of closures of grassroots venues were \u201cwidely known, costed, and deliverable\u201d. The spokesperson added: \u201cWe really hope the next government will act on them. We don\u2019t need any more studies, research or commissions to examine how to protect, secure and improve our grassroots music venue network.\u201d Lovett said his musical taste was determined by going to London venues such as the Borderline, Metro and the Astoria, which closed in 2009; the demise of one of the capital\u2019s best-known venues was seen as a watershed moment. \u201cThey were really great venues that inspired me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that any more, and I wanted to make something that if you were 18 and in London wanting to have a real time, with real experiences, that\u2019s what I want it to feel like.\u201d Lovett already runs Omeara, a 350-capacity space in London Bridge that opened in 2016.

First, reduce unbridled ministerial powers \u2013 now at more than 2,000 (epitomising the most centralised, authoritarian education system in the developed world) where once there were just three. Do this by establishing a statutory standing national educational advisory council of teachers, parents, employers, universities, faith groups, unions, inspectors, and local government, whose advice ministers would be required publicly to seek before making decisions.</p> <p>Second, reinvigorate local government through 10 democratic regional authorities \u2013 comparable in size and responsibility to the Welsh assembly and the Scottish parliament \u2013 with members nominated by existing unitary councils, and devolve most ministerial powers and the requirement to maintain nationally approved plans for provision, school improvement, teacher supply and special educational needs services to these two levels.</p> <p>Third, give local government tax-raising powers, including the control of business rates.</p> <p>Fourth, insist every school has a governing body including staff and parent representatives, with powers analogous to church-aided schools; and insist schools have the option to leave their multi-academy trusts \u2013 too many of which are unnecessarily expensive bureaucratic fifth wheels on the carriage.</p> <p>Next year is the 150th anniversary of Forster\u2019s Education Act, when a reluctant state made its first tentative steps towards providing education for all. The next educational era was ushered in 75 years ago by Clement Attlee, with education a central plank of the welfare state. It was an age of trust and partnership that lasted until Thatcher decreed the long winter of markets, managerialism and centralisation, bestowing all those unfettered powers on the secretary of state. Its time is now up, and we need to create a change of climate in which the systemic reforms outlined here mark an age of hope and ambition that our young people deserve.</p> <p><em>Tim Brighouse, formerly </em><em>commissioner for London </em><em>schools and leader of the London Challenge, writes as member of the <a href=\"https://www.newvisionsforeducation.org.uk/about-the-group/home/\" title=\"\">New Visions for Education</a> group</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Although there is a certain world-weariness \u2013 a Brenda from Bristol moment of \u201cnot another one\u201d \u2013 associated with the prospect of this general election, for the optimistic in education it is hard to hold back a surge of hope. After all, teaching is about hope: tirelessly treating our children not as they infuriatingly are but as they might become. \u201cMaybe,\u201d you think, \u201ceducation will once again be centre stage, with a realisation by politicians that a civilised society and every citizen\u2019s wellbeing depends on getting it right.\u201d Superficially the omens look good. It isn\u2019t just that Labour promises to restore the brief period of adequate funding we saw in the decade when Blair prioritised \u201ceducation, education, education\u201d. Even their opponents accept that \u201csocial mobility\u201d, \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d and \u201cequity\u201d are desirable \u2013 though their actions betray their words. If Labour wins this election it must not merely fund and repair the enormous damage to early years provision, schools, further education, lifelong learning opportunities, universities and, vitally, the youth service, it must also tackle some of the systemic structural issues that mean we continue to fail about a third of our young people. The wishlist is long. We need early years programmes of play and language, starting with health visitors, leading through teacher-run nurseries to formal schooling at age six where pupils experience a curriculum designed to develop values, attitudes and ideas as well as knowledge and skills \u2013 in short, affecting their hearts and hands as much as their minds. Tests and exams should be nationally set, internally marked, externally moderated and regionally validated by a nominated university and employing body. School accountability would be anchored in an independent inspectorate \u2013 not Ofsted cosying up to ministers. There would be random national testing to ascertain standards, regional inspections and democratic scrutiny of schools, with a new balanced school scorecard accrediting performance across the full range of desirable school outcomes, not only the academic. Admission to schools must be locally administered with a policy based not on selection, but on putting one parent\u2019s right to a place at their nearest school ahead of another\u2019s right to choose. Local communities should have a regional network of well-funded colleges of further education, accessible from age 14 into retirement and linked to regional universities, ensuring lifelong learning opportunities for all, with priority for the socio-economically disadvantaged. Ten percent of entry to major independent schools should be nominated regionally with priority for children in care, with a 10% limit on independent school entry to Russell Group universities. The proposed VAT on independent school fees and an end to the scandalous public funding of private universities would defray the cost of these reforms. This wishlist needs to be underpinned by four reforms of governance. First, reduce unbridled ministerial powers \u2013 now at more than 2,000 (epitomising the most centralised, authoritarian education system in the developed world) where once there were just three. Do this by establishing a statutory standing national educational advisory council of teachers, parents, employers, universities, faith groups, unions, inspectors, and local government, whose advice ministers would be required publicly to seek before making decisions. Second, reinvigorate local government through 10 democratic regional authorities \u2013 comparable in size and responsibility to the Welsh assembly and the Scottish parliament \u2013 with members nominated by existing unitary councils, and devolve most ministerial powers and the requirement to maintain nationally approved plans for provision, school improvement, teacher supply and special educational needs services to these two levels. Third, give local government tax-raising powers, including the control of business rates. Fourth, insist every school has a governing body including staff and parent representatives, with powers analogous to church-aided schools; and insist schools have the option to leave their multi-academy trusts \u2013 too many of which are unnecessarily expensive bureaucratic fifth wheels on the carriage. Next year is the 150th anniversary of Forster\u2019s Education Act, when a reluctant state made its first tentative steps towards providing education for all. The next educational era was ushered in 75 years ago by Clement Attlee, with education a central plank of the welfare state. It was an age of trust and partnership that lasted until Thatcher decreed the long winter of markets, managerialism and centralisation, bestowing all those unfettered powers on the secretary of state. Its time is now up, and we need to create a change of climate in which the systemic reforms outlined here mark an age of hope and ambition that our young people deserve.

      "bodyText": "Nineteen South Australian prison guards are attempting to have a coroner removed from investigating the death in custody of an Indigenous man after seven guards lost a bid to avoid giving evidence at the inquest. The inquest into the death of Wayne Fella Morrison has not heard any new evidence since last December, when seven guards who travelled in a transport van with the 29-year-old man argued they should be excused from giving any evidence that could implicate them in either criminal or internal disciplinary proceedings. Morrison, a Kokatha, Wirangu and Wiradjuri man, was blue and unresponsive when he was pulled from the transport van on 23 September 2016 and did not regain consciousness before dying in hospital three days later. He had been placed face-down in the van after being restrained by a dozen officers in an incident caught on CCTV at Adelaide\u2019s high security Yatala Labour Prison. The prison guards have challenged the inquest in the supreme court, arguing that they should have a right to silence when being asked to give evidence that could lead them liable to civil or disciplinary penalty. They have also argued that the deputy state coroner, Jayne Basheer, should be removed from the inquest, saying there is a risk of apprehended bias because she had, at one point in her career, acted in a matter for which her fees were paid by the Correctional Officers Legal Fund. The hearing was listed for the supreme court in Adelaide on Tuesday and is scheduled to run for three days. Basheer and the coroner\u2019s court are opposing her removal. Morrison\u2019s family, which are not listed as a party to the case but have been granted the right to make a written submission, have argued that Basheer be able to stay on as coroner to ensure the inquest is concluded without further delay. Morrison\u2019s sibling Latoya Rule said their family had waited three years and two months for answers about their brother\u2019s death.

That community is currently grieving the fatal police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory remote community of Yuendumu. \u201cWe don\u2019t wake up every day wanting to all come down to the court to hear about the death of a loved one,\u201d Rule said. \u201cWe want to move on with our lives, we want to grieve and to heal ...

      "body": "<p>Heading the Open University, a British institution venerated on a par with the NHS, would be a huge responsibility, Tim Blackman, its new vice-chancellor, was warned by fellow university leaders. But, they said, \u201cwe all believe in the OU\u201d.</p> <p>There have been times in the past few years when this veneration has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/20/open-university-strike-ou-regional-centres-moocs\" title=\"\">tested</a>. The government\u2019s decision in 2012 to raise tuition fees and cut grants delivered a shock to the OU\u2019s business model, which relied on mature and part-time students. Mature students proved reluctant to take on a debt they would have little time to repay and the financial model did not easily support part-timers wanting to dip in and out of learning. Across all UK universities, part-time student numbers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/02/part-time-student-numbers-collapse-universities\" title=\"\">fell by 56%</a> between 2010 and 2015. The OU lost a third of its student body, severely affecting its finances.</p> <p>For 2017-18 it recorded a \u00a317.9m deficit after taxation, which included \u00a313.3m in voluntary redundancy payments. Blackman\u2019s predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/09/save-open-university-peter-horrocks-changing\" title=\"\">Peter Horrocks</a>, resigned in April last year after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/13/open-university-vice-chancellor-peter-horrocks-resigns-after-vote-of-no-confidence\" title=\"\">vote of no confidence</a>, having proposed making savings of \u00a3100m by cutting courses and staff.</p> <p>Blackman, who took over on 1 October, insists the financial situation was not as bad as had been made out and that the university is now in good financial shape. It will shortly announce a small operating surplus for the past financial year (although, like other universities, its overall financial position has been hit by changes to academic pensions) and predicts surpluses over the next five years, helped by recent cost cutting. He says it also has sound reserves. \u201cMany other institutions would like to be in our position.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the OU has recently negotiated new contracts, making more than 4,000 staff on casual contracts permanent, something welcomed by the unions. Student numbers are up 7% over the past year. It is one of the largest universities in Europe, with nearly 175,000 students.</p> <p>The economic value of learning and the impact it has on careers is one of the three buttons the OU presses that \u201creally send a tingle down my spine\u201d, says Blackman. Another is the university\u2019s commitment to make its benefits available to everyone equally. </p> <p>Then there is its role in helping people rise to the \u201cgrand challenges\u201d the world faces, such as the climate emergency. The OU has a responsibility to create an informed public \u201crather than seeing the solution as just with experts. We need to engage the public in being experts as well\u201d. The university has been a pioneer and will be doing more to respond to this, he says. \u201cWe need to step up in that space.\u201d</p> <p>He cites the example of Blue Planet, Sir David Attenborough\u2019s wildly popular documentary series, produced by the BBC with the OU as a partner. The university\u2019s platform for free learning, OpenLearn, allowed viewers to find out more, and the resulting public outcry over the damage caused by plastic straws led McDonald\u2019s to drop them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/15/century-adult-education-tossed-aside\">A century of adult education has been tossed aside \u2013 is it too late to rescue it? | Laura McInerney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI want the OU to be absolutely at the heart of the transition from a carbon economy to a green economy,\u201d says Blackman. He argues its distance learning delivery model is naturally \u201cgreen\u201d and, already, 100% of electricity on its Milton Keynes campus is from green sources, while only 3% of its waste goes to landfill. </p> <p>Blackman studied urban geography at the University of Durham, before spending a year as a community worker in Northern Ireland, having become interested in community action as a student, running adventure playgrounds on deprived estates. He returned to Durham to do a PhD before taking a job as a social policy academic at the University of Ulster.</p> <p>He has managed to cover the full gamut of universities, from Russell Group ones to post \u201992s, smaller and larger institutions, ending up \u2013 before the OU \u2013 at Middlesex.</p> <p>The OU, he says, has a particular appeal as a prototype of the comprehensive university, an idea he has developed over several years. He explored this in a <a href=\"https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2017/07/20/new-report-calls-comprehensive-universities-improve-social-mobility/\" title=\"\">paper</a> published by the Higher Education Policy Institute two years ago, arguing that the higher education sector has become too divided between the equivalents of secondary moderns and grammar schools. At secondary school level, he says, the case for comprehensive education has been won, and yet England has the most selective higher education system in the world. </p> <p>\u201cThe complex problems we need to solve nowadays don\u2019t just need individual smart people,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need a diversity of perspectives, of experience, of ways of framing and solving the problem.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour party is interested in exploring how his ideas might fit into its plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/12/labour-still-asking-for-education-policy-ideas-here-are-a-few\" title=\"\">National Education Service</a>.

      "bodyText": "Heading the Open University, a British institution venerated on a par with the NHS, would be a huge responsibility, Tim Blackman, its new vice-chancellor, was warned by fellow university leaders. But, they said, \u201cwe all believe in the OU\u201d. There have been times in the past few years when this veneration has been tested. The government\u2019s decision in 2012 to raise tuition fees and cut grants delivered a shock to the OU\u2019s business model, which relied on mature and part-time students. Mature students proved reluctant to take on a debt they would have little time to repay and the financial model did not easily support part-timers wanting to dip in and out of learning. Across all UK universities, part-time student numbers fell by 56% between 2010 and 2015. The OU lost a third of its student body, severely affecting its finances. For 2017-18 it recorded a \u00a317.9m deficit after taxation, which included \u00a313.3m in voluntary redundancy payments. Blackman\u2019s predecessor, Peter Horrocks, resigned in April last year after a vote of no confidence, having proposed making savings of \u00a3100m by cutting courses and staff. Blackman, who took over on 1 October, insists the financial situation was not as bad as had been made out and that the university is now in good financial shape. It will shortly announce a small operating surplus for the past financial year (although, like other universities, its overall financial position has been hit by changes to academic pensions) and predicts surpluses over the next five years, helped by recent cost cutting. He says it also has sound reserves. \u201cMany other institutions would like to be in our position.\u201d Meanwhile, the OU has recently negotiated new contracts, making more than 4,000 staff on casual contracts permanent, something welcomed by the unions. Student numbers are up 7% over the past year. It is one of the largest universities in Europe, with nearly 175,000 students. The economic value of learning and the impact it has on careers is one of the three buttons the OU presses that \u201creally send a tingle down my spine\u201d, says Blackman. Another is the university\u2019s commitment to make its benefits available to everyone equally. Then there is its role in helping people rise to the \u201cgrand challenges\u201d the world faces, such as the climate emergency. The OU has a responsibility to create an informed public \u201crather than seeing the solution as just with experts. We need to engage the public in being experts as well\u201d. The university has been a pioneer and will be doing more to respond to this, he says. \u201cWe need to step up in that space.\u201d He cites the example of Blue Planet, Sir David Attenborough\u2019s wildly popular documentary series, produced by the BBC with the OU as a partner. The university\u2019s platform for free learning, OpenLearn, allowed viewers to find out more, and the resulting public outcry over the damage caused by plastic straws led McDonald\u2019s to drop them. \u201cI want the OU to be absolutely at the heart of the transition from a carbon economy to a green economy,\u201d says Blackman. He argues its distance learning delivery model is naturally \u201cgreen\u201d and, already, 100% of electricity on its Milton Keynes campus is from green sources, while only 3% of its waste goes to landfill. Blackman studied urban geography at the University of Durham, before spending a year as a community worker in Northern Ireland, having become interested in community action as a student, running adventure playgrounds on deprived estates. He returned to Durham to do a PhD before taking a job as a social policy academic at the University of Ulster. He has managed to cover the full gamut of universities, from Russell Group ones to post \u201992s, smaller and larger institutions, ending up \u2013 before the OU \u2013 at Middlesex. The OU, he says, has a particular appeal as a prototype of the comprehensive university, an idea he has developed over several years. He explored this in a paper published by the Higher Education Policy Institute two years ago, arguing that the higher education sector has become too divided between the equivalents of secondary moderns and grammar schools. At secondary school level, he says, the case for comprehensive education has been won, and yet England has the most selective higher education system in the world. \u201cThe complex problems we need to solve nowadays don\u2019t just need individual smart people,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need a diversity of perspectives, of experience, of ways of framing and solving the problem.\u201d The Labour party is interested in exploring how his ideas might fit into its plans for a National Education Service. His wife is Roberta Blackman-Woods, shadow minister for housing, communities and local government and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary University Group, who is not standing as an MP in the general election. But, he adds, Labour has tended to be as blind to the needs of part-time students as the other political parties (although last week\u2019s manifesto suggests this could change). Immediate challenges for Blackman include a multimillion pound changeover to a new computer system, due to be completed by 2022, and the repercussions of Brexit. The OU is less vulnerable than most to the potential loss of EU students, but still has EU staff to look after. He never thought he would return to the OU (he did a stint there as acting vice-chancellor before heading to Middlesex, which he assumed would be his last job), but the opportunity to lead an organisation that is as much a social movement as a university was one he could not resist. \u201cThe mission here is on such a scale,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a society where we are increasingly bothered by divisions, the OU\u2019s position in offering a right to higher education is important,\u201d he says. \u201cAccess to education in a way that is inclusive and equitable, which is what we were set up to do, is more important than ever.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to your daily news digest. By this point in the campaign, both parties have outlined their \u2013 very different \u2013 spending plans and visions for the future, and now that the big reveals are done we\u2019re into the fight over them. Today it\u2019s all about spending. We\u2019ve also got a taste of non-election news and you can read our rolling political coverage here. What\u2019s going on? The huge gap in the spending promises of the two major parties is high on the agenda after it emerged that Labour was committing 28 times as much in public spending as the Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn defended his multibillion-pound general election spending pledge on public services, saying that even with the increased spending of \u00a383bn a year that he has promised, the UK would still spend less on public services than France or Germany. Zoe Williams writes that Labour has outlined its promises and now its job is to make those promises seem real. Meanwhile the Resolution Foundation thinktank has released analysis showing that child poverty is at risk of rising to a record 60-year high under a Conservative government because its manifesto retains the coalition\u2019s benefit cuts. The analysis says the number of British children living in relative poverty would increase from 29.6% in 2017-18 to 34.5% in 2023-2024 under a Boris Johnson-led government. It adds, though, that Labour\u2019s \u00a39bn of extra spending on social security would mean 550,000 fewer children in poverty but would not lead to current poverty rates falling. In other news, Britain\u2019s former envoy to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, has issued a scathing verdict of the government\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic amateurism\u201d saying Johnson is sowing the seeds of \u201cthe biggest crisis of Brexit to date\u201d. In a lecture in Glasgow, Rogers said Johnson was repeating Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrategy errors\u201d and would soon find himself \u201cunwisely\u201d boxed in by his campaign promises. At a glance The UK\u2019s chief rabbi has accused Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d to take root in Labour, saying Jews were justifiably anxious about the prospect of a Labour government tainted by antisemitism complaints. In the latest instalment of candidate controversy: a Conservative candidate who is pictured in the party\u2019s manifesto as an NHS nurse standing for parliament is suspended from practising as a midwife. Nicky Morgan has been trotted out to sell the Conservative manifesto, despite the fact she won\u2019t be standing at this election, with John Crace writing: \u201cYou can only imagine that CCHQ have decided that every other member of the cabinet is too much of a liability to be let out in front of the public.\u201d An attack on two Labour canvassers aged in their 70s has been condemned by Labour. The leader of Welsh Labour has backed Corbyn\u2019s decision to remain neutral in any fresh referendum campaign even though the party in Wales has pledged to fight for remain. Aditya Chakrabortty has spent time with some of Corbyn\u2019s \u201clads army\u201d asking: if Johnson has already won the professional air war, who will fight in Corbyn\u2019s corner? The day ahead The Labour party will unveil its race and faith manifesto in Tottenham this morning. Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler will attend. In the Conservative camp, Johnson will launch his Scottish campaign at midday and then head to the east of England to campaign. Sajid Javid will speak in Manchester this afternoon about the cost of Corbyn\u2019s campaign promises. Jo Swinson is in Cheltenham and the Brexit party will hold an event in Barnsley. Corbyn has an interview with Andrew Neil tonight at 7.30. Sign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s afternoon round-up from the campaign trail \u2013 direct to your email inbox.

The body was found in a creek on Tuesday morning, 1km from the campground at Princetown on the Great Ocean Road where the 25-year-old Bristol man was staying. King was last seen at the campground at 2am on Saturday, when he apparently ran into bushland after hitting his head. Police and emergency services searched for four days on foot, horseback and in helicopters. A coroner\u2019s report will be prepared. &gt; A federal judge has ordered the former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify in the impeachment hearings, tossing out claims he had \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d as a top presidential adviser.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Rudd says the Coalition \u201copened the door\u201d to Chinese influence in the South Pacific by slashing the aid budget and retreating on climate change action. The former prime minister, in Canberra to launch a Quarterly Essay by the Nine journalist Peter Hartcher, used the opportunity to lash the Abbott and Turnbull administrations for their approach to the Chinese relationship that has become increasingly strained over allegations of foreign interference. While Rudd would not comment on revelations this week of an alleged Chinese Communist party plot to infiltrate the Australian parliament, the renowned Sinophile said the relationship remained \u201cdifficult\u201d. \u201cManaging the China relationship has always been difficult, it was difficult when I was prime minister, so it is for prime minister Morrison today,\u201d Rudd said. Later, Rudd told ABC\u2019s 7:30 while Australia should not be \u201cnaive\u201d about China advancing its interests, he favoured a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. Asked about warnings from Australian security chiefs, Rudd said it was \u201ckind of crazy to overreact and to get into reds under the bed land, to get into yellow peril land\u201d. He said Labor supported the foreign interference legislation but checking against the threat \u201cshould not result in some sort of anti-Chinese domestic political witch-hunt\u201d. Rudd also told the ABC the tactic of citing the fact Australia only accounts for a bit over 1% of global emissions \u2013 a point made recently by Scott Morrison \u2013 was \u201cstraight out of the climate change denialist handbook\u201d. He said the Coalition\u2019s policy amounted to saying \u201cit ain\u2019t really our problem, it\u2019s all those other countries\u2019 problem\u201d, arguing Australia had to pull its weight or large emitters would not do more to cut emissions. Earlier at the launch, Rudd accused the Coalition of \u201ccapitulating\u201d to China after it took power in 2013, bending to demands to enter into a comprehensive strategic partnership with China and conceding on negotiating positions that had been \u201clong held\u201d by Labor and the Howard governments. \u201cAbbott also collapsed Australia\u2019s aid effort into the South Pacific, virtually cutting it in half from our period in office, and in doing so the Liberal government opened the door to the region for China,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cThis was an utterly reckless act with long-term national security consequences for Australia.\u201d Rudd said that Turnbull remained \u201cuncritical\u201d in his approach to China in his first two years as leader, overseeing the lease of the Port of Darwin, which was the point of access for the US marines based in the Northern Territory. \u201cThe Americans were horrified, while the Chinese couldn\u2019t believe their luck,\u201d Rudd said. However, he said Turnbull then changed course \u201c180 degrees\u201d to placate the right wing of his party, using attacks on China and a crackdown on foreign interference to consolidate his position in the short term. As one of a number of remedies to counter Chinese influence in the region, Rudd said Australia needed to become the \u201cinternational champion of our friends in the South Pacific\u201d on climate change. \u201cThe current government\u2019s posture is the exact reverse of where we were in 2009 when we were the global voice for small island developing states \u2026 and their existential demand for a temperature ceiling of 1.5 to 2 per cent centigrade,\u201d he said. \u201cThe so-called Pacific step up is hollow; without credible climate leadership from Australia it will be seen in the neighbourhood as a dead letter.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He also recommended the government develop a national China strategy, driven by cabinet, saying it was \u201cnegligent\u201d that the government had not already done so. \u201cIt should be crystal clear about our national objectives in relation to China, just as it should be clear in its understanding of what China\u2019s objectives are in relation to Australia, just as it should be brutally pragmatic.\u201d He said Australia had failed to develop a balanced strategy towards China that protected security interests while also advancing economic interests. \u201cThis has eluded our current government,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia needs a more mature approach to managing the complexity of the relationship than having politicians out competing with one another about who can sound the most hairy chested about China on any given day of the week.\u201d While arguing the country needed to maintain \u201cdomestic vigilance\u201d against any substantive threats of foreign interference, Rudd also warned against a return of the \u201cyellow peril\u201d and a \u201cpopulist witch hunt\u201d of certain individuals. \u201cIt is very easy for this to translate to a form of racial profiling,\u201d he said. Rudd also said Australia should push ahead with trying to join Asean, diversify its economy and consolidate the alliance with the US, while also preparing for the possibility of further American isolationism. Saying the country needed to prepare to stand on its own in the event of a further US retreat, Rudd also advocated a \u201cbig and sustainable Australia\u201d with a population of about 50 million later this century to fund the defence force it would need. \u201cThis is not politically correct, I know that \u2026 but I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just an uncomfortable truth,\u201d he said. Rudd also commented on China\u2019s ideological viewpoint that saw two sets of values in conflict, saying the authoritarian regime of Xi Jinping had had become increasingly assertive and saw western liberal democracy as its \u201cideological enemy\u201d. He said China saw the Trump administration as accelerating the decline of the United States in the geopolitical world order and \u201cdamaging the global brand\u201d of democracy itself. \u201cOn balance, the trade war as seen from Beijing, is a lesser problem than the greater strategic advantage for China\u2019s wider national interest from the continuation of the Trump presidency,\u201d he said.",

In fact, the 1997 pledge cards distributed by the party worked partly as a code, each promise signalling a vision of the country, and partly as a distribution of power \u2013 when they distilled their agenda to five easily communicable points, anyone could become its ambassador. That cannot be said of Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto, but it is not too late to do a pledge card this time too. The original was, for anyone who\u2019s forgotten, mostly awful: \u201cWe will introduce a fast-track punishment scheme for persistent young offenders by halving the time from arrest to sentencing\u201d was there mainly to put themselves on the side of law and order, an answer to the habitual critique of the bleeding-heart liberal, not a serious reflection on criminality or the penal system. \u201cWe will get 250,000 under-25-year-olds off benefit and into work by using money from a windfall levy on the privatised utilities\u201d was a decent programme with a vindictive frame, \u201cget them off benefits\u201d a crude variation on Thatcher\u2019s scrounger narrative. \u201cWe will set tough rules for government spending and borrowing\u201d was the classic \u201cwe\u2019re basically Tories, only kinder\u201d, but everyone was prepared to take that for the last two: cut class sizes in primary schools; cut NHS waiting times. Corbyn\u2019s programme has signals of its own, it\u2019s full of them: \u201ccreate one million Green New Deal jobs\u201d says \u201cwe\u2019re taking climate change seriously, and we have a solution that brings prosperity\u201d. \u201cBuild 100,000 social houses a year\u201d says \u201cwe\u2019re not just aware of the housing crisis, we\u2019ll tackle it at a systems level\u201d. \u201cEnd student debt\u201d puts them on the side of generational justice. Arguments about which class this brings the greatest advantage to cut precisely no ice, because it\u2019s not really about the money, it\u2019s a statement of solidarity with a generation, and an extremely large one \u2013 getting towards anyone under 40. \u201cEnd privatisation in the NHS\u201d, again, isn\u2019t really about money; nobody is reading those runes for a detailed account of which bits have already been privatised, of the internal markets, of the invisible hand of Richard Branson. They are reading it for its commitment to the greatest, also most efficient, act of socialised medical care ever undertaken, anywhere in the world. They are reading it for a rebuttal of every Conservative policy, a defence against Trump and rapacious markets everywhere. You could even read within it a commitment to the public sector generally, and its workers, steadily impoverished by a decade of pay freezes; it doesn\u2019t even have to say that out loud. And finally, on Brexit: \u201cfinal say\u201d is enough. With that on a pledge card, it wouldn\u2019t matter which way Corbyn himself would campaign, or whether or not Angela Rayner misspoke when she seemed to suggest that the whole of the front bench would be arguing for a pointless deal of its own. Explicit in its second referendum offer, the party becomes the gateway to remain, the inner workings of its individual actors no longer important. There is an argument that it\u2019s just as important to say what the party won\u2019t do: no tax increases for 95% of people; no more austerity. I\u2019m agnostic; those negative promises are implicit in the positives, but there\u2019s no harm in saying them twice. The manifesto put meat on the bones of the Corbyn \u2013 or, to get specific, the John McDonnell \u2013 agenda, but now it needs to knit together to come alive. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

Then Jo Whiley played all six minutes of Run on daytime Radio 1, and everything changed. We did a hasty radio edit and released it as a single. We were told it had charted, so about 30 of us gathered in my mate\u2019s house to listen to the Top 40 rundown. Each time there was a song mentioned and it wasn\u2019t ours we all cheered, because we knew it must have gone in higher. When they announced it had gone in at No 5 the place just erupted. It was one of the best parties we ever had.</p> <h2><strong>Nathan Connolly, guitarist</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019d been talking about becoming a rock star since I was 11. In 2001, I was in a Belfast postpunk rock band called F.U.E.L. who supported Snow Patrol on an early Irish tour. I started hanging out with them and after F.U.E.L.\u2019s drummer quit and the band\u2019s future looked uncertain, Snow Patrol asked me to join them. They\u2019d just been let go by [indie label] Jeepster after a couple of albums but had new management and were gigging. They picked me up in a van outside my parents\u2019 house and I moved to Glasgow that same night.</p> <p>Run was one of the songs on a CD they gave me to learn, the same demo that convinced Polydor \u2013 who then signed us \u2013 to come up to the rehearsal room to hear us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40ee54f2f64158b6d21acadb091bdb0ada6d9dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ee54f2f64158b6d21acadb091bdb0ada6d9dcb/0_0_4450_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Lightbody and Nathan Connolly performing on TV this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"775\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Lightbody and Nathan Connolly, right. performing on TV this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: S Meddle/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember thinking Run was a special song, way before we knew what would happen to it. Most of the structural elements were on the demo, but it was much more indie then and shied away from the big chorus. [Producer] Jacknife Lee saw the potential and instilled in us the idea that if it\u2019s a great hook, play it when it really matters. When we recorded it, he let the anthemic side shine through.</p> <p>You can never put a finger on why a song connects. I remember a conversation about whether Run should be the next single, and 21-year-old me was arguing that it was way too long, which seems ridiculous now. Our final show of 2003 was in the White Horse in High Wycombe, which later featured in a TV programme called Britain\u2019s Toughest Pubs. After Run came out, we were in Shepherds Bush Empire. The album took off and the venues just kept getting bigger.</p> <ul> <li><p>Snow Patrol\u2019s album Reworked is out now on Polydor.

It was one of the best parties we ever had. Nathan Connolly, guitarist I\u2019d been talking about becoming a rock star since I was 11. In 2001, I was in a Belfast postpunk rock band called F.U.E.L. who supported Snow Patrol on an early Irish tour. I started hanging out with them and after F.U.E.L.\u2019s drummer quit and the band\u2019s future looked uncertain, Snow Patrol asked me to join them. They\u2019d just been let go by [indie label] Jeepster after a couple of albums but had new management and were gigging. They picked me up in a van outside my parents\u2019 house and I moved to Glasgow that same night. Run was one of the songs on a CD they gave me to learn, the same demo that convinced Polydor \u2013 who then signed us \u2013 to come up to the rehearsal room to hear us. I remember thinking Run was a special song, way before we knew what would happen to it. Most of the structural elements were on the demo, but it was much more indie then and shied away from the big chorus. [Producer] Jacknife Lee saw the potential and instilled in us the idea that if it\u2019s a great hook, play it when it really matters. When we recorded it, he let the anthemic side shine through. You can never put a finger on why a song connects. I remember a conversation about whether Run should be the next single, and 21-year-old me was arguing that it was way too long, which seems ridiculous now. Our final show of 2003 was in the White Horse in High Wycombe, which later featured in a TV programme called Britain\u2019s Toughest Pubs. After Run came out, we were in Shepherds Bush Empire. The album took off and the venues just kept getting bigger. Snow Patrol\u2019s album Reworked is out now on Polydor. The band tour the UK until 5 December.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I was a single mum, working in a full-time job, helping people who\u2019ve got issues, and it all got too much for me,\u201d Sharron Maasz told a film-maker in 2012. Maasz\u2019s ambition was to write a book about her life. The message behind it would be simple: homelessness can happen to anybody. Nobody knew that better than Maasz. Before she ended up sleeping rough for 10 years, she was an outreach worker supporting homeless people in Oxford.</p> \n<p>Few homeless people get the chance to tell their story. Maasz was the subject of two short films, and in August 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/how-to-help-homeless-people-without-feeding-a-habit\" title=\"\">she told the Guardian</a> she had just started dictating her life story into a recorder she had been given. She was going to put everything into it: the domestic abuse that led to her losing her children, home and job; life on the streets; dual addiction to alcohol and drugs. She hoped that the story would have a feelgood ending \u2013 recovery, a new home, the published book. But, on 22 January, Sharron Maasz died in supported accommodation in Oxford aged 44.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures.

We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating.

We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness.

What seemed so shocking is that this is a city defined, in the eyes of outsiders at least, by privilege, opulence and success. But perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been shocked. Oxford has always been a place of extremes \u2013 a city of dreaming spires for some, a city of hand-to-mouth survival for many others.</p> \n<p>Maasz was never one of those who assumed she was destined to succeed. But she certainly had her dreams. Her former headteacher at middle school, Roger Pepworth, says: \u201cSharron was a lively and sensitive girl. She was a keen cyclist and an all-round athlete. When she was 11 or 12, she did the Brighton to London bike ride. She was the only pupil who did it in the school that year.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a70aeac37850ad794f3b1354b539542afbf9b6e5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a70aeac37850ad794f3b1354b539542afbf9b6e5/0_0_1388_1133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharron Maasz, in a film made by Mark Horvath in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"816\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharron Maasz, in a film made by Mark Horvath in 2012</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Mark Horvath/Youtube</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maasz and her brother Charlie came from a working-class family and lived on an estate in Oxford. They were brought up by their father, Alan, a forward-thinking man with left-leaning politics. Alan Maasz started out as a painter and decorator, then became a college lecturer, teaching the trade to female students.</p> \n<p>From middle school, Maasz went to a comprehensive. \u201cA good one,\u201d according to Pepworth. Was she bright? \u201cShe was, but she slightly underperformed. She was a canny lass, bubbly and sharp. She was popular and competitive.\u201d Pepworth says she was self-reliant, like her father. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he was living off his wits, but as a single parent, both having to work and look after his kids, it wasn\u2019t easy. He brought the kids up to be independent.\u201d Did Pepworth have any sense that Maasz was troubled as a child? \u201cNo, none whatsoever. She was a perfectly happy, normal kid.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few days after we speak to Pepworth, Alan Maasz emails. \u201cHi, Roger suggested I get in touch with you regarding my late daughter, Sharron. The inquest into her death is to be held soon, so as a family we are still in a state of distress, with many unanswered questions. I feel my daughter and my grandchildren were let down by various organisations right from the outset of her introduction to drugs. If you would like to email with an outline of any information you require, I will discuss it with my grandchildren and seek their approval to respond.\u201d</p> \n<p>But, as so often with people who have died homeless, the surviving family is divided. One of her children also gets in touch to say they would like to talk to us, but in the end they decide not to talk on the record for fear it may cause a family rift.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Sharron Maasz was very particular about the pronunciation of her name \u2013 unlike the regular Sharon, the emphasis was on the <em>rron</em>. She used to say there had never been a first name so fiercely debated. Her mother insisted it was pronounced Sha<em>rron</em>, and eventually she did, too. After school, Maasz worked as a hairdresser, then became a full-time support worker for drug addicts and former prisoners in Oxford. According to those who knew her at the time, she was a brilliant support worker \u2013 kind, caring, generous and funny. She was the same in her private life \u2013 sometimes it worked against her, with men in particular taking advantage of her nature.</p> \n<p>Maasz had three children with different partners and fostered another. She suffered mental health issues from her late teens and said she had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Like many teenagers, she dabbled with drugs, but she claimed she was clean for 12 years till she was 30. Her family say she was happiest in these years \u2013 working, cooking, bringing up her children. Maasz was well known and well liked \u2013 a big personality with a social conscience. When she wasn\u2019t working or looking after her children, she would often be out and about helping homeless people on a voluntary basis.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, she said, the abuse she suffered at the hands of a partner (not one of the fathers of her children) damaged her irreparably. She had a breakdown and became addicted to crack and heroin. The abusive partner, who had moved in with Maasz and her children, was eventually sentenced to five years in jail. But by the time she fled the family home, her children had been taken away from her. She was never subsequently housed by the council, which is why she ended up on the streets in her early 30s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"042da1633b3822ac957ce39f81b7bfa7828036c9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/042da1633b3822ac957ce39f81b7bfa7828036c9/0_167_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharron (left) with her daughter, Leah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharron (right) with her daughter, Leah.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Sharron, right, with her daughter, Leah.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In 2012, the US homelessness activist Mark Horvath made a moving five-minute video about Maasz. Despite its brevity, her complex character is conveyed in full. In the film Maasz is friendly, giggly, optimistic, resilient, tearful and, ultimately, desperate. It was the middle of winter, she had a scarf wrapped tight around her neck, and in her furry deerstalker hat she looked like a sassy pigeon. She told Horvath she was born and bred in Oxford. \u201cGreat town! Oxonian by heart.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said she had left her house in Jericho, Oxford, for a women\u2019s refuge in Birmingham, but returned to her home city a couple of years before the film was made because she was worried about her children. \u201cThe long and short of it is I\u2019ve been sleeping rough here for two and a bit years.\u201d When asked how she survives, she laughed and looked puzzled. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. Through the grace of God, I think. We get donations of clothes. And obviously, being born and bred Oxonian, there are people who have known me and they give me a bit of support when they can and I just survive hand to mouth.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=6&amp;title=homeless%20people%20have%20died%20in%20Oxford%20since%20November%202018\" data-alt=\"6 homeless people have died in Oxford since November 2018\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=6&amp;title=homeless%20people%20have%20died%20in%20Oxford%20since%20November%202018\">6 homeless people have died in Oxford since November 2018</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Maasz said she was sleeping in a children\u2019s park in Cowley, in the south-east of Oxford, because it was safer than bedding down in the city centre. \u201cI had an incident happened in the town centre,\u201d she explained, \u201cso I\u2019m not happy about sleeping out in the town centre because of my mental-health issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Horvath probed her gently, empathetically. \u201cYou used to work in the sector?\u201d \u201cI did, yes. I left in 2003, I gave in my resignation.\u201d She said that, as a single mother working full time with society\u2019s most vulnerable people, life had just got on top of her. She acknowledged the irony that she had worked with homeless people and had now become one herself. \u201cYes, life has its funny turns,\u201d she said, before explaining that this had helped her adapt to her new life. \u201cPeople are familiar with me from back then, which has made my path a little bit easier because I knew a lot of the homeless people.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz3cAS84lSY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qz3cAS84lSY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch Mark Horvath\u2019s film interview with Sharron Maasz\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maasz was almost impossibly cheery about her circumstances. Until, that is, she was asked what her future looked like. \u201cThis time last year I had more hopes. But, as the years are going by, I\u2019m feeling that it\u2019s more and more further away.\u201d When asked if she had three wishes what would they be, her voice cracked and she started to cry. \u201cHave somewhere to live, my children back with me, and just to be back living like a normal person. Whatever normal is.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is an almost uncanny correlation between the life of Sharron Maasz and her friend, 49-year-old Monica Gregory. But it is an inverse correlation. When Maasz worked for social services and was an outreach worker, Gregory was homeless in Oxford and then in Glasgow. While Maasz was extrovert and assertive, Gregory was introverted and meek. A few years ago, Gregory met Shaista Aziz, a local Labour councillor, comedian and journalist, and Aziz helped bring her out of herself. Gregory discovered her voice, developed a degree of confidence and began to do outreach work with homeless people. That was when she met Maasz.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>She\u2019d be very familiar with you, which is why so many people liked her. She was quite commanding \u2013 a big presence in a small space</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Lucy Warin</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Gregory also escaped abusive relationships. In her early 20s, she lived with an alcoholic who beat her unconscious (Gregory has never had addiction issues). She accepted the abuse because she thought she was worthless. But after her partner assaulted her family \u2013 he pushed both her father and brother down concrete stairs \u2013 she knew she had to escape. \u201cThat was the tipping point. When he did that to my brother and my dad, I thought I can\u2019t do it no more. I just walked out of the house.\u201d</p> \n<p>She could have stayed with either her father or brother, but she was fearful for them. Her partner knew where they lived and would come looking for revenge. So she ran away and lived on the streets for six weeks. It was a horrific time, she says. \u201cI hid myself under the bushes so nobody could spot me. I didn\u2019t sleep in those six weeks. You always have men come up to you and ask if you\u2019re a working girl. When the police spotted me, my first words to them were: \u2018Just let me die.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Gregory sips at her Diet Coke in an Oxford pub and calmly tells us about her horrific childhood. She is quietly spoken with short hair and coral-blue eyes. At the age of 13, she says, she was raped at knifepoint soon after her best friend had gone missing. \u201cThe man who raped me then showed me where my best friend\u2019s body was buried. He had her and buried her under a garden shed.\u201d</p> \n<p>It sounds far-fetched, but she tells us the names and dates and they all check out. She led the police to the body and told them that the killer, a family friend, had also raped her. The man was convicted of her friend\u2019s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but Gregory says she simply doesn\u2019t know if he was convicted of her rape. Soon after this, Gregory was taken into care. Not surprisingly, she believes her childhood left her with post-traumatic stress disorder, from which she has never recovered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0d5078f1dcdc35df09303fc20d2a55ad827f170\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0d5078f1dcdc35df09303fc20d2a55ad827f170/360_80_4706_2824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Gregory (left), who was homeless, with and and local Oxford City councillor Shaista Aziz.

Photograph: Ben Gurr/The Guardian</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>After those six weeks sleeping rough at the age of 22, Gregory spent a number of years off the streets but still homeless. She had her first child while sofa surfing, and remains friends with his father. Then she found herself in another abusive relationship (\u201cI was getting beatings every single day\u201d), and Gregory was put in a refuge for women. By now she had two children. The intervention may well have saved her life but, for many years after, Gregory barely felt alive. She never believed she was worthy of sympathy or attention, let alone love. However subdued she might seem now, Gregory promises us she is nothing like the ghost of yesteryear.</p> \n<p>It was two years ago that Aziz, who was working on a homelessness project in Cowley Road, first met her. \u201cThere was this woman with these beautiful blue sparkly eyes that were just dead,\u201d Aziz says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people with that dead-eyed look around the world and these people have normally survived earthquakes and tsunamis, not been people living in my city. She wouldn\u2019t look at me or anybody. Eventually, she started talking to me, but she\u2019d look off. Then one day she said: \u2018I\u2019m going to apply for a job, I need you to help me with a CV.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Gregory told Aziz about the physical and sexual abuse she had suffered. She didn\u2019t get the job Aziz helped her apply for, but from then on they met up every week. \u201cI just saw this incredible woman opening up and becoming more confident,\u201d Aziz says. With Gregory\u2019s help, Aziz set up the <a href=\"https://www.oxfordhomelessmovement.org.uk/organisation/womens-hope-forum\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Hope Forum</a> for women experiencing rough sleeping in Oxford. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that women who are deemed to be at the bottom of the barrel still have hope,\u201d says Aziz. \u201cThat says a lot about them.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The students will throw drinks over homeless people and toilet over them when they\u2019re drunk.

Wealthy home-owners, privileged university students and people sleeping on the streets dropped in for cake and tea, to discuss housing and join in group poetry-writing sessions. Towards the end of her life, Maasz attended a few sessions with Gregory. Maasz was keener on the cake than the poetry.</p> \n<p>Lucy Warin, an urban designer, helps run Open House. She only met Maasz three or four times, but was left with a distinct impression of her. \u201cSharron would come for 20 minutes with her dogs at the end of the day. She\u2019d be very familiar with you, which is why so many people liked her. She\u2019d come very close to you, and ask your name straightaway. She was quite commanding \u2013 a big presence in a small space.\u201d Warin believes Open House has done much to break down barriers between homeless people and other parts of the community. But the week we talk it is preparing to shut down. Its one-year lease, from the university of Oxford, has expired.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Gregory first got to know Maasz two years before the latter died when she started doing outreach work. From the start, there was a special bond. They had both experienced domestic abuse and understood the perils of street life. But there was a crucial difference. Gregory had clung on to her children through the worst of times (her boys are now aged 18 and 15); Maasz hadn\u2019t. Gregory talked to Maasz about so much, but this was one avenue she did not want to explore. \u201cOne day somebody said something about her kids to her and I saw the pain on her face, and I thought, I can\u2019t put her through no more pain,\u201d Gregory says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A39bn&amp;title=the%20estimated%20consolidated%20net%20assets%20of%20Oxford%20University%20and%20its%20colleges\" data-alt=\"\u00a39bn: the estimated consolidated net assets of Oxford University and its colleges\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A39bn&amp;title=the%20estimated%20consolidated%20net%20assets%20of%20Oxford%20University%20and%20its%20colleges\">\u00a39bn: the estimated consolidated net assets of Oxford University and its colleges</a> \n</figure> \n<p>So they talked about outreach work, life\u2019s surprising reverses, Maasz\u2019s dogs, CeeCee and Jack Hammer, her writing ambitions, how she wanted to get off the streets and, a favourite topic, the perception that everybody from Oxford was posh. \u201cSharron used to take the mickey out of the posh side,\u201d Gregory says. \u201cShe\u2019d try to speak posh, and you\u2019re sat there in fits of laughter when she\u2019s imitating them.\u201d How did the students treat them? It depends what state they\u2019re in, Gregory says. \u201cThe students will throw drinks over homeless people and toilet over them when they\u2019re drunk. And they throw bottles. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Were there times when Maasz was resentful of what had become of her life? \u201cIt depends what personality she was,\u201d Gregory says. \u201cOne day she could be Sharron, another she\u2019d be somebody else. She\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019m not Sharron today.\u2019 When she\u2019s Sharron, she\u2019s happy; when she\u2019s somebody else, you don\u2019t go near her. I would walk up to her and say: \u2018Are you grumpy or are you Mrs Happy today?\u2019 If I got a growl I knew she was Mrs Grumpy; if she was smiling and laughing I knew I\u2019d got Mrs Happy.\u201d She pauses. \u201cShe was an amazing girl, you know.

It is 2 September, the second day of the annual St Giles\u2019 Fair, which dates back to the 17th century and became a celebrated children\u2019s fair in Victorian times. And there really does feel something Dickensian about it today \u2013 the bustle of crowded streets, the whirr of mechanical rides, the caramelised whiff of toffee apples, and, wherever you look, homeless people taking shelter or trying to make a few quid.

Why did she end up living on the streets? \u201cShe lost her kids and a few bad things happened to her. She had a very shit relationship.\u201d He goes into the unsavoury details.

We\u2019d sleep here \u2013 anywhere with cover.\u201d How did they pass the days? \u201cGetting by, having a drink, getting some food, just trying to get the day over as quickly as possible really.\u201d</p> \n<p>What did he call her? \u201cI always called her Sharon, and she used to bollock me for it because her name\u2019s Sharron.

I\u2019d been with her the day before just walking around having a drink, having a laugh. She was fine. I don\u2019t know what happened. It crippled Pip. He\u2019s got the dogs now \u2013 CeeCee and Jack Hammer. D\u2019you know why he\u2019s called Jack Hammer? Sharron\u2019s grandfather was a bare-knuckled fighter and his fighting name was Jack Hammer. He\u2019s a lovely dog, not really a Jack Hammer.

Andy lost his flat after serving a prison sentence. \u201cI\u2019ve been homeless ever since,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t offer you no support when you come out of prison, no place to stay; they give you \u00a346 and kick you out of the door.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3300m&amp;title=The%20size%20of%20the%20budget%20cut%20Oxfordshire%20county%20council%20has%20had%20to%20make%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"\u00a3300m: the size of the budget cut Oxfordshire county council has had to make since 2010\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3300m&amp;title=The%20size%20of%20the%20budget%20cut%20Oxfordshire%20county%20council%20has%20had%20to%20make%20since%202010\">\u00a3300m: the size of the budget cut Oxfordshire county council has had to make since 2010</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Oxford is a great place for students and the wealthy, he says, but not for the poor. \u201cEverywhere\u2019s so expensive here. I was born in Oxford, but it\u2019s all student-oriented. You go to any shop and they give 20% discount to a student who\u2019s been in Oxford for about two weeks, then someone who\u2019s lived here all his life gets no discount. We get fuck all. Every new building is about students. That quad they\u2019re building is not for people like me, it\u2019s for students and for the universities to make money from.\u201d</p> \n<p>He has got a point. Last year, it was estimated that Oxford University and its colleges had consolidated net assets of \u00a39bn. Apart from Cambridge, Oxford requires the <a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-7382937/Britains-expensive-cities-including-London-Cambridge-affordable-buyers.html\" title=\"\">highest income</a> of any city outside of London to buy a home. Meanwhile, there is a shocking contrast in life expectancy for the rich and poor. Men living in Northfield Brook, one of the poorest wards in Oxford, die on average at 75 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/08/deadly-poverty-one-uk-s-richest-cities\" title=\"\">15 years younger</a> than their counterparts in North ward, one of Oxford\u2019s most affluent areas.</p> \n<p>Another homeless person joins us. He is handsome, but his back is bent, he limps and he talks in a drug-induced slur. Simeon says he knows where Pip is, and he is happy to take us. We walk and walk, twisting our way through side streets and alleys, the fair still thrumming in the background. After about 20 minutes, he stops halfway down a hill. \u201cPip is down there. But I\u2019m going to leave you here because I don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019ve brought you here.\u201d He tells us he hopes we will make his efforts worth his while. We give him \u00a35, and head down the hill. There is no sign of Pip, CeeCee or Jack Hammer. We look back up the hill. Nor is there any sign of Simeon.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>When, 10 days after Maasz died, the Guardian reported the spike in homeless deaths in Oxford, the Labour-led council\u2019s deputy leader and cabinet member for leisure and housing, Linda Smith, wrote a letter to the paper putting it all into context: \u201cIt is right to highlight the lack of drug, alcohol and mental health support that many rough sleepers need to successfully rebuild their lives, and this is a direct consequence of austerity. Since 2010, Oxfordshire county council has had to make more than \u00a3300m in cuts that include many of these services \u2013 and the consequences are all too evident on our streets.\u201d</p> \n<p>Today, Smith tells us she is not shocked that five people who had experienced street homelessness died in Oxford in such a short period of time (there had been a further death since Maasz died). \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising at all. We know homelessness kills. The statistics bear that out, with people experiencing rough sleeping and homelessness having a life expectancy that is in their 40s. That is really shocking, and we\u2019ve got a lot of rough sleepers and homeless people in Oxford.\u201d She lists the ways in which the council has responded to the homelessness crisis: dozens of extra beds for rough sleepers in a new hub; a \u201csevere-weather emergency protocol\u201d, activated when the temperature is predicted to fall below zero (previously it had to be three nights below zero); a new emergency winter shelter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f8a5e5c1df314552be453d5023e8e7296f8fa17\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f8a5e5c1df314552be453d5023e8e7296f8fa17/0_92_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharron and Jack were photographed when she spoke to G2 in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharron and Jack were photographed when she spoke to G2 in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Sharron and Jack Hammer photographed in 2018 when she spoke to G2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/how-to-help-homeless-people-without-feeding-a-habit\">about a crowdfunding scheme</a> for homeless people. Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>But why would a woman such as Maasz have to rely on emergency accommodation? Surely she was an ideal candidate for council housing? \u201cShe was housed,\u201d Smith says tersely. \u201cShe was in women-only supported accommodation. She didn\u2019t die on the streets. She was accommodated by the council because she did have that local connection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith becomes more expansive about a scheme she is obviously proud of. \u201cIt\u2019s a women-only project we are trialling. There are not any male visitors allowed. And that was because a lot of women experiencing homelessness have experienced domestic abuse and maybe sexual abuse. For some women, having that kind of women-only environment is very therapeutic and helps with their recovery.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It is early October, and Maasz\u2019s inquest is being held at the coroner\u2019s court. Often coroners\u2019 courts are empty when the deceased is a homeless person. But today three generations of the family are here (Maasz\u2019s father, her sister Lucy and her daughter Leah, with her fiance), as well as three journalists and a police officer. The coroner, Darren Salter, is plumped up on a red throne and peers down at the family to address them.</p> \n<p>Despite his elevated station, Salter is a mild-mannered man. He explains that we are here to discover when, where, why and how Maasz died. The account of her life is bald and depressing. We hear nothing about her work, her dreams, her talents, her generosity of spirit. There is no reference to a life spent helping homeless people, or the sadness that she ended up that way herself. There is no mention that Maasz was one of five homeless deaths in Oxford in a matter of months. Maasz is presented to us purely and simply as a junkie \u2013 a woman who lived as an addict, and died as one.</p> \n<p>It emerges that a man whom Salter describes as Maasz\u2019s boyfriend, Jake Smith, was in her bedroom when she died. He called the ambulance service to tell them Maasz was not breathing, then left the scene. Smith, who had been released from prison and had breached his licence conditions, was later regarded as a potential suspect in the death of Maasz \u2013 the suggestion was that he may have administered the fatal drugs to her. He was interviewed by DS Darren Little in prison. He told the detective that he could not help Maasz when she was dying because he couldn\u2019t stand up after hitting an artery when injecting himself with heroin.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6b690c96405feb42bfe4d207f2be1cbe4762d66\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6b690c96405feb42bfe4d207f2be1cbe4762d66/38_87_541_325/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sharron Maasz, left, with her sister Lucy.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharron Maasz, left, with her sister Lucy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Sharron Maasz, left, with her sister Lucy.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The coroner asks the family if they have any questions. Maasz\u2019s sister Lucy asks how, if Smith was in such a bad state, he was able to leave before the ambulance arrived. Little says he was also baffled by this. \u201cI raised exactly the same question in the interview, and he couldn\u2019t provide an adequate explanation.\u201d Ultimately, though, Little could find no evidence of third-party involvement in Maasz\u2019s death. Salter rules that there were a number of contributory factors: mixed drug toxicity (heroin, cocaine and methadone were found in her system); a necrotising soft tissue infection; cirrhosis of the liver; and possibly hypothermia. Salter concludes it was a drug-related death.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, the coroner fails to mention that Smith should not have been there at all because it was women-only supported accommodation. Salter did not ask why support staff had allowed Smith into the accommodation, nor did he call <a href=\"https://homelessoxfordshire.uk/\" title=\"\">Homeless Oxfordshire</a>, the charity that runs the property, as a witness.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Maasz was destined to die in her early 40s. Certainly the pathologist\u2019s report revealed that she was in a terrible physical state, and the toxicology report showed she had relapsed \u2013 and badly. But, yet again, a simple systemic failing may have contributed to the death of a homeless person. Smith should never have been allowed in the women-only accommodation where both he and Maasz binged on class-A drugs, and where Maasz died.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>They did not think the whole set-up through properly. If they had done, maybe Sharron would still be alive</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Maasz family statement</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We ask Homeless Oxfordshire, which is commissioned by Oxford city council to provide supported accommodation in community settings, why Smith was allowed in the accommodation. It makes no attempt to answer the question, stating: \u201cWhilst we advocate risk reduction and encourage positive choices, our clients may relapse or make a negative decision that has a severe impact on their lives, and in some cases this can lead to death from an overdose or accident whilst under the influence.\u201d</p> \n<p>When we ask Oxford city council whether there will be an investigation into why Smith was allowed into the accommodation, it tells us that the five residents had agreed \u201cto enforce these rules themselves\u201d. The statement further explains: \u201cAn on-call duty manager is available around the clock, and CCTV footage can be reviewed in the event of any reported issue or incident. As the aim of the project is to involve and support residents towards independent living, there is not a continuous staff presence in the house or real-time monitoring of CCTV. This is consistent with similar dispersed-accommodation projects around the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few days after receiving our response from the council, we receive an answer to a freedom of information request that is subtly different in its emphasis, and appears to suggest that the CCTV in Maasz\u2019s accommodation was not there simply for retrospective investigations after an incident. It states: \u201cAs the aim of the project is to involve and support residents towards independent living, there is not a continuous staff presence in the house. However, an on-call duty manager is available around the clock, and CCTV footage is relayed live to O\u2019Hanlon House [a large hostel in central Oxford run by Homeless Oxfordshire], where it can be viewed in real time. This is consistent with similar dispersed-accommodation projects around the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Oxford city council further states that in February, after the deaths of five homeless people, including Maasz, it asked the statutory Oxfordshire Safeguarding Adults Board (OSAB) to consider undertaking an independent investigation. \u201cFollowing an initial investigation, the OSAB concluded that a safeguarding adults review was not required \u2013 for the most part, these individuals were accommodated at the time of their deaths, and those who were rough sleeping either died of natural causes or had pre-existing health conditions not directly associated with their homelessness.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bef1a1736f794725c59d7afb872fb7ea88ecbd4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bef1a1736f794725c59d7afb872fb7ea88ecbd4/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"Sharron Maasz\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharron Maasz.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This year, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/30/the-homeless-death-of-kane-walker-how-we-let-down-the-kid-from-care\" title=\"\">the death of Kane Walker</a> in Birmingham, the Labour MP Liam Byrne said there should be a safeguarding adults review after every homeless death in the country. The OSAB\u2019s justification for not conducting a safeguarding adults review is questionable at best. If those who died were accommodated at the time of their death, surely there should be an investigation to see if anything went wrong with the support offered at that accommodation. In the case of Maasz, we know there should have been no guests at the house, and that self-regulation (a contradiction in supported accommodation) clearly, and tragically, failed. Maasz had been sleeping on the streets two months earlier. To suggest that her death was not directly associated with her homelessness seems illogical.</p> \n<p>In mid-November, we receive a statement from a family member saying they believe Maasz was let down. \u201cThey have not set this accommodation up appropriately,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThey had no staff to make sure the condition of no men being in the building was being met. They did not think the whole set-up through properly. If they had done, maybe Jake Smith wouldn\u2019t have been able to enter the building and Sharron would still be alive.\u201d The statement says that the family member met Maasz most days, towards the end of her life, and had never heard her mention the name Jake Smith.</p> \n<p>Last week it was reported that another homeless person \u2013 the sixth since November 2018 \u2013 had died in Oxford. The man, as yet unnamed, was aged 46. It was the second death this year at Oxford\u2019s homeless shelter Simon House.</p> \n<p>Back in Oxford town centre, Gregory is sharing more memories of Maasz. If she closes her eyes, what most comes to mind? \u201cHer laugh. It\u2019s one of those funny little giggles. She\u2019d find something funny and it would be infectious. Everyone would start laughing and no one knew why they were laughing.\u201d Gregory says she still cannot believe her friend is dead, because she seemed so determined to turn her life around. \u201cI thought she\u2019d do really well when she went in that women\u2019s project.\u201d</p> \n<p>Maasz\u2019s death has devastated Gregory, but it has helped put her own achievements into context. A few months ago she started a paid job working for a charity. \u201cIf you\u2019d said to me this time last year that I\u2019d be in a job, I would have just laughed at you,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happened to Sharron has made me even more determined to prove my family wrong as well. I remember my mum\u2019s words: \u2018You\u2019re going to turn to drugs or drink and wreck your life.\u2019 And you know what, I\u2019ve still got my two boys with me. I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still standing.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Ten years ago, the first short film was made about Maasz soon after she became homeless. In her purple wellies and purple quilted jacket, and with a can of Tennent\u2019s lager in her hand, she could have passed for a kids\u2019 TV presenter fallen on hard times. It looked like spring, and she said she had been sleeping rough since the previous November. \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of bad choices and I\u2019ve paid for them all, trust me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was being raped, buggered and beaten by a bastard.\u201d</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxWHD-ttUu8\" title=\"\">the film</a>, she is shown living on the canal towpath and gives a remarkable insight into her life. We meet the two dogs; she shows us the community bed she and a couple of homeless friends sleep on hidden in a bush underneath a canal bridge; we join her at the water\u2019s edge where she washes her face. We see what a skilled blagger she is, sat between two cash machines, telling a passing woman how beautiful she looks in her dress, and being paid handsomely for her compliments. \u201cWe could be out for eight hours and make \u00a312, or we could be out for eight hours and every now and again, God bless them, we can make \u00a3100.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxWHD-ttUu8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xxWHD-ttUu8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch Sophie Ackers\u2019 film, Reading Sharron\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And all the time, she points out the perversity of a system that seems determined to punish her whatever her best intentions. She points to a letter from the NHS informing her that she didn\u2019t qualify for a methadone prescription because she was only using a small amount of the heroin substitute and was not injecting heroin. \u201cWhat do they want me to do, go out and start injecting in my groin again?\u201d she asks. \u201cThey could have had me off that [heroin] in six weeks.\u201d</p> \n<p>The video is unusual because, although it is about Maasz, it also feels as if it has been authored by her. She may never have been in control of the narrative of her life, but she certainly seemed in control of the narrative of this short film. Her message is clear, and delivered with utter conviction. \u201cJust because you\u2019re on the streets you\u2019re not a piece of rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy not take a step back? Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I was a single mum, working in a full-time job, helping people who\u2019ve got issues, and it all got too much for me,\u201d Sharron Maasz told a film-maker in 2012. Maasz\u2019s ambition was to write a book about her life. The message behind it would be simple: homelessness can happen to anybody. Nobody knew that better than Maasz. Before she ended up sleeping rough for 10 years, she was an outreach worker supporting homeless people in Oxford. Few homeless people get the chance to tell their story. Maasz was the subject of two short films, and in August 2018 she told the Guardian she had just started dictating her life story into a recorder she had been given. She was going to put everything into it: the domestic abuse that led to her losing her children, home and job; life on the streets; dual addiction to alcohol and drugs. She hoped that the story would have a feelgood ending \u2013 recovery, a new home, the published book. But, on 22 January, Sharron Maasz died in supported accommodation in Oxford aged 44. Maasz was the fourth homeless person to die in Oxford since November 2018. What seemed so shocking is that this is a city defined, in the eyes of outsiders at least, by privilege, opulence and success. But perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been shocked. Oxford has always been a place of extremes \u2013 a city of dreaming spires for some, a city of hand-to-mouth survival for many others. Maasz was never one of those who assumed she was destined to succeed. But she certainly had her dreams. Her former headteacher at middle school, Roger Pepworth, says: \u201cSharron was a lively and sensitive girl. She was a keen cyclist and an all-round athlete. When she was 11 or 12, she did the Brighton to London bike ride. She was the only pupil who did it in the school that year.\u201d Maasz and her brother Charlie came from a working-class family and lived on an estate in Oxford. They were brought up by their father, Alan, a forward-thinking man with left-leaning politics. Alan Maasz started out as a painter and decorator, then became a college lecturer, teaching the trade to female students. From middle school, Maasz went to a comprehensive. \u201cA good one,\u201d according to Pepworth. Was she bright? \u201cShe was, but she slightly underperformed. She was a canny lass, bubbly and sharp. She was popular and competitive.\u201d Pepworth says she was self-reliant, like her father. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he was living off his wits, but as a single parent, both having to work and look after his kids, it wasn\u2019t easy. He brought the kids up to be independent.\u201d Did Pepworth have any sense that Maasz was troubled as a child? \u201cNo, none whatsoever. She was a perfectly happy, normal kid.\u201d A few days after we speak to Pepworth, Alan Maasz emails. \u201cHi, Roger suggested I get in touch with you regarding my late daughter, Sharron. The inquest into her death is to be held soon, so as a family we are still in a state of distress, with many unanswered questions. I feel my daughter and my grandchildren were let down by various organisations right from the outset of her introduction to drugs. If you would like to email with an outline of any information you require, I will discuss it with my grandchildren and seek their approval to respond.\u201d But, as so often with people who have died homeless, the surviving family is divided. One of her children also gets in touch to say they would like to talk to us, but in the end they decide not to talk on the record for fear it may cause a family rift. * * * Sharron Maasz was very particular about the pronunciation of her name \u2013 unlike the regular Sharon, the emphasis was on the rron. She used to say there had never been a first name so fiercely debated. Her mother insisted it was pronounced Sharron, and eventually she did, too. After school, Maasz worked as a hairdresser, then became a full-time support worker for drug addicts and former prisoners in Oxford. According to those who knew her at the time, she was a brilliant support worker \u2013 kind, caring, generous and funny. She was the same in her private life \u2013 sometimes it worked against her, with men in particular taking advantage of her nature. Maasz had three children with different partners and fostered another. She suffered mental health issues from her late teens and said she had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Like many teenagers, she dabbled with drugs, but she claimed she was clean for 12 years till she was 30. Her family say she was happiest in these years \u2013 working, cooking, bringing up her children. Maasz was well known and well liked \u2013 a big personality with a social conscience. When she wasn\u2019t working or looking after her children, she would often be out and about helping homeless people on a voluntary basis. Ultimately, she said, the abuse she suffered at the hands of a partner (not one of the fathers of her children) damaged her irreparably. She had a breakdown and became addicted to crack and heroin. The abusive partner, who had moved in with Maasz and her children, was eventually sentenced to five years in jail. But by the time she fled the family home, her children had been taken away from her. She was never subsequently housed by the council, which is why she ended up on the streets in her early 30s. Sharron, right, with her daughter, Leah. In 2012, the US homelessness activist Mark Horvath made a moving five-minute video about Maasz. Despite its brevity, her complex character is conveyed in full. In the film Maasz is friendly, giggly, optimistic, resilient, tearful and, ultimately, desperate. It was the middle of winter, she had a scarf wrapped tight around her neck, and in her furry deerstalker hat she looked like a sassy pigeon. She told Horvath she was born and bred in Oxford. \u201cGreat town! Oxonian by heart.\u201d She said she had left her house in Jericho, Oxford, for a women\u2019s refuge in Birmingham, but returned to her home city a couple of years before the film was made because she was worried about her children. \u201cThe long and short of it is I\u2019ve been sleeping rough here for two and a bit years.\u201d When asked how she survives, she laughed and looked puzzled. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. Through the grace of God, I think. We get donations of clothes. And obviously, being born and bred Oxonian, there are people who have known me and they give me a bit of support when they can and I just survive hand to mouth.\u201d Maasz said she was sleeping in a children\u2019s park in Cowley, in the south-east of Oxford, because it was safer than bedding down in the city centre. \u201cI had an incident happened in the town centre,\u201d she explained, \u201cso I\u2019m not happy about sleeping out in the town centre because of my mental-health issues.\u201d Horvath probed her gently, empathetically. \u201cYou used to work in the sector?\u201d \u201cI did, yes. I left in 2003, I gave in my resignation.\u201d She said that, as a single mother working full time with society\u2019s most vulnerable people, life had just got on top of her. She acknowledged the irony that she had worked with homeless people and had now become one herself. \u201cYes, life has its funny turns,\u201d she said, before explaining that this had helped her adapt to her new life. \u201cPeople are familiar with me from back then, which has made my path a little bit easier because I knew a lot of the homeless people.\u201d Maasz was almost impossibly cheery about her circumstances. Until, that is, she was asked what her future looked like. \u201cThis time last year I had more hopes. But, as the years are going by, I\u2019m feeling that it\u2019s more and more further away.\u201d When asked if she had three wishes what would they be, her voice cracked and she started to cry. \u201cHave somewhere to live, my children back with me, and just to be back living like a normal person. Whatever normal is.\u201d There is an almost uncanny correlation between the life of Sharron Maasz and her friend, 49-year-old Monica Gregory. But it is an inverse correlation. When Maasz worked for social services and was an outreach worker, Gregory was homeless in Oxford and then in Glasgow. While Maasz was extrovert and assertive, Gregory was introverted and meek. A few years ago, Gregory met Shaista Aziz, a local Labour councillor, comedian and journalist, and Aziz helped bring her out of herself. Gregory discovered her voice, developed a degree of confidence and began to do outreach work with homeless people. That was when she met Maasz. Gregory also escaped abusive relationships. In her early 20s, she lived with an alcoholic who beat her unconscious (Gregory has never had addiction issues). She accepted the abuse because she thought she was worthless. But after her partner assaulted her family \u2013 he pushed both her father and brother down concrete stairs \u2013 she knew she had to escape. \u201cThat was the tipping point. When he did that to my brother and my dad, I thought I can\u2019t do it no more. I just walked out of the house.\u201d She could have stayed with either her father or brother, but she was fearful for them. Her partner knew where they lived and would come looking for revenge. So she ran away and lived on the streets for six weeks. It was a horrific time, she says. \u201cI hid myself under the bushes so nobody could spot me. I didn\u2019t sleep in those six weeks. You always have men come up to you and ask if you\u2019re a working girl. When the police spotted me, my first words to them were: \u2018Just let me die.\u2019\u201d Gregory sips at her Diet Coke in an Oxford pub and calmly tells us about her horrific childhood. She is quietly spoken with short hair and coral-blue eyes. At the age of 13, she says, she was raped at knifepoint soon after her best friend had gone missing. \u201cThe man who raped me then showed me where my best friend\u2019s body was buried. He had her and buried her under a garden shed.\u201d It sounds far-fetched, but she tells us the names and dates and they all check out. She led the police to the body and told them that the killer, a family friend, had also raped her. The man was convicted of her friend\u2019s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but Gregory says she simply doesn\u2019t know if he was convicted of her rape. Soon after this, Gregory was taken into care. Not surprisingly, she believes her childhood left her with post-traumatic stress disorder, from which she has never recovered. Monica Gregory (left) with local councillor Shaista Aziz. Photograph: Ben Gurr/The Guardian After those six weeks sleeping rough at the age of 22, Gregory spent a number of years off the streets but still homeless. She had her first child while sofa surfing, and remains friends with his father. Then she found herself in another abusive relationship (\u201cI was getting beatings every single day\u201d), and Gregory was put in a refuge for women. By now she had two children. The intervention may well have saved her life but, for many years after, Gregory barely felt alive. She never believed she was worthy of sympathy or attention, let alone love. However subdued she might seem now, Gregory promises us she is nothing like the ghost of yesteryear. It was two years ago that Aziz, who was working on a homelessness project in Cowley Road, first met her. \u201cThere was this woman with these beautiful blue sparkly eyes that were just dead,\u201d Aziz says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people with that dead-eyed look around the world and these people have normally survived earthquakes and tsunamis, not been people living in my city. She wouldn\u2019t look at me or anybody. Eventually, she started talking to me, but she\u2019d look off. Then one day she said: \u2018I\u2019m going to apply for a job, I need you to help me with a CV.\u2019\u201d Gregory told Aziz about the physical and sexual abuse she had suffered. She didn\u2019t get the job Aziz helped her apply for, but from then on they met up every week. \u201cI just saw this incredible woman opening up and becoming more confident,\u201d Aziz says. With Gregory\u2019s help, Aziz set up the Women\u2019s Hope Forum for women experiencing rough sleeping in Oxford. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that women who are deemed to be at the bottom of the barrel still have hope,\u201d says Aziz. \u201cThat says a lot about them.\u201d The Women\u2019s Hope Forum met at a project called Open House in Oxford \u2013 a space in which all sorts of people gathered to talk about what they wanted from housing. Wealthy home-owners, privileged university students and people sleeping on the streets dropped in for cake and tea, to discuss housing and join in group poetry-writing sessions. Towards the end of her life, Maasz attended a few sessions with Gregory. Maasz was keener on the cake than the poetry. Lucy Warin, an urban designer, helps run Open House. She only met Maasz three or four times, but was left with a distinct impression of her. \u201cSharron would come for 20 minutes with her dogs at the end of the day. She\u2019d be very familiar with you, which is why so many people liked her. She\u2019d come very close to you, and ask your name straightaway. She was quite commanding \u2013 a big presence in a small space.\u201d Warin believes Open House has done much to break down barriers between homeless people and other parts of the community. But the week we talk it is preparing to shut down. Its one-year lease, from the university of Oxford, has expired. * * * Gregory first got to know Maasz two years before the latter died when she started doing outreach work. From the start, there was a special bond. They had both experienced domestic abuse and understood the perils of street life. But there was a crucial difference. Gregory had clung on to her children through the worst of times (her boys are now aged 18 and 15); Maasz hadn\u2019t. Gregory talked to Maasz about so much, but this was one avenue she did not want to explore. \u201cOne day somebody said something about her kids to her and I saw the pain on her face, and I thought, I can\u2019t put her through no more pain,\u201d Gregory says. So they talked about outreach work, life\u2019s surprising reverses, Maasz\u2019s dogs, CeeCee and Jack Hammer, her writing ambitions, how she wanted to get off the streets and, a favourite topic, the perception that everybody from Oxford was posh. \u201cSharron used to take the mickey out of the posh side,\u201d Gregory says. \u201cShe\u2019d try to speak posh, and you\u2019re sat there in fits of laughter when she\u2019s imitating them.\u201d How did the students treat them? It depends what state they\u2019re in, Gregory says. \u201cThe students will throw drinks over homeless people and toilet over them when they\u2019re drunk. And they throw bottles. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d Were there times when Maasz was resentful of what had become of her life? \u201cIt depends what personality she was,\u201d Gregory says. \u201cOne day she could be Sharron, another she\u2019d be somebody else. She\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019m not Sharron today.\u2019 When she\u2019s Sharron, she\u2019s happy; when she\u2019s somebody else, you don\u2019t go near her. I would walk up to her and say: \u2018Are you grumpy or are you Mrs Happy today?\u2019 If I got a growl I knew she was Mrs Grumpy; if she was smiling and laughing I knew I\u2019d got Mrs Happy.\u201d She pauses. \u201cShe was an amazing girl, you know. I nearly always got the happy.\u201d Gregory mentions Maasz\u2019s long-term street partner, Pip. Now he can be proper grumpy, she says, but he was always good with Maasz \u2013 even after they split up. Does she know where we can find him? \u201cBy the Tesco, probably. But don\u2019t tell him I told you where he\u2019d be.\u201d She says he will be easy to spot \u2013 he\u2019s adopted Maasz\u2019s two dogs. Sharron with her dogs, Ceecee and Jack Hammer. Her street partner, Pip, has adopted them both We head off into town, where the poverty is every bit as conspicuous as the wealth \u2013 so many imposing doorways hosting homeless people. We don\u2019t need to show pictures of Maasz. Everybody knows her, the dogs, Pip and the tragedy. And nobody can make any sense of it. It is 2 September, the second day of the annual St Giles\u2019 Fair, which dates back to the 17th century and became a celebrated children\u2019s fair in Victorian times. And there really does feel something Dickensian about it today \u2013 the bustle of crowded streets, the whirr of mechanical rides, the caramelised whiff of toffee apples, and, wherever you look, homeless people taking shelter or trying to make a few quid. There is no sign of CeeCee, Jack Hammer or Pip. Outside Tesco, Andy tells us he\u2019s not seen Pip for a couple of hours. By his side is a bag of spice. He insists he doesn\u2019t touch the synthetic cannibanoid. When we offer to put the bag in the bin, he anxiously checks it for dregs. \u201cI knew Sharron when she was an outreach worker,\u201d he says. Why did she end up living on the streets? \u201cShe lost her kids and a few bad things happened to her. She had a very shit relationship.\u201d He goes into the unsavoury details. Andy says he, Maasz and Pip have known each other for years. \u201cWe were hanging out together, we slept out together. We\u2019d sleep here \u2013 anywhere with cover.\u201d How did they pass the days? \u201cGetting by, having a drink, getting some food, just trying to get the day over as quickly as possible really.\u201d What did he call her? \u201cI always called her Sharon, and she used to bollock me for it because her name\u2019s Sharron. She was quality. It was horrible when it happened.\u201d How did he find out she had died? \u201cI was drinking outside the night shelter. I was gutted. Proper gutted. We were very shocked. I\u2019d been with her the day before just walking around having a drink, having a laugh. She was fine. I don\u2019t know what happened. It crippled Pip. He\u2019s got the dogs now \u2013 CeeCee and Jack Hammer. D\u2019you know why he\u2019s called Jack Hammer? Sharron\u2019s grandfather was a bare-knuckled fighter and his fighting name was Jack Hammer. He\u2019s a lovely dog, not really a Jack Hammer. Everyone just calls him Jack.\u201d Andy, who is 41, is one of 94 people estimated to be sleeping rough in Oxford, an almost twelvefold rise from eight in 2011. In 2017, only Westminster, Brighton and Hove, Camden, Bedford and Luton had a higher rough sleeping rate per capita in England. Andy lost his flat after serving a prison sentence. \u201cI\u2019ve been homeless ever since,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t offer you no support when you come out of prison, no place to stay; they give you \u00a346 and kick you out of the door.\u201d Oxford is a great place for students and the wealthy, he says, but not for the poor. \u201cEverywhere\u2019s so expensive here. I was born in Oxford, but it\u2019s all student-oriented. You go to any shop and they give 20% discount to a student who\u2019s been in Oxford for about two weeks, then someone who\u2019s lived here all his life gets no discount. We get fuck all. Every new building is about students. That quad they\u2019re building is not for people like me, it\u2019s for students and for the universities to make money from.\u201d He has got a point. Last year, it was estimated that Oxford University and its colleges had consolidated net assets of \u00a39bn. Apart from Cambridge, Oxford requires the highest income of any city outside of London to buy a home. Meanwhile, there is a shocking contrast in life expectancy for the rich and poor. Men living in Northfield Brook, one of the poorest wards in Oxford, die on average at 75 \u2013 15 years younger than their counterparts in North ward, one of Oxford\u2019s most affluent areas. Another homeless person joins us. He is handsome, but his back is bent, he limps and he talks in a drug-induced slur. Simeon says he knows where Pip is, and he is happy to take us. We walk and walk, twisting our way through side streets and alleys, the fair still thrumming in the background. After about 20 minutes, he stops halfway down a hill. \u201cPip is down there. But I\u2019m going to leave you here because I don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019ve brought you here.\u201d He tells us he hopes we will make his efforts worth his while. We give him \u00a35, and head down the hill. There is no sign of Pip, CeeCee or Jack Hammer. We look back up the hill. Nor is there any sign of Simeon. * * * When, 10 days after Maasz died, the Guardian reported the spike in homeless deaths in Oxford, the Labour-led council\u2019s deputy leader and cabinet member for leisure and housing, Linda Smith, wrote a letter to the paper putting it all into context: \u201cIt is right to highlight the lack of drug, alcohol and mental health support that many rough sleepers need to successfully rebuild their lives, and this is a direct consequence of austerity. Since 2010, Oxfordshire county council has had to make more than \u00a3300m in cuts that include many of these services \u2013 and the consequences are all too evident on our streets.\u201d Today, Smith tells us she is not shocked that five people who had experienced street homelessness died in Oxford in such a short period of time (there had been a further death since Maasz died). \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising at all. We know homelessness kills. The statistics bear that out, with people experiencing rough sleeping and homelessness having a life expectancy that is in their 40s. That is really shocking, and we\u2019ve got a lot of rough sleepers and homeless people in Oxford.\u201d She lists the ways in which the council has responded to the homelessness crisis: dozens of extra beds for rough sleepers in a new hub; a \u201csevere-weather emergency protocol\u201d, activated when the temperature is predicted to fall below zero (previously it had to be three nights below zero); a new emergency winter shelter. Sharron and Jack Hammer photographed in 2018 when she spoke to G2 about a crowdfunding scheme for homeless people. Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian But why would a woman such as Maasz have to rely on emergency accommodation? Surely she was an ideal candidate for council housing? \u201cShe was housed,\u201d Smith says tersely. \u201cShe was in women-only supported accommodation. She didn\u2019t die on the streets. She was accommodated by the council because she did have that local connection.\u201d Smith becomes more expansive about a scheme she is obviously proud of. \u201cIt\u2019s a women-only project we are trialling. There are not any male visitors allowed. And that was because a lot of women experiencing homelessness have experienced domestic abuse and maybe sexual abuse. For some women, having that kind of women-only environment is very therapeutic and helps with their recovery.\u201d * * * It is early October, and Maasz\u2019s inquest is being held at the coroner\u2019s court. Often coroners\u2019 courts are empty when the deceased is a homeless person. But today three generations of the family are here (Maasz\u2019s father, her sister Lucy and her daughter Leah, with her fiance), as well as three journalists and a police officer. The coroner, Darren Salter, is plumped up on a red throne and peers down at the family to address them. Despite his elevated station, Salter is a mild-mannered man. He explains that we are here to discover when, where, why and how Maasz died. The account of her life is bald and depressing. We hear nothing about her work, her dreams, her talents, her generosity of spirit. There is no reference to a life spent helping homeless people, or the sadness that she ended up that way herself. There is no mention that Maasz was one of five homeless deaths in Oxford in a matter of months. Maasz is presented to us purely and simply as a junkie \u2013 a woman who lived as an addict, and died as one. It emerges that a man whom Salter describes as Maasz\u2019s boyfriend, Jake Smith, was in her bedroom when she died. He called the ambulance service to tell them Maasz was not breathing, then left the scene. Smith, who had been released from prison and had breached his licence conditions, was later regarded as a potential suspect in the death of Maasz \u2013 the suggestion was that he may have administered the fatal drugs to her. He was interviewed by DS Darren Little in prison. He told the detective that he could not help Maasz when she was dying because he couldn\u2019t stand up after hitting an artery when injecting himself with heroin. Sharron Maasz, left, with her sister Lucy. The coroner asks the family if they have any questions. Maasz\u2019s sister Lucy asks how, if Smith was in such a bad state, he was able to leave before the ambulance arrived. Little says he was also baffled by this. \u201cI raised exactly the same question in the interview, and he couldn\u2019t provide an adequate explanation.\u201d Ultimately, though, Little could find no evidence of third-party involvement in Maasz\u2019s death. Salter rules that there were a number of contributory factors: mixed drug toxicity (heroin, cocaine and methadone were found in her system); a necrotising soft tissue infection; cirrhosis of the liver; and possibly hypothermia. Salter concludes it was a drug-related death. Surprisingly, the coroner fails to mention that Smith should not have been there at all because it was women-only supported accommodation. Salter did not ask why support staff had allowed Smith into the accommodation, nor did he call Homeless Oxfordshire, the charity that runs the property, as a witness. Perhaps Maasz was destined to die in her early 40s. Certainly the pathologist\u2019s report revealed that she was in a terrible physical state, and the toxicology report showed she had relapsed \u2013 and badly. But, yet again, a simple systemic failing may have contributed to the death of a homeless person. Smith should never have been allowed in the women-only accommodation where both he and Maasz binged on class-A drugs, and where Maasz died. We ask Homeless Oxfordshire, which is commissioned by Oxford city council to provide supported accommodation in community settings, why Smith was allowed in the accommodation. It makes no attempt to answer the question, stating: \u201cWhilst we advocate risk reduction and encourage positive choices, our clients may relapse or make a negative decision that has a severe impact on their lives, and in some cases this can lead to death from an overdose or accident whilst under the influence.\u201d When we ask Oxford city council whether there will be an investigation into why Smith was allowed into the accommodation, it tells us that the five residents had agreed \u201cto enforce these rules themselves\u201d. The statement further explains: \u201cAn on-call duty manager is available around the clock, and CCTV footage can be reviewed in the event of any reported issue or incident. As the aim of the project is to involve and support residents towards independent living, there is not a continuous staff presence in the house or real-time monitoring of CCTV. This is consistent with similar dispersed-accommodation projects around the country.\u201d A few days after receiving our response from the council, we receive an answer to a freedom of information request that is subtly different in its emphasis, and appears to suggest that the CCTV in Maasz\u2019s accommodation was not there simply for retrospective investigations after an incident. It states: \u201cAs the aim of the project is to involve and support residents towards independent living, there is not a continuous staff presence in the house. However, an on-call duty manager is available around the clock, and CCTV footage is relayed live to O\u2019Hanlon House [a large hostel in central Oxford run by Homeless Oxfordshire], where it can be viewed in real time. This is consistent with similar dispersed-accommodation projects around the country.\u201d Oxford city council further states that in February, after the deaths of five homeless people, including Maasz, it asked the statutory Oxfordshire Safeguarding Adults Board (OSAB) to consider undertaking an independent investigation. \u201cFollowing an initial investigation, the OSAB concluded that a safeguarding adults review was not required \u2013 for the most part, these individuals were accommodated at the time of their deaths, and those who were rough sleeping either died of natural causes or had pre-existing health conditions not directly associated with their homelessness.\u201d This year, after the death of Kane Walker in Birmingham, the Labour MP Liam Byrne said there should be a safeguarding adults review after every homeless death in the country. The OSAB\u2019s justification for not conducting a safeguarding adults review is questionable at best. If those who died were accommodated at the time of their death, surely there should be an investigation to see if anything went wrong with the support offered at that accommodation. In the case of Maasz, we know there should have been no guests at the house, and that self-regulation (a contradiction in supported accommodation) clearly, and tragically, failed. Maasz had been sleeping on the streets two months earlier. To suggest that her death was not directly associated with her homelessness seems illogical. In mid-November, we receive a statement from a family member saying they believe Maasz was let down. \u201cThey have not set this accommodation up appropriately,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThey had no staff to make sure the condition of no men being in the building was being met. They did not think the whole set-up through properly. If they had done, maybe Jake Smith wouldn\u2019t have been able to enter the building and Sharron would still be alive.\u201d The statement says that the family member met Maasz most days, towards the end of her life, and had never heard her mention the name Jake Smith. Last week it was reported that another homeless person \u2013 the sixth since November 2018 \u2013 had died in Oxford. The man, as yet unnamed, was aged 46. It was the second death this year at Oxford\u2019s homeless shelter Simon House. Back in Oxford town centre, Gregory is sharing more memories of Maasz. If she closes her eyes, what most comes to mind? \u201cHer laugh. It\u2019s one of those funny little giggles. She\u2019d find something funny and it would be infectious. Everyone would start laughing and no one knew why they were laughing.\u201d Gregory says she still cannot believe her friend is dead, because she seemed so determined to turn her life around. \u201cI thought she\u2019d do really well when she went in that women\u2019s project.\u201d Maasz\u2019s death has devastated Gregory, but it has helped put her own achievements into context. A few months ago she started a paid job working for a charity. \u201cIf you\u2019d said to me this time last year that I\u2019d be in a job, I would have just laughed at you,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happened to Sharron has made me even more determined to prove my family wrong as well. I remember my mum\u2019s words: \u2018You\u2019re going to turn to drugs or drink and wreck your life.\u2019 And you know what, I\u2019ve still got my two boys with me. I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still standing.\u201d * * * Ten years ago, the first short film was made about Maasz soon after she became homeless. In her purple wellies and purple quilted jacket, and with a can of Tennent\u2019s lager in her hand, she could have passed for a kids\u2019 TV presenter fallen on hard times. It looked like spring, and she said she had been sleeping rough since the previous November. \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of bad choices and I\u2019ve paid for them all, trust me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was being raped, buggered and beaten by a bastard.\u201d In the film, she is shown living on the canal towpath and gives a remarkable insight into her life. We meet the two dogs; she shows us the community bed she and a couple of homeless friends sleep on hidden in a bush underneath a canal bridge; we join her at the water\u2019s edge where she washes her face. We see what a skilled blagger she is, sat between two cash machines, telling a passing woman how beautiful she looks in her dress, and being paid handsomely for her compliments. \u201cWe could be out for eight hours and make \u00a312, or we could be out for eight hours and every now and again, God bless them, we can make \u00a3100.\u201d And all the time, she points out the perversity of a system that seems determined to punish her whatever her best intentions. She points to a letter from the NHS informing her that she didn\u2019t qualify for a methadone prescription because she was only using a small amount of the heroin substitute and was not injecting heroin. \u201cWhat do they want me to do, go out and start injecting in my groin again?\u201d she asks. \u201cThey could have had me off that [heroin] in six weeks.\u201d The video is unusual because, although it is about Maasz, it also feels as if it has been authored by her. She may never have been in control of the narrative of her life, but she certainly seemed in control of the narrative of this short film. Her message is clear, and delivered with utter conviction. \u201cJust because you\u2019re on the streets you\u2019re not a piece of rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy not take a step back? Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Why not open it up and take a look inside?\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "body": "<p>The first Friday night of the election campaign and about 100 Labour people hungriest for the fight are packing out a bar in east London. They are here to sound off, to network, to plot. But since the night is hosted by young activists in Momentum \u2013 the cheeky ground troops of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s grassroots movement \u2013 they are also here to have a laugh.</p> <p>The bar is small and rough and ready, with bottles of pale ale sold from a hatch and a fog of condensation settling over the windows and newcomers\u2019 glasses. Mince pies and songbooks are handed out, as the crowd is taught some \u201cincredible socialist bangers\u201d for those long, cold nights out on the doorstep.</p> <p>To the tune of an old favourite, they sing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m dreaming of a red Christmas<br>Just like the ones I door-knocked for,<br>Proletarian heaven,<br>Where our comrades strengthen,<br>Our leftist manifesto</p> </blockquote> <p>The repertoire stretches to more contemporary material, such as 2 Unlimited\u2019s No Limit, the lyrics of which now go: \u201cCorbyn, Corbyn, Corbyn, Corbyn, Corbyn/He\u2019s our Corbyn.\u201d The songsheet advises repeating this \u201cuntil the revolution comes\u201d.</p> <p>So they giggle through tune after post-capitalist tune, until a woman clutching a pint glass clambers up on her seat. Hope Worsdale says she only began working at Momentum this week but the 24-year-old knows the importance of this election: \u201cWe face a choice, lads, between socialism and barbarism.\u201d</p> <p>She appeals for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/labours-momentum-raises-250000-in-six-days-to-fight-election\">\u201cLabour legends\u201d</a>: volunteers who will take a week off work or university to campaign unpaid. London-based activists can go to \u201cthe beautiful countryside\u201d, Worsdale says, which conjures a holiday out of trudging icy roads for blister-inducing hours.<br><br>Most of all, she describes an utterly skewed six-week war, with \u201cthe Tories, their millionaires and their press\u201d bearing down on Labour\u2019s \u201cpeople-powered campaign\u201d. </p> <p>Two days after Worsdale\u2019s speech, three of the largest-selling Sunday papers splash across their front pages the shock revelation that, if let into No 10, Corbyn plans a \u00a31tn splurge. It is an unbelievably large number that turns out to be just that: unbelievable.</p> <p>One culprit is the Sunday Times. Culled from a Conservative press release, it groups together a bunch of motions passed at Labour\u2019s autumn conference. As the newspaper\u2019s economics editor <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-turns-on-spending-taps-but-voters-fear-a-new-recession-w7mx560s0\">acknowledges</a>, it \u201ccost[s] policies as if they would apply from day one, when they might take years to implement, or not be implemented at all\u201d. But the front-page headlines are all over the politics shows and radio phone-ins before readers reach this killer caveat.</p> <p>If Boris Johnson has already won the professional air war, who will fight Corbyn\u2019s corner? The men and women clustered in this Dalston bar and beyond, for one; the \u201clads\u201d saluted by Worsdale. Call them the lads\u2019 army: the Labour reservists who produce campaign videos, knock up anti-Johnson memes to share on Facebook and descend on marginals mob-handed.</p> <p>They command neither printing presses nor TV studios, but offer elbow grease and shoe leather. Propping up a wall of this bar is Fred Pritchard, who spent the 2017 election regularly commuting south after work in London to the marginal seat of Croydon Central, canvassing away sunny spring evenings. He devoted up to 15 hours a week, the equivalent of a part-time job for which he did not receive so much as a train fare. His sole reward was helping depose Tory MP Gavin Barwell.</p> <p>Whatever stereotypes you have read about a generation of millennials mesmerised by a \u201cmagic grandpa\u201d, they don\u2019t apply here. Pritchard judges Corbyn as having \u201clots of flaws, but he\u2019s honest and he cares.

So she listens first and canvasses later.</p> <p>One crisp Wednesday morning, I follow her around a council estate in Clay Cross, the town that gave the world Dennis Skinner. Its leftwing heritage speaks even in the street names: Bevan Road, Pankhurst Place, Marx Court. For generations, this was a brick in the \u201cred wall\u201d of seats that Labour politicians took almost for granted. \u201cThey barely bothered to campaign,\u201d says one local Labour member. All the while, the mines and manufacturing shut, to be part-replaced by warehouses and care work.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Sports Direct economy,\u201d says Dave Etherington of Staffordshire University, referring to the giant distribution centre in neighbouring Bolsover. \u201cCrap pay, minimal rights, and barely enough for workers to live on.\u201d</p> <p>Kill a local economy and its civic institutions die soon after. Here, pubs have closed and buses barely run. Clay Cross lost its jobcentre a couple of years ago and the community hospital faces big cuts. The town has a food bank but its last high street bank shut in 2017.</p> <p>North East Derbyshire is one of the staunchest leave seats in the UK, voting 63% in 2016 for Brexit (against 52% nationally). At each door on this estate, voters give almost the same response: they want out of the EU and they can\u2019t abide \u201cweak\u201d Corbyn. Each time, Peace has to tiptoe around those two hurdles before she can even start talking about what Labour offers. That \u201cfool\u201d Johnson cuts no ice, either. Peace worries less about Labour voters crossing to the Tory party than that they\u2019ll vote for no party. \u201cIf they stay at home, we\u2019re done for.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a Sports Direct economy - crap pay, minimal rights, and barely enough for workers to live on.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the unacknowledged truths about Britain today is that it is the people who have had most done to them by politics who want least to do with politics. Until the 1990s, the working classes were staunch voters, and they normally backed Labour.

His successor in 2005 was Natascha Engel: privately-schooled in Kent and a New Labour parachute drop into the Midlands.

Corbyn has not reversed the trend: in 2017, 83% of professionals voted compared with only 52% from working-class jobs.</p> <p>It is not that the working classes have nothing to say about politics; it is that there are no parties to listen to them. For all Corbyn\u2019s rhetoric, this has changed less under his leadership than one might imagine. The first thing he did on becoming leader in 2015 was call for the nationalisation of the railways; by contrast, it took until 2019 to promise to scrap universal credit.</p> <p>The difference in emphasis is striking given how many working-age households are being driven to the wall by the Tories\u2019 cuts to welfare.

      "bodyText": "The first Friday night of the election campaign and about 100 Labour people hungriest for the fight are packing out a bar in east London. They are here to sound off, to network, to plot. But since the night is hosted by young activists in Momentum \u2013 the cheeky ground troops of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s grassroots movement \u2013 they are also here to have a laugh. The bar is small and rough and ready, with bottles of pale ale sold from a hatch and a fog of condensation settling over the windows and newcomers\u2019 glasses. Mince pies and songbooks are handed out, as the crowd is taught some \u201cincredible socialist bangers\u201d for those long, cold nights out on the doorstep. To the tune of an old favourite, they sing: I\u2019m dreaming of a red Christmas Just like the ones I door-knocked for, Proletarian heaven, Where our comrades strengthen, Our leftist manifesto The repertoire stretches to more contemporary material, such as 2 Unlimited\u2019s No Limit, the lyrics of which now go: \u201cCorbyn, Corbyn, Corbyn, Corbyn, Corbyn/He\u2019s our Corbyn.\u201d The songsheet advises repeating this \u201cuntil the revolution comes\u201d. So they giggle through tune after post-capitalist tune, until a woman clutching a pint glass clambers up on her seat. Hope Worsdale says she only began working at Momentum this week but the 24-year-old knows the importance of this election: \u201cWe face a choice, lads, between socialism and barbarism.\u201d She appeals for \u201cLabour legends\u201d: volunteers who will take a week off work or university to campaign unpaid. London-based activists can go to \u201cthe beautiful countryside\u201d, Worsdale says, which conjures a holiday out of trudging icy roads for blister-inducing hours. Most of all, she describes an utterly skewed six-week war, with \u201cthe Tories, their millionaires and their press\u201d bearing down on Labour\u2019s \u201cpeople-powered campaign\u201d. Two days after Worsdale\u2019s speech, three of the largest-selling Sunday papers splash across their front pages the shock revelation that, if let into No 10, Corbyn plans a \u00a31tn splurge. It is an unbelievably large number that turns out to be just that: unbelievable. One culprit is the Sunday Times. Culled from a Conservative press release, it groups together a bunch of motions passed at Labour\u2019s autumn conference. As the newspaper\u2019s economics editor acknowledges, it \u201ccost[s] policies as if they would apply from day one, when they might take years to implement, or not be implemented at all\u201d. But the front-page headlines are all over the politics shows and radio phone-ins before readers reach this killer caveat. If Boris Johnson has already won the professional air war, who will fight Corbyn\u2019s corner? The men and women clustered in this Dalston bar and beyond, for one; the \u201clads\u201d saluted by Worsdale. Call them the lads\u2019 army: the Labour reservists who produce campaign videos, knock up anti-Johnson memes to share on Facebook and descend on marginals mob-handed. They command neither printing presses nor TV studios, but offer elbow grease and shoe leather. Propping up a wall of this bar is Fred Pritchard, who spent the 2017 election regularly commuting south after work in London to the marginal seat of Croydon Central, canvassing away sunny spring evenings. He devoted up to 15 hours a week, the equivalent of a part-time job for which he did not receive so much as a train fare. His sole reward was helping depose Tory MP Gavin Barwell. Whatever stereotypes you have read about a generation of millennials mesmerised by a \u201cmagic grandpa\u201d, they don\u2019t apply here. Pritchard judges Corbyn as having \u201clots of flaws, but he\u2019s honest and he cares. Put him against that charlatan Johnson and is there even a choice?\u201d He is neither unswerving Corbynista nor Labour die-hard, and the same goes for the other 20-somethings I meet here. Their politics go beyond compositing conference motions in some seaside hotel. Pritchard spent last year trying to preserve a community hub in Bristol. Someone else here is organising security guards for an upcoming strike, while another is fighting to save north London\u2019s Latin Village from developers\u2019 bulldozers. They spend as much time combating Labour bigwigs in town halls and union offices as they do battling to get the party into Downing Street. Children of the banking crash, their adult experience of capitalism has been of insecure jobs, low wages, high rent, slummy flatshares and debt that will take decades to repay. Not unreasonably, they hate the British way of doing capitalism. This lot want worker co-ops, a four-day working week and the Green New Deal, radical themes now developed by the Labour leadership. The lads\u2019 army has already provided advisers and candidates for Corbyn\u2019s party; if he becomes prime minister next month many more stand to become key figures of his regime. Which brings us to a defining problem of perhaps the most fateful election in a generation. If leftwing politics in Britain is now largely propelled by the energy and inventiveness of activists outside Labour tradition, how does the party talk to voters in traditional Labour areas? To put a finer point on it, how does Corbyn win in North East Derbyshire? This is the patchwork of mining towns and villages whose politics have long run as red as blood \u2013 until 2017, when it elected its first Tory since the 1930s. Lee Rowley\u2019s aunt used to be Arthur Scargill\u2019s secretary, yet the MP for North East Derbyshire now co-chairs a Conservative thinktank funded, housed and operated by the Institute of Economic Affairs, those old favourites of Margaret Thatcher. Try that on for historical irony. If Corbyn is to stand any chance of forming a government, it is key marginals like this one he needs to regain. Labour\u2019s candidate here is Chris Peace, a former teacher and legal-aid lawyer, who has already spent months tootling around the patch in her red Peugeot hatchback, its boot crammed with campaign literature. \u201cSomething has gone profoundly wrong in the relationship between our voters and us,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison is standing by the embattled minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, despite New South Wales police launching an investigation into the origins of an altered document used to attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. The prime minister told parliament on Tuesday, after a conversation with the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, there was no need to take action against Taylor at this time. Taylor is under pressure from Labor to vacate his portfolio after the NSW police confirmed they were investigating an altered version of a Sydney City Council report that formed the basis for the minister\u2019s political attack on Moore. New South Wales police have contacted the City of Sydney requesting information about downloads of its 2017-18 annual report after Taylor relied on an altered version to lash Moore over the council\u2019s carbon footprint and accuse her of hypocrisy. A NSW police spokesperson said the investigation was in the early stages and detectives from the state crime command\u2019s financial crimes squad had launched Strike Force Garrad to determine if any criminal offences had been committed. The doctored document, which contained grossly inflated travel figures for the 10 city councillors \u2013 it claimed they had spent $15m in a year \u2013 was quoted in a letter sent by Taylor to Moore on 29 September and provided at the same time to the Daily Telegraph, which used the figures in an article published the same day. When Moore complained about the article, the minister\u2019s office sent the journalist a copy of the inaccurate document to back up Taylor\u2019s claims of profligate spending by the council. But these figures did not accord with the figures in the annual report for 2017-18, which was published on the City of Sydney\u2019s website. The council later produced metadata showing the reports had been unaltered since being first uploaded. News of the police investigation broke as MPs in Canberra gathered for question time, and Labor went on the offensive, demanding that Taylor vacate his position until police had completed their inquiries. Labor directed most of their questions to Morrison, who appeared on the back foot at news of the police inquiry, but Taylor also faced a grilling about whether he would supply all relevant documentation to the authorities. Taylor told the chamber he intended to cooperate with the investigation and he repeated his previous statements that neither he, nor \u201cany members of my staff, altered the documents in question\u201d. It is understood the police have not yet spoken to Taylor. Morrison said he intended to have a conversation with the NSW police commissioner to better understand the nature of the investigation. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the former Liberal frontbencher Arthur Sinodinos had stepped aside when there was an investigation into his conduct by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption. \u201cHe stepped aside voluntarily,\u201d the Labor leader told reporters after question time. \u201cThis minister cannot survive this day. The prime minister needs to stand him aside today.\u201d Albanese said the government\u2019s plan was to stonewall during the final parliamentary sitting fortnight for the year, but the police probe made that untenable. He said Labor would continue to pursue Taylor, and the unanswered questions about the document. \u201cIf [the prime minister\u2019s] ministerial standards mean anything at all he should have stood aside this minister well before now.\u201d Asked by reporters why he wouldn\u2019t accept Taylor\u2019s assurances that neither he nor his staff altered the document, Albanese said the minister had said the document with the incorrect travel figures came from the council website, but there was no evidence that was the origins of the document. \u201cHe can\u2019t continue to do what he has done which is to express contempt for the parliament.\u201d Taylor has insisted in parliament that the altered version was downloaded from the City\u2019s website. He has refused to say who downloaded it or to explain how he came by it, although he has now apologised to Moore and acknowledged the figures in his letter were wrong. Following the Guardian\u2019s revelations about the doctored document on 25 October, Labor called for a police investigation. The council confirmed to the Guardian it had been contacted by police and would be cooperating. Earlier on Tuesday the Guardian reported the environment and energy department had blocked access to two emails about Taylor\u2019s use of incorrect figures to attack the City of Sydney\u2019s travel spending, claiming they were exempt from freedom of information because they related to an unspecified \u201congoing process\u201d. In response to Labor\u2019s FOI request, the department has refused access to two emails sent at 8.52am on 25 October \u2013 the day after Guardian Australia revealed the controversy \u2013 and a second email chain at 3.23pm the same day. Labor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the public had the right to know \u201cwhat the process is and what is its purpose\u201d, accusing Taylor of being \u201cloose with the truth\u201d and avoiding scrutiny. Taylor\u2019s office also blocked a second request seeking documents about the incident on \u201cpractical\u201d grounds, citing the fact that \u201cmore than 200 documents have been identified that fall within the scope of the request\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A wild storm in Sydney has brought down dozens of trees and cut power to tens of thousands of homes on Tuesday afternoon. Ausgrid said 47,000 homes were without power as of 2pm, as up to 90km/h winds brought down power lines. The wild weather swept through the city just after noon, with damage most prominent in the north shore suburbs of Gordon and Pymble, where at least one fallen tree was blocking the Pacific Highway. Anna Ogg, who lives in the suburb of Willoughby on Sydney\u2019s lower North Shore, said the storm came in incredibly hard and fast. \u201cThe winds were so strong that I backed away from the window because I thought it might blow in. I thought it had the potential to get very nasty very quickly.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to last more than 10 minutes, but it was ferocious,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are big trees down across main roads and also electricity wires down. There\u2019s debris across all the streets \u2013 leaves, branches.\u201d \u201cWhen it first happened there were residents out directing traffic and stopping cars, telling drivers there were power lines down or trees, so they shouldn\u2019t go down there.\u201d Train services were briefly suspended on Sydney\u2019s north shore line between Hornsby and Gordon due to a tree on the tracks. Services between Hornsby and Berowra remain suspended due to urgent power supply repairs, which is also affecting the Central Coast/Newcastle line between Hornsby and Gosford. Sydney Buses said some buses and school services were delayed up to 30 minutes through Gordon, Pymble, Macquarie Park and surrounding north west and northern Sydney suburbs due to downed wires, fallen trees and blacked out traffic lights in various locations. A full list of affected routes is available on the Transport NSW website. Residents told local radio tin roofs were being pulled off houses by the wind. Social media users posted pictures of trees and power lines blocking roads in Davidson and Belrose, as well as further south in Bondi. In the west and south-west, 90km/h gusts were observed at Holsworthy and Horsley Park. Earlier, Sydney residents had woken to a morning of smoky skies and \u201chazardous\u201d air quality conditions. By noon, temperatures hit a maximum of 35C before the storm ripped through.

The company that made watching movies at home so easy you didn\u2019t even have to get up and go to a video store is opening a cinema.</p> <p>Well, \u201copening\u201d maybe isn\u2019t the correct term, so much as \u201cpreventing a closure\u201d. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/11/paris-theatre-longerm-lease-netflix-marriage-story-the-irishman-robert-solow-1202794519/\">Netflix has fixed a new lease for </a><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/11/paris-theatre-longerm-lease-netflix-marriage-story-the-irishman-robert-solow-1202794519/\">the Paris Theater</a> in New York, causing a moment of existential crisis for cinephiles. On the one hand, the streamer can easily be positioned as a wrecking ball bashing its way through film culture. On the other hand, who <em>else</em> has the pockets to keep the lights on at this place?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/22/netflix-most-watched-tv-shows-films-figures\">What Netflix's biggest reveal tells us about what works and what doesn't</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Paris, a jewel case cinema in a rather photogenic part of midtown Manhattan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/07/paris-theatre-new-york-city-closing-rumors\">shut its doors in August</a> after 70 years in business. If you have never been to New York and only know it from the movies, the theater is catty-corner to the Plaza hotel and across from the south-eastern entrance to Central Park. Around the corner is Fifth Avenue, where you will find Tiffany &amp; Co and Bergdorf Goodman.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 71 years, the Paris Theater has an enduring legacy, and remains the destination for a one-of-a kind moviegoing experience,\u201d said Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos. \u201cWe are incredibly proud to preserve this historic New York institution so it can continue to be a cinematic home for film lovers.\u201d</p> <p>The 581-seat theater, the last single screen in the city, has an elegant interior, with blue velvet seats and a purple-hued curtain, as well as a cozy balcony. Its first owner was Path\u00e9 and it originally showed French language films. Marlene Dietrich and the ambassador to France cut the ribbon in 1948 before a screening of La Symphonie Pastorale. The theater was picketed by angry Catholics led by Cardinal Spellman during a 1951 showing of Roberto Rossellini\u2019s The Miracle, in which Anna Magnani plays a pregnant woman convinced she is carrying Christ.</p> <p>In recent years, however, the Paris has made curious programming choices. While one wouldn\u2019t expect to see Avengers there (how gauche!) the arthouse picks were rarely the ones in the movie-lover conversation (it was showing Ron Howard\u2019s easily forgotten documentary Pavarotti when it shuttered). Moreover, it eschewed repertory titles, which was just throwing money away. What tourist wouldn\u2019t want to see Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s in a classy auditorium inches away from the actual location?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1be389bac94d89bd2c4e72346dadedbb9c638787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be389bac94d89bd2c4e72346dadedbb9c638787/0_0_3150_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast and crew of Marriage Story at the New York premiere at The Paris Theater.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast and crew of Marriage Story at the New York premiere at the Paris Theater.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marion Curtis/StarPix for Netflix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Netflix is already utilizing the theater for its showcase release of Noah Baumbach\u2019s Oscar-tipped divorce saga Marriage Story. (Across town, the Belasco, a Broadway house between productions, is screening The Irishman). The announcement of the purchase states that the company intends to use it for special events (no more renting other theaters for premieres) as well as screenings.</p> <p>Undoubtedly this will aid in the company\u2019s recruitment of top shelf directors who yearn for that opening night vibe, especially at the spot where Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s Romeo and Juliet played for an entire year back in the day. Baumbach, at a recent post-screening Q&amp;A at the Paris, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/noah-baumbach-marriage-story-netflix-theatrical-experience-1202188566/\">gushed to Indiewire\u2019s Eric Kohn</a> about the importance of the theatrical experience beyond the obvious special effects-driven titles. \u201cWhat you lose \u2026 is the communal experience of seeing something funny or sad,\u201d he said of only watching films at home.</p> <p>A source familiar with the company\u2019s decision stressed that this wasn\u2019t only for awards season. Netflix had upwards of 30 titles that had theatrical runs this year, even if some were tucked away for short runs at small US chains like iPic. These runs will not cease with the purchase, but it will be interesting to watch the politics of what gets a Paris perch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4c03edcc83bc320c6e1b6a7063247f717445c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4c03edcc83bc320c6e1b6a7063247f717445c33/0_0_3150_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Paris Theater in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Paris Theater in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marion Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the Paris will be the go-to for special events, the source continued, it will remain open to the public on a random Tuesday in March. Additionally, the programming concepts are \u201clooking to get creative\u201d with the entirety of Netflix\u2019s slate, not just narrative feature films. \u201cIt all happened rather quickly, the theater only shut down in August,\u201d the insider said.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s more than a little ironic. The company that made watching movies at home so easy you didn\u2019t even have to get up and go to a video store is opening a cinema. Well, \u201copening\u201d maybe isn\u2019t the correct term, so much as \u201cpreventing a closure\u201d. Netflix has fixed a new lease for the Paris Theater in New York, causing a moment of existential crisis for cinephiles. On the one hand, the streamer can easily be positioned as a wrecking ball bashing its way through film culture. On the other hand, who else has the pockets to keep the lights on at this place? The Paris, a jewel case cinema in a rather photogenic part of midtown Manhattan, shut its doors in August after 70 years in business. If you have never been to New York and only know it from the movies, the theater is catty-corner to the Plaza hotel and across from the south-eastern entrance to Central Park. Around the corner is Fifth Avenue, where you will find Tiffany &amp; Co and Bergdorf Goodman. \u201cAfter 71 years, the Paris Theater has an enduring legacy, and remains the destination for a one-of-a kind moviegoing experience,\u201d said Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos. \u201cWe are incredibly proud to preserve this historic New York institution so it can continue to be a cinematic home for film lovers.\u201d The 581-seat theater, the last single screen in the city, has an elegant interior, with blue velvet seats and a purple-hued curtain, as well as a cozy balcony. Its first owner was Path\u00e9 and it originally showed French language films. Marlene Dietrich and the ambassador to France cut the ribbon in 1948 before a screening of La Symphonie Pastorale. The theater was picketed by angry Catholics led by Cardinal Spellman during a 1951 showing of Roberto Rossellini\u2019s The Miracle, in which Anna Magnani plays a pregnant woman convinced she is carrying Christ. In recent years, however, the Paris has made curious programming choices. While one wouldn\u2019t expect to see Avengers there (how gauche!) the arthouse picks were rarely the ones in the movie-lover conversation (it was showing Ron Howard\u2019s easily forgotten documentary Pavarotti when it shuttered). Moreover, it eschewed repertory titles, which was just throwing money away. What tourist wouldn\u2019t want to see Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s in a classy auditorium inches away from the actual location? Netflix is already utilizing the theater for its showcase release of Noah Baumbach\u2019s Oscar-tipped divorce saga Marriage Story. (Across town, the Belasco, a Broadway house between productions, is screening The Irishman). The announcement of the purchase states that the company intends to use it for special events (no more renting other theaters for premieres) as well as screenings. Undoubtedly this will aid in the company\u2019s recruitment of top shelf directors who yearn for that opening night vibe, especially at the spot where Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s Romeo and Juliet played for an entire year back in the day. Baumbach, at a recent post-screening Q&amp;A at the Paris, gushed to Indiewire\u2019s Eric Kohn about the importance of the theatrical experience beyond the obvious special effects-driven titles. \u201cWhat you lose \u2026 is the communal experience of seeing something funny or sad,\u201d he said of only watching films at home. A source familiar with the company\u2019s decision stressed that this wasn\u2019t only for awards season. Netflix had upwards of 30 titles that had theatrical runs this year, even if some were tucked away for short runs at small US chains like iPic. These runs will not cease with the purchase, but it will be interesting to watch the politics of what gets a Paris perch. While the Paris will be the go-to for special events, the source continued, it will remain open to the public on a random Tuesday in March. Additionally, the programming concepts are \u201clooking to get creative\u201d with the entirety of Netflix\u2019s slate, not just narrative feature films. \u201cIt all happened rather quickly, the theater only shut down in August,\u201d the insider said. There is also nothing new to report about longstanding rumors of Netflix buying The Egyptian in Los Angeles. Also, there are no current plans to alter the interior. The Paris, remember, is blue; Netflix is red! \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d a programmer at a competing New York City arthouse not permitted to make public statements about Netflix told me. \u201cThe Paris Theater is an institution and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s showing movies again, regardless of the owner. It\u2019s a sign that Netflix is serious about film exhibition, and not just when it\u2019s convenient to satisfy a contractual obligation.\u201d Netflix has no shortage of movies that are deserving of theatrical treatment, but time will tell how they round out their calendar. This has been a standout year for them (Dolemite Is My Name and The Two Popes are worthy contenders alongside The Irishman and Marriage Story) but the week-to-week releases can sometimes come up lacking.

The Israel-Jordan peace agreement has survived massacres, poisoning attempts and the rightward drift of Israeli politics, and now may face its greatest test in Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cAre we better off now, 25 years since the deal was signed? I don\u2019t think we are, not economically nor politically,\u201d says Dureid Mahasneh, a former Jordanian official who helped to negotiate key water and transport agreements with the Israeli side. \u201cWe ended hostilities, and that\u2019s progress, but nothing beyond that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would say it is still working,\u201d says Jawad Anani, a former Jordanian deputy prime minister who was part of the negotiating team for the deal. \u201cNeither side has shown any inclination or desire to give it up, despite all the acid tests it has gone through.\u201d</p> <p>The treaty, only the second Arab-Israeli peace deal after the 1979 agreement with Egypt, is the product of a lost era. \u201cIt was a rare alignment of people willing, genuinely, to strike peace,\u201d says Osama al-Sharif, an Amman-based political analyst.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Jordan was under economic pressure, ostracised by its traditional patrons in the Gulf for being seen to go soft on Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. The Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinian Authority had been signed a few months before, raising hopes that a solution to the region\u2019s most intractable conflict could be within reach.</p> <p>And then there was the chemistry between King Hussein, Jordan\u2019s ruler at the time, and the then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. \u201cIt was this charm King Hussein felt for Rabin and vice versa,\u201d says Sharif. \u201cThere was personal chemistry between these two men, and a vision for a new Middle East, a riviera along the Red Sea, extending from [Egypt\u2019s] Sharm el-Sheikh to [Jordan\u2019s] Aqaba through [Israel\u2019s] Eilat.\u201d</p> <p>The high hopes when the deal was signed on 26 October 1994 were dashed in the crackle of gunfire. \u201cJust as the deal was expanding we had the assassination of Rabin, which truncated the whole process,\u201d says Sharif, echoing the popular Jordanian view. \u201cAnd the rise of one man who undid everything, whose name is Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201d</p> <p>The treaty was tested from almost its inception. In 1997, a Jordanian soldier on duty in a part of Baqoura known as the \u201cIsland of Peace\u201d opened fire on a group of Israeli schoolgirls on an excursion to the site, killing seven. It required a personal visit to the victims\u2019 families by Hussein, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C3jUpfCyFA\">kneeled before them in contrition</a>, to keep relations on track.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba8ab56cead060f0e8c758b0cf47afb8d6531708\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba8ab56cead060f0e8c758b0cf47afb8d6531708/0_471_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordanian policewomen in Baquora, Jordan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordanian policewomen in Baquora, Jordan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same year, in a spectacularly bungled operation, a team of Mossad operatives entered Jordan on fake passports and attempted to poison a Hamas leader, Khaled Mashaal. The agents managed to spray Mashaal with a deadly chemical, but were caught trying to flee the scene.

      "bodyText": "This month, without a shot being fired, Israel gave up land to an Arab neighbour. The flag of Jordan was raised above Baqoura and al-Ghamr, two tracts along the kingdom\u2019s border with Israel, recognised as Jordanian land but leased to the Jewish state as part of a landmark 1994 peace deal between the two countries. The bloodless handover of the territories, as well as Jordan\u2019s staunch refusal to renew Israeli leases on them, was a fitting 25th anniversary for a peace treaty that has proved extraordinarily unpopular yet stubbornly durable. The Israel-Jordan peace agreement has survived massacres, poisoning attempts and the rightward drift of Israeli politics, and now may face its greatest test in Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the Middle East. \u201cAre we better off now, 25 years since the deal was signed? I don\u2019t think we are, not economically nor politically,\u201d says Dureid Mahasneh, a former Jordanian official who helped to negotiate key water and transport agreements with the Israeli side. \u201cWe ended hostilities, and that\u2019s progress, but nothing beyond that.\u201d \u201cI would say it is still working,\u201d says Jawad Anani, a former Jordanian deputy prime minister who was part of the negotiating team for the deal. \u201cNeither side has shown any inclination or desire to give it up, despite all the acid tests it has gone through.\u201d The treaty, only the second Arab-Israeli peace deal after the 1979 agreement with Egypt, is the product of a lost era. \u201cIt was a rare alignment of people willing, genuinely, to strike peace,\u201d says Osama al-Sharif, an Amman-based political analyst. In the early 1990s, Jordan was under economic pressure, ostracised by its traditional patrons in the Gulf for being seen to go soft on Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. The Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinian Authority had been signed a few months before, raising hopes that a solution to the region\u2019s most intractable conflict could be within reach. And then there was the chemistry between King Hussein, Jordan\u2019s ruler at the time, and the then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. \u201cIt was this charm King Hussein felt for Rabin and vice versa,\u201d says Sharif. \u201cThere was personal chemistry between these two men, and a vision for a new Middle East, a riviera along the Red Sea, extending from [Egypt\u2019s] Sharm el-Sheikh to [Jordan\u2019s] Aqaba through [Israel\u2019s] Eilat.\u201d The high hopes when the deal was signed on 26 October 1994 were dashed in the crackle of gunfire. \u201cJust as the deal was expanding we had the assassination of Rabin, which truncated the whole process,\u201d says Sharif, echoing the popular Jordanian view. \u201cAnd the rise of one man who undid everything, whose name is Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201d The treaty was tested from almost its inception. In 1997, a Jordanian soldier on duty in a part of Baqoura known as the \u201cIsland of Peace\u201d opened fire on a group of Israeli schoolgirls on an excursion to the site, killing seven. It required a personal visit to the victims\u2019 families by Hussein, who kneeled before them in contrition, to keep relations on track. The same year, in a spectacularly bungled operation, a team of Mossad operatives entered Jordan on fake passports and attempted to poison a Hamas leader, Khaled Mashaal. The agents managed to spray Mashaal with a deadly chemical, but were caught trying to flee the scene. The Hamas leader collapsed into a coma within hours. Informed of the attempted assassination, Hussein warned that if Mashaal died, the deal would expire too. Reluctantly, and under US pressure, the Israeli government dispatched its spy chief to Amman with an antidote to the substance its agents had administered to one of its key nemeses, bringing him back to life. More recently, observers on both sides argue the treaty has been severely strained by the rightwing turn of Israeli politics led by Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister. His government has used a mutual fear of Iran to quietly soften relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who in turn are perceived to have disengaged from the Palestinian issue. But around 70% of Jordan\u2019s population are Palestinian refugees or their descendants. The kingdom\u2019s official position is that they will one day return to a state of their own. The growing occupation of the West Bank, as well as announcements such as Netanyahu\u2019s election-eve pledge to annex swathes of the occupied Jordan valley are treated in Amman as an existential threat. \u201cI see great danger to the peace treaty,\u201d the former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy said at an Israeli research institute in September. \u201cThe Israeli lack of attention and real analysis of this issue, taking Jordan for granted, as a state having no choice but relying on Israel, are the factors severely endangering the treaty\u2019s existence.\u201d Nimrod Goren, the founder and head of Mitvim, an Israeli thinktank that works to promote Arab-Israeli relations, said every time there was tension with the Palestinians, it played out in Jordan-Israel ties. \u201cThat is something the [Israeli] government tries not to acknowledge.

      "bodyText": "Sydney grandmother Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto has won her appeal against a death sentence for drug trafficking in Malaysia and will be freed after nearly five years in jail and 18 months on death row. Her appeal for trafficking more than 1kg of crystal methamphetamine, also known as ice, through Kuala Lumpur airport in December 2014, was heard in Malaysia\u2019s court of final appeal on Tuesday. Chief justice of Malaysia Tengku Maimun Binti Tuan Mat delivered the finding, overturning her conviction and ordering her release. Exposto was led from the court still shackled. Exposto\u2019s long-running case had won global sympathy after judges heard how she was set up through a love scam online. The 55-year-old grandmother from Cabramatta West in Sydney was initially found not guilty in a lower court after it heard how she was set up in an online boyfriend scam by a man who identified himself as \u201cCaptain Daniel Smith\u201d, a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan. They arranged to meet in Shanghai, where he claimed he was to lodge documents for his retirement from the military, but he never turned up. Instead, Exposto was befriended by a stranger. She testified that he had asked her to take a black backpack, which she thought contained only clothes, to Melbourne. During a stopover in Kuala Lumpur customs officers noticed irregular stitching inside the backpack and found packages of ice hidden inside the lining of the bag. She was charged, and while the lower court initially believed she had been an unwitting drug mule, prosecutors appealed and won and she was sentenced to death early last year. Her final appeal against that sentence had been complicated by changes in laws governing executions. There is currently a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in Malaysia as legislation is pending that will remove mandatory death penalties for traffickers and give judges greater discretion in sentencing. Exposto\u2019s lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told the court of final appeal on Tuesday that his client was so naive about drugs that when customs officers told her they\u2019d found ice in the bag she was carrying she said it couldn\u2019t be because \u201cit would have melted\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Meme and image-hosting site Giphy has apologised to Disney after pulling \u2013 and then reinstating \u2013 all gifs of The Mandalorian character nicknamed Baby Yoda from the internet this week. The character from the new Disney+ flagship streaming series and Star Wars spin-off has been evoking the increasingly fervent love of the internet since the show\u2019s US premiere on 12 November. Baby Yoda is not in fact Yoda, the ancient Jedi master that guided Luke Skywalker to the Force in the original Star Wars films, but The Child, an entirely different character, albeit from the same race of bug-eyed, bat-eared beings. Fans have been swamping social media with memes and gifs featuring the character, and the hype quickly became mainstream. Twitter accounts dedicated to Baby Yoda sprung up, pulling tens of thousands of followers within days. \u201cPeople can\u2019t stop sharing Baby Yoda memes (and we don\u2019t want them to),\u201d shrieked a headline on CNN last week. Disney, having kept the character\u2019s existence under wraps until the show launched, then announced it would be rolling out a huge line of \u201cBaby Yoda\u201d merchandise in time for Christmas. But the hype backfired \u2013 albeit briefly \u2013 when the images disappeared from circulation late last week after they were blocked by Giphy, the service used to create them. Disney was initially blamed by many fans for the intervention after Vulture magazine, which often publishes gif collections, reported on the image cull after its own posts on the gifs had been pulled. The gifs have since reappeared \u2013 and the image-sharing site issued a statement apologising for what they called \u201cconfusion\u201d around the images\u2019 copyright status. \u201cLast week, there was some confusion around certain content uploaded to Giphy and we temporarily removed these Gifs while we reviewed the situation,\u201d Giphy said in a statement. \u201cWe apologise to both Disney and Vulture for any inconvenience, and we are happy to report that the Gifs are once again live on Giphy.\u201d Images in gifs are widely understood to fall under the \u201cfair use\u201d exception in US copyright law.",

      "bodyText": "A manga depicting the plight of an Uighur woman who was detained and tortured in China has clocked up millions of views and spawned versions in several languages. The popularity of \u201cWhat has happened to me,\u201d by the Japanese manga artist Tomomi Shimizu, coincides with rising global anger over China\u2019s treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority based in the country\u2019s northwest border region of Xinjiang. This week, the Guardian and other media media organisations revealed that China is holding more than a million people from the Uighur community and other Muslim minorities without trial. The China Cables, a leak of classified documents from within the Communist party, appear to provide the first official confirmation that the camps were designed by Beijing as brainwashing internment centres and not, as Chinese authorities have claimed, vocational education and training centres. Shimizu\u2019s short manga, which has been translated into English, Chinese, Uighur and other languages, tells the story of Mihrigul Tursun, a Uighur woman who was detained three times by the Chinese authorities after returning from Egypt. The account includes Tursun\u2019s time living in Egypt, where she gave birth to triplets, and her accounts of being tortured and detained in China on three separate occasions between 2015 and 2017. Tursun, who last year testified before the US congress about human rights abuses at Xinjiang detention centres, said she had been deprived of sleep in an overcrowded cell that was lit day and night, tied to a chair and repeatedly tortured. She said her eldest son died in mysterious circumstances at a hospital in Urumqi while she was in custody. She lost contact with her husband, whom she believes had returned from Egypt to China to look for her and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. She now lives in the US with her surviving son and daughter. Shimizu\u2019s manga has attracted about 2.5m views and been shared more than 86,000 times since it appeared on Twitter in August, according to the Kyodo news agency. Shimizu first learned about the plight of Muslim minorities in China from members of Japan\u2019s small Uighur community and released her first manga on the subject, \u201cNo one says the country\u2019s name,\u201d in April this year. \u201cDespite (China) being a neighbouring country, it is full of things that are unknown. Telling people about them through manga is my mission,\u201d Shimizu told Kyodo.",

      "bodyText": "A hiker in New Zealand has become the first to be charged with walking on closed tracks in the Waitakere ranges, violating a ban put in place to stop the devastating spread of a fungal disease called kauri dieback. Potential fines of tens of thousands of dollars apply for repeatedly using the tracks, which are closed to the public to let the forest recover from a disease that kills the majority of kauri trees it infects. The Auckland mayor, Phil Goff, said the hiker walked on the closed tracks three times in the past five months and a stern response was needed to deter others from behaviour that threatened the survival of one of the country\u2019s most precious native trees \u2013 sacred to its Indigenous people and prized for its beauty, strength and use in boats, carvings and buildings. Each breach carries a separate maximum penalty of NZ$20,000 (\u00a39,900). Most hiking tracks in the Waitakere ranges have been closed for over a year, with the local M\u0101ori iwi, Te Kawarau \u0101 Maki, also placing a r\u0101hui \u2013 temporary ban \u2013 over the area. \u201cThose individuals who flout the rules with no regard for the damage they cause need to be held to account,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThis prosecution reflects the seriousness of the issue and sends a clear message to anyone breaching closed tracks areas that we will take enforcement action. \u201cThe survival of our most iconic native tree is at risk and the decisions to close the tracks are based on hard evidence about what is necessary to slow and reverse the spread of kauri dieback disease.\u201d Kauri dieback can be spread by as little as a pinhead of soil on the sole of a hiker\u2019s boots or a dog\u2019s paw, according to the ministry of primary industries. There is as no known cure for the disease and the trees are facing \u201cfunctional extinction\u201d, the ministry says, despite a government working group set up in 2018 to tackle its spread. In addition to the latest prosecution, which will head to the courts in January, Auckland council has issued 49 trespass notices in the past six months, and ranger numbers will be increased over the summer months to patrol the closed tracks. In 2018 the conservation minister Eugenie Sage told the Guardian that kauri dieback was \u201cdevastating\u201d for New Zealand\u2019s unique flora and fauna, but said the Department of Conservation (DOC) was confident the risk of the disease spreading by human traffic was \u201cvery low\u201d and wild pigs were in the crosshairs.",

      "body": "<p>A federal judge has landed a damaging blow on Donald Trump in the US president\u2019s ongoing fight with Congress, ruling that the former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry\">the impeachment hearings</a> despite claims that he had \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d as a top presidential adviser.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016e-a4c4-d442-a5ef-fee4e04c0000\">The judgment</a> from Ketanji Brown Jackson, of the US district court in Washington, has potentially far-reaching implications for Trump as he struggles to fend off impeachment. Not only is McGahn an important witness in his own right \u2013 as Trump\u2019s first White House counsel he had broad influence until he left the post in October 2018 \u2013 but the ruling could also affect other key witnesses called before Congress.</p> <p>Those high-value witnesses include John Bolton, the former national security adviser who is reported to have been deeply unhappy about Trump\u2019s posture on Ukraine, Bolton\u2019s deputy, Charles Kupperman, and the current acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. In each of those cases the White House has deployed the same argument \u2013 that the officials were so core to executive functions that they enjoyed immunity in the face of congressional subpoenas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/25/trump-impeachment-republicans-democrats-white-house-senate-trial\">Trump impeachment: Republicans dig in as hopes of bipartisan support dashed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jackson\u2019s ruling has blown a large hole in that legal argument. In terms that left no room for ambiguity, the judge scathingly remarked that the White House had got its separation-of-powers thinking in relation to the respective standing of the president, Congress and judiciary \u201cexactly backwards\u201d.</p> <p>Pointedly, the judge added: \u201cIt is a core tenet of this nation\u2019s founding that the powers of a monarch must be split between the branches of the government to prevent tyranny \u2026 Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.\u201d</p> <p>It was the role of the judiciary to interpret the law and of Congress to conduct investigations of suspected abuses of power by the government, she wrote in the 120-page opinion. The Department of Justice\u2019s claim \u201cto unreviewable absolute testimonal immunity on separation-of-powers grounds \u2026 is baseless, and as such, cannot be sustained.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee and key Democratic figure in the impeachment inquiry, called the ruling a \u201cvery significant victory\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWith today\u2019s ruling, the courts have made it absolutely clear \u2026 that absolute immunity is not a legitimate basis by which to prohibit senior White House officials from testifying before Congress.\u201d</p> <p>The justice department instantly moved to appeal against the decision, rendering an appeal hearing inevitable and opening up the possibility that such a fundamental dispute over where power lies in modern America will end up at the door of the US supreme court. In the short term, though, the immediate question is whether the Democrats in control of the impeachment process in the House of Representatives will be able to use this legal opening to oblige McGahn and other crucial witnesses to testify.</p> <p>McGahn has already spent many hours in front of the special counsel on the Russia inquiry, Robert Mueller. His testimony may be important in determining whether obstruction of justice is included as grounds for impeachment.</p> <p>The House judiciary committee is still investigating whether Trump tried to have Mueller himself sacked, as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/26/trump-says-he-did-not-try-fire-mueller-heres-what-muellers-report-says/\">recorded in the Mueller report</a> citing McGahn.

      "bodyText": "A federal judge has landed a damaging blow on Donald Trump in the US president\u2019s ongoing fight with Congress, ruling that the former White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify in the impeachment hearings despite claims that he had \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d as a top presidential adviser. The judgment from Ketanji Brown Jackson, of the US district court in Washington, has potentially far-reaching implications for Trump as he struggles to fend off impeachment. Not only is McGahn an important witness in his own right \u2013 as Trump\u2019s first White House counsel he had broad influence until he left the post in October 2018 \u2013 but the ruling could also affect other key witnesses called before Congress. Those high-value witnesses include John Bolton, the former national security adviser who is reported to have been deeply unhappy about Trump\u2019s posture on Ukraine, Bolton\u2019s deputy, Charles Kupperman, and the current acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. In each of those cases the White House has deployed the same argument \u2013 that the officials were so core to executive functions that they enjoyed immunity in the face of congressional subpoenas. Jackson\u2019s ruling has blown a large hole in that legal argument. In terms that left no room for ambiguity, the judge scathingly remarked that the White House had got its separation-of-powers thinking in relation to the respective standing of the president, Congress and judiciary \u201cexactly backwards\u201d. Pointedly, the judge added: \u201cIt is a core tenet of this nation\u2019s founding that the powers of a monarch must be split between the branches of the government to prevent tyranny \u2026 Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.\u201d It was the role of the judiciary to interpret the law and of Congress to conduct investigations of suspected abuses of power by the government, she wrote in the 120-page opinion. The Department of Justice\u2019s claim \u201cto unreviewable absolute testimonal immunity on separation-of-powers grounds \u2026 is baseless, and as such, cannot be sustained.\u201d Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee and key Democratic figure in the impeachment inquiry, called the ruling a \u201cvery significant victory\u201d. \u201cWith today\u2019s ruling, the courts have made it absolutely clear \u2026 that absolute immunity is not a legitimate basis by which to prohibit senior White House officials from testifying before Congress.\u201d The justice department instantly moved to appeal against the decision, rendering an appeal hearing inevitable and opening up the possibility that such a fundamental dispute over where power lies in modern America will end up at the door of the US supreme court. In the short term, though, the immediate question is whether the Democrats in control of the impeachment process in the House of Representatives will be able to use this legal opening to oblige McGahn and other crucial witnesses to testify. McGahn has already spent many hours in front of the special counsel on the Russia inquiry, Robert Mueller. His testimony may be important in determining whether obstruction of justice is included as grounds for impeachment. The House judiciary committee is still investigating whether Trump tried to have Mueller himself sacked, as recorded in the Mueller report citing McGahn. Jerrold Nadler, the committee\u2019s chair, said in a statement following the ruling that McGahn was \u201ca central witness to allegations that President Trump obstructed special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2026 Now that the court has ruled, I expect him to follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the committee.\u201d The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said that multiple court rulings had made the point clearly: \u201cThe president\u2019s insistence that he is above the law is an offense to our constitution and to every American.\u201d Bolton and Mulvaney promise to be critical witnesses should they eventually be forced to testify in the impeachment hearings under Jackson\u2019s ruling. Several officials who have already appeared before Congress have named Bolton as having disapproved of attempts by Trump\u2019s inner circle to coerce or bribe Ukraine by withholding military aid and an Oval Office welcome for the country\u2019s new president unless an investigation was publicly launched into Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Bolton reportedly objected to the desired arrangement in lurid terms, calling it a \u201cdrug deal\u201d. Mulvaney has become more deeply implicated in the Ukraine scandal this week after new secret documents emerged from a confidential White House review. According to the Washington Post they show that Mulvaney had tried after the event to create a justification for why almost $400m of military aid to Ukraine had been suspended that would obscure its role as part of the quid pro quo.",

Its reform is one of the UN\u2019s longest-running and \u2013 to date \u2013 insoluble debates. Alongside the P5, 10 countries representing different regions of the world sit on the council for two-year terms. Non-permanent members do not have the veto power. The extraordinary powers and accompanying influence granted to the P5 are not rights those countries have demonstrated any willingness to relinquish. The veto power on non-procedural matters, exercised most by Russia (and its forerunner, the USSR), not only allows already powerful countries to stymie action by the council, but even deters global security matters from being debated. The P5 members also have a power colloquially known as the \u201cdouble veto\u201d: the power to use a veto to define what is non-procedural in order to veto it. Critics of the unchallengeable status given to the P5 members \u2013 unchanged since 1965 \u2013 say the council\u2019s decision-making is sclerotic, unwieldy and unreflective of the modern world. Advocates for a reformed council argue the current body reflects a post-second world war international landscape, fails to acknowledge the rising power of populous nations such as India and Brazil, and does not have a single African representative. At Monday\u2019s debate at the UN general assembly, Alie Kabba, the representative of Sierra Leone, speaking on behalf of the African group, said Africa should have two permanent seats \u201cwith all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership\u201d.

The committee sued McGahn in August to try to enforce the subpoena.</p> <p>Jackson\u2019s ruling concerns only McGahn\u2019s testimony. But by rejecting Trump\u2019s key legal argument for defying congressional subpoenas it could give other former and current presidential advisers a legal basis for cooperating with the ongoing House impeachment inquiry, legal experts said.</p> <p>The Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry as well as other Democratic-led investigations and has directed current and former officials to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony.</p> <p>The legal battle over McGahn\u2019s testimony was prompted by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and started months before the House opened an impeachment inquiry in September into the Republican president\u2019s actions concerning Ukraine. </p> <p>House Democratic leaders have focused their impeachment inquiry on Ukraine, but have discussed pursuing a broader count of obstruction of Congress among any articles of impeachment - formal charges - brought against Trump. McGahn\u2019s testimony could bolster that part of their inquiry.</p> <p>House passage of any articles of impeachment would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. The Senate is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who have shown little support for removing him.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ddc5c4c8f087b800b62113b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T23:01:34.025Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Federal Judge Rules McGahn Must Testify</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A federal judge has ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before the House Judiciary Committee, a decision that could have major implications for the House\u2019s impeachment probe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsamuelsohn/status/1199099274371444741\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: A federal judge on Monday ordered Don McGahn must testify to Congress about his time as the Trump WH&#39;s top lawyer, a ruling that will add pressure on other Trump officials tied to the impeachment probe.

Parnas says he worked to put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians who could help Nunes dig up dirt on Biden and Democrats in Ukraine, according to Bondy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Appearing on Fox News yesterday, Nunes refused to directly say whether he met with Shokin but blamed the controversy on a \u201ct0tally corrupt\u201d media, echoing rhe president he has so ardently defended. </p> <p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to know all the facts, but I think you can understand, I can\u2019t compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt,\u201d Nunes said.</p> <p>But the chairman of the intelligence committee, <strong>Adam Schiff, </strong>indicated Nunes could be facing an ethics investigation if the accusations have merit. \u201cIf he was on a taxpayer-funded [congressional delegation] \u2014 and I say \u2018if\u2019 \u2014 seeking dirt on a potential Democratic candidate for president, Joe Biden, that will be an ethics matter,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat is not before our committee.\u201d </p> <p>However, given the partisan breakdown of the House ethics committee, an investigation into the matter seems unlikely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BresPolitico/status/1198956641011535872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">/2 Anyone can file a complaint with the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which can investigate Nunes.

      "bodyText": "Coverage continues in Tuesday\u2019s live blog Some key late-breaking court rulings today, to wrap up another interesting day in American politics, where, as one federal judge wrote, \u201cPresidents are not kings.\u201d A federal judge ruled that the former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before Congress, and called the Trump administration\u2019s argument that senior White House aides had absolute immunity from testifying incompatible with America\u2019s constitutional system. The decision has broader implications for other current and former White House officials, including the former national security adviser John Bolton, a key witness in the Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry. Trump\u2019s justice department has pledged to appeal the ruling. The supreme court is temporarily shielding Trump\u2019s tax returns from House Democrats, in order to allow the justices to consider two separate cases about the release of Trump\u2019s financial records at the same time. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, said his panel intended to transmit its report on the impeachment inquiry to the judiciary committee shortly after Thanksgiving. However, Schiff did not rule out the possibility of his committee seeking additional hearings or testimony. Federal prosecutors have reportedly launched a broad investigation into the consulting business of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. Possible charges being considered include obstruction of justice, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the US. David Pecker, who runs the parent company of the National Enquirer, reportedly met with prosecutors to discuss the Trump Organization\u2019s hush-money payments to women who alleged they had affairs with the president. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, confirmed that Eddie Gallagher, the Navy Seal accused of war crimes in Iraq, would retire with his Trident pin, the badge denoting his qualification for the elite force, after receiving a direct order from Trump. Liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was back at work on Monday, a day after being released from a hospital following her admission on Friday with chills and a fever, a spokeswoman said, according to Reuters. Ginsburg\u2019s health is closely watched because another Supreme Court vacancy would give President Donald Trump the opportunity to appoint a third justice to the nine-member court and move it further to the right. The court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices named by Trump. Ginsburg, 86, is an icon for progressive Americas, and has been dubbed \u201cThe Notorious RBG.\u201d She has had various health problems in recent months. On Nov 13, Ginsburg missed a court session after catching a stomach bug. In August, Ginsburg underwent radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. She had two cancerous nodules in her left lung removed last December, and had previously been treated for pancreatic cancer in 2009 and colon cancer in 1999. \u201cPresidents are not kings.\u201d That\u2019s how U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson dismantled the Trump administration\u2019s argument that the president had the power to compel \u201c absolute immunity\u201d to block former senior White House adies from having to testify before Congress. The White House\u2019s legal argument has \u201cstartling and untenable implications\u201d and is incompatible with \u201cour constitutional scheme,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings. This means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control. Rather, in this land of liberty, it is indisputable that current and former employees of the White House work for the People of the United States, and that they take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Moreover, as citizens of the United States, current and former senior-level presidential aides have constitutional rights, including the right to free speech, and they retain these rights even after they have transitioned back into private life.\u201d Read the full ruling here. A federal judge\u2019s ruling today that former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before Congress is likely to have much broader implications\u2014including for former national security adviser John Bolton. The ruling could lead to renewed efforts by House Democrats to compel testimony from other high-ranking officials, including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, a key figure in the Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry As expected, the Trump administration will appeal the federal judge\u2019s ruling that former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify to Congress, and seek to put the ruling on hold in the meantime, Justice Department spokesman Kerri Kupec said, according to the Associated Press. William Burck, an attorney for McGahn, said the former White House counsel will comply with the subpoena, absent a court-imposed stay. For now, the supreme court is shielding President Donald Trump\u2019s tax records from House Democrats, the Associated Press reports. The delay announced late Monday allows the supreme court justices to decide how to handle the House subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns and a similar demand from the Manhattan district attorney at the same time. The justices are giving Trump until Dec. 5 to file a full appeal of a lower court ruling calling for his accountants to turn over the records. The president\u2019s lawyers are certain to comply, and the court\u2019s decision about whether to take up the case is expected by mid-January. The New York case centers on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\u2019s subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns from the same accounting firm, Mazars USA. The justices now should be able to say at the same time whether they will take up the cases and decide them by late June. If they opt to reject Trump\u2019s appeals, the House and Vance would be able to enforce their subpoenas immediately. Mazars has said it would comply with any legal obligation. The House\u2019s quest for the records is not part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, but the court\u2019s action probably means Democrats will not have the records before an expected vote on impeachment by year\u2019s end. \u201cNow that the court has ruled, I expect [McGahn] to follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the Committee,\u201d House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said in a statement. \u201cMcGahn is a central witness to allegations that President Trump obstructed Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation, and the Administration\u2019s claim that officials can claim \u2018absolute immunity\u2019 from Congressional subpoenas has no basis in law, as the court recognized today.\u201d As the New York Times\u2019 Charlie Savage noted earlier, this ruling will almost certainly be appealed by the White House. More from Reuters on today\u2019s key ruling: U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in Washington rejected the Trump administration\u2019s legal claim that current and former senior White House officials cannot be compelled to testify before Congress. Former White House counsel Don McGahn must comply with a congressional subpoena seeking his testimony about President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to impede the now-completed federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, Jackson ruled on Monday. Last May, McGahn defied a subpoena from the Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The committee sued McGahn in August to try to enforce the subpoena. Jackson\u2019s ruling concerns only McGahn\u2019s testimony. But by rejecting Trump\u2019s key legal argument for defying congressional subpoenas it could give other former and current presidential advisers a legal basis for cooperating with the ongoing House impeachment inquiry, legal experts said. The Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry as well as other Democratic-led investigations and has directed current and former officials to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony. The legal battle over McGahn\u2019s testimony was prompted by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and started months before the House opened an impeachment inquiry in September into the Republican president\u2019s actions concerning Ukraine. House Democratic leaders have focused their impeachment inquiry on Ukraine, but have discussed pursuing a broader count of obstruction of Congress among any articles of impeachment - formal charges - brought against Trump. McGahn\u2019s testimony could bolster that part of their inquiry. House passage of any articles of impeachment would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. The Senate is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who have shown little support for removing him. A federal judge has ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before the House Judiciary Committee, a decision that could have major implications for the House\u2019s impeachment probe. The judge also made clear that this ruling applies to other Trump administration staffers who receive a Congressional subpoena. As POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney put it: \u201cAny \u2018current or former\u2019 senior White House aide subpoenaed by a House committee must at least appear for testimony -- even if they claim privilege while testifying.\u201d Does this mean McGahn is likely to testify soon? No, the New York Times\u2019 Charlie Savage reports: \u201cIt is virtually certain that the Justice Department will file an appeal and seek a stay of the judge\u2019s ruling.\u201d In the response to a freedom of information lawsuit by the Center for Public Integrity, an investigative journalism nonprofit, a federal judge has ordered the release of hundreds of pages of communications between Defense Department officials and others over stalled American aid to Ukraine. This is Lois Beckett, taking over our live politics coverage from our California office. The senior Biden presidential campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women\u2019s groups has quit, POLITICO reports. Two allies said she was frustrated over the former vice president\u2019s immigration rhetoric. On Thursday, an immigration activist told Biden at a town hall in South Carolina that he had campaigned for Obama but felt betrayed by the number of deportations carried out by the Obama administration. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cBiden just refuses to talk about the issue in a compassionate way,\u201d a friend of the senior staffer who quit told POLITICO. That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. I\u2019m handing things over to my west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said his panel intended to transmit its report on the impeachment inquiry to the judiciary committee shortly after Thanksgiving. However, Schiff did not rule out the possibility of his committee seeking additional hearings or testimony. Federal prosecutors have reportedly launched a broad investigation into the consulting business of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. Possible charges being considered include obstruction of justice, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the US. David Pecker, who runs the parent company of the National Enquirer, reportedly met with prosecutors to discuss the Trump Organization\u2019s hush-money payments to women who alleged they had affairs with the president. Defense secretary Mark Esper confirmed that Eddie Gallagher, the Navy Seal accused of war crimes in Iraq, would retire with his Trident pin, the badge denoting his qualification for the elite force, after receiving a direct order from Trump. The president held a Rose Garden news conference with Conan, the military dog who played a key role in the al-Baghdadi raid. (And after much confusion on the subject, the White House confirmed Conan is male.) Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who would help oversee a trial if the House approved articles of impeachment against Trump, appeared to dodge a question about whether the president acted approppriately in his communications with Ukraine. But the Kentucky Republican emphasized again that he thought it would be nearly impossible for two-thirds of the Senate to sign off on removing Trump from office. Reporters continue to await a ruling in the case of Don McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, but the presiding judge emphasized her distate for time limits during oral arguments last month, so we could be here a bit longer. A ruling will likely come in the next hour on whether Don McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, must comply with a congressional subpoena or the administration\u2019s guidance not to cooperate with a House investigation. The ruling in the case will almost certainly be appealed regardless, but it could give cover to former administration officials like John B0lton to testify in the impeachment inquiry if they are looking for an opening to do so. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office this afternoon, Trump brushed aside a question about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s repeated claim that he has \u201cinsurance\u201d in case the president turns on him, as the president\u2019s personal lawyer told the Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner earlier this month. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Rudy\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Trump told reporters about Giulaini\u2019s comments. \u201cRudy is the best mayor in the history of New York. In my opinion, the strongest mayor, the best mayor. Rudy is a great crime-fighter, corruption fighter.\u201d The Washington Post has more details on the investigation into Rudy Giuliani\u2019s consulting business, reporting that federal prosecutors are also scrutinizing donations to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action. The Post reports: As part of the probe, federal prosecutors are examining a raft of other potential crimes, including destruction or alteration of documents, aiding and abetting federal crimes, and foreign nationals contributing to U.S. candidates, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. The list of possible crimes under investigation does not mean that those charges will be filed. They do, however, indicate prosecutors are casting a wide net for wrongdoing as they examine the business and legal dealings of the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and two Soviet emigres businessmen who have been assisting Giuliani in the efforts to dig up damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on the president\u2019s behalf. ... A spokeswoman for American First Action said the group reached out last month to federal prosecutors in New York, offering to cooperate voluntarily. She said the group has received no subpoenas and follows the law, declining to comment further. The blog has to correct an earlier correction. The White House pool report initially indicated that Conan, the military dog who participated in the al-Baghdadi raid, was male. Then a White House official confirmed on background that the dog was actually female. However, it now appears the dog is, indeed, male. The confusion around Conan\u2019s sex prompted inevitable jokes about the effectiveness of the Trump White House\u2019s messaging operation. There have been a couple investigative developments beyond the impeachment inquiry this afternoon. CNN is now reporting that David Pecker, who runs the parent company of the National Enquirer, met with prosecutors to discuss the Trump Organization\u2019s hush-money payments to women who alleged they had affairs with the president. CNN reports: The America Media Inc. chairman\u2019s late October meeting with prosecutors from the major economic crimes bureau could provide key details on discussions that took place involving Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who allegedly had an affair with Trump, and agreements that were made with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, the sources said. Cohen is cooperating with the investigation. Pecker is expected to continue talking with prosecutors, sources said. The meeting between Pecker and the local prosecutors shows that investigators are still trying to connect the dots between Trump and the hush money payments. The meeting could result in Pecker being a potential critical witness down the road in any legal action against Trump or the Trump Organization. Prosecutors are investigating whether any state laws were broken, such as whether the Trump Organization falsified any business records relating to the Daniels payment. Federal subpoenas sent to individuals with ties to Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, indicate that prosecutors have launched a broad investigation into the former New York mayor\u2019s consulting business. The Wall Street Journal reports: In recent weeks, prosecutors have sent subpoenas and other requests to potential witnesses seeking records and information related to Mr. Giuliani and two of his associates, according to the people. The investigation, led by the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has already led to campaign-finance charges against the associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The subpoenas offer the clearest indication yet that federal prosecutors are examining Mr. Giuliani\u2019s consulting work. Among the entities named in the subpoenas are Giuliani Partners, a security-consulting firm founded by Mr. Giuliani in 2002 that had multiple foreign clients, including a city in Ukraine. The subpoenas also sought information on a company co-founded by Mr. Parnas that paid Mr. Giuliani for business and legal advice. Mr. Giuliani said in an interview that he hadn\u2019t been contacted by prosecutors and has denied wrongdoing. Subpoenas described to The Wall Street Journal listed more than a half dozen potential charges under consideration: obstruction of justice, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, serving as an agent of a foreign government without registering with the Justice Department, donating funds from foreign nationals, making contributions in the name of another person or allowing someone else to use one\u2019s name to make a contribution, along with mail fraud and wire fraud. Adam Schiff\u2019s \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter indicates that House Democrats are likely to impeach Trump before Christmas if current levels of support hold. This could set the Senate up for a January trial, which would complicate the campaign schedules of the six Democratic senators running for president. An impeacment trial would leave senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet stuck in the Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa caucuses. In his \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter, Adam Schiff warned that attempts to obstruct the inquiry could be incorporated into an article of impeachment against Trump. \u201cWe will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that Committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct,\u201d the House intelligence committee chairman wrote. \u201cSuch obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon,\u201d Schiff warned in the letter. However, Schiff emphasized that he would not allow legal battles connected to the impeachment inquiry to drag out the investigation for months on end. Adam Schiff\u2019s \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter indicated the House intelligence committee chairman is open to holding additional impeachment hearings, echoing comments he made in an interview on Friday. \u201cEven as we draft our report, we are open to the possibility that further evidence will come to light, whether in the form of witnesses who provide testimony or documents that become available,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cIf other witnesses seek to show the same patriotism and courage of their colleagues and deputies and decide to obey their duty to the country over fealty to the President, we are prepared to hear from them.\u201d The California Democrat emphasized that he believed the inquiry had already turned up concrete evidence implicating Trump. \u201cBut the evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct by the President that we have gathered to date is clear and hardly in dispute,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cWhat is left to us now is to decide whether this behavior is compatible with the office of the Presidency, and whether the Constitutional process of impeachment is warranted.\u201d Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has just released a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter saying his panel intends to transmit its report on the impeachment inquiry soon after the Thanksgiving congressional recess. Schiff wrote, \u201cAs required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess.\u201d But the California Democrat noted the committee has not concluded collecting evidence in the inquiry. \u201cThe investigative work continues, and we are learning additional information almost every day,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cBut while we will continue with our investigative work and do not foreclose the possibility of further depositions or hearings, we will not allow the President or others to drag this out for months on end in the courts.\u201d The newest Democratic 2020 election candidate, Michael Bloomberg, plans a campaign stop in Arizona tomorrow, as he kicks off his unconventional campaign for the presidency, Joanna Walters writes. The New York billionaire officially confirmed his candidacy in an event yesterday, unveiling a minute-long campaign video that called him, one of the richest men in the world, a \u201cmiddle-class kid who made good\u201d. While the Democratic front-runners are hopping all over the earliest voting states in the primary race - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - which go to the polls in February to pick the Dem nominee for the White House, Bloomberg is heading west to get on the ballot in Arizona. Super Tuesday is March 3, the Arizona primary is March 17. Today\u2019s White House pool reporter has just passed along a very important update: Conan, the dog who heroically assisted in the al-Baghdadi raid, is female, not male. \u201cA White House official confirmed to your pooler on background that Conan the dog is female,\u201d wrote Yahoo News reporter Hunter Walker. \u201cThe president used male pronouns to identify the dog during the earlier event. Your pooler retracts the earlier comment that Conan was a very good boy. Conan is apparently a very good girl. Good girl Conan.\u201d Update at 3:58 p.m. ET: The White House pool reporter passed along another update to confirm that Conan is, indeed, male. \u201cA White House official informed your pooler that Conan the dog is a male. Multiple officials had previously said Conan was female. Your pooler retracts prior statements calling Conan a \u2018good boy\u2019 and a \u2018good girl.\u2019 Conan is a good dog.\u201d As expected, New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state has set the date of the Granite State\u2019s presidential primary as Feb. 11 of next year, eight days after the Iowa caucuses kick off voting in the Democratic race. Eleven days after the New Hampshire primary, Nevada will hold its caucuses, followed by South Carolina -- wrapping up the four early voting states. There are several animals who will be making an appearance at the White House in the next couple of days. Trump has just wrapped up his Rose Garden news conference with Conan, the military dog involved in the al-Baghdadi raid, and the president will be doing the official White House pardon of the Thanksgiving turkeys tomorrow. The names of the turkeys have been announced -- Bread and Butter -- and Americans will now get the chance to vote on which bird should receive a presidential pardon. (However, both turkeys invetiably end up being spared from the dinner table to live out their lives at Virginia Tech\u2019s Gobblers Rest.) And a horse-drawn carriage delivered the White House Christmas tree to 1600 Pennslyvania Avenue this afternoon, where it was received by first lady Melania Trump. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The defense secretary confirmed Eddie Gallagher, the Navy seal accused of committing war crimes in Iraq, would be allowed to retire with his Trident pin, the badge denoting his qualification for the elite force, because of a direct order from Trump. Trump continues to lash out against the impeachment inquiry as the House intelligence committee works on preparing its report following the recent public hearings. The president unexpectedly appeared before reporters in the Rose Garden with Conan, the dog involved in the raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. As he was leaving the Rose Garden event with Conan the dog, Trump told reporters he still had confidence in his acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Questions have swirled about Mulvaney\u2019s future at the White House after a report emerged that emails show the acting chief of staff trying to create an after-the-fact justification for holding up military aid to Ukraine. The Washington Post reported: A confidential White House review of President Trump\u2019s decision to place a hold on military aid to Ukraine has turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, according to three people familiar with the records. The research by the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, which was triggered by a congressional impeachment inquiry announced in September, includes early August email exchanges between acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget officials seeking to provide an explanation for withholding the funds after the president had already ordered a hold in mid-July on the nearly $400 million in security assistance, according to the three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations. One person briefed on the records examination said White House lawyers are expressing concern that the review has turned up some unflattering exchanges and facts that could at a minimum embarrass the president. It\u2019s unclear whether the Mulvaney discussions or other records pose any legal problems for Trump in the impeachment inquiry, but some fear they could pose political problems if revealed publicly. The vice president was also present for the Rose Garden news conference with Conan and said that Trump had just met with some of the other special forces officers involved in the al-Baghdadi raid. Trump praised Conan as \u201cso brilliant\u201d and \u201cso smart\u201d and warned the reporters present that the dog was trained to attack people if they opened their mouths. The president also predicted Conan would not retire from his duties yet, saying the dog was in his \u201cprime time\u201d to continue serving with the US military. This post has been twice updated to reflect the fact that Conan is indeed male after being mistaken as female. Trump has just appeared in the Rose Garden alongside Conan, the dog who participated in the raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound that resulted in the death of the ISIS leader. The president said he had presented Conan with a plaque for his heroic efforts. This post has been twice updated to reflect the fact that Conan is indeed male after being mistaken as female. According to the White House pool report, the rumor among reporters gathered in the Rose Garden is that Conan, the dog who assisted with the raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound, will be present for Trump\u2019s unexpected event. A White House spokesperson has advised the reporters gathered for Trump\u2019s unpexected appearance in the Rose Garden to \u201cremain as calm as possible\u201d because \u201cthere is going to be an animal\u201d present for the event. It looks like Trump will soon speak to reporters in the Rose Garden, but it\u2019s unclear what he intends to discuss. The White House did not originally include the event on the president\u2019s public schedule. Defense secretary Mark Esper said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by Navy secretary Richard Spencer\u2019s effort to go around Pentagon leadership and offer Trump a secret deal on Eddie Gallagher\u2019s case. Spencer reportedly told Trump he would allow Gallagher to keep his Trident pin if the White House did not interfere with proceedings against the Navy Seal, who was accused of war crimes in Iraq. Esper told reporters that Spencer\u2019s efforts undermined the chain of command and necessitated his firing. \u201cThis proposal was completely contrary to what we agreed to, and contrary to secretary Spencer\u2019s public position. [The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff] and I were completely caught off-guard, and realized that it had undermined everything we had been discussing with the president,\u201d Esper said.\u201d Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary commitee, has defended his recent decision to seek information on Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine. \u201cI love Joe Biden as a person but we are not going to give a pass to what is obviously a conflict of interest,\u201d Graham said in a tweet. The Republican senator also said earlier today in South Carolina, \u201cMy conscious is clear. I love Joe Biden as a person ... but I have a conscious very clear right now, and I have a duty.\u201d In a CNN interview on Friday, Biden criticized Graham and predicted his former Senate colleague would \u201cgo down in a way that I think he\u2019s going to regret his whole life.\u201d \u201cI say Lindsey, I just -- I\u2019m just embarrassed by what you\u2019re doing, for you. I mean, my Lord,\u201d Biden added. \u201cI am disappointed, and quite frankly I\u2019m angered, by the fact -- he knows me; he knows my son; he knows there\u2019s nothing to this.\u201d Trump had said yesterday in a tweet that Eddie Gallagher would be allowed to retire as a Navy Seal, despite his past demotion over allegations of committing war crimes in Iraq. Defense secretary Mark Esper had similarly confirmed Gallagher would be allowed to retire with the honor, but today was the first time he acknowledged hacing received a direct order from Trump to allow the officer to retain the prestigious status. Secretary of defense Mark Esper has just confirmed that Trump ordered him to allow Eddie Gallagher, the Navy Seal officer accused of war crimes in Iraq, to keep his Trident pin, the badge denoting his qualification for the elite force. The controversy over Gallagher led to yesterday\u2019s firing of Navy secretary Richard Spencer, although there were varying accounts about the events leading up to Spencer\u2019s departure. Trump claimed in a tweet that he was disappointed by the Navy\u2019s handling of Gallagher\u2019s case as well as \u201clarge cost overruns,\u201d citing those concerns as the reason why Esper fired him. But reports also emerged that Esper lost confidence in Spencer after discovering the Navy secretary had tried to circumvent the Pentagon by privately telling Trump he would allow Gallagher to keep his Trident pin if the White House did not interfere with proceedings against the officer. Then, in his resignation letter, Spencer took a moral stand and claimed he could not continue to serve knowing that he no longer shares \u201cthe same understanding with the commander-in- chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline.\u201d Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, is dismissing reports that he played a role in trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, as a lawyer for one of Rudy Giulaini\u2019s associates has alleged. CNN reported Friday: The attorney, Joseph A. Bondy, represents Lev Parnas, the recently indicted Soviet-born American who worked with Giuliani to push claims of Democratic corruption in Ukraine. Bondy said that Parnas was told directly by the former Ukrainian official that he met last year in Vienna with Rep. Devin Nunes. \u2018Mr. Parnas learned from former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin that Nunes had met with Shokin in Vienna last December,\u201d said Bondy. Shokin was ousted from his position in 2016 after pressure from Western leaders, including then-vice president Biden, over concerns that Shokin was not pursuing corruption cases. ... Bondy told CNN that his client and Nunes began communicating around the time of the Vienna trip. Parnas says he worked to put Nunes in touch with Ukrainians who could help Nunes dig up dirt on Biden and Democrats in Ukraine, according to Bondy. Appearing on Fox News yesterday, Nunes refused to directly say whether he met with Shokin but blamed the controversy on a \u201ct0tally corrupt\u201d media, echoing rhe president he has so ardently defended. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to know all the facts, but I think you can understand, I can\u2019t compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media are totally corrupt,\u201d Nunes said. But the chairman of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, indicated Nunes could be facing an ethics investigation if the accusations have merit. \u201cIf he was on a taxpayer-funded [congressional delegation] \u2014 and I say \u2018if\u2019 \u2014 seeking dirt on a potential Democratic candidate for president, Joe Biden, that will be an ethics matter,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat is not before our committee.\u201d However, given the partisan breakdown of the House ethics committee, an investigation into the matter seems unlikely. Meanwhile, the turkeys that will be pardoned by the president tomorrow for the annual Thanksgiving event at the White House have arrived in Washington. The actual White House turkey pardon wll take place tomorrow, but the birds will participate in a news conference later today where their names are expected to be announced. Their predecessors from last year\u2019s ceremony were named Peas and Carrots. In impeachment-related news, judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is expected to issue a ruling today on whether Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, Don McGahn, must comply with a congressional subpoena. Jackson\u2019s ruling could have sweeping implications for the Trump administration officials who have refused to comply with congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry, even though an appeal seems highly likely. During a hearing on the case last month, Jackson appeared skeptical of the justice department\u2019s argument that McGahn had immunity from testifying as a former White House official and expressed concern that such a position could upset the separation of powers outlined in the constiution. Nevada representative Dina Titus has become the first sitting member of Congress from an early voting state to issue an endorsement in the Democratic presidential race, announcing her support of Joe Biden this morning. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him up close. I\u2019ve worked with him in Congress. I\u2019ve known him for a long time,\u201d Titus said while announcing her endorsement on CNN. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best qualified to be president of all the good Democratic candidates.\u201d Nevada votes third in the Democratic primary calendar, after Iowa and New Hampshire. In addition to being the first western state of the primary, Nevada is also the first state with a significant non-white population to vote in the Democratic race. Speaking earlier this month during the state\u2019s \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner, Titus reminded presidential candidates not to forget the \u201cmoderate Democrats in suburban districts\u201d who helped flip the House. \u201cWe have just got to make sure that we appeal across the board,\u201d Titus said. \u201cWe are a big-tent party.\u201d The House intelligence committee has reportedly come into possession of recordings from Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani who reportedly helped the president\u2019s personal lawyer pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. ABC News reports: The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. \u2018We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,\u2019 House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman\u2019s comments. ... Sources tell ABC News the tapes were provided as part of that congressional subpoena issued to Parnas, and the former Giuliani ally also provided a number of documents both in English and Ukrainian to the committee in two separate productions, sources told ABC News. However, some of the material sought by congressional investigators is already in possession of federal investigators within the Southern District of New York and thus held up from being turned over, according to sources familiar with the matter. Good morning, live blog readers! Even though it\u2019s a holiday week with Thanksgiving on Thursday, the impeachment inquiry is still advancing and weighing heavily on the mind of Donald Trump, if his Twitter feed is any indication. The House intelligence committee continues to prepare its report on the inquiry, but it\u2019s still possible more public hearings will be held in the future. Chairman Adam Schiff would not rule out the possibility of additional hearings in an interview published Friday. Meanwhile, the president is misstating Americans\u2019 support for impeachment, claiming in a tweet that it is \u201cdropping like a rock\u201d and \u201cdown into the 20\u2019s in some Polls.\u201d In reality, support for impeaching Trump continues to hover just below 50%, but FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling average on the issue has dipped a few points in recent days. That polling, combined with congressional Republicans\u2019 continued opposition to the inquiry despite last week\u2019s damning testimony, has dispelled any hope of a bipartisan consensus emerging as the House moves toward voting on articles of impeachment. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump will have lunch with Mike Pence, meet with the Bulgarian prime minister and sign two bills. Melania Trump will receive the White House Christmas Tree at 1 p.m. ET. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are both campaigning in Iowa with a little over two months left until the state\u2019s caucus. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s peak scientific institution has told an inquiry into the reliability of Great Barrier Reef science that it is \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d over a trend to cherrypick and misrepresent scientific evidence. In a submission to a Senate inquiry, the Australian Academy of Science\u2019s president, Prof John Shine, wrote that selective use of science and misrepresentations were \u201cdangerous\u201d and would lead to \u201cpoor outcomes\u201d. The inquiry, introduced by the Nationals senator Susan McDonald and the Liberal senator James McGrath, is looking at the evidence linking pollution from farm runoff to degradation of the reef. In the months leading up to the inquiry, industry groups including Canegrowers and AgForce had sponsored a speaking tour by the controversial scientist Dr Peter Ridd, who claims that the reef is not being damaged by farm pollution. He also disputes evidence for human-caused climate change, and claims that mass coral bleaching events on the reef are natural. The campaign had aimed to pressure the Queensland government to withdraw proposed legislation, which later passed, that set limits on nutrients, sediments and chemicals running into the reef\u2019s catchments. Australia\u2019s former chief scientist Ian Chubb, who chairs an expert panel of reef scientists, likened the campaign to the tactics used by the tobacco industry when it attacked the science linking its products to cancer. In his submission, Shine wrote: \u201cThe Australian Academy of Science is greatly concerned about a recent tendency to \u2018cherrypick\u2019, dismiss, misrepresent, or obscure scientific evidence or smear individual scientists.\u201d Later in the submission, he added: \u201cA commonly used tactic in opposing or advocating for policy positions is to \u2018cherrypick\u2019 scientific findings rather than consulting and analysing the body of literature systematically. \u201cCherrypicking evidence to support a decision or position is dangerous and leads to poor judgment and outcomes.\u201d The academy said it backed the methods and findings of a 2017 Scientific Consensus Statement on the impacts of poor water quality of the reef. The Australian Environment Foundation \u2013 a group that promotes climate science denial and supported Ridd\u2019s tour \u2013 has also written to the inquiry, repeating Ridd\u2019s claims that science linking farm pollution to the reef was \u201cdemonstrably wrong or unreliable\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Jennifer Marohasy, a former long-serving director at the AEF who now works at the Institute of Public Affairs, claims in a submission that water quality is improving along the reef, and that governments were conspiring to \u201cmaintain the perception of declining water quality\u201d. Last week one reef scientist explained to Guardian Australia that Marohasy had misrepresented her work in an IPA video. The submissions also reveal a split among Queensland\u2019s canegrower industry groups. The Proserpine and Bundaberg districts continued to question the science in their submissions, while groups in Cairns and the Herbert River said farm runoff was damaging to the reef but challenged the need for regulation. The Queensland Farmer\u2019 Federation also said it had \u201cno reason to question that land-based runoff continues to impact water quality in the GBR, and that agricultural activities contribute to this\u201d. As reported by Guardian Australia, the federation\u2019s newly elected president, Allan Dingle, the chairman of Bundaberg Canegrowers, has been an enthusiastic backer of Ridd\u2019s claims. He has characterised the science underpinning the Queensland government\u2019s laws as \u201cunsubstantiated scaremongering\u201d. The farmers\u2019 federation manages more than $4m of taxpayer-funded water quality improvement grants from the federal government\u2019s controversial grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. A submission from the Department of the Environment and Energy highlights how the world heritage committee had expressed concern in 2017 that water quality on the reef was not improving. The committee will review the reef again next year. In August the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority downgraded the reef\u2019s long-term outlook from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cvery poor\u201d for the first time, citing impacts from climate change as a key driver. The Senate inquiry is due to issue its report in October 2020.",

According to the footfall experts Springboard, the number of shoppers on Britain\u2019s high streets is expected to decline during this year\u2019s event, although foreign tourists cashing in on weak sterling are expected to keep the tills ringing in London\u2019s West End.</p> <p>\u201cThe prevalence of discounting from retailers throughout the year, combined with the scepticism surrounding whether Black Friday discounts are better than those being offered generally, means that consumers are paying less attention to this period as a whole,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. She added that the election in December would also have a dampening effect on consumers\u2019 appetite for spending.</p> <p>The Which? price research covered the six months before and after last year\u2019s Black Friday. It found that just four of the 83 products surveyed were cheaper on Black Friday than at other times of the year.</p> <p>Six in 10 were found to be cheaper on at least one day in the six months before Black Friday, while 74% were cheaper after.</p> <p>But Which? found no evidence that retailers were breaking sales laws. Rather, consumers were being confused by offers that might not be as good as they sounded.</p> <p>Natalie Hitchins, the Which? head of home products and services, said: \u201cWe have repeatedly shown that \u2018deals\u2019 touted by retailers on Black Friday are not as good as they seem. Time-limited sales can be a good opportunity to bag a bargain, but don\u2019t fall for the pressure tactics around Black Friday.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigation indicates that this popular shopping event is all hype and there are few genuine discounts.\u201d</p> <p>It advises consumers not to impulse buy or panic that the deal might never be available again.</p> <p>Which? presented its findings to the major retailers. Currys PC World said: \u201cOur customers tell us that they appreciate the increased choice during Black Friday where we have the most deals on at once. When we launched our Black Friday event last year 40% of those products were the lowest price they had ever been.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis said: \u201cOur commitment to being never knowingly undersold means that we continuously monitor and match the prices of our high street competitors throughout the year. As such, we offer our customers the best value on the high street all year round, including during the Black Friday period.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon said: \u201cWe seek to offer our customers great value thanks to low prices all year round as well as a number of fantastic seasonal deals events.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon disputed the findings regarding the pricing of the Echo, but Which? stood by its research.</p> <p>While Black Friday may not be a feast for shoppers, it is for cyber crooks, according to a separate report from an online security company, SonicWall. It found that year-on-year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/11/small-business-ransomware-attacks-precautions-prevent\">ransomware</a> attacks in the UK during the seven-day Black Friday week period had multiplied by 12 times last year.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2019 to add post-publication statements from Amazon and Which?.</p>",

A Samsung soundbar was a Currys PC World Black Friday deal last year at \u00a3299. But the researchers found that the price dropped by a further \u00a349 during the month after Black Friday and was priced at \u00a3279.97 at least 13 times in the following six months. At John Lewis, a De\u2019Longhi coffee machine was offered at \u00a3399 on Black Friday, but it was then discounted to \u00a3368 on at least 35 occasions in the following six months. Meanwhile, Amazon put its Echo (2nd Gen) on offer as 39% cheaper on Black Friday, when it had been cheaper on at least 13 occasions before that date, Which? said. Black Friday, which has turned into a fortnight-long event, peaks this Friday but there are signs of fatigue among both shoppers and retailers. According to the footfall experts Springboard, the number of shoppers on Britain\u2019s high streets is expected to decline during this year\u2019s event, although foreign tourists cashing in on weak sterling are expected to keep the tills ringing in London\u2019s West End. \u201cThe prevalence of discounting from retailers throughout the year, combined with the scepticism surrounding whether Black Friday discounts are better than those being offered generally, means that consumers are paying less attention to this period as a whole,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. She added that the election in December would also have a dampening effect on consumers\u2019 appetite for spending. The Which? price research covered the six months before and after last year\u2019s Black Friday. It found that just four of the 83 products surveyed were cheaper on Black Friday than at other times of the year. Six in 10 were found to be cheaper on at least one day in the six months before Black Friday, while 74% were cheaper after. But Which? found no evidence that retailers were breaking sales laws. Rather, consumers were being confused by offers that might not be as good as they sounded. Natalie Hitchins, the Which? head of home products and services, said: \u201cWe have repeatedly shown that \u2018deals\u2019 touted by retailers on Black Friday are not as good as they seem. Time-limited sales can be a good opportunity to bag a bargain, but don\u2019t fall for the pressure tactics around Black Friday. \u201cOur investigation indicates that this popular shopping event is all hype and there are few genuine discounts.\u201d It advises consumers not to impulse buy or panic that the deal might never be available again. Which? presented its findings to the major retailers. Currys PC World said: \u201cOur customers tell us that they appreciate the increased choice during Black Friday where we have the most deals on at once. When we launched our Black Friday event last year 40% of those products were the lowest price they had ever been.\u201d John Lewis said: \u201cOur commitment to being never knowingly undersold means that we continuously monitor and match the prices of our high street competitors throughout the year. As such, we offer our customers the best value on the high street all year round, including during the Black Friday period.\u201d Amazon said: \u201cWe seek to offer our customers great value thanks to low prices all year round as well as a number of fantastic seasonal deals events.\u201d Amazon disputed the findings regarding the pricing of the Echo, but Which? stood by its research. While Black Friday may not be a feast for shoppers, it is for cyber crooks, according to a separate report from an online security company, SonicWall. It found that year-on-year ransomware attacks in the UK during the seven-day Black Friday week period had multiplied by 12 times last year. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2019 to add post-publication statements from Amazon and Which?.",

In Sally Cookson\u2019s brilliantly inventive production \u2013 first seen at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/10/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-review-west-yorkshire-playhouse\">Leeds Playhouse</a> two years ago \u2013 it becomes about a family of evacuees confronting the perils of wartime.</p> <p>The point is made from the start, with the audience handed green identity labels, the onstage musicians playing a 1940s medley and a model train, bearing the evacuated Pevensie family, snaking its way through the countryside. But the wartime theme doesn\u2019t stop there. The animals in Narnia sport camouflage gear, communicate through code \u2013 \u201cFoxtrot to Badger\u201d \u2013 and Aslan is not just a heroic lion but, in Wil Johnson\u2019s fine performance, an inspirational leader.
